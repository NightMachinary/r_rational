I can agree with your assessment. I think it's something that's easier to say than do, however. Although, even forgetting that, the biggest reason for that occurring, I believe, is the desire for a satisfying narrative. And the concept of a "virtual" reality of all play and no work goes against a number of ingrained cultural beliefs. We are taught that you can't ever get something for nothing, that hard work leads to results, and that being lazy is frowned upon (Sloth is one of the seven deadly sins, that's how ingrained our loathing for laziness goes) So when you have an author who wants to write about a virtual world, they can't have everyone all pleasant and happy. Or, if they do, the outliers of what you were proposing tend to rise up against them, for the sake of the narrative. And the exit door? No source of conflict if people can freely exit your virtual world. I mean, what? You're going to rebel against the tyranny, when people who hate it can just GTFO? Plus if you start to just emulate the real world in the virtual world, it can get rather boring. The only reason the Matrix wasn't boring is because we followed the story of people that "broke" the game. The rebels and the "administrators" of the system. It seems like a fairly boring place for your average schmuck.

TL;DR: Narratively, you need a source of conflict. It's hard to have a story that focuses on a virtual world and tearing it down, if said world has an escape button. Plus our society doesn't like to reward easy things (for obvious reasons)
