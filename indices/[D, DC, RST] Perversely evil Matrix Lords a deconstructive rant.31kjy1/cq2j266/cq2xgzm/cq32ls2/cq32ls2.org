  Of course, you'd think there would still be some arrangement or compromise that could be negotiated with the 5%.

If you made an arrangement then if there was a large scale cultural movement to take advantage of that arrangement or compromise then your resources could be overtaxed. Better to just deny everyone so that no precedents can be set.

The arrangement or compromise could be extra computational resources to entertain people.

It's very context dependent on the matrix. There's no certainty that cooperating is better than defecting when the users have little ability to punish you. If they can actively rebel then sure, compromise may be necessary, but if you have strong control why not just oppress them more?
