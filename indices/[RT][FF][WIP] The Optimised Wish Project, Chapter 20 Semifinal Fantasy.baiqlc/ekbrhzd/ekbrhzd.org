Really sorry for the delay. I hope I can pick myself up, I have the plot decided, what I can't find recently is the actual inspiration to put it in words, or just the energy to do it. I still haven't finished chapter 21, but I wanted to post this just to make it clear that the story's not dead, I'm still here and writing it!
