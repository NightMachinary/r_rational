You know, I'd seen this pop up in the subreddit a bunch of times, but only checked it out yesterday, while browsing through other people's favorite lists on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]

It's really good! I only know a small segment of canon, and it's not this part, but that doesn't seem to matter (having briefly looked up Bulma's canon incarnation, I'm glad you've altered her). Properly measuring and quantifying ki usage to understand how to repeatably reproduce its effects and presumably bring them to the masses? Most excellent.
