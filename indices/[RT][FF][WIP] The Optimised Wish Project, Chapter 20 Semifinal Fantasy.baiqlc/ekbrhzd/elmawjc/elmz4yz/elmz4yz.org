Thanks! I think Bulma is a pretty awesome character in canon too, in theory, she's just got the bad luck to be in the wrong genre of story. So she gets sidelined relative to all the muscle heads.

I think one of my favourite defining moments of her comes at the beginning of the android saga. Trunks brings news of the coming of the androids from the future, and her first reaction is “well, let's go kill their creator before he can make them!”. A utilitarian if I've ever seen one XD. But then of course no one does that because the plot must go on (and Krillin points out that actually having a continuous stream of common enemies might be the only thing that keeps their dysfunctional bunch from blowing up).
