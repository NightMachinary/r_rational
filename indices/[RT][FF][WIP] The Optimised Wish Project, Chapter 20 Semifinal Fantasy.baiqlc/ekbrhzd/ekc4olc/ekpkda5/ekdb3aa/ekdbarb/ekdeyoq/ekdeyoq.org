#+begin_quote
  Inside this small space, hunched under the slanted roof where it was so low standing was impossible, was Mai.
#+end_quote

Grammatically correct but a bit awkward. Maybe something like:

Inside this small space, hunched under the *low* slanted roof where standing was impossible, was Mai.

or

Inside this small space *where standing was impossible*, hunched under the slanted roof, was Mai.

or even just:

Inside this small space, hunched under the *low* slanted roof, was Mai.

I would suggest the second one. I'm only mostly confident this choice and would welcome a second opinion from anyone reading this.
