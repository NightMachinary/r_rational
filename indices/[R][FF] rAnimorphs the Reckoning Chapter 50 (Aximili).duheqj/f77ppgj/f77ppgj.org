Well, this is definitely the longest gap I've ever had between a comment and its vindication.

From the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4hn9hr/ranimorphs_chapter_18_cassie/d2spj0u/][comment]] (May 2016):

  My hypothesis is that the two entities are OUS (order, unity, silence) and CHN (chaos, harmony, noise).

And from a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6jvv6o/ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_29_esplin/djjxcc3/][later comment]] (June 2017):

  If InfinitEsplin is a goal of Order+Unity+Silence (for compatibility with canon, Crayak), what is the goal of Chaos+Harmony+Noise (Ellimist)?

I'm so pumped for the Hork-Bajir world expedition. I want to see how r!Marco deals with r!Arn monstrosities, especially if they can acquire some of them. It's a really interesting setting, and canon had some great moments there. If I remember right, Cassie morphed a whale with wings to slow a terminal fall? The Hork-Bajir Chronicles was great, too.

Sadly, I expect it will be pretty brutal for the Marclones. I doubt Jake will find it "real easy for you to forget that that little blue fucker murdered your best friend nine or ten times".
