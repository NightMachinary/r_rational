  That raises the subquestion of "okay, but then why not individual H2 molecules, then?" and my half-baked BS answer is "that's not how the degradation works; thanks, anthropics" + "seriously, you guys, DO NOT MAKE AN H2 ANTIPARTICLE ON PURPOSE."

The problem with just saying that no one has made H2 particles on purpose is that if these particles can be artificially made at all, it seems likely that some lab somewhere might /accidentally/ made H2 particles as a byproduct when trying to make protein-specific particles.

Here's what I might do with the physics. Per duality, the smaller the real-matter particle, the larger and more unstable the Z-space dual particle, and also the stronger the attractive force. Thus to make the dual for H2 requires exponentially more energy than making one for a whole protein, and this dual particle decays faster, so even if accidentally produced it can't always get to its real-space counterpart before it decays. On the other hand, the dual particles for complex objects are small, plentiful, and easy to make, practically just a quantum soup of vacuum fluctuation, but correspondingly the attractive force is exponentially weaker, and since the form of large objects constantly fluctuates, there's basically no risk of annihilation for complex objects (also, it's very hard to intentionally produce the exact flavor of Z-particle for any given complex object due not to energy issues but to precision issues). Which leaves a happy medium of protein-sized particles, which are large enough so that creating the dual particle requires a manageable (but still large) energy (they need a very large particle accelerator facility to get off the ground, not easy for just anyone to build), and which are small enough that their Z-particle dual can be pinned down precisely, and will have the right level of attractive force to propagate.

I'm not sure if that fits with what you've set up in the text, but yeah, that's what I'd probably do.

  my intended interpretation is that the avatar is in fact an independent, self-aware, sapient consciousness

Actually, that didn't come across to me on my read of this chapter - I thought that it was like a suit that either Crayak or Ellimist could wear at any given time. Will have to look closer on reread.

  I think it might be more fun to leave confirmation out of the text

I agree. Maybe I'll PM you in the future, but for now I like the mystery.
