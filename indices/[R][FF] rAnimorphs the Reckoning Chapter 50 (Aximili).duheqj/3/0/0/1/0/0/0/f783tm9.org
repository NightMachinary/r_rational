It occurs to me that this also can explain lots of other phenomena, like psychic abilities. Suppose that when a structure is large enough, the corresponding Z-dual doesn't pull strongly enough to annihilate the object, but can still influence the object. Suppose that Z-duals for things on the order of neural circuits are low energy enough that they can be produced by biological processes. So a creature evolves the ability to make Z-duals for parts of its brain, and then the brain evolves to leverage dual particles, etc. There is the issue of Z-dual precision. Let's say that bio-processes can't produce exact Z-particle matches to any given structure (that requires too much information), but approximate duals are enough to have a very, very small influence, not usually enough for TK powers, but sufficient to tip a neuron's firing threshold when enough approximate Z-duals are present. Since these particles are in Z space, distance isn't a problem, and other members of your species can be instantly influenced too, leading to psychic communication.

So there are still problems with this model. Thought-speak has limited range, whereas the quantum virus has unlimited range. I suppose the weaker attractive force for larger structures is the limiter? (The Z particles decay before they can accelerate across the galaxy). There is also the question of directed thought-speak. That implies control over the where the Z-particles go, which implies other kinds of interactions going on between Z particles. Which is fine, but that implies that a quantum virus could be shielded against in principle by the same forces which allow directed beams of Z-duals. Which may or may not be an okay implication for the story you want to tell. Or perhaps individual brains are uniquely identified by certain structures, and to communicate, you just make Z-particles tailored to each individual.

There is also the question of how interspecies thought-speak works (and how individuals are identified telepathically in the first place). I guess a telepath's brain can use the Z-duals for smaller, more common neural structures to probe another being's brain structure, and then build Z-duals more precisely tailored to those circuits. Leeran hypersight, for example, is very advanced in this regard, producing so many probing Z-duals that there are whole-brain effects on nearby creatures similar to strong psychedelic drugs.
