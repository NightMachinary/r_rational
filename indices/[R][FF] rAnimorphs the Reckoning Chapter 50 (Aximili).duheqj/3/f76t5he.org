I was literally cheering at my iPad screen by the end of this chapter. Ho. lee. S**t. I thought the return of the Ellimist would be the chapter's high point, but then: OFF-WORLD MISSION. I am so stoked for this. I didn't think this fic would go there, but now we're going to get some classic, bloody, morph-vs-alien Animorphs.

Also, that weird invisible alien device is definitely the remote startup key to an ancient underwater Pemalite ship that holds the secret to unlocking the Chee's block on violence, just saying. >95% confident. Ever since the Chee showed up in this fic, I've been waiting for that shoe to drop, as it's the only means I can think of that yields any sort of fighting chance against Visser Three. I predict that by the end of the fic, the Animorphs will end up with the Pemalite ship as their own personal spaceship. I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but if canon is at all being followed then this seems the likely course of events.

I was going to do a quote-review like Couteau Bleu, but there's just too much here. It's all outstanding. I loved Ax's internal dialogues. I loved the conversation with the Ellimist. I loved the army of Marcos. I wrote down several good quotes from this chapter in my personal notebook. Wasn't sure if I could get into this fic again after so long, but yet again it exceeds expectations.

Thanks for writing this, TK17!
