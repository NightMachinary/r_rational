A contagious tumor /isn't/ typically considered to be its own organism, but they can have a karyotype different from that of their host, and are subject to distinct evolutionary pressures, so it's a difference of magnitude rather than a difference of kind.

Consider the following:

- There are concerns that devil facial tumors may jump to related species like quolls. Canine transmissible tumors probably originated in a wolf or dog, and have /already/ spread to foxes and coyotes. And there are transmissible bivalve tumors which can spread between wildly different species.

- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placozoa][placozoa]] are the simplest of all animals, little more than a scrap of epithelium. One hypothesis for their evolution is that they descended from a more complicated organisms with muscles and neurons.

- The mites infesting your eyelashes are your distant cousins, and share most of your DNA.
