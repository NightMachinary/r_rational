Just binge read the whole thing. Great work. I especially like the reimagining of the Yeerks.

When it was revealed that pools are immortal super organisms, one of my thoughts was, "but what happens if a pool gets cancer?", I figured that the pool could consciously react, ejecting the mass. Unlike humans, a Yeerk Pool can cut off huge chunks of themselves without injury. But then what if that tumor can survive on its own? It's likely that there are entire ecosystems on their homeworld of protist-like nonsapient creatures descended from the sapient Yeerks.

And then when we find out that Esplin is trying to clone itself and subvert existing pools, I realized "Oh, that's what happens when a Yeerk Pool gets cancer. The cancer decides to conquer the galaxy."

  Humans exhibit no known example of a contagious cancer, but canids such as wolves, coyotes and domestic dogs suffer from a sexually transmitted cancer line still displaying its own distinct DNA - the DNA of the first dog to ever develop it. A dog that has been dead for thousands of years. This cancer line is literally a separate living organism genetically distinct from every one of its hosts and has continued to adapt for millenia into new strains, yet we do not officially consider it a species of parasite in its own right for the simple reason that it is still genetically the tissue of a dog. Admittedly, this would be because any instance that grew too distinct from a dog would be more easily identified and wiped out by the immune system of any new host, so its origin as dog tissue essentially "imprisons" it within its Canis taxonomy
