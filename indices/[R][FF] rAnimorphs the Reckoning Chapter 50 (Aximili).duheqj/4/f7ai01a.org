The analogy to the year 410 seems like evidence for the theory that the Game doesn't have a "win condition", and the game is simply to bring the universe in line with your values without breaking the rules.

I think Crayak thinks Visser 3 with Howlers is game over. He already has Leeran's perfect merging of minds, once he has the Howlers' infinite range telepathy, his omnipresence and Unity with all minds, is inevitable. Ellimist is counting on the Howlers and others, and maybe even Crayak Itself to be overconfident. I wonder if the word an alien spoke as it died, to its enemies who do not speak the language, has anything to do with the Howlers' collective memory?

One thing I still don't get, what happens to your mind if you stay in morph too long? The computer that hosts it can't be in the stasis bubble with you, cause then it would be in stasis, so there's no reason to think it would be destroyed when your body dies.
