"We awoke from disconcerting dreams, from visions as crisp and clear as memory-"

As Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed into a gigantic vermin.

I was expecting and mildly hoping this would be a trip to the land of the Iskoort, but was having trouble imagining how they would be relevant if they are as distant as implied in canon, and lo, it was another planet which I am also happy to visit.
