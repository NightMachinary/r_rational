  every time we've ever seen someone wake up from being a morph-made-permanent, they have visions related to Crayak and Ellimist
#+end_quote

In canon, Jake's vision came as the Yeerk inside of his head died; that inspired me to make a similar thing happen when the /morph-control-Yeerk/ dies. Jake's visions have been Crayak-related both times, and Ax's was Ellimist-related. No one's mentioned whether Marco or the others have seen stuff.

  Perd√£o talks exactly like a classic silicon valley rationalist.

I was definitely trying to include some amount of human-knowledge-being-collected-and-distilled.

  Okay, so wait. If it's easier to make Z-particles that correspond to, say, proteins than to people, then surely it's even easier to make ones that correspond to protons. Which would immediately annihilate all matter in the universe, even if one just accidentally fluctuated into existence somewhere. So why does anything exist at all? It's like the matter/antimatter paradox in our universe, but worse.

So, I haven't fully fleshed this out in my head, but one thought was that a bunch of fundamental matter /did/ get poof'd into Z-space, and that's why space is so sparse and empty. Another thought was that the attractive force requires a minimum mass or volume to function, hence molecules and up but not single atoms or smaller. That raises the subquestion of "okay, but then why not individual H2 molecules, then?" and my half-baked BS answer is "that's not how the degradation works; thanks, anthropics" + "seriously, you guys, DO NOT MAKE AN H2 ANTIPARTICLE ON PURPOSE."

I'm glad you still remember Rachel not belonging. I have been worrying that it's been too long or that I was too subtle.

  Crayak (Order) or the Ellimist (Chaos)
#+end_quote

So, my intended interpretation is that the avatar is in fact an independent, self-aware, sapient consciousness, that can have its utility function edited essentially "at will" by either Crayak or the Ellimist, as long as they're acting in accordance with the game rules. They set it up to perform a task, that task is vetted by the arbiter, and then it just goes off and works, but it's truly an /agent./ It might receive telepathic communication from C or E, or it might get re-edited in the moment if things go off the rails, but it isn't straightforwardly a player avatar; neither C nor E is "present" in the room.

That being said, it /does/ sometimes speak as if it literally /is/ C or E, such as it taking credit for "creating the preconditions."

I-as-author have a clear sense of which agenda is being primarily pursued in any given appearance of the avatar, C's or E's, but a) note that they often both have the /same/ agenda, since they're doing the anti-Red-Queen thing (or, like, often I want you to take my bishop with your pawn, and you also want to take my bishop with your pawn, and who knows which one of us is correct about my-bishop-being-taken being better for us), and b) I think it might be more fun to leave confirmation out of the text, and let readers decide whether they believe e.g. Marco's conclusions about any given instance. I guess PM me if you ever want WOG on this?

  the Arbiter is using Visser Three as its gamepiece, to set up the gameboard?
#+end_quote

The Arbiter in its current state is not sapient or agentic, except insofar as it is executing the rules of the game. It /has/ accrued a tremendous amount of physical and processing capital, though---the bulk of the properties of /two/ godlike entities...
