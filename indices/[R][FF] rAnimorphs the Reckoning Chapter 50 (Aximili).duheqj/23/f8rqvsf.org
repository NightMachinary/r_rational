May be a bit late but I thought I'd post here cuz it's more relevant to this chapter: It's notable that this time when the ellimist appeared to the group, they were not in morph. So the mechanism by which it appeared to them this time and materialized the gun is different from the time at the pool, where it was all in their minds. Also notable is that no mention of time stopping this time around either.

My guess is that the smurf Yoda avatar is an actual creature this time created the same way a morph construct is created. The gun as well. Just to clarify where does the mass for morph constructs come from? Z-space? It's not being created from nothing I hope!
