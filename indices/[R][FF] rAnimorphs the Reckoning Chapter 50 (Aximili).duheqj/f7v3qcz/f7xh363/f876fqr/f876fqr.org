Just realized that the Chee giving Rachel the weapons thing has a simpler explanation: Erek only learned who she was at the high school during the mind meld, and when the Censor saw V3's violent thoughts in Erek's head, it immediately erased him and destroyed the memory. The Chee didn't know she was the same person who killed the kid in Elfangor morph.
