Also! What's the deal with this?

  “I will not tell you. But the Chee who put it in your hands---it did indeed die, in order to do so. Knew that it would likely die, and went willingly.”

  “Why?”

  “For the dogs, of course.”

We know from one of Esplin's POV chapters that he's pre-committed to preserving the dog planet untouched forever. So was giving Tobias the Chee device part of what he got in exchange, or has he not actually made a deal with them yet?

Also, what's the deal with Rachel? Is the fact that the Chee don't remember her name, and she's apparently exempt from their anti-violence rules, connected to her being, "not supposed to be there" in the eyes of the gods? It would make sense for a super-intelligence to want to corner the market on brain emulation ASAP, and so far the only conscious machines we've seen are the morph computer and the Chee (and the gods themselves). Maybe they're not actually separate technologies?
