Ok one night of sleep later here's my thoughts on the chapter:

- I think E/C are capable of lying, or a lie uses a move as per the rules of the game.

- How convenient to be discussing a quantum virus and then ending up on the homeworld of the alien species who could put together a really good one?

- Speaking of the Arn, since V3 isn't demanding tribute any longer it sounds like the Kandrona-virus was a success and V3 decided to give himself an upgrade.

- Perdao seems to be a bit bigger than Temrash. I have a funny mental image of someone outgrowing their prosthetic limb and needing a bigger one.

- There is something interesting about the Ellimist dreams. The Ketrans, like the Andalites, use base 7 for their counting, which supports Perdao's hypotheses on the Andalites' development being influenced by E/C.

- Time didn't stop when the avatar came to have a chat with the boys. Jake appeared after a delay on the HB world.

- I think one of the biggest recurring themes in this story is identity, and we're treated to some interesting and differing views on it. We have the Yeerks who embrace a loss of self with the coalesecion, V3 who has a very strict definition of self (and what a contrast it is to the rest of his species!), Andalites who have a coalescion-lite setup with the eib and the Path, and humans who overall feel that each morph clone isn't quite 'self', but close enough to accept morph clone resurrection.
