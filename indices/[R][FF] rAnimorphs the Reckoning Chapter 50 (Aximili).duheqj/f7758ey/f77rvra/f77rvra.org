The Andalites aren't a pacifist race. They believe they are because their government is very fond of revisionist history, and their extreme networking allows them to alter records (and, to some extent, memories) at will.

In reality, they have a long history of wars, both internal and external. Alloran rose to celebrity by saving the andalite race from a war they started with an enemy that almost wiped them out; the importance of that war was then downplayed in andalite culture, and the only traces of it that remain are the intense professionalization of their military-industrial complex.

(this isn't that implausible; eg, France has very little awareness of its military-industrial complex, and of the intensity and brutality of its past colonial wars)
