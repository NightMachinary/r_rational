It almost think it is more surprising that the Andalites would be so peaceful, what with the razor sharp natural weapons they evolved with. Perhaps Andalite history was in fact much more bloody than any modern Andalite realizes. Perhaps a unifying totalitarian government came into power and erased all "oral" history of the time before the totalitarian government and its peace. Besides, we know from canon that Andalites invented computers before books, or at least that Ax found the concept of a book a technological marvel. When your society doesn't write it's history down and all thoughts are open for everyone to see, how would you retain knowledge of an inconvenient history?
