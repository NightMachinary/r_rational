Makes sense! It's far less resource intensive to have a shared avatar than try and run subterfuge. ï¿¼I headcanon that there were minor points spent to be kinda snarky just for the sake of it.

Also, loved the Rick and Morty reference (was it loosely a reference to the Animorphs: The Rickoning recursive fic?)
