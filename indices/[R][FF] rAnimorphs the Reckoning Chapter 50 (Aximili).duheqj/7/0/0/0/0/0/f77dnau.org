There was also a #deepcut HPMOR reference in this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  A situation has arisen, and the Ellimist and Crayak are...constrained, in their ability to intervene. You could intervene, perhaps. If you wished. They are not asking you for a favor, and would not owe you one. It is simply an opportunity to do as you will.
#+end_quote

And a Homestar reference (Captain High Voice Crew).
