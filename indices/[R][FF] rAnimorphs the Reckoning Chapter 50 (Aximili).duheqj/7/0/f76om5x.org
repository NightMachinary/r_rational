Yeah, I couldn't manage to work the Drode into the rationalverse. There's a chance we might see it piloting a ship or something at some point, but with both Crayak and the Ellimist using the same hypercomputer to do all their shenanigans, it seemed like having unique avatars was just BEGGING people to then ape/mimic/fake the avatars (like how most of the time when someone in the Old Testament claims to be a heavenly angel it's just Satan again).

I did try to make this instantiation of the avatar more snarky and Drode-ish, though.
