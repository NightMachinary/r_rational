I don't know. Seerow doesn't seem to have thought that the hypercomputer was a preexisting thing, and if /he/ didn't know, then the message has no reason to anticipate the hypothetical preservation of data, since the data would maybe only be saved if the Ellimist and Crayak had made the hypercomputer that way.

Elfangor believes the computer running your mind is in the same pocket dimension your body-in-stasis is and therefore collapses when you run out of time and Seerow doesn't seem to have left behind any interface to retrieve the mind states.
