I confess I don't fully understand the Marco stuff.

So he convinced a bunch of terminally ill people to morph him and stay past the limit, so there's now many comatose Marcos Levy lying around in hospitals. And he figured out how to get those Marcos to acquire morphs from him while comatose.

(I guess there's some potential awkwardness here in that if all their morphs come from him, no two of them can use the same morph at once.)

And he figured out some way of coordinating with himself before doing this, so they all know how to do it. I figure the details of that probably aren't meant to be obvious and aren't super important. (Except that "abnegation" did feel like I should understand what that meant, and I don't.) But at least part of it is arranging who's going to go after Laocoön to stop him running into the forest?

And they all got woken up when they were brought over here? Or... some of them had already woken up, and only those ones came along? It kind of sounds like some of them went on and made more clones, or am I misreading "you're my granddad" and the bit about "unless I got myself captured"?

"Heimdall" is... a name that Marco-who-was-with-Ax has uniquely, and another one has "Aurora" and another has "Laocoön"? I guess those are the names of the people they morphed from? (Edit: wait, but they have no way of knowing that, right?) But it sounds like "Heimdall" carries some amount of authority, is that just because they all expect Heimdall to have the most information?

The numbers they give are a counter that he's been increasing internally so that he knows how much time it's been since each one was created?

Anyway, I thought this was a great chapter even with how confusing it was. I laughed out loud a few times, especially at the early parts of the avatar conversation, and Marco's speech at the end gave me chills.
