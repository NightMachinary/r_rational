  Marco scoffed, pushed his hands into his pockets, kicked idly at the floor. “But who knows,” he said. “'Course, if it turns out they're not on our side, we're already fucked, so fuck it. Pretty much standard operating procedure at this point, right?”
#+end_quote

You know, it's interesting how /daunting/ everything is in this fic, compared to the original.

In the original, it's like "Yaay! We got robot friends to help us with the invasion!". And the heroes can always solve every problem by throwing 5 zoo animals of some sort at it, now matter how big it is.

Here it's like "Okay, so we've got this plan where we're 90% likely to all die and the survivors will see our species be genocided, but every other option is the same except the genocide will 100% happen, so let's do it".

#+begin_quote
  We glared, and he shrugged. “I'm not going to not say it,” he declared. “And I'm not going to not think it, either. We don't know what the hell kind of mind games a Yeerk can pull off with---what is it, now---two or three years of total, uninterrupted access. [...] Pretty sure if I could push someone's orgasm button whenever I felt like for three years, I could clicker train them into whatever shape I wanted.”
#+end_quote

Yes, Marco, this is the perfect thing to say right now.

Tobias and Helium are perfectly comfortable with you mentioning a yeerk pressing someone's orgasm button.

(this does underline that Ax never really addressed the fact that Temrash manipulated him, and the implications of it; namely, that Helium isn't nearly as safe from as he'd like to be from hostile influence)

#+begin_quote
  So who's to say he didn't get himself cloned into some completely different biology, or upload himself into a robot, or something---something a quantum virus wouldn't be able to hit?”
#+end_quote

I mean, lots of people would like to upload themselves into robots, and yet we're still free from Cyborg Musk.

Just because bunkers exist as a concept doesn't mean nukes are useless.

#+begin_quote
  “---or no, wait, I've got it, it's the first in a series of clues that lead to a time machine, and we've got to solve them before Visser Three gets there first and assimilates the Earth back in cowboy times---”
#+end_quote

Look, Marco, everybody knows the Megamorphs book were dumb, but you don't have to be /mean/ about it.

#+begin_quote
  we could throw that fucking keychain into the ocean and the next thing you know we'd just happen to stumble across a bunch of stranded Andalite warriors who crash-landed last year and have been just waiting for their chance.
#+end_quote

Well... it /would/ be a valuable occasion to teach them the errors of their handicap-intolerant culture, and also experience the complete trippyness of morphing into bees.

#+begin_quote
  But what happens when it turns out that was misdirection too, and everything we've been doing was exactly what the real bad guys wanted us to do?
#+end_quote

No, I don't think The One is canon in this fic.

#+begin_quote
  Like, if things really are so close that all it takes to shift the balance is a bunch of idiot teenagers with a death wish, then what's stopping us from being the reason everything goes to shit?
#+end_quote

He said it! He said the thing!

#+begin_quote
  The creature shrugged again. “It sounded like you had questions,” it said.

  “Are you offering answers?”

  “Some. Never hurts to ask, right?”
#+end_quote

It's funny, we've got a lot of "ROB sits down and explains the plot to the protagonist" moments in fics posted here, lately. The Dungeon Master in WtC, the Wandering Bard in PGtE, the smiley guy in With This Ring, Death of the Endless in that one Luthor comic, and now this.

This chapter in particular feels especially close to the first chat with the Dungeon Master in WtC, with pretty similar beats.

#+begin_quote
  “You're thinking that the Visser is too far ahead. That he has too many advantages, too many resources, too much control. But the same was true of the Visigoths, in the year 410.”
#+end_quote

Yeah, I can totally see Visser Three becoming a semi-permanent problem that nation-planets have to deal with for generations. Like, every so often you hear news about Esplin-controlled terrorists capturing some military base and stealing all its weapons and infrastructure, and maybe blowing up a city or two as part of a larger plan.

#+begin_quote
  “If you were seeking to destroy all life on Earth, you might first create an industrial society of intelligent beings capable of doing the job thoroughly, rather than risking a quicker, more haphazard solution,”
#+end_quote

[Insert Donald Trump joke here].

#+begin_quote
  “We will go,” we said. “Us-singular. Helium.”
#+end_quote

Helium, it just said that the constraints of the game are the decisions you make.

That means you want to make /informed/ decisions, where you spend some time wondering about the consequences of your choice, weighing alternatives against each other, and probably talking it out with your friends. Which is the /opposite/ of what you're going, taking an easily-manipulated decision on impulse with no questions asked.

#+begin_quote
  “Is there a time limit on this conversation?” Marco asked abruptly. “Or, like, a limited number of questions? Are we going to get halfway through some important topic and then you're going to be all, ‘whoops, time's up, guess we have to leave it there'?”

  “There's no limit,” the creature said. “But I get to decide when I'm done, same as you.”

  “Time's up,” said the creature.
#+end_quote

Well someone's having fun.

And is a liar.

#+begin_quote
  “Helium,” said Prince Jake. “His n---don't call him ‘Ax' anymore. Ax---Ax died in the line of duty. This is his---heir. Call him Helium.”
#+end_quote

There are some interesting parallels to transgender issues being drawn here.

#+begin_quote
  Yet another silence--- (This one just about the right length, we noted, for Marco to consider making a joke, and then decide against it.)
#+end_quote

"Whatever floats you boat."

#+begin_quote
  We turned to look at Prince Jake, saw that his lips were drawn tight, his own knuckles white and bloodless.
#+end_quote

I feel sorry for Jake. From his perspective, he's just woken up, it's been a few days since the Ventura pool mission, and people keep giving him shit for reasons beyond his control.

I sure hope that doesn't lead to any negative consequences in future chapters.
