The transgenderism nods are deliberate, and hopefully not TOO cloying, just as the Circling/authentic relating nods were deliberate, back in the Rachel chapter on the mesa, and the stuff about autism and sexuality. I'm having a lot of fun pushing on various progressive issues without (HOPEFULLY) being too much of an asshole or cramming an agenda down anyone's throats. My main thing is to kind of showcase a sort of ... people just taking things in stride? Like, not necessarily understanding, but just being generally teamly and good-natured and therefore not making a huge deal out of it.

Um, excuse me, when Temrash was in Tobias's head, he pushed the COOKIE button, not the orgasm button.

  He said it! He said the thing!

Literally due to repeated requests from multiple readers. Sorry it took me this long to find a place where it made sense; you're welcome.

  From his perspective, he's just woken up, it's been a few days since the Ventura pool mission, and people keep giving him shit for reasons beyond his control.

My heart bleeds for Jake. Moreso than any of the other characters. I think because he would clearly be so comfortable in any other role---like, if anyone else /could/ hold them all together, as a leader, he would be /so happy/ to be first officer or just a random niche player.
