Oh hey, it's overly verbose review time again!

#+begin_quote
  [A MESSAGE BLARING, DEAFENING EVEN OVER THE SOUNDS OF SCREAMS, OF EXPLOSIONS, OF RUSHING WIND. A MESSAGE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THE WORDS THEMSELVES SOUNDING TWISTED AND ALIEN---*YOU WILL ATONE FOR ATROCITY. YOU WILL ATONE FOR ATROCITY. YOU WILL ATONE FOR ATROCITY.*]
#+end_quote

And we start off strong with our Ellimist Chronicles cameo. I think by now we've covered them all except /Visser/, kind of (and I don't think the Los Angeles characters from /Visser/ would fit here, given Visser One never went to Earth).

It seems Toomin's implied backstory remains mostly the same: aliens destroyed his civilization because of their simulated games. It's pretty short and open-ended, which is probably for the best, given how little sense the original backstory made. It's also got a kinda religious-like feeling, like "inquisitors telling you to repent for your sins while butchering your people and wiping out your town".

#+begin_quote
  ‹Why do you hold yourself apart?› we asked, trying not to gasp. ‹Why do you not embrace?›
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he's just /standing there/.

#+begin_quote
  ‹We need to talk first,› said Temrash.
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he says he wants to talk.

#+begin_quote
  There was a feeling of closeness, a slight pressure in the emptiness around us, as if Perdão had leaned in to whisper.
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he starts edging you.

#+begin_quote
  Perdão paused, and it seemed that we could feel its sadness, feel a flicker of connection despite the mental distance it was imposing. ‹And yet, nothing on our world flies, and so we never thought to take to the skies. In one sense, we never even realized that there was a sky, until Seerow came down out of it.›

  ‹What does this have to do with the war?› we asked, unable to keep the impatience from creeping into our voice. It was one thing to stand alone in the silence of the eib, but this--- Perdão was so close. The promise of embrace---of relief---was distracting, intoxicating, maddening. It took all of our willpower to remain even somewhat focused on the conversation, the more so given that we had no roadmap, no sense of where it was going.
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he starts giving you a history lesson.

#+begin_quote
  ‹You are less entwined than you think, child-that-has-named-itself-Helium. Elfangor does not fidget and whine. Has he become lost within Aximili?›

  The words were like a sudden splash of cold water, cutting through the fog of distraction, snapping our attention inward.
#+end_quote

TFW you ask to merge with your boyfriend and he calls you whiny.

#+begin_quote
  Perdão exploded, a wave of sheer emotional power that filled the eib and left us reeling. ‹YES!› it screamed. ‹A response! Jesus everloving FUCK, how can you know about this---how can a whole SPECIES know of something like this and simply---go on?›
#+end_quote

TFW you're waiting to merge with your boyfriend and she shouts that you're not taking his lesson seriously.

#+begin_quote
  ‹Morph,› Perdão whispered. We could feel their presence in the eib, as if they were standing beside us, looking over our shoulder. ‹Those of you who were in morph---demorphed, somehow, there was no body but you demorphed anyway. And those of you who were not in morph were simply brought.›
#+end_quote

TFW you start thinking about your boyfriend's history lesson, and he gets closer to better see your thoughts.

#+begin_quote
  There was a grim silence, and then suddenly Perdão was with us, began to expand and enfold and fuse with us, the empty eib coming alive with light and sound. Doorways opened, and thoughts unfurled, and we looked---
#+end_quote

TFW you've been so distracted you almost forgot about your boyfriend, and /now/ he merges with you.

#+begin_quote
  ‹More than three times what it took the humans. And their gravity is stronger than yours, their moon more distant.›
#+end_quote

Nice canon nod there.

#+begin_quote
  ‹But your species was at peace with itself. The eib had unified you. And against outside enemies---your communications were already secure, since thought-speak cannot be intercepted. And you could solve complex mathematical equations in your head. Your people never felt the need for mechanical computers---never started down the path that ends with machines far more powerful than you.›
#+end_quote

Oh, that reminds me, this raises an interesting question: why were the Andalites so militarized?

If they were at peace for an eternally long time, what did they need a military for? Why did they need a military genius like Alloran to create their entire doctrine, and way of thinking, from scratch? Colonialism? What did they need the colonies for? Did they fight an external invader? If so, why did the yeerks not make contact with that invader?

#+begin_quote
  ‹This is not natural, child-that-has-named-itself-Helium. Something has made your people like this.›
#+end_quote

Eh, I'm not sure I buy the argument here. There are plausible reasons a social, telepathic species would evolve super strong social conforming mechanisms that would keep them from questioning why we're all obeying the king's orders.

#+begin_quote
  ((It was shameful---chilling---almost incomprehensibly distressing. We had known---Essak had told Aximili of the rift, and still we had not made the connection at the critical moment, that Chancellor Lirem's threat was empty, that the rift would protect Earth from Z-space bombardment. We had not yet even begun to process the magnitude of that error---were not sure which was worse, the prospect of mental interference or the possibility that we had committed such an oversight entirely on our own---))
#+end_quote

Oh, yeah, what the hell, Ax-and-Essak? You kind of screwed that one up.

#+begin_quote
  Visser Three had been fomenting discord and chaos within the larger Yeerk command structure---Terra was not clear on all of the details, but Visser One had been deposed and had vanished from custody prior to a court martial
#+end_quote

Yup, that sounds like Visser One.

#+begin_quote
  We had thought that this might be the more difficult argument to win---that the humans would be skeptical of the possibility, and slow to acknowledge the risk. But Marco had seen the logic of it immediately
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, I see nothing suspicious in the fact that Marco seems perfectly amenable to the plausibility of a plan involving the creation of a large number of Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  then obviously one of the very first things you would do would be to arrange for copies of yourself to be sent to safe and faraway locations. Dormant copies, perhaps---triggered by a dead man's switch---or active copies, if you were already confident in your ability to coordinate and cooperate with yourself.
#+end_quote

Yup. Someone read /Methods of Rationality/, read Quirrel's plan and thought "I can do better".

#+begin_quote
  Which led to conclusion two: the Visser could no longer be stopped by conventional means.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't go that far. If it bleeds, you can kill it.

If your Horcruxes cost money to build, and you don't have infinite money, and you've pissed off every major military force out there, then you're still kinda screwed.

#+begin_quote
  Our mouth was dry again. “The most likely outcome is the eradication of all members of the target species. The target genus, in some cases. Conceivably, the entire genetic molecule, and any organism from the same evolutionary lineage.”
#+end_quote

I really like this adaptation of the quantum virus. It makes perfect sense, it's horrifying, it would probably be an incredibly painful way for an entire civilization to die.

I'm imagining the virus takes time to mutate from one particle for the next. So people would see other people disintegrate, or maybe suffer from something close to radiation poisoning as some of their DNA disintegrates, and know that something is targeting the entire species, and all they could do is watch as their civilization slowly crumbles apart until, eventually, all humans have died one way or another. It would be like the Thanos snap, except spread over weeks, months, or even /decades/.

I like it.
