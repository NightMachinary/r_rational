Alright, /sigh/, I'll do /some/ blow-by-blows.

So the first thing that occurred to me when reading this chapter was that every time we've ever seen someone wake up from being a morph-made-permanent, they have visions related to Crayak and Ellimist. This hasn't affected the plot so far, so I've been attributing it to a convenient writing device to provide backstory. But it occurs to me that morphs are constructed from data stored in some cosmic cloud machine, so maybe it's plausible that every time a morph is constructed, a bit of the Ellimist or Crayak's memories get unintentionally mixed in for some reason. This is different than when Marco's mind was messed with, because he was /demorphing/ in that case.

Perdão talks exactly like a classic silicon valley rationalist. It's like his Yeerk coalescion took its collective knowledge from the rationalist community and concentrated it into one intelligent Yeerk. I remember you saying in an old reddit comment that you might do something like this. It's fun to see implemented in the fic!

I really like Ax/Helium's slow realization of the blindspot in their thinking about the Path. Reminds me of HPMOR dialogue.

  Basically, any configuration of matter---any set of atoms, molecules, cells, whatever---has an inverse, a complement, a dual.  There exists a /Z-particle/ for any given particle, a Z-object for any given object, such that the Z-object will generate an attractive force that draws its real-space complement /into/ Z-space.

I love the physics worldbuilding here. This opens up so many possibilities. I wonder if the quantum virus could be made to pay attention to a multiply-realizable pattern instantiated on different substrates. Seems unlikely given this description. But Visser Three might be vulnerable to a more basic molecular attack if he's been using any unique identifying molecule in his experiments (I don't get the sense he's progressed to the point of having robot brains or brains with very different biologies yet).

  “It turns out that the Z-particles don't /just/ straightforwardly break down.  In some cases, there can be mutation first.  If one of them happens to deform such that it matches some other similar particle in real space, the whole reaction starts all over again.  And the smaller the particle, the higher the risk of mutation.”
#+end_quote

Okay, so wait. If it's easier to make Z-particles that correspond to, say, proteins than to people, then surely it's even easier to make ones that correspond to protons. Which would immediately annihilate all matter in the universe, even if one just accidentally fluctuated into existence somewhere. So why does anything exist at all? It's like the matter/antimatter paradox in our universe, but worse.

  “I did a little Googling,” Jake said.  “There's some evidence that dogs were first domesticated from wolves in the Middle East, which sounds like something the Chee might care about.  Calypso Deep---I was thinking about how Tobias found Ax, and the deepest trench in the Mediterranean Sea is right in the middle of that triangle. 
#+end_quote

Okay, so the Middle East, cradle of early civilization, probably has a Pemalite ship in it. Suggesting that the Chee were around a lot of ancient and far-reaching civilizations. We learned a while back that there is something special going on with Rachel and the Chee, and that Rachel "was not supposed to be here." So, wild speculation here, the ancient Chee somehow got a list from the Gods of which people would exist in the future, which is for... I don't know what... but Rachel is not on the list so she is an exception. Or, more plausibly, maybe it's some genetic marker, and lots of people don't have the marker, but the Animorphs were all supposed to, except Rachel was unintended and she happened not to have the genetic marker... I really don't know what to make of the Rachel thing so far, but that's the best I've got. I don't know why the ancient Gods would explicitly program a list of probably future people into the Chee. Actually, maybe Rachel /does/ have the genetic marker where most people don't, and it is part Pemalite DNA or something, so the Chee listen to Rachel (and anyone else who has the marker). Hmmm. ??

  A/ll/ of the pieces are gray.  All belong equally to both players, you no less than I.

So I wonder which being we are talking to now, Crayak (Order) or the Ellimist (Chaos)? Assuming that the avatar truly can't lie, we've got confirmation that this avatar, at least, is the one that messed with Marco. I was going to say that this being is the one that killed Cassie as well, but technically when it says "I created the preconditions for her decision... I arranged those preconditions so that, of her possible choices, the ones that I preferred would seem better to her as well," it doesn't actually confirm that Cassie chose as intended. But it seems likely that this is the same being.

  The obstacle presented by Visser Three's ambition /is/ the game

  why mutually annihilate resources in a Red Queen race, when a cooperative approach yields the same result at a lower cost?
#+end_quote

A curious thing. The conversation with the avatar suggests that the Gods both dislike Visser Three and would like to see him gone (though each in slightly different ways, to build infrastructure for a distant future conflict). Does that mean that the Arbiter is using Visser Three as its gamepiece, to set up the gameboard?

  What role did the Ellimist have in mind for /us?/ 
#+end_quote

Well, it's confirmed that Yeerks and Andalites are specially made for each other, so maybe Helium can leverage this opportunity to spread this idea to the rest of the galaxy somehow. Alternatively, bribe the Arn to slip a special little something into the next batch of Visser-Threes, and bam, quantum virus time.
