I'm hoping it's even better than that. From Chapter 14:

  “We're still gathering, just in case. But there's nothing we can do. Our understanding of psychological trauma is learned---as far as our core programming is concerned, the Yeerk invasion is a good thing. Crime is down by fifty percent and still falling. Pretty soon, there won't be any violence left at all.”

We see a couple of hints that Erek is drifting out of agreement with most of the Chee, (he's uncomfortable lying to Tobias, for one). If he's still alive and gets hold of that Pemalite ship, he could tweak this "core programming" to be more in line with human values. Heck, maybe he could even change their utility function to care about dogs /and/ humans.

Another thing I would definitely have put on my super spaceship before sinking it to the bottom of the Mediterranean: backup copies of all the Chee minds.
