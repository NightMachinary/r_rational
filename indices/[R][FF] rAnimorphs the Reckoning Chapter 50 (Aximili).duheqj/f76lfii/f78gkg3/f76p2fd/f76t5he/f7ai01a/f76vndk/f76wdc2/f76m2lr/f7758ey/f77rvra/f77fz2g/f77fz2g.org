Have 'em encounter the Skrit Na early on. If it's not nailed down, they'll take it, and unarmed ships/unmilitarized flying counts as not being nailed down. Plus, dealing with the likes of the Skrit Na means that you're best off just intimidating them away, which dovetails nicely with Andalite arrogance once it starts to work. If it beats them, why wouldn't it cow everyone else?
