One answer that comes to mind is that the Andalite military wasn't really a military, more of a coast guard and gendarmerie crossed with NASA, designed to deal with (at most) martial (if technologically inferior) alien species. If you're building spacecraft for exploratory purposes and even if you were the most technologically advanced space-faring civilisation in your area of space, arming them with some simple weapons would not be a bad idea. There seem to have been massive space battles starting very early in the war, but nothing says these weren't the Andalite equivalent of modern US Coast Guard cutters battling it out with the Yeerk equivalent of pre-dreadnought battleships. Heck, this could be the reason that the Andalites have lost so much ground - by the time they retooled their civilisation to produce high tech war machines and got their war doctrines up to scratch, the Yeerks have caught up.

Alternatively, since it's explicitly stated in this chapter that all the intelligent species discovered so far seem to have been "designed" to interact in certain ways, maybe the Ellimist/Crayak deliberately engineered a predatory species that the Andalites would encounter early in their spacefaring age, and would have to defeat - leaving a legacy of militarisation and war-organisation on the Andalite culture which would have ramifications for the future Andalite-Yeerk war.
