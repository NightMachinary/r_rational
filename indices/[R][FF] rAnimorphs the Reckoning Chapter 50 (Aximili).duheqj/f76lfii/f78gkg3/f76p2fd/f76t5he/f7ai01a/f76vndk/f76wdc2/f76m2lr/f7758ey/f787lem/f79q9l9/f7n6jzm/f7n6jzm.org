I've been thinking about the quantum virus stuff a bit lately. Specifically this part,

#+begin_quote
  “One time, it stayed stable, and no one knows why. To this day, every time we synthesize more of that particular particle, it gets pulled into Z-space almost immediately.”
#+end_quote

I don't think that particle just magically stayed stable. To me it seems more likely that what happened was that they accidentally made a particle that did correspond to a bit of someone's biology accidentally. The reason the particle still gets pulled into z-space would then be because the aliens' biology is keeping the reservoir full as it were.

If this is the case, then the good news is that they didn't accidentally commit genocide at least. But they did heck with someone's biology. It could be something simple like messing with pigment molecules and making the species albino, or a digestive protein so now there's a universal food intolerance in the species.

But the fact that it was brought up at all makes me think we might see it again. So, what's the scariest possibility I can think of? The andalites might have accidentally given someone a z-space based immune system. This is very speculative on my part of course. It would require that the synthesized particle could pull another particle into z-space with it and then predictably break down into 2 components. One representing the antibody and the other the foreign substance. If it worked, then any disease that infected even one individual would quickly be destroyed everywhere, and if the foreign substance getting cleaned up was one of your skin cells or something, well maybe don't shake their hands ok?
