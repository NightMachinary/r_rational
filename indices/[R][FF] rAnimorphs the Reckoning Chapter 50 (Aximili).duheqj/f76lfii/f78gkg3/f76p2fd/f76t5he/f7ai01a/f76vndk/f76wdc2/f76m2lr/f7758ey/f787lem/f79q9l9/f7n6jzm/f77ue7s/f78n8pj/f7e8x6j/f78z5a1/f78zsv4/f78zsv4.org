It's never been explained outright in the text, so it's reasonable for there to be some confusion/uncertainty.

My general model is this:

The Yeerk tissue that's sitting on top of the brain, acting as a control interface, doesn't have anything /sustaining/ it. It doesn't have anywhere to draw nutrients from, doesn't have a way to metabolize or excrete, doesn't have a functioning immune system like a full Yeerk.

That's fine from a design standpoint, because it never needs to live for more than a few hours.

So when you stay past the time limit, and the pocket dimension collapses, and the Yeerk-flesh stops receiving signals, you just fall into a coma. The Yeerk-flesh is like the driver of a car who's fallen unconscious---the car no longer runs because there's nothing steering, nobody pushing the gas, etc.

But over time, that Yeerk-flesh is going to die. It's going to starve, and the human immune system is going to start chopping away at it, eating it up, cleaning it out. Eventually, enough of it is dead and gone that there's just ... nothing stopping the person from being normal-awake again.

The Chee just speed this process along by straight-up lasering away the interfering dead flesh.
