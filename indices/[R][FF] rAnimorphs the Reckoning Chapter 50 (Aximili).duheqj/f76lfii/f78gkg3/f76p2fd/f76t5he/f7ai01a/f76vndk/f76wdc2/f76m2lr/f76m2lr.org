Marco 10: Me.

So I take it we don't get to see Drode then. So much happened in this chapter. As always. Extremely worth the wait, I'm so excited to see where it goes. Everything changes and the stakes rise each chapter I'm really feeling the desperation and scrambling to win and/or understand the layout of the chessboard

Off world mission! I would love to see someone write a short recursive fic that tells the Megamorphs stories. Or an interactive CYOA r!Alternamorphs book. (I know, I know how much effort that would take.)

Helium!!! What a great name.
