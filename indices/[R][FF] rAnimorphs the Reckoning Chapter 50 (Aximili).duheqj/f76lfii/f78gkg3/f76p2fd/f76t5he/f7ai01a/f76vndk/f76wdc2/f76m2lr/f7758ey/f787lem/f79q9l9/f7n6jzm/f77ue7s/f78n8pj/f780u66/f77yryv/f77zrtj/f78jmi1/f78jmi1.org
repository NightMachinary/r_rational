No no no, you and [[/u/Meriipu]] are both off.

Person A acquires DNA from a skunk and morphs into it.

Person B acquires DNA from /Person A in skunk morph/. In doing this, Person B's morph has all the physiology of the original skunk, /plus/ the layer of receptor Yeerk tissue that was introduced when Person A morphed the skunk.

Now Person B morphs the skunk, and they add /their/ layer of receptor tissue on top of all of that. If Person A isn't in morph, there's no problem; the signal is received by the top layer of tissue, routes through the dormant tissue it picked up from Person A's morph, and executes normally in the skunk brain.

The /problem/ arises when Person A is in skunk morph at the /same time/ as someone else further down the acquiring pipeline - in this case, Person B. A's Z-space body send out the signal, and the Yeerk receptor tissue in their morph back on earth picks it up and operates as normal. Problem is, if A and B are /both/ in morph, then the otherwise dormant layer of tissue in B's morph picks up the signal, too. Now that poor skunk body is receiving signals from two Z-space bodies, and it twitches and convulses.

Like, imagine you plug your VCR into your TV's input jacks. Works great, let's watch Homeward Bound. But then you plug your DVD player into the /VCR's/ input jacks. Well, your DVDs and your VHS's will each still work fine, as long as only one player is sending an image. If both try to send an image at the same time, the picture comes out garbled and nonsensical, because they'd sorta mix together by the time they got to the TV.

If Person C were to show up and acquire the skunk from A, then B and C could morph it side by side and again have no issue, because A's tissue would still just be sitting there under the B/C tissue, dormant, doing nothing. But if A were to morph the skunk while the others were in it, then B and C would both have issues.
