He didn't figure out how to get them to acquire from him; he just transferred the morphing power to them while they were sleeping. When they wake up, they wake up knowing that they're clones (because he planned it all out and then slept on it so they all inherited memories of deciding to do this), and knowing that they have the morphing power, but not having acquired anyone and anything.

So each of them wakes up and is like, "Go time, I guess," and goes out into the world in some different direction, acquiring morphs and weapons and information, attempting to maneuver himself into some useful position in a community or a government or a company or whatever. They're each of them just doing what Marco would do if he were on his own, without the Animorphs as backup and support.

He did some thinking ahead of time about code words and coordination (Heimdall means "I think I know what's going on better than anyone else, so let me talk" in case two or more Marcos meet and don't know who should get the conch; Laoco√∂n is a reference to someone who gave a dire warning and wasn't believed). Most of it just derives from his own internal nerd culture and sense of humor, and it's expandable in the sense that if he comes up with an "obvious" new code word or reference, all of the other Marcos will "get it" immediately, since they share 99.999% of his personality and memories.

The intended interpretation is that, out of thirty-or-so clones, only a dozen had woken up yet, and so the Ellimist/Crayak avatar only sent a dozen on the mission.

None of them were able to make more clones on their own, since there's only one blue box and the core Animorphs still have it. The "you're my grandad" was a joke on how they organize themselves via number. The "main" Marco keeps memorizing the next power-of-two every few days, so Marcos can tell how "old" they are relative to one another based on the largest power-of-two they can remember.
