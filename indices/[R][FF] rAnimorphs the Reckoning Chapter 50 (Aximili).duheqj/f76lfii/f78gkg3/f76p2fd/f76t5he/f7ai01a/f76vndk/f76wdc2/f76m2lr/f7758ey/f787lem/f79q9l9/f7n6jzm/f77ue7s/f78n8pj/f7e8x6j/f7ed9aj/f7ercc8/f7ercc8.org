  Given that I just never thought to try that, it seems reasonable that they didn't, either. I don't know if that would work or not.

It might be pretty dangerous. If whoever you're morphed into also morphs, they probably can't receive signals and also wouldn't be able to control the morph as their unconscious so both bodies would just die. I don't know if there's any risk in accidental morphing, but it's probably worth avoiding the risk anyway if you can acquire the morphing power afterwards.
