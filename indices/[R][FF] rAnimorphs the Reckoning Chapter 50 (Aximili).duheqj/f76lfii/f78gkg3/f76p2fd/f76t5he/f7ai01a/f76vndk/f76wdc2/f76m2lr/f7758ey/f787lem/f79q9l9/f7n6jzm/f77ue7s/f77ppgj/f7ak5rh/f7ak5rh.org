Awesome chapter! Heroes piecing together the villain's plot! Aliens thinking in alien ways! At least three different superintelligences or potential superintelligences! Off-planet adventures! Marco, the best genre savvy character ever times 12!

It is everything I have ever wanted from an r!Animorphs chapter!
