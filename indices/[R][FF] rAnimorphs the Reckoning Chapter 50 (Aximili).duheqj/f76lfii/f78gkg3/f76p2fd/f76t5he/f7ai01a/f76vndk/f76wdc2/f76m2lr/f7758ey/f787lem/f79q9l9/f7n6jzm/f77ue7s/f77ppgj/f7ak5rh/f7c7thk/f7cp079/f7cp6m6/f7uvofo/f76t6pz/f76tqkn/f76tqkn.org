I had a hard time choosing between Leera, Isk, and Arn for an offworld adventure, just based on how fun each of them would be to write. But once I started thinking realistically about which worlds were the most likely to involve relevant plot threads and independent action from other characters, it became pretty clear that I had only one option.
