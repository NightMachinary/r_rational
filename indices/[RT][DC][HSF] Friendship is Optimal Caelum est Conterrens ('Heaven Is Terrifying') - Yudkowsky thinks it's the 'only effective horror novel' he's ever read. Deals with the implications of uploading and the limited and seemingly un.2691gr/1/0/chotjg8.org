  which I believe is the story Yudkowsky was referring to in that quote (or both together).

You're wrong, he was specifically referring to this story. From his March 1st HPMOR [[http://hpmor.com/notes/progress-13-03-01/][progress report]]:

  On the lighter side, I recommend the recursive fanfic “Friendship is Optimal: Caelum est Conterrens” (Heaven Is Terrifying). This is the first and only effective horror novel I have ever read, since unlike Lovecraft, it contains things I actually find scary. You may or may not need to first read My Little Pony: Friendship is Optimal. I would recommend reading FiO first to get acquainted with the Optimalverse, but Caelum est Conterrens was written by a much more experienced fanfic writer and you might consider moving onto Conterrens directly if Optimal isn't doing it for you. Also, you have no idea how hard it is not to write my own take on the Optimalverse, which is something I'm not doing so I can put all my available writing energies into Methods. I want relationship credit for this.

I think this version takes some of the icky concepts of the original story even further.
