It was probably in Caelum anyways, I'm too bored to read both of them again. That's still in the 'canon' section of the 'Optimalverse' group though.

A proper Evil Plan has to have that, unless you can win otherwise. If it doesn't what kind of Evil Overlord are you? Sure, your Legions of Terror can smash any enemy, but if the other guy will walk off a cliff why bother?

The FiO original was probably always going to be the best anyways, a sequel always sells better in the first week but is never as good. (Except sometimes, because this /is/ real life, after all.) The one who made the Evil Plan in the first place probably has a better understanding of how to go about it anyways rather than someone who glanced at the instruction manual on how to conquer the world.
