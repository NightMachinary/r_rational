Well of course I'm not. Go check.

Well /yeah/. That was actually something I liked about the FiO original and disliked about its "sequels": the sequels imply that she outright changes you to be more cartoony, the original outright states that she let whatshisface go for some sizable period of time just making himself miserable with his pony-hating until she strolled by one day /just in time/ for him to consent to being modified from someone who thinks "ponies are girly and gay" to someone who thinks "I /used to think/ ponies are girly and gay".

On the one hand, that "I used to think" is a really blatant marker for "I used to think that [before the AI modified me to think otherwise]". On the other hand, leaving that kind of huge /tell/ lying in his memories is, kinda weirdly, almost but not /quite/ actually respectful of his personal autonomy.

There's a sheer /elegance/ to an Evil Plan in which the victim manipulates himself right into the position you want him in.
