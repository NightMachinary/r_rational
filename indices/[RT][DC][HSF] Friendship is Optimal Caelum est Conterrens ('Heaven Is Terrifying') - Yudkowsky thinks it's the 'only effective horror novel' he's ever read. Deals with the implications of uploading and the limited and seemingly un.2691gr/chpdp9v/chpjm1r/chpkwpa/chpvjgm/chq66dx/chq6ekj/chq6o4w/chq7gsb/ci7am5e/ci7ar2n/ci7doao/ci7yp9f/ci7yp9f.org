Hmm.... I have some complexes about words like "childlike" (namely: how it has come to mean "anyone who sees more wonder and joy in life than I do") and "adult" (namely: how it has come to mean "anyone who has shut down their soul and put on a business suit"), but... /yeah/.

Anyway, the scenario is depressing, but luckily, it's also completely unrealistic.
