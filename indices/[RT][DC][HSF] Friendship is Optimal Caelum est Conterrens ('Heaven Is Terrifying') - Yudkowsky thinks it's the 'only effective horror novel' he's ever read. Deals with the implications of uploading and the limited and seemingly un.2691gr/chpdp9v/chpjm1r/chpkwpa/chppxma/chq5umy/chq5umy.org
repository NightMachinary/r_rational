No, not necessarily like that. The way it was done here is that the brain is completely destroyed, then the data is taken and edited a bit, then a new 'brain' is made from the edited and compressed data. My proposal involves connecting the replacements to the original organic brain, so the subject would not tell the difference over the slower timescale as the brain is eventually completely converted.

In the situation that my brain is destroyed to upload and there is no alternative, I would also grant it the status of 'Me-ness'. I would just be dead, and my last thoughts would be to tell it to be f****** grateful.
