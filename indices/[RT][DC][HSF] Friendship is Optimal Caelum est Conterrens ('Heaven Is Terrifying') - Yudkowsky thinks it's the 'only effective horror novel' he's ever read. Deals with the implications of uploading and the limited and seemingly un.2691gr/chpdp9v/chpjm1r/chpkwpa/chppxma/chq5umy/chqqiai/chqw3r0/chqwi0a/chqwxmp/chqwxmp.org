It is technically the same, but my brain is the thing that is currently 'me', and I don't want the version of 'me' that is currently running to stop running. Another version of 'me' on a different medium would still be 'me', but this 'me' would be gone.

Telling the one on a different medium that it should be grateful because 'you' died to create the new(but still the same) 'you' is slightly different in my opinion. And he better be grateful. Even though 'I' won't exist to see it.

If the process was done without destroying the original brain, you would be capable of saying hello to the new 'you' and having different experiences than it. This would define the two of 'you' as different people. And the new 'you' would watch in horror as 'you' were destroyed by whatever system is used to prevent millions of copies of 'you' taking over the world.
