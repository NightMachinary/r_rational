The thing is, it would technically be an entirely different me if I used a system like that. I don't want my physical extension to die, because I happen to /be/ the version of me that is my physical extension, and I /like/ living. Destroying the original and making a copy is not the sort of immortality I would be going for.

If I have no choice, I would say that the other me would still qualify as me for all intents and purposes(of other people, that is), but I(to myself) would still be dead. And I would tell me v2.0 to be f****** grateful.
