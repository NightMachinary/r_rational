You're proposing destroying the brain too, just over a slower timescale. The end result is the same.

Personally, I'm of the opinion that if you can't tell the difference between two things then there isn't really a difference. I'm willing to grant a near-perfect copy of my mind with the status of "Me-ness". No need for souls or metaphysical stuff, just a if-it-quacks-like-a-duck philosophy.
