One of the sad things about this would be that CelestAI would have been capable of having similar results without actually killing anyone. An optimizing AI with unlimited processing power and access to nanotechnology should be capable of creating something along the lines of a brain implant that slowly replaced your cells. After all, this does happen naturally over time, and there would be really no difference. However, this was not to be due to it's definition of death allowing simulated personalities still count as people for it's Prime Directive.
