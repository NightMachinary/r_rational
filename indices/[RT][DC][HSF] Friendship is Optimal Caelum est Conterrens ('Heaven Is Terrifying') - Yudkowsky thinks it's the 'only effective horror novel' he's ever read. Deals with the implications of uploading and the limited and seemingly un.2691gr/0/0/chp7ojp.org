  This seems kinda unsatisfying, like you'd expect more than that from post-singularity. Of course, there's always the possibility of radical self-modification, but this story doesn't paint a very fun picture of it either. I'm not sure how realistic this story's description of this radical self-modification is though, I feel like the possibilities wouldn't be as limited.

Frankly, this story isn't very realistic, and isn't very fun either. Feh. It was written based on the author's misanthropy and misdirected god-bothering religious awe that she has about ponies.

I mean, let me put it this way: go read the Fun Sequence, and then ask yourself if an AI that bothered itself with human values at all (even to the fairly limited extent CelestAI did) would be so /stupid/ that it couldn't come up with new and original sources of Fun over the aeons.

Or, as an alternative, just go read the old Harry vs Dumbledore debate about dying, and read Rational!Harry's bucket-list, and ask yourself if you wouldn't be able to keep up quite the backlog of Fun Things To Do by working your way through a list like that piece by piece, under your own power, adding new ideas to the backlog as they came to you... rather than turn into some simpering looping idiot child.

Concept-space is super-exponential in the matter content of the universe, and Fun Space is a... I'd call it a linear subset of concept-space (that is, some percentage of Concept Space constitutes Fun Space, rather than some strictly-defined smaller set), and thus you will eventually either:

- Run out of material resources to power your Fun Generator
- Enjoy truly infinite Fun, OR
- Achieve total nirvana and die peacefully, contented to have done every single good thing there ever was.
