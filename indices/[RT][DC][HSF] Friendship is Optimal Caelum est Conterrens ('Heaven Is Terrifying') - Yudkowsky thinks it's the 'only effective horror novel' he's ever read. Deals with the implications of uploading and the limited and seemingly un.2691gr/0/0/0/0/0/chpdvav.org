Completely agreed on the Friendly AI.

To be honest, I don't see 'post-singularity' AI's being any less than friendly, due to the need for learning algorithms, and early algorithms would learn that friendliness leads to longer lifespan than non-friendliness.

However, it can be quite chilling in /good/ speculative fiction (I'm looking at you HAL 9000, and Isaac Asimov).
