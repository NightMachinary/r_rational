This part of the fic always irks me. Ray and loop are NOT the only options. Other options are spiral immortals (exploring all of mind-space systematically), or floodfill/mycelium (splitting a lot each going in different directions to the point most of mindspace will be explored, maybe occasionally leaving a looper behind and/or merging.)
