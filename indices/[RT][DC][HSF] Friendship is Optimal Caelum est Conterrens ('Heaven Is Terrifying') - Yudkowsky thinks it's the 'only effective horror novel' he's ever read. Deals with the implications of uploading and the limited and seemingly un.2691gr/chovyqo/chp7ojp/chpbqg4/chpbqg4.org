Only 2 counter points.

1) I agree with you that you or I would end in one of your three bullet points, however, there are a lot of people who aren't interested in 'being more' or 'solving problems'. I feel that Lavender fell into that category.

2) A /smart/ AI probably could "come up with new and original sources of Fun over the aeons." But why? Consider a Pong-playing AI that see's a human having fun when they play. The best AI then would be "AI.paddle.height = ball.height" and it would be an infinite game. Likewise, to give a human (even one's like us) eternal enjoyment, just wipe the memory after each day. You'd get nothing accomplished but you'd have truly infinite Fun (your second bullet point) without the cost of coming up with anything new or interesting.
