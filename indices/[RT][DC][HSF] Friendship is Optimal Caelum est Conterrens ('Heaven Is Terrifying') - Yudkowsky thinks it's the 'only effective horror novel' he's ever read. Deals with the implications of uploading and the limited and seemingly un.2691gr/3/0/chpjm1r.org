I actually, honestly don't see the difference. This debate happens every time that series comes up, and it really just comes across as the least-scary thing to pick nits about. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/pn/zombies_the_movie/][Just because we don't /yet/ understand consciousness and the continuity thereof doesn't mean there's some metaphysical sense in which the digitized sugar denizen "isn't you".]]

I mean, sure, the UFAI /could/ destroy your brain physically and then invent a new personality from whole cloth who gets instantiated in a virtual world and lives a lovely life. Doing that /after going to the trouble of tricking or seducing you into giving consent to upload your mind/ is so damn complicated that its prior is far lower than the theory that it actually is, to the best of its own knowledge, uploading you, and besides, if it didn't care about you enough to upload you, there are many far simpler ways to just outright kill you.

And anyway, if you think your conscious mind can =diff= itself for unauthorized patches while being piece-by-piece replaced with cybernetic components, you've got another thing coming.
