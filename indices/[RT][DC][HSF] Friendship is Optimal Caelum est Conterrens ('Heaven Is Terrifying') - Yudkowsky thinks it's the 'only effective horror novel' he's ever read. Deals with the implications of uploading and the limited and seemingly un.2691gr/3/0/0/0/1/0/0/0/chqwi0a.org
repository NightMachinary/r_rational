I don't see a grand difference honestly; "you" go to sleep, "you" wake up later. If it's you in the outset and you in the end, it doesn't matter that much if you had a change of medium in between, right?

Isn't telling your future self that you should be grateful before such a procedure equivalent to saying the same thing before you go to sleep for the night?
