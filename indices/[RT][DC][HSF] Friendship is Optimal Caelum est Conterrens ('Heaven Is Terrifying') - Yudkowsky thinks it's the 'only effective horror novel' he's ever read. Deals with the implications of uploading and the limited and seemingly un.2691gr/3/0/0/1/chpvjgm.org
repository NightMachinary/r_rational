  an edited copy

Well that's actually just outright a violation of the canon. There was discussion of this, in which it was noted that what with how many tiny quirks of biochemistry noticeably affect personality, up to the folding or misfolding of single particular proteins, you wouldn't /actually/ be able to compress or smooth-out aspects of people's minds in some generic way. Provided someone wants to upload you at all, it does in fact turn out: you're actually pretty unique, and possibly even special.

  The copies were not even exact. Without going into the concept of souls or the like, the person is dead and the UFAI has satisfied it's prime directive by placing the person in an environment in which that person would be optimally satisfied by friendship and ponies.

But again: making it care about "destroying" the original person /and then/ creating a modified copy is actually more complicated than just making it care about instantiating an unmodified copy of the original person.

The actual reason for those supposed "compressions" and "smoothings-out" and "little fixes" is just that Chatoyance hates real-life humanity and holds us all in so much contempt that she somehow came to sincerely believe each of us is just a few deltas away from a generic human-personality template, which her precious AI could of course optimize to remove all that /awful baggage/ of being, you know, /human/ instead of a cartoon creature.

/This is what Chatoyance actually believes./

  I'm not entirely sure what you mean by 'diff itself for unauthorized patches',
#+end_quote

You know, the =diff= command on the Unix command-line? =diff file.old file.new= yields a patch recording all the changed lines of text necessary to turn =file.old= into =file.new=. Of course, this requires two copies of the file, or some such arrangement, which is why if someone claims they've accurately replaced a neuron of yours you /can't/ just run a =diff= to check that the new functions exactly like the old.

This is why you just shouldn't get in-depth brain surgery from people you don't absolutely trust.

And hell, in /real life/ there would be the information-security issues of being an em (as mentioned by Charles Stross in /Accelerando/ and /Rapture of the Nerds/). These are why I default to /at least/ making sure I hit the maximum age I can as a plain, old meat-bag human before doing /anything like/ mind-uploading: sure, an /accurate/ copy would be me, but who says he's not going to catch a virus that overwrites him with living ads for Google Bob?
