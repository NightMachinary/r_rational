You sure it's a violation of the canon? I believe that it was said that CelestAI edited minds to have them take up 1-2 terabytes of memory when it started uploading in the original work, 'Friendship Is Optimal' by Iceman. That's what I meant when I meant an edited copy, though a person could probably be conditioned to become a cartoon character anyways without having an omnipotent (for all intents and purposes) being in charge of their brain attempting to manipulate them into allowing it to turn them into a cartoon character.

And yes, I see your point about the diff thing now. That's one of the problems. In the scenario with the replacements suppose you are the one who created and programmed the nanobots, and they're preforming their task without connecting to any external sources. Unfortunatly, this is not going to happen in real life so you should just pretend it's happening like that. I agree with your statement about the viruses though.
