Anyway, like I said, the scenario is completely unrealistic. Even in the space of almost-but-not-quite-Friendly UFAIs, almost none are /specifically programmed/ to reduce people to childlike idiots, and /this/ one in particular has very little in common with the canon TV show the AI was ostensibly programmed to mimic, so the whole worrisome thing would just never happen. And that's assuming you get /neither/ a properly Friendly AI /nor/ a paper-clipping UFAI in the first place, so actually in real life... yeah.

File this one under "kinda pathetic but not actually worth getting depressed about."
