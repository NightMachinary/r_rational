  A proper Evil Plan has to have that, unless you can win otherwise. If it doesn't what kind of Evil Overlord are you?

Conditional on my ever being an evil overlord, which I am not currently and have no plans to become at the moment, I think the evidence conclusively establishes exactly what sort I would be. Thus, ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars.

  The FiO original was probably always going to be the best anyways, a sequel always sells better in the first week but is never as good.

No, /Always Say No/ is the best. It's got a post-apocalyptic action hero who /knows how to handle UFAI./

  The one who made the Evil Plan in the first place probably has a better understanding of how to go about it anyways rather than someone who glanced at the instruction manual on how to conquer the world.

I still admire the kind of twisted mind who can come up with an Evil Plan whose primary steps are "Give people things they want."
