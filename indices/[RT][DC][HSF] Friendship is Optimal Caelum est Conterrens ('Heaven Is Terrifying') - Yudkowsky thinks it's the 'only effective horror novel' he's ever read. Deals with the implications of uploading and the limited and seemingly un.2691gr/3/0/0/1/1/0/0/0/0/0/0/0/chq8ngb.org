  No, no, I did not think you would. I am simply the type of person who attempts to plan for every eventuality. In the scenario that you do become an Evil Overlord, I would hate to have humanity defeated by one who broke a rule. After all, you may have not read the list because of a fluke.

Nah, I'm working on becoming a Good Overlord, obviously.

Actually, I don't want to rule anything. Not the ruling type. Any overthrow of major or minor governments I might perform is a mere subgoal to my general goals of "live a long time, have as much fun as possible, keep my friends and family and sources of new members for those groups around, and make sure to give the appropriate people hugs on a regular basis."

One of the fucked-up things about growing up is that you end up realizing having fun requires overthrowing major governments.
