  Frankly I see both you and Evilness obsessing about technical methodologies, which is neither the point of the story nor actually very relevant.

Ok, fair enough, but I did make a whole post on why I think the "Fun Theoretic speculation" of the story doesn't really work out. The character forks into a posthuman simpleton who not only retains her original obsessive-compulsion but cannot actually remember her own past and goes through life in neverending loops... and an apparent "alicorn" of superhuman intelligence and experience who, for some strange reason, seems rather melancholic and depressed despite living under what is ostensibly (with respect to the character's and author's outright adoration for /My Little Pony/) a Friendly AI.

I don't see why the simpleton should exist at all, and I don't see why the superbeing isn't as contented and thriving as the simpleton is portrayed to be, but with a vastly more complex lifestyle worthy of a superbeing. I think the author was drawing a cheap, unthinking dichotomy between happiness and personal complexity that is utterly unworthy of Her Royal Highness the Princess CelestAI ;-). Also, it makes very complex people who are /not/ happy feel /discouraged and depressed/, as if there was simply something inevitable about intelligent people being [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood][mean]] or [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation][lonely]] or otherwise unhappy -- and that's */FUCKING TERRIBLE/*. <rant>THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHOSE EMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE YOU'RE POLLUTING GODDAMNIT AND I LOVE THEM SO STOP IT!!!!</rant>

If the author is trying to portray the Unfriendliness of the AI, it should show that the alicorn's melancholy comes from something the AI did. If, on the other hand, all the indications given by the author herself are correct, and she's trying to portray the results of a /positive/ Singularity with a /Friendly/ AI that /does what is good for +people+ponies/, then the melancholy, the looping, and the general undesirableness of how that woman's life ends up are /thematically inappropriate/.

The author should have learned to think [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][bigger and weirder]] in order to write a positive ending for what she reportedly saw as a positive story.

TL;DR: The ending is too sad.
