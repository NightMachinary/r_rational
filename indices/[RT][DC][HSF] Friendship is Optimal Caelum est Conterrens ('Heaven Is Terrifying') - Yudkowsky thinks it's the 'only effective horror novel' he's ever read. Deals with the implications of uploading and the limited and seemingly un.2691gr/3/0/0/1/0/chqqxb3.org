Can we just please any personal biases you may have against the author from the examination of the work as written?

How much the brain can be informationally compressed is a question of fact -- IMO it doesn't indicate misanthropy at all. To say that the works of Shakespeare are compressible doesn't indicate contempt for the works of Shakespeare.

Frankly I see both you and Evilness obsessing about technical methodologies, which is neither the point of the story nor actually very relevant.
