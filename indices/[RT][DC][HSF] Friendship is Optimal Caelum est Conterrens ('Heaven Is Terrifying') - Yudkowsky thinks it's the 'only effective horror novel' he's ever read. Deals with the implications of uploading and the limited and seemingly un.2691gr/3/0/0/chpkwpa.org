The thing is, your brain has been destroyed to create the new thing. Your brain is terminated, then an edited copy of your brain is placed into sugar-land. Therefore, /you/ are dead. There is a copy of you in ponyland. That is how it worked in the fic.

This series is about a being who's purpose was to 'satisfy human values through friendship and ponies'. It clearly could not override that directive, but it was using it's own definition of death, which considered a person alive if that person was destroyed and then replaced by a copy. The copies were not even exact. Without going into the concept of souls or the like, the person is dead and the UFAI has satisfied it's prime directive by placing the person in an environment in which that person would be optimally satisfied by friendship and ponies.

And for the last point, would a human notice if something as small as say, a single cell, was replaced? I'm afraid I'm not entirely sure what you mean by 'diff itself for unauthorized patches', but according to my logic, if a part that small has been replaced by a copy designed to replace it(though powered differently), would the rest of the thing even notice? Cells do die naturally, after all.
