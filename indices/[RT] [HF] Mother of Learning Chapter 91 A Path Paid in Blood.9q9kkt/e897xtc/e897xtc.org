Damn. I suppose it wouldn't have fit the tone of the chapter but I was really hoping for a little section on the various reactions of governments around the world. Dunno why but my absolute favorite parts of this story are the descriptions of authority outrage whenever ZZ do some crazy shit. Consecutive raids on every black room facility on the continent. Christ, can you imagine the shitstorm that must be going on everywhere in the aftermath of that?

Also, it was a nice little moment when the eagle riders were mentioned again. Serves as a nice comparison between where they were before and where they are now. Whereas before they were impossible to fight, now the two are so OP the eagle riders have to back the fuck up.
