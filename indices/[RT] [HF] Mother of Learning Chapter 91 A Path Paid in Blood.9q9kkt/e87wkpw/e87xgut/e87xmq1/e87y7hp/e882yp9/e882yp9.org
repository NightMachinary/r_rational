It was over a year if you include the time in the time dilation chambers. 6 months in the outside loop and six months in the time dilation chambers. A year practicing and refreshing on highly advanced magic would definitely make her more dangerous than the original. Plus even if they were equal she knows the original's routines and defenses perfectly, so an ambush would almost certainly succeed unless the angels or random bad luck interfere with it.

As a side note, even though Zorian probably spent about 8.5 years in the outside time loop, if you add the time he spent in the time dilation chambers he's probably spent somewhere closer to 13 years total, maybe as high as 15 years, inside the Sovereign Gate.
