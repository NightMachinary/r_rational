It's been /decades/ since the loop started, and not only is Zorian at home, asleep in his bed (he'd be in Cyoria if it were even a single day later), it's still dark out.

By that math, (>20 years : <8 hours), the acceleration factor is at least 22,000:1 (and probably /much/ higher, I'm probably low balling it by at least five orders of magnitude).

At that rate, with a one-month head start, Silverlake has had, at most, two minutes out of the loop. Red Robe might have an hour or two, but, as I said, I'm giving an absolute worst-case scenario; my guess is that he's been out for seconds, if that.
