#+begin_quote
  Did we ever find out who Red Robe is?
#+end_quote

no

#+begin_quote
  Do Red Robe and Silverlake know enough about Zorian to attack him in his home?
#+end_quote

Red Robe, no

Silverlake, she may or may not know his home address immediately, but she can find it fairly quickly

#+begin_quote
  Do they know enough about artifacts, treasure, and allies Zorian needs to get there first?
#+end_quote

Zorian doesn't need any artifacts or treasure simply to stop the invasion per se

Silverlake certainly knows the allies Zorian has used in the past

#+begin_quote
  Will they ally with each other?
#+end_quote

not immediately as Red Robe doesn't even know Silverlake exists and Silverlake doesn't know who Red Robe is

#+begin_quote
  Will either of them bring Quatach-Ichl up to date?
#+end_quote

most certainly, which is their best chance for meeting each other

#+begin_quote
  What has Zach been up to in his remaining loops?
#+end_quote

most likely he left asap in the next loop

#+begin_quote
  How much preparation can he do without Zorian?
#+end_quote

none, they've already done all the prep they can

#+begin_quote
  Does he know Zorian made it?
#+end_quote

he will once Zorian is found soul-killed at the beginning of the next loop

#+begin_quote
  Do our heros have a good plan for after the loops
#+end_quote

well, they have A plan, but how good it is remains to be seen

#+begin_quote
  (2) only Zorian got out?
#+end_quote

Zach can easily get out the next loop. The gate is unbarred and he's the main controller
