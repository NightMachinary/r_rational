There aren't any others anymore, just Zach and Zorian. So Zach will probably show up next chapter.

On the other hand [[/u/nobody103]] once mentioned that the story basically ended as they got out, so if you leave us at this cliffhanger I swear to god i will find whatever country you're from that doesn't speak english, and go Zorian on you to write the final chapters!
