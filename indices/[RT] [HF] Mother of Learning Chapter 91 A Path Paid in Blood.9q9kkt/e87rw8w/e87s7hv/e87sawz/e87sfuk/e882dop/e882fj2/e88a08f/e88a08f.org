Simmer down there friend. I know this is a fantasy story but at some point you gotta draw a line in the sand. I would never accept such an unreasonable, fantastical premise for a sequel. Even if I was overdosing on psychedelics, I'd still recognize this plot idea for the impossibility that it is. Zorian? Getting a girlfriend? Beyond Absurd.

I'm sorry to tell you this my guy, but your entire premise just makes no sense.
