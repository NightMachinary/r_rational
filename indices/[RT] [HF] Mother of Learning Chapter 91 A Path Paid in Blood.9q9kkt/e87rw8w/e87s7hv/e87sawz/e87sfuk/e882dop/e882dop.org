Epilogue? Fuck that I'd pay 15 dollars for a fucking sequel where Zorian has more adventures as a master mage in the real world. It may not be possible for Nobody (Stories require conflict, and creating a good conflict for a sequel story can be very hard), but dammit if he manages to come up with a good sequel idea for Zorian I'd buy the hell out of that shit.
