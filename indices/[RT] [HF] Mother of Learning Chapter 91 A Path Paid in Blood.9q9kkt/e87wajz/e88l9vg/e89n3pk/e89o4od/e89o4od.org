he's far from mastered most disciplines, he can use them yes, but mastery usually means a deeper understanding them what Zorian have, warlock would not be a bad match sure since he know all the forbidden magics to some extent.

the only area's where he actually got some form of mastery is mind magic and artifice, and possibly divination but i feel he haven't dived deep there simply because he haven't needed to due to divination being so easy for him.

what he got actual mastery of is mana shaping, so he can do basic "spells" without actually using a spell for most areas, medical magic being one he haven't found a shaping exercise for, or at least not one that was easy to practice with. his expertise in this area aid's his casting in all areas and is a boon due to his low mana pool.

i just find warlock being a bit plain personally, it's fitting but being "the hydra mind" is more unique then being a warlock in my personal opinion, but taste differ so if you think warlock's better then you do you.
