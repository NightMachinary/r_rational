We're really in the endgame now people. Pretty sure Zach made it out as well with the gate unbarred, also his muddled memory has been teased too much for it not to be payed off.

Silverlake is going to be top priority to deal with first (unless Zach has been mind magicked to attack Zorian). Hopefully Zorian can get the original Silverlake to join them seeing as the looper version is most definitely going to try and kill her og self.
