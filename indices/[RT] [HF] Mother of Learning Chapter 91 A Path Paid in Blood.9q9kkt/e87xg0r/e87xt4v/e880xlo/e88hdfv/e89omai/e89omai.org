Souls aren't getting wiped clean. They're being obliterated, because they're cut off from the spiritual realms and then their entire universe collapses (confirmed by author).

Also, the Guardian made reference to a template being used to recreate the world.

So, it appears that the Gate is keeping a full unaltered copy of all souls in storage, and then creating *another* copy of each soul each time to actually go out and live in the world for a month.

So there's no obstacle to recreating Zorian from the template; he'd just go back to how he was when the loop started.
