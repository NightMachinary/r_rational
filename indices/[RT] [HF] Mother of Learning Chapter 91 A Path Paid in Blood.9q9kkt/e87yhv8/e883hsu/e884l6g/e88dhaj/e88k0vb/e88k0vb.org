Time in a time loop is different from regular time. You can avoid social responsibilities and suffer no consequences. You can not show up for work or class and spend money like its going out of style and suffer no consequences. You can ignore social interactions or taboo's at no social costs. Did you miss your friends birthday and now he no longer wants to help you on your personal work? Who cares. In a month he'll no longer be angry with you, and you can ask him to help you then. You have much more free time to do what you want, and alot less stress in your life, when interactions like these are no longer a requirement for you. A large part of our lives are just spent treading water, so to speak, so once you stop top trying to maintain your reputation, social circle, lifestyle, or finances, a substantial amount of time opens up to you.

A time loop is particularly helpful for teaching a person combat, illegal activities, and dangerous hobbies.

Doing an important experiment that might kill you? Who cares. Safety precautions would just slow down your work. Poisons or cancerogic compounds matter not to to you. Without the fear of an arrest, you can learn to rob and swindle people to your heart's content. Combat can be learned at your pace and stress free. In the real world, if you screw up any of these dangerous pursuits, you'd be dead, kidnapped, in prison, etc. You don't get a second chance to learn from major mistakes in a real life or death situation. Since people learn how to do things by repetition and correcting their past mistakes, learning in these dangerous situations is limited. At best, you can only correct minor mistakes, since major mistakes will just get you killed. Training for dangerous activities in safe, hypothetical scenarios can help get around this issue, but it will never be the same as the real thing. A practice scenario on how to defend against a guy trying to kill you in a defense class, where safety precautions are enforced, will always be different than learning how to defend yourself against an actual guy who is trying to kill you.

In short, you can't just look at the number of years Zorian has been inside the loop and determine his original potential. He's had far more opportunities and time to practice his talents than any equivalent time frame in the real world could allow.
