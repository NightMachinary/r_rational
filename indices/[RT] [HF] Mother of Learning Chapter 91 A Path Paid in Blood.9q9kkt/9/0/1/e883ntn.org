This world does have heaven, so it wasn't so much snuffing it out as it was letting it go, I think. (Provided no soul mutilation took place.)

Maybe it was possible for two souls to cohabit a body? But without a known precedent it would probably have taken Zorian at least a month to work it out, during which Zorian prime would be kept a disembodied soul. And that's not considering the church's stance on such a thing, or Zorian prime's resentment on sharing what was originally is own body. I'm guessing that's what was going through Zorian's head before he decided it was too cruel.
