Oh, good point, I forgot that's basically what shifters were.

That said, the description of them were more like "an animal's soul /stapled/ to the shifter's soul", and from all that we've seen of them it looks like only one mind/consciousness is in play, so it still wouldn't solve the basic problem of "two-Zorian coexistence" without heavy experimentation that Zorian-prime never gave and maybe can't give meaningful assent to.
