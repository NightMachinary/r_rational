There's a lot here, bear with me.

OK so they were never going to be allowed to keep the things they physically obtained in the time loop. Their souls leave, but not physical goods so it's not really a loss. Plus, whatever they obtained in the loop can almost-just-as-easily be reobtained.

The iterated blueprints and data Zorian gained... Doesn't he already have a memory bank ability that he uses to store that stuff anyway? Like I remember a section where he even dismissed some of the orbs usefulness since he could already store memories. He's probably also well familiar by now with the iterated plans so again not much of a loss.

The entire team making it out was always going to be a hail Mary and this really does hurt him a little. But he was always able to convince Xvim and Alanic of the time loop with trivial ease later on, he'd be able to recruit the inner circle pretty fast. Plus like Ilsa said, these are grown mages at the end of their careers, they've mostly plateaued so the loss of the gains inside the loop aren't a big deal.

And like others said, this was the last chance for everyone except Zach to get out, it was all or nothing.

Also, I really disagree that Qatach is evil. It's mostly a moral disconnect from the from more brutal time he comes from. His belief system is that no true peace can exist between powerful states, he does what he does to guarantee the continued existence of the state he cares for. It's like all geopolitics to him.
