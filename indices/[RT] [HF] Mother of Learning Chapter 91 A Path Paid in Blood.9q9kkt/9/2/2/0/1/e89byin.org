I see QI's mindset guided by realpolitick - it quite echoes the gist of offensive realism (one of the oldest structuralist theories in international relations) (nation states exist in an anarchic international political situation (no higher powers), states prioritize survival, one of the ways to do so is to maximize military power, EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE TO MAXIMIZE ODDS OF SURVIVAL AT ALL COST):
