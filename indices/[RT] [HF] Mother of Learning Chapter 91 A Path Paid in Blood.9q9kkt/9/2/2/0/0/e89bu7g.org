Have you just recently read the story?

Anyway, in the chapter where ZZ convince him to tutor them, chapter 81, he explains that his plans on releasing the Primordial is simply to cause enough damage to Eldemar and Sulamnon so that Falkrinea wins the next round of splinter wars and leaves his country alone. Eldemar and Sulamnon are the biggest threats to his country and he just wants to weaken them enough so they can't threaten Ulquua Ibasa.

I'd imagine from his point of view, it wasn't backstabbing (Plus ZZ literally planned on straight up murdering him if he so much as stepped into the orb). He honored the deal they worked out entirely. There was no ongoing commitment to remain allies or even friendly, they had contract and it was fulfilled. What more can be asked of this honorable skelly?

As for why he wanted to disrupt their ritual? The cultists and Quatach want a loose, rampaging primordial. ZZ were just using the primordial to escape the loop, they never intended to truly release it, they just said that's what they were doing to get them on board. But the cultists and Quatach were probably too clever and figured out what they were really doing and trying to stop them so Panaxeth could truly be freed.

Oooh right I just reread the relevant bit. That is a pretty big blow actually but it happened 2 chapters ago really.
