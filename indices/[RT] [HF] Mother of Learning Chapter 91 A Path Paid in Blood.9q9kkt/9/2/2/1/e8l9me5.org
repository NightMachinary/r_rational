  OK so they were never going to be allowed to keep the things they physically obtained in the time loop. Their souls leave, but not physical goods so it's not really a loss. Plus, whatever they obtained in the loop can almost-just-as-easily be reobtained.

they would have kept the orb, with all the important physical stuff aka blueprints and decades of research notes etc..

​

also, as far as has been stated/everyones comments in previous chapter posts, their whole body leaves IDEALLY, it's only cos his body wa destroyed zorian only got his soul.

> Doesn't he already have a memory bank ability that he uses to store that stuff anyway?

yeah many man ychapters ago, he hit the limit of that memory bank i believe? plus it decays with age where the orb stores forever.
