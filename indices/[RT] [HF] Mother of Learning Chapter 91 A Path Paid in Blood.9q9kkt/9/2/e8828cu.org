I am beyond relieved that the time loop is finally, finally over. But the /price/ that they had to pay... losing all of their artifacts, all of the data stored within the orb, all of Zach and Zorian's allies... was it worth it? Couldn't they have just tried again in one of the half dozen or so restarts they had left?

What resources does Zorian even have now, now that he's out of the loop? Does he still have the ability to 'reawaken' fellow loopers like Daimen and Xvim?

What's for sure is, Qatach needs to die now, in the 'real' world. He's too evil and too powerful to let live.
