for Zorian's benefit. because the Guardian is not going to know what to do with Zorian since it will find a soul already in place when "re-anchoring", where Zach's body will be fine. they don't want to risk that so they had to find a way to bring Zorian out as a body rather than as a soul

Chapter 55:

  "So the Controller has their original soul drawn into the time loop when it is first made," Zorian said. "They aren't a copy, so there is no problem with them leaving. But everyone else would have to kill someone to get out, and that's unacceptable. Is that correct?"

  "Yes," the Guardian agreed.

  "But you could do that?" Zach suddenly spoke up. "If one of the copies wanted to leave this place, you could switch their soul with that of the original?"

  "Theoretically," the Guardian admitted, "but that goes against what I was made to do. I am the Guardian of the Threshold. One of the main tasks the Maker gave me was to ensure things inside the time loop could not menace the source of the template. If a diverged copy tried to kill the original by switching their souls with it, I would do my best to stop them."

  "What about a normal, un-diverged copy?" asked Zorian. "Surely there is no harm in replacing the original with a normal copy. They're practically the same thing! It's what makes it okay to destroy millions of souls every month or so, isn't it?"

  The Guardian hesitated. A short, tense silence descended on the scene as it considered the scenario.

  "So long as the copies do not diverge too much from the original, such a switch would be theoretically acceptable," the Guardian eventually admitted. "But it is my purpose to keep the time loop from spilling out in the real world as much as possible, so I would still refuse to perform such a switch. Only the controller, with the knowledge and secrets they gathered inside the time loop, is allowed to leave and make their mark on the world outside, since they are technically of that world to begin with."
