  What resources does Zorian even have now, now that he's out of the loop? Does he still have the ability to 'reawaken' fellow loopers like Daimen and Xvim?
#+end_quote

he still has ALL of his knowledge and skills, but perhaps not his improved mana reserves as that's a part of the body, still has all his efficiency and spells/skills i believe, if not the specific research notes etc.

also knows how to get access to ridiculous amounts of money/valuable resources etc.
