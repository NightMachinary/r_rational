What an amazing chapter. I can't wait to see what happens next and who exactly Zorian is targeting with the ability to pierce Mind Blank. The most obvious target is Zach but this could be potentially very useful against both Red Robe and Silverlake too. Not to even mention the general combat benefits. For a long time Zorian's biggest weakness has been that his specialty and most overpowered ability is countered by Mind Blank. If he can bypass it his opponent's only real option is to kill him before he gets into their mind. There will probably be some limitations though, I would be surprised if the author put in something as game changing as this without any limitations.

Random thought but if Silverlake had not accepted the offer they probably would have broke out much more safely. She accepted the death pact and all it will likely mean is she is killed by either Zach or Zorian. Pretty ironic.
