I feel like them sacrificing themselves to save Zorian can be framed in less altruistic motives as well. Many of the core group of loopers are people Zorian's been ferrying information to within the time loop. If they can get him to survive, then, given Zorian's previous behavior and well demonstrated strong morals, their out-of-loop selves will also benefit, whereas if they attempt to escape and fail, they get no benefit at all.
