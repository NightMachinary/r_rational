He might not have to.

Z&Z have gotten QI to join them on a caper by offering divine artifacts before (how they got the knife). Zach could probably get QI to take Zorian's place in the collection quest on the basis that Zach knows the locations but will also need the crown, and some "muscle" and expertise he "doesn't have" to secure the set.

QI seeing an opportunity to snag all the artifacts (as well as possibly learn something about the crown) agrees, but not knowing that the one use will be exiting the time-loop he has no idea he's in, he gets beaten to the betrayal by Zach.
