Holy shit that was EPIC! You've done such a good job Nobody103!! My heart was racing throughout! Kudos.

I can only hope that the last run through of the month is not fast forwarded a lot. I want to get closure on so many subplots! It has been a long time since ZZ have existed in a world with active antagonists hunting then down. Really want to read more about that.

So hyped about the next chapter!
