True, it was my expectation that Sudomir's soul stapling exercises will help Zorian & company in their post escape plan.

But like I said, integrating his own soul gives Zorian zero benefit. Plus, having two souls suddenly will make him suspicious in the eyes of the Church (and Alanic). So no benefit with serious down sides. Ejecting and replacing his own soul makes it much easier. And rational.

So,yeah, I was (somewhat) disappointed, but it was still within reasonable limits.
