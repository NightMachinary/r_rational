  the divine construct, the thing providing QI with doubled mana reserves?
#+end_quote

Are you calling the crown a divine construct?

They didn't call it that in the novel?

#+begin_quote
  QI's "body" is manmade and non-living, thus any mana stored in it wouldn't be able to hold its affinity. even if it was able to somehow able to store his mana, would each of his temporary bodies need to store his capacity in mana? or just one main body which channels it to wherever he currently is? how easily screwed is he with a ward then?
#+end_quote

Isn't disrupting his mana how they get his body to collapse and he returns to his phylactery?

So his mana comes from that no?

#+begin_quote
  also remember only the Controller's soul is brought into the loop and only he may leave since only he has a target body to return to. if the body is what stores the mana, what is the point of that if it'll just render his whole progress moot?
#+end_quote

The controller keeps the loop body as he's the only one who entered with consent. The issue is the temporary/"fake" loopers are now different people to the ones outside the loop.
