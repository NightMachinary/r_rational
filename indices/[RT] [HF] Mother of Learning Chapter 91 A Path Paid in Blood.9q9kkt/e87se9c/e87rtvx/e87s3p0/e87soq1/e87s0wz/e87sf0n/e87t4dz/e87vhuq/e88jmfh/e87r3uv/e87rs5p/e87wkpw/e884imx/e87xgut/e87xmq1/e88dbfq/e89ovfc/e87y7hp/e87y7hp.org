Yeah, I was never too sure Silverlake would do this. But I could totally see Quatach-Ichl doing it though. We already know that he will sacrifice himself for the original.

I'm not too sure on OG already being dead. On one hand, she's paranoid enough that I bet she would defend from a bad copy of herself. On the other, she knows all her secrets, and she may have ruled out the possibility of an evil clone. I also don't think the looper learned enough in five/six months to beat her original.

It's hard to say. I bet that the original is alive though, even if there's a good chance she's dead.
