well, can you really say it's more effort than trying to trick the Guardian? =P

it's not that there's an advantage to taking their bodies out. it's their only feasible option. they did discuss the possibility of tricking the Guardian but they decided it was ultimately too risky and unfeasible. how would you even go about figuring out the mechanics of the Guardian when it's godmade, contingencies to prevent tampering, can immediately erase you (or you can assume so), and you have limited ways of interacting with it?

also, to be perfectly accurate, they had no real plan from the start. they were looking for clues on how to get out for quite a while.

only until Chapter 65:

  "Why, though?" Zach asked. "Is this about finding a way for you to leave the time loop?"

  Zorian looked at his fellow time traveler in surprise.

  "Don't be so surprised," Zach scoffed. "You already told me how space itself seemed to collapse when Panaxeth tried to leave his prison. It's natural to wonder if that kind of spatial hole could be used to fashion some kind of passage out of this place. I've thought of it too. Admittedly, I have no idea how you could actually go about doing that..."

and even in Chapter 85 they were still only just figuring things out:

  Yet, Zorian knew he had to risk it. The fact was, their current initiatives were insufficient. Even if they managed to gather all the keys together in one restart before the time ran out, that wouldn't be enough. Not for Zorian, anyway. The problem of how he was supposed to exit the time loop still remained. His original self was still out there in the real world, so he couldn't just order the Guardian of the Threshold to shove his soul into his real body and be done with it. The Guardian of the Threshold may be confused about his controller status, but it would surely notice there was already a soul in Zorian's original body upon trying that. And even if that could be sidestepped somehow, there was still the matter of how to seize control of the body from his original self.
