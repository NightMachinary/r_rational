I don't think a human can ever rise to the level of the angels. My understanding (based on memory) is that the angels are limited by divine commands on how much they are allowed to interfere in mortal affairs, and that is the only reason they employ mortal agents.

The angels may oppose Zorian when they learn of him, but they would have the option to co-opt him. Either by reasoning with him, or by mind/soul magic.
