If what the protagonists have been told is true, all the loops were compressed into a matter of seconds in the real world. So Red Robe (and Silverlake) have had only moments to prepare longer that Zorian will.

Oh course, both probably have more resources in the real world that Zorian does. Silverlake can (probably) overpower her double fairly quickly. We don't know know for sure who Red Robe is, but he's adept at making friends with the invaders without outside help. Zorian, meanwhile, lost all his gear, first sacrificing it to hold the portal and then losing his body with whatever he had left. He'll have to rebuild.
