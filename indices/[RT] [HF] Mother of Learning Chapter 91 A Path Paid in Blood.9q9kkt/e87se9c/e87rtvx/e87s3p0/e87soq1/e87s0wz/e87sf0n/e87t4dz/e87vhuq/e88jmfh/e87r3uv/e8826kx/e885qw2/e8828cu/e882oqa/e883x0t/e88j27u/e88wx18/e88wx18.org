That's totally right... even though they couldn't bring the Orb, Zorian and others definitely could have brought along smaller pocket dimensions, right?

One possibility is that they didn't want to put pocket dimensions inside other pocket dimensions, for fear that there would be some resonance in the spells. But even that seems sketchy, as I thought they had smaller pockets in the Orb during that 5 month period.
