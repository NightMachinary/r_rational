Simulacrums: a very good point. The one-choice-only nature in particular gathered my attention again, but indeed, that ship has sailed.

(To put in in Omega box terms: if you're the sort of person who would be willing to live by copy-killing, then there's no particular room for dissatisfaction if you die by copy-killing.)

((Edit: Now reviewing my own original thought-pattern formation, in that when thinking of stories in which people go back in time and take action against their past selves, thinking of this as a failure state and much preferring precommitting to always cooperate with all other selves (any nature of copy), any copy breaking this being disowned as a copy, hopefully prompting cognitive dissonance in the mind of any copy contemplating that.))
