Super excited to see where the Cyorian aranea come into play! He can't prove that he's from the looping world perfectly but for some people he has key memories of their most guarded secrets to help at least convince some of them. See Xvim and his passcode. For some people, he has also obtained enough of their skills where it is eerily impossible for something to not have happened and he can actually just show them what's going on in the Dungeon in order to at least convince them partially.

I'm not sure how contingent belief in the loop for various characters are in specifically the fact that the spiritual realm was cut off in the looping world, because presumably the spiritual realm is now accessible again.

Which begs the question... should Zorian attempt to call for the angels' help? Getting help from them could end up being a double edged sword. I can see a scenario where he could potentially leave a tip to operators of certain temples (and disguise himself to remain anonymous/untraceable), and the priests/priestesses at these institution could then relay this information to the angels.
