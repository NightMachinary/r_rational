those can be stored in other things but do not have affinity with the user. it's no longer the caster's mana but general mana at that point. why wouldn't it make sense to store within the soul? it's the soul that creates, refines, and manipulates mana. the soul already has life mana so what's different about other mana?

where in the body would mana be stored? why/how exactly does the body grow to accommodate more mana? what happens if a person loses multiple limbs?

also Chapter 39:

  "Shame it's only useful for powering items," Kael said. "Having some kind of personal mana battery would have been a nice way of side stepping your limited mana reserves. Have you looked into making such a thing? Even if it only lasted a few weeks, that should be enough to be useful in your circumstances."

  "Of course I've looked into it," Zorian scoffed. "It's impossible. Personal mana loses its affinity with its maker rapidly once expended, becoming indistinguishable from ambient mana in a matter of minutes."

so... QI definitely can't have mana storage in anything except his soul if he expects to use it competently and without handicap

Chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  There were two main forms of mana available to the mage: his personal mana and the ambient one that emanated from the underworld. Personal mana was something that all things with a soul possessed in varying amounts, and it was attuned to the person producing it -- it bent easily to its creator's will, and was innately more malleable and controllable than anything else they might use to power their magic, since it never resisted the caster's efforts to shape it. Ambient mana, on the other hand, was both harder to control and toxic to living beings. Not enough to kill a mage just for using it once, but any substantial, prolonged use resulted in sickness and insanity.

there's nothing to need confirming next chapter. all the evidence and arguments are all here
