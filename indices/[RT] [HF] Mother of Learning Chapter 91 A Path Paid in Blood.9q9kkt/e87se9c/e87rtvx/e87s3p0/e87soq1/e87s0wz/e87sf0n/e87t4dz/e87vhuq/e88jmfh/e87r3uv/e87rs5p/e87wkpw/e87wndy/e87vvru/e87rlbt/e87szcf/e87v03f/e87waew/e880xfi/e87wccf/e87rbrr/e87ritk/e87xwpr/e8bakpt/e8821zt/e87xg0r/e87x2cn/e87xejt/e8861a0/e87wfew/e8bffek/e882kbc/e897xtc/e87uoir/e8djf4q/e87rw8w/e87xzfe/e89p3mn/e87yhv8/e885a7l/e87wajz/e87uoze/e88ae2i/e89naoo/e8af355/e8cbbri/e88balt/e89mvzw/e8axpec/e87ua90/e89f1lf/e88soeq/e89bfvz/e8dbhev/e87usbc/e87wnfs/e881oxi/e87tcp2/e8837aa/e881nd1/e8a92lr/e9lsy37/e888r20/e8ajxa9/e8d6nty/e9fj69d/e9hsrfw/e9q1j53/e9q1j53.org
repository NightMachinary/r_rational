that would only work in a true time loop. and thus would not be possible.

​

say you are correct. this Zorian that just took over is going to eventually toss Zach into the loop. say it's day -2 relative to the loop we're familiar with. on day -1, Zorian tosses Zach into loop, which for some reason starts the loop in a simulated timeline that's 1 day ahead, so day 0. then new loop Zorian breaks out. it'll be day -1 at best. where'd Zorian on Day -2 come from? or rather, the day -2 Zorian that the Zorian stole the body from?

​

how would we continue this loop?
