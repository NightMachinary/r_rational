Now Zorian has a timeloop marker outside the (innermost) timeloop.

Remember how the gods have disappeared long ago? I think there are two timeloops; an inner one of a month and an outer one of centuries. Zorian will loop in the outer one now by the authority of his marker.

Next he will mindwipe himself and become QI. I am sure of it. Somebody write a fanfic about this.
