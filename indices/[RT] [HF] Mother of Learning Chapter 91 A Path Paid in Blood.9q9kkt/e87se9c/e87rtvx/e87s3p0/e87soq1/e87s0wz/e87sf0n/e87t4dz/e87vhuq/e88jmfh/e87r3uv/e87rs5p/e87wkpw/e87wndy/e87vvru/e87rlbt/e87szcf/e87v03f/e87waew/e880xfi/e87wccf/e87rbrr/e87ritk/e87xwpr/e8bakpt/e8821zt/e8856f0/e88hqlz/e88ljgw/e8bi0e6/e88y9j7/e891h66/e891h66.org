Maybe. We don't know the exact power level of the angels but if Zorian had been given the 20 extra years of time loops that that zach wasted fighting the Dragon, his power level would be far far higher. He likely would have figured out divine energies, which would vastly increase his base mana pool (Not just double it, since its possible he may have worked out a more powerful or efficient stabilization frame, and or just make himself ten rings that store the same mana as the crown.). Add to the that the extra experience from 20 years of study and combat, and Zorian is already approaching astronomical power levels.

Yet the 60 or so years zach was supposed to get out of the loop is nothing compared to the 1,000 or so years that a fully charged Sovereign gate is supposed to give the controller. A normal mage, let alone a mage like Zorian who has perfect memory, would have an absurd amount of power after a thousand years of learning, practice and growth. Is it enough to Rival the Angels? I think so, but who knows. At the very least, describing them as demigods is a not unreasonable.
