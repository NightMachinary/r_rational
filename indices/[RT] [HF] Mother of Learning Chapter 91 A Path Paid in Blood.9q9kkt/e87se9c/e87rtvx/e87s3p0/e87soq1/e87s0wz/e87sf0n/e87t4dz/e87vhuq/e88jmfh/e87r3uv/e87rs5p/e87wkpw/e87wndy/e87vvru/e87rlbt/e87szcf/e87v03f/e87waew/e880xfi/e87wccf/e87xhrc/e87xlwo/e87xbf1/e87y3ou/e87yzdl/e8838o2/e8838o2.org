If Zorian is going to hide he needs to immediately hide his family as well. If Zorian disappears but his family doesn't that'll be a huge red flag to Zach or Silverlake that he made it out of the time loop. If however Zorian's entire family is missing Zach might assume Red robe or Silverlake killed them all or some other disaster happened.

Zorian would need to do this fast, and the easiest way to do this is to put them all to sleep telepathically and then teleport them somewhere safe. Once his family is safely hidden, then he can plan for the future. An immediate teleport to Silverlake's home to try to save the original would probably be the wisest next move.
