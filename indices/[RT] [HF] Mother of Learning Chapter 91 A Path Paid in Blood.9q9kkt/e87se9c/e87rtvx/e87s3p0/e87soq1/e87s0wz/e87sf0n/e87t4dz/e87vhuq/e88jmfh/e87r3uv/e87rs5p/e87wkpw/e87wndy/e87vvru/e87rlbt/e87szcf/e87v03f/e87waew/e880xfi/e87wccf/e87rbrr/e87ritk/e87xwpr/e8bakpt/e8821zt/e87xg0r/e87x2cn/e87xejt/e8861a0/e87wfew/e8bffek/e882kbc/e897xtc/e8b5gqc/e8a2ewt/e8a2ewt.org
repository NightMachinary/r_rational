LOL, no. Adding others' perspective will dilute the narrative. Sure we get some gratification, but it will be short-lived. I've read enough Jap light novels that didn't practice POV discipline. They turned atrocious after some time. Best the author can do is give approximation of what's other might think, through conversations or guesses.
