At least 3-4 times I'd say. I discovered it around Ch 38, so did a reread after Ch 54 (end of second arc). Then I did another reread around Ch 75 or so. Then I did a reread just because! I think I have a problem haha.

Well, you're not that far off now I hope! It's a really enjoyable reread cuz you see so many things that make sense later. The temple here, the first sight of the bicycle girl, the first understanding of Zach's guardian, the moaning about Daimen etc etc.
