I mean, they all came out at exactly the same time right? The entire time loop happens within seconds at most. So Red Robe coming out years ago, Silverlake weeks, Zorian when he did, Zach potentially months from now at the end of the loops, all happened within seconds of each other. By the time Zorian was casting divination spells everyone was out.
