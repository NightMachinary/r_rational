Doesn't the orb regenerate after each restart? Is the destruction of the orb permanent in future restarts? If not, I'd imagine Zach could spend the next several restarts gathering information, notebooks, blueprints, etc. and piling them in the orb to bring with him.

Didn't they know the orb would be erased of data from a while ago though? The guardian said that anything stored in the orb would be erased once the simulation is terminated.

It will be interesting to see if Zach creates some pocket dimension full of information and brings it through when he comes.
