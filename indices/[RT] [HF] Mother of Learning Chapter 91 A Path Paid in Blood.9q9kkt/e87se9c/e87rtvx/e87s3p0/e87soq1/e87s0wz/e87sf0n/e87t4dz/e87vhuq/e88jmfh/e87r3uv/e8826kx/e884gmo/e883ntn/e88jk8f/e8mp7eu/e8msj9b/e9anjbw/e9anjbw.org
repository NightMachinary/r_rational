Actually, I thought it was going to be two Zorian co-existence given the massive amount of Sudomir exposition we were given. Now it looks like setting up a whole thing without any payoff.

See, Sudomir fused with not one, but 5 souls, including a troll and a dragon. Both species are sentient and sapient. Dragons ARE mages (we know from ZZs flight aboard the stolen ship to Blantyrre; and their fight with one for the last key). Yet, he was still in control.

And Zorian HAD interrogated him extensively about it (he wondered how the hell it even partially worked). So, the experimentation was already done (by Sudomir), and Zorian by this point is powerful enough to replicate it. And since it would involve fusing with his own soul, it won't be an uncontrollable mess.

But still, the rational thing to do was to do the simplest thing, eject his old soul, pass it into afterlife and continue from their. Least complications. But still, it was a massive setup for no payoff (as far as we know of right now).
