I kind of see what he means, even if we do get a few more chapters after this. The final conclusion isn't in much doubt, although the details of it are, there aren't too many mysteries left to solve, Zorian can't meaningfully get any more powerful in the one month before the story has to end compared to the years he spent in the loop, and there just isn't much that the antagonists could surprise him with in the final confrontation. It's not over yet, but we can see the finish line pretty clearly.
