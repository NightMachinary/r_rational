So that could possibly imply that it was never possible to retrieve the memories even if they brought the looping orb out into the real world depending on how memory retrieval was programmed into the simulation world. Implementation of memory retrieval could have been "virtually" implemented (instead of being "physically" implemented in the simulation via simulation world mechanics) and thus the function would not remain if the orb was brought into the real world.
