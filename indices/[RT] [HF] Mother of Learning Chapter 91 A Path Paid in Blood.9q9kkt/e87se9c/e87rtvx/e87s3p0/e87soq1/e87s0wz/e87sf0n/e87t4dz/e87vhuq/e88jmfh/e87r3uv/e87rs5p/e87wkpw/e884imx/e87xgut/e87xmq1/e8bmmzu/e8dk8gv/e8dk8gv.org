  He may also be able to pit looper Silverlake against the original.

That was my first thought, as looper Silverlake would have all of the original's secrets and want her stuff, so there is room for working together there.

The primordial did specify (several times) that he was "Incarnating" those that took his offer, so theoretically that should mean a brand new body, so there would indeed be two Silverlakes. I suppose, however, that it's still possible that the primordial just put the looper soul in the original body. That seems less likely, however.
