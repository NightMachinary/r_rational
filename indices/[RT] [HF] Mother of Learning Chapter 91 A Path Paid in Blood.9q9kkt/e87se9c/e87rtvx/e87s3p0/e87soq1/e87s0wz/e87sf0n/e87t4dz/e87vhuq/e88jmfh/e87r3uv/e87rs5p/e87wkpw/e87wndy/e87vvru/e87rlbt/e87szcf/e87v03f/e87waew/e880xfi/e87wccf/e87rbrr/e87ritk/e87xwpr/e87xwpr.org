Well this was a chapter and a half.

A huge change in the stakes of the story too. One hand, Zorian doesn't have to worry about the impending collapse of the time loop and his soul with, and on the other he's now out of the time loop - no more second chances.

And now he's got to decide who he tells about the time loop he just went through. There are the usual suspects, obviously, but I can't see him being particulalry open about it unless he needs to reel in some assistance and explain his knowledge.

I also want to see how much, if at all, the next month differs from the inside of the time loop, what with the spiritual planes back in working order.

But I bet Zorian's going to enjoy the first day of the next month, assuming he lives that long.
