All right, everybody, place your bets! Will Zorian reveal himself to Zach? Will he take out his potential enemies hard and fast, or will he remain in the shadows until the last possible second? Will he call upon the help of his new/old friends, or is he a solo act all the way to the end? Place your bets now, it's /anybody's/ ballgame!
