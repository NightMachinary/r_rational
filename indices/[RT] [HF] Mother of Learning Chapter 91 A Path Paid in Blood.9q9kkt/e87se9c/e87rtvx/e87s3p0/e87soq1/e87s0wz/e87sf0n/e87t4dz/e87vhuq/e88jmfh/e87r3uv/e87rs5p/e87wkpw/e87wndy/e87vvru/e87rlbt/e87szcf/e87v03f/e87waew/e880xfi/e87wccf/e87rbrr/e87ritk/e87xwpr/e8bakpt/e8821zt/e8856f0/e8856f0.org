Yeah I really wanna see Zorian get a mana upgrade but there's probably not enough time even if he did know how to do it.

His best bet against Zach is gonna be mind magic (hence working a way around mind blank). Hopefully he'll be able to fix whatever compulsions are in there, he'll definitely need his help against QI and Red Robe.
