Possible, but the angels may very well try to kill him once they discover his presence, since he is an uncontrolled entity. One can not just assume the angels are benevolent, since it has been made clear that the gods were not.

It is implied that Zach has been mentally compromised by both the angels and Red Robe. Ignoring Red Robe, when one considers how weak zach was when the time loop started, its very easy to believe the Angels put layers upon layers of compulsions on Zach before sending him in. The sovereign gate's keys were scattered by the angels, and it hadn't been activated for millennia, because if used to its fullest extent it can turn humans mages into practical demigods. The angels wanted a demigod on their side to fight the Primordial, but due to Red Robe, Zach wasted most of his time and became simply a master mage. Regardless, I don't believe for a second that the angels would ever risk a rogue demigod coming out of the Sovereign gate. Zach had to be controlled. Since Zorian maintains his free will, I don't think the Angels will be too happy when they realize there is a time looper not under there control roaming around.
