So Fucking hyped for the next chapter, this one was absolutely incredible.

I don't think we've seen the last of Zach, he almost certainly made it out as well. (From a Literary standpoint, Zach has had far to much screen time and mystery surrounding his forgotten past to die an implied off-screen death.) However, I'm curious as to whether Zach will be an ally once Zorian tries to meet up with him in the real world. The last 13 or so loops would have gone by in a fraction of a real world second, so Zach should have arrived back to reality at nearly the same instant as Zorian. Will the probable mental compulsions placed upon Zach make him Zorian's enemy? Can't wait to see.

I'm also curious on how Zorian plans to handle the situation if that occurs, because most of combat magic was done by Zach. Even though Zorian has combat skills comparable to a skilled Combat Mage, and could probably win against most combat mages (Even Irrespective of his Mind Magic), he is nowhere near the level of master combat mages like Zach or Quatach-Ichl. He just doesn't have the mana. However, If Zorian could somehow replicate the divine energy frame around Quatach-Ichl's soul and double his base mana, that would go a long way to evening the playing field for Zorian. He may not have the time now that he's out of the time loop, but after all that analysis and destruction of the Divine artifacts, Zorian is the only mage even possible of pulling something like that off on his own.

Seeing as how Zach's mana reserves allows him to cast about 250 force bolts, and Quatach-Ichl's mana reserves, with the crown, allows for around 3000 force bolts ( 300 * 10 = 3000), doubling Zorian's mana from around 80 Bolts to 160 would definitely help him bridge his mana gap, while still allowing him to remain an underpowered character compared to his adversaries, having to rely on strategy and preparation to win. I really hope Zorian manages to get a mana power up like this, which I feel he desperately needs to take on Zach, but we will see. The wait is gonna kill me.
