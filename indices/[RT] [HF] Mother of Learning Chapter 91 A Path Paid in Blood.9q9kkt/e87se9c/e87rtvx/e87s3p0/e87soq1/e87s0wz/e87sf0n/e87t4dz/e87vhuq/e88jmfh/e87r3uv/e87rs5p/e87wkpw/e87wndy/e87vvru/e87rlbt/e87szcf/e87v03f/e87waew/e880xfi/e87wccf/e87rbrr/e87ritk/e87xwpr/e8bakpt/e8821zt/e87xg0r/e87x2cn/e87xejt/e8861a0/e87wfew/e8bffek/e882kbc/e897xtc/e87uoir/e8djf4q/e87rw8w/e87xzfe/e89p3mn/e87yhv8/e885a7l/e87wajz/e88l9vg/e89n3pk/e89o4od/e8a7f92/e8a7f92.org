Now after I think it again, Zorian don't want deep into necromantic (do not enslave the dead, or curse people) but he already half way there because he can cast simulacrum, use soul projection, and body possession, it's his morality and that stop him to become necromancer. From blood magic Zorian only use enchantment ritual and life force as powering magic, he never use it to summon demon. With knowledge from Sudomir and blood magic books he know how to become necromancer and demon summoner but still no, his moral against it, that's why he don't want to learn those thing.

Other disicplines, I mean master is he already too proficient to use them and overshadow many people, Zorian divination is too good because mind magic aid divination, with mind enchantment and custom built divination compass his divinination will upgrade. Yes low mana pool hold back Zorian, still with it Zorian can be lot faster at mana shaping exercise, tinker with magitek(spell formulae & artifice), and he have to creative when to defeat enemy more powerful than him 'in term of mana".

I like " Hydra Mind" title, but think it fit to be crest or heraldy of Zorian house if he intent to rise into Noble House.

What do you think when angels know Zorian also time looper, wil they grant Divine Blessing to him?
