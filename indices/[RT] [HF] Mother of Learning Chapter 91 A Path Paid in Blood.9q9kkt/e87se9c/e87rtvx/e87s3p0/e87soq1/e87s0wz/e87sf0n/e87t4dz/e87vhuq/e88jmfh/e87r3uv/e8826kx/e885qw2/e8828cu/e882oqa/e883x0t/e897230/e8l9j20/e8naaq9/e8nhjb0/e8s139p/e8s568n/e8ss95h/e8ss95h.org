the divine construct, the thing providing QI with doubled mana reserves?

QI's "body" is manmade and non-living, thus any mana stored in it wouldn't be able to hold its affinity. even if it was able to somehow able to store his mana, would each of his temporary bodies need to store his capacity in mana? or just one main body which channels it to wherever he currently is? how easily screwed is he with a ward then?

also remember only the Controller's soul is brought into the loop and only he may leave since only he has a target body to return to. if the body is what stores the mana, what is the point of that if it'll just render his whole progress moot?
