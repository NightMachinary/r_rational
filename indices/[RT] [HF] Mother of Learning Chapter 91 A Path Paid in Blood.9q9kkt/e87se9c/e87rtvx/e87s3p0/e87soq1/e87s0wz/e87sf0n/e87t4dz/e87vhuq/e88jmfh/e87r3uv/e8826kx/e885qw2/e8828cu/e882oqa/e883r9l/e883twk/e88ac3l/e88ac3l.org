The gate should have been unbarred at all times as soon as Zach entered the Sovereign Gate simulation. The fact that the gate got barred and had to be unbarred let the Simulation know there was a problem. Unbarring the gate automatically caused the whole Simulation to do a full analysis of itself to determine where the mistakes in its programming occured. During this analysis it identified Zorian as one of its many anomalies, so marked him, and all other anomalies, for removal during the next reset.
