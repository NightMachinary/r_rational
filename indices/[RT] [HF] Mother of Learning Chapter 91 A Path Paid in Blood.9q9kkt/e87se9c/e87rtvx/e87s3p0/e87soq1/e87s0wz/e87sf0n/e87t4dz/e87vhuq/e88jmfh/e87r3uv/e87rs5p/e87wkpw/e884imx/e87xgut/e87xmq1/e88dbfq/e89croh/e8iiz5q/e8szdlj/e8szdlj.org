We're talking a matter of hours at most though. Presumably the restart begins at 12:02, one month exactly before the restart ends. So maybe 6/7 hours max she has had to walk around?

She knows Zach will make it out, so that's probably her #1 priority if she starts going after somebody. She will also probably join up with Red Robe and Quatach-Ichl to release the primordial.

This will be an interesting restart for sure.
