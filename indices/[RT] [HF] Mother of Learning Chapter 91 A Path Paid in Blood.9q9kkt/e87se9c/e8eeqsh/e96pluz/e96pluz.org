Honestly, I'm really hoping that this *doesn't* happen, and the final loop mirrors the earliest loops by being a tense affair with every party unsure which other parties might be there and having to nudge things while laying low instead of just being an all-out brawl. It'd be really neat to revisit things like Taiven's mission and the Aranea, and have the final sequence rely on knowledge of the month ahead instead of just being about raw power.
