There may be a few reasons Zach won't appear. Zach is the only one that can leave the loop for sure, so he might get targeted first. Zach might not even suspect that Zorian escaped, his body was left behind and looks pretty dead. Zach might not even be on Zorian's side anymore, his mind wipe and lack of examination might allow for some contingency to trigger when he escapes from the loop.
