Lol no I don't! But I've reread this story a few times too many :D I just remembered it right away as soon as QI mentioned it, and I knew this plot point was mentioned before - at some point after Zorian comes back to Cyoria and looks at the invasion plan after Red Robe stopped helping them out. So it was easy to track down (ctrl f, temple, in chapter 38,39,40 and boom).
