Also, yet another question from the past answered!

Ch 40

=Bizarrely, every single temple in the city was the target of at least one flare â€“ Zorian had no idea what the invaders were trying to accomplish there, and it definitely wasn't something they did in their previous invasion plan.=

Ch 91

=I(QI) ordered all the temples razed to the ground at the very beginning of the invasion, but I fear it may not be enough=
