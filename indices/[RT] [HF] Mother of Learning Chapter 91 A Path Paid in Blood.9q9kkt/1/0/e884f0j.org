Loved the character stuff with Damien. Him being an actually decent guy was a great way of showing Zorians character growth.

The old Zorian was convinced, making us convinced, that Damien was this really shitty dude (don't get my wrong he had his asshole moments). Seeing Damien be useful and even making the ultimate sacrifice shows how far Zorian has come as a character since pre-loop.

All up some fantastic character development for both of them
