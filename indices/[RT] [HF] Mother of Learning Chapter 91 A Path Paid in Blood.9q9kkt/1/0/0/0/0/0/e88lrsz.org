i disagree. i believe all the people who were willing to sacrifice themselves know that because zorian has spent the most time in the loop other than zach, zorian is the best shot of preventing the invasion and release of the primordial outside of the loop. if any of the 6 month loopers managed to escape without zorian, how much could they do in comparison? maybe xvim could come close the impact that zorian would have but even that is dubious.
