True, Xvim and Daimen were not the only ones. Still, I find it hard to believe that everyone would unselfishly give up their own chances at freedom for Zorian... unless there's something only Zorian can do.

This line from Daimen particularly intrigued me:

“It's fine if I die, but you have to live. Don't let it all be in vain. It can't!”

Suggests to me that Zorian is somehow significantly more important than the other time travellers, and not just because he's spent a longer time in the loop.
