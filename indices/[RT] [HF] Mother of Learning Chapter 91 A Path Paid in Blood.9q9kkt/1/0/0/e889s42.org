Did anyone find that both Daimen and Xvim sacrificing themselves to get Zorian out was too much of a coincidence? They were both mentioned as being in on Zorian's plan to get past Zach's mind blank.

My theory is that they got past Zach's defences and found out something really important to stopping Panaxeth. That's why they were both so determined to get Zorian out of the loop, even at the cost of their own lives. That information is probably something related to the angels which has been so heavily foreshadowed in recent chapters.
