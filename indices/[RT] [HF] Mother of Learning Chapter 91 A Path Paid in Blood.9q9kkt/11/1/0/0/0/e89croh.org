Zorian was in soul form when he rejoined the normal timeline. He had to find his way home and then take control of his original body. Even Zorian doesn't know how long this took other than that it is still early morning. On the other hand, Looper Silverlake would have been in her body immediately and able to act immediately.

Granted, Zorian did have a little over five months to plan for what he would do to deal with her. He has vastly less resources and allies that made it through the gate than would have been ideal though. Silverlake had just made her deal with Pan just a few minutes before (relative to her) so will have to adjust her plans on the fly.
