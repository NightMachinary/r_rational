top priorities:

1. stash his family somewhere safe so Zach and/or Silverlake can't do anything to them
2. a ton depends on what he pulled from Zach. It could completely blow this list up (yes, I'm positive he already took a peek even though it wasn't explicitly mentioned)
3. stop Silverlake before she does something nasty (hold Kirielle hostage, start teleporting around assassinating people, etc)
4. kill the brain rats
5. recruit/protect the Aranae asap
6. recruit Xvim
7. save Alaric and friends
8. track down Zach's 'friend' who was soul-killed
