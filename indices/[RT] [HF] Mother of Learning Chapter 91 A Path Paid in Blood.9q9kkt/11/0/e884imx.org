Thinking about it, Zorian can afford putting the death of cranium rats lower on the priority list. The only people with sensitive information at the moment are the four loopers who got out (including Zach), and all of them are either capable of mental shields or is about to contact the invaders anyway (Red Robe), so it'd just tip Zorian's hand for dubious gains.

And maybe it's not so much a priority list Zorian needs than to split out simulcrums and just do all of them at once (though admittedly three is his max without golem bodies). Any one of the objectives on the list failing lowers the chance of a counterattack succeeding (except for number 8, maybe).
