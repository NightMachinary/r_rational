The same reason why people are worried about what Panaxeth said to Zorian: "be wary of Zach". The angels might not be so happy about a stowaway that exited the Sovereign Gate. People fear that Zach has a compulsion to remove mistakes caused by the Sovereign Gate. Contacting the angels will only make more people aware of this mistake.

They could potentially recruit him for his help and then stab him in the back after the ordeal is finished. The gods were never portrayed as solely benevolent beings.
