Now that I have calmed down a bit. Some really interesting new bits of information in this chapter. Ichl's faith that the angels will take down the primordial is pretty interesting. Depending on the success of his research, Zorian might be able to outright beat mind blank (without dispell? was that possible before?).

If he immediately seeks out Zach, will he be out? cause not only is zorian out, at least 10 seconds has passed since then, so Zach should have ran out his last few loops, I wonder if he got out?
