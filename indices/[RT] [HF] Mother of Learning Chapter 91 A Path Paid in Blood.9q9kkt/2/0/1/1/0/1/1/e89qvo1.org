I'd be worried about both the Orb and the Staff, both are very far away and only really accessible by either Zorian spending simulacrums to travel to both places and open a portal, or them convincing the spiders to open a gate, and I'm not sure Zach even bothered to learn that information or can convince them as well as Zorian did.
