They gave the crown back subjective months ago, before QI started helping them. And since the orb was destroyed to make the bridge, Zach doesn't have the full Key any more until he resets the loop.

It's still possible that Zorian's exit did not re-bar the Gate, in which case Zach can just walk out, or it's possible that he'd have to retrieve the whole Key again, which would be quite difficult for him to do (no mind magic and no temporary loopers).
