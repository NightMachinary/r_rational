Well, true. But we haven't followed Zach ever so I don't think we'll start now. I imagine some complications might be present but meh. There's a lot of drama in the pipeline (Silverlake, Red Robe, actual life and death dangers, demons, Tesen Zveri, and then just a million plot points). This particular exit situation seems to be rather straightforward.
