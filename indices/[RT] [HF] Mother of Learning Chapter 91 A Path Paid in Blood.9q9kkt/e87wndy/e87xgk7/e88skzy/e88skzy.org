There isn't much to suggest anything could have prevented Zach from getting out. He still has a number of restarts to attempt it, and the gate is unbarred. He should have no trouble.

From a meta perspective, it would rob us from a resolution to the questions we have about his motivations/mind wipe, or even if Zorian got those answers in the last restart, it lessen the impact because of Zach didn't get out, who really /cares/ if he was actually not an ally,
