Here's something to think about: What's the time differential between inside the simulation and outside?

We know of at least two individuals who have left the simulation previously, Red Robe and Silverlake. Red Robe got out a lot of restarts ago; Silverlake just got out. Red Robe could have had a lot of time to prepare, outside, depending.

If it's even one day outside for every restart... how many total restarts have there been? How many were there before Zorian got pulled in? Certainly more than 30...

We won't know for sure until the next update. I await with bated breath.
