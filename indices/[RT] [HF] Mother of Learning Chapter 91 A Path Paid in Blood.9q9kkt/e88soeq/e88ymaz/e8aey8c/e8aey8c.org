I actually doubt that Silverlake could overpower her double easily. Zorian became an expert at soul magic inside the loop. That means to him it was easy to possess his own body. Silverlake was not long enough in the loop and she was also already an expert at soul magic. If we assume that the soul that owns a body has a slight advantage both souls power level should be nearly identiacal.
