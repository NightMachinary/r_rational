Did we ever find out who Red Robe is?

Do Red Robe and Silverlake know enough about Zorian to attack him in his home? Do they know enough about artifacts, treasure, and allies Zorian needs to get there first? Will they ally with each other? Will either of them bring Quatach-Ichl up to date?

What has Zach been up to in his remaining loops? How much preparation can he do without Zorian? Does he know Zorian made it?

Do our heros have a good plan for after the loops, considering (1) what they learned in the last loop when they met Panaxeth and (2) only Zorian got out?
