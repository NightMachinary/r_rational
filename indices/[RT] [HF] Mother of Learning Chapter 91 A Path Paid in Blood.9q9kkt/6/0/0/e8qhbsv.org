Hell naw! If the end of this story is rushed in a few chapters everyone except you and a few others will hate It and regret reading everything for such a short and rushed ending. We have so many characters and sub plots that need to be adressed once out of the time loop that not even 90 more chapters are enough. Maybe 15 or 20 chapters more till the end would make sense rather than a couple...
