Two weeks waiting is worth it, this new chapter is awesome . Angels are like parents who planned for a child, instead just one they got two, curious what will hapen when they know about Zorian existance. Also who thought our Lich QI is like damn priest because he have qualities like sense of honor, fair, and now faith in angels. Z&Z plan are successed but also failure, still I was glad Zorian can get out of time loop.

Now beside his archmage title he deserved, hereby I give Zorian title Warlock for mastery over mind magic, soul magic, and blood magic.

All those sacrifice by temporary loopers (and original Zorian)\\
Press F for respect *salute*
