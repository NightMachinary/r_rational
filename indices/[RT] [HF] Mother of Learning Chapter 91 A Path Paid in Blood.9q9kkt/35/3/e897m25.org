Yeah, like even though it's been years since RR left, in the real world only seconds have passed. I hope Zorian remains cognizant of this because he really needs to get a fucking move on like right now. First priority is grab all his friends and family and deliver them to the Taramantula estate ASAP. Daimen's wife's family seem powerful enough to protect them.
