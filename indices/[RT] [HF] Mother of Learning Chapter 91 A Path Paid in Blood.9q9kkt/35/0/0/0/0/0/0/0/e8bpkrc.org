Fair enough. On that note, I have one final suggestion, for you to put into your no-doubt voluminous list of notes.

There are many aspects to the world that you chose not to explore during the time loop, but one particular aspect was sorely missed. The Dungeon's true depths. I'd love to see an exploration into the serious, deep-deep-deep reaches of whatever is in the underworld. That particular aspect of your worldbuilding - a worldspanning, ever-more-alien, and inconceivably deep and dangerous and populated dungeon - is basically entirely original, as far as I know. I wish one of the Imperial Artifacts had been down there, so we could have seen Zach and Zorian explore the dark depths that even archmages fear to tred.
