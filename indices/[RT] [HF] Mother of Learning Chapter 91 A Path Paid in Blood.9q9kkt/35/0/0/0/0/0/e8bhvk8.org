Just so that you're aware, I'd be eager to continue to read about Zorian's adventures after this final month is over. He could be doing anything, whether it's just going through school and winning tournaments and getting a girlfriend, or rising to prominence in Dungeon exploration or the military or magical research or... anything, really. I'm sure that many think similarly. Zorian's adventures as he goes through life with all of the knowledge and power he's gained - it would be great fun to read, and I'd definitely buy it on Kindle in a heartbeat if it was offered there.
