Silmarillion is the ur-example of writing wordbuilding for worldbuilding sake. Story to tie everything together is scarce over there. I see that you suggested author to do something similar to Silmarillion. While I remember MOL is an exercise in worldbuilding, I don't remember author want to disregard story in the process.

Also, there's this advice from writer somewhere I don't remember. It's a good advice that I am keen to heed it. I paraphrased,

#+begin_quote
  You can build your world as detailed as you'd like, but don't put it in its entirety in your book. Think of them as a solid support for your plots and characters. On the process of consuming the story, there will be 10% of readers who are curious about your world. They're the one you should share your passion with. Not the rest of your reader.

I'm not MOL author, but as he had set up separate space strictly for world building, it may seems that he shared the sentiment.
