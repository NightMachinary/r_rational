I definitely agree. Or even anything along these lines.

My preferred fantasy method is always to merge with myself.

That said, who knows if merging would actually cause him to regress some as a 50/50 merge, instead of throwing out the bad and keeping the good.

I also wonder how "real" his soul is. Is there anything explicitly bad about killing the original, or are they actually (formerly) identical.

Going along the idea that his start may have been an Angel's intervention, they may have intended what happened.

I'm also sad that his mind/soul didn't have more storage space. Or better compression algorithms. I can't remember if he made a spell that stored an image of what was written, instead of a high detail copy. That would probably have been a worthwhile investment.
