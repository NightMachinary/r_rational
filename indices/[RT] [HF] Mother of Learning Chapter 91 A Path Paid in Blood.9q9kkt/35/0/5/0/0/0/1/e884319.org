Compression would be great, but he'd be limited by what is humanly possible in the realm of calculations. I can see it happening in the future if he modifies his mind to perform specific intensive calculations to compress/decompress data, but at this point it seems impossible.

Taken from another one of my posts in this thread because it is relevant to the memories:

  Hopefully and rationally, it would make sense to cram the most important details of the data stored within the orb inside Zorian's mind. Ikosian magic seems to follow some structure and is governed by rules (and it seems spell formulae to the extent that it resembles electrical engineering in my eyes). If he stores the key findings of the research, not all is lost as presumably this will allow one to derive the rest of the research with time in a world where magic is less "magical" and more like a physical property of the world, e.g. electromagnetism.
