Zach might, if he doesn't exit the loop the normal way and have to wait to wake up.

We don't know what he was able to keep, though. The Orb was cracking and might have been destroyed, along with all the memories it contained. Zach can't remember nearly as much as Zorian. All of the temporary loopers are dead, and can't start looping again for another six restarts.

Zach should be able to get back out, being the Controller, but it may be impossible to do the same for anyone else. The knowledge of how to do so may be gone for good.
