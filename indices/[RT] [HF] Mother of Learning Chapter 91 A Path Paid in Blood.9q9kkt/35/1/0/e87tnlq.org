I don't think the Orb being destroyed would destroy the memories. Remember it's recreated from the template each time as well. I bet the memories are actually stored in the gate and just recreated with the Orb each time.

They were frustrated about not having the Orb because they would have to leave it behind while serving as a door, not because it would be destroyed.
