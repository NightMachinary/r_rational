Anyone else think that Zorian should have taken some time to grieve his dead allies? He spent a year and a half with them, and they all sacrificed themselves for him at the end. He probably won't be able to cultivate the same relationships with them in the real world, since he obviously can't prove that they're in a looping world any more. Xvim has been his mentor for the better part of a decade, and he won't be able to have that relationship with him again. Kael and Taiven lost a substantial part of their lives by not making it out, and they can't recreate the life changing events that happened to them in the loop.

Well, at least Spear of Resolve and Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty are alive again. We haven't seen them in the story in ages.
