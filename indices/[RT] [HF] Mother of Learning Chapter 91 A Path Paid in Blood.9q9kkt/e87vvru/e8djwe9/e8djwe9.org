I don't think that there will be too much of a concern with proving the loop, he's only really lost a couple items of proof:

1. They won't be cut off from the spiritual world, which was a pretty big factor for at least Xvim.
2. The Primordial cage won't be changed, although that only mattered to Silverlake, so it basically doesn't matter.
3. The loss of the orb will lose Zorian a lot of research materials and other resources they may have stashed away.

However, they knew they were going to lose the orb anyways, and they always have a couple contingencies. At the very least Zorian will still have all the notes (that he altered on to empty notebooks) that Zack and Zorian used to convince Alanic, Xvim, Kael, etc before they were given temporary marks. It seems likely that Zorian will have specifically updated those notebooks, as well as expanded them to most, if not all, of the people they gave temporary markers.

This won't be as useful (for example someone like Taiven isn't going to have some sort of cryptokey generation prepared for such an event like Xvim and one of the spider colonies did), but it should be doable.

I feel like the big question is "how soon can Silverlake convince Red Mage, and then perhaps Xuat Lichl." It could turn in to a race between the baddies assassinating the team members versus the good guys warning and helping them.

The good news with that is that I doubt Silverlake will go and try to do murdering by herself, certainly she'd be leery of fighting Alanic and Xvim, even with surprise--that's why I think she'll go to Red Robe first. From there, however, Silverlake and Red Robe may team up to start killing people while a RR simulacrum convinces the Lich to support against the stronger members.
