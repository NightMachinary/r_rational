I don't think it was explicitly stated that Zach gained soul sight independent from the Ring's ability. So it could be that Zach has no idea that Zorian made it out, the Guardian could stonewall Zach as it is apt to do.

Just think of how amazing it would have been if we switched to Zach's PoV in the final fight, and seen Zorian take a bone bolt through the spine right before reaching the exit... Then having no idea whether or not Zorian succeeded. God damn that would have been powerful.
