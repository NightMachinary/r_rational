Only after re-reading is it sinking in just how exquisitely screwed Zorian's band was in that fight. Quatach (and his invasion army), the Controller, and Panaxeth were /all/ attacking them at the same time! Unbelievable. Gives some perspective on how screwed Zorian was by the end; so many of the things he wanted to bring over from the time loop, allies, friends, items and resources, his physical body.... none of it happened.
