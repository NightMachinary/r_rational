diving blessing. my bad. either way, it affects the soul, not the body

Chapter 81:

  "In very general terms," the ancient lich said. "It's a sort of stabilization frame made out of divine energy, encircling the soul.

with regards to banishing him

#+begin_quote
  Isn't disrupting his mana how they get his body to collapse and he returns to his phylactery?
#+end_quote

no. it's because of safeguards in place when his soul is tampered with.

Chapter 80:

#+begin_quote
  "Because it wasn't Kael's little spell that exiled the lich's soul back to his phylactery," Silverlake said. "It was his own soul defenses that did that. You may think that being vulnerable to a cheap trick like this is a weakness, but imagine for a moment what would happen if that coin the brat used was a fancy soul jar or the like." "His soul would get captured and his phylactery would be useless," Xvim said. "I see. So liches like him make their defenses incredibly sensitive, so that even the slightest soul disturbance causes their souls to snap back to their phylactery."

with regards to controller

#+begin_quote
  The controller keeps the loop body as he's the only one who entered with consent.
#+end_quote

then there was no reason to rip it out of the original body

Chapter 55:

#+begin_quote
  "Because only the Controller has their real soul pulled into the time loop," the Guardian said. "Everyone else is a copy. For a Controller of the loop to leave, I only have to re-anchor their soul back to their original body. For one of the copies to enter the real world, I would have to switch their soul with the soul of the original. This would effectively kill the original."
