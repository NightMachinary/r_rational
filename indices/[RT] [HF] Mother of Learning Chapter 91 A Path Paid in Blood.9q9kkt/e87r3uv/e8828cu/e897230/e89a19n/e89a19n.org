I'm under the impression that Qatach is evil because he's launching this invasion on Cyoria... Why exactly? What's his rationale? Just seems like unprovoked greed for conquest to me. And even by geopolitical standards, backstabbing Zach and Zorian seemed especially cold-blooded. It's not like their apparent ambitions would have interfered with his.

As for physical items.... I'm under the impression that Zorian's plan A was to bring his physical body through? So why not bring divine artifacts through? Yeah, he can retrieve the real world ones... But it would be nice to have two of them. Duplicates.
