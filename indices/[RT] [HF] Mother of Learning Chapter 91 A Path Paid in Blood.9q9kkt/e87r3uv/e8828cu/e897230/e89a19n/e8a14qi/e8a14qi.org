Ah..., seems like some bits of info goes over your head. No worry, only people who discuss each chapter caught everything. Average readers got a pass. Moreover, CaptainMcSmash gave you a review.

As addendum to his comment, don't forget that what's decided to brought out the loop (and what's not) is not detailed. It's author style, really. For all we know, Zorian may pack things to the brim. But plot has him killed just before the escape, so describing everything physical won't gave much payoff. It's reasonable for author to leave the detail out.
