Hopefully and rationally, it would make sense to cram the most important details of the data stored within the orb inside Zorian's mind. Ikosian magic seems to follow some structure and is governed by rules (and it seems spell formulae to the extent that it resembles electrical engineering in my eyes). If he stores the key findings of the research, not all is lost as presumably this will allow one to derive the rest of the research with time in a world where magic is less "magical" and more like a physical property of the world, e.g. electromagnetism.

Of course there is a massive data loss but with enough people he recruits, some is still salvageable with time. Frankly, I'm not convinced all of the research would have even been necessary for his immediate and pressing goal.

Edit: Just thought of another scenario that /could have/ potentially circumvented the orb's precious contents being destroyed if they had managed to exit physically. Zorian could have simply stored packets of information in enough small animals which he could have brought out with him had the physical exit plan worked. Similar to how the Cyorian aranea stored memory packets in their male counterparts.
