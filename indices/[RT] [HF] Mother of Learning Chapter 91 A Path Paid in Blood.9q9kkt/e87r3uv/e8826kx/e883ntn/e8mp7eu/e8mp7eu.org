It IS possible for two souls to cohabit a body. We know this. Zorian ALSO knows that. What he doesn't know is how to exactly do that without primordial blood (or essence).

See, shifters (Rania, cat shifters, et al) ARE two souls one body. And Zorian spent time figuring this out. And it is stated out openly: Even if the ritual is known, it is insanely hard to start a new shifter clan. One, because you NEED primordial blood for that; secondly, even if you got that somehow (killing shifter kids is one way), maintaining the balance in the second generation is a massive problem. That is why only Pigeon shifters have been the only new group.
