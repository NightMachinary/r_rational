Not all dragons are mages - there was a worldbuilding post about that, and I think it was at least implied, in-story, that there's a distinction between dragons and dragon mages.

Other than that...I do feel you were projecting a whole lot of your expectations into that setup. It's not really clear whether Zorian manipulating his original's soul will give him any more control in a fusion ritual than Sudomir had. It's unknown if there were any clues at all in Sudomir's experimentation that would let the secondary souls retain sapience. And it definitely doesn't seem to me like Zorian is the kind of person to perform a probably- irreversible soul magic on bystanders, without them actually requesting it (even if in this case the other party is his original self).

Zorian only interrogated Sudomir as much as he did to increase his soul magic expertise, not for any particulat goal.
