That's a bit of a comparison between apples and oranges, I think. I was pointing out that Zorian-prime's soul wasn't knowingly cast into nothing, but rather knowingly into the afterlife, two actions which make wildly different interpretations of Zorian's current character. Whether being relegated to a makeshift life is better than heaven is debatable either way but doesn't affect the original distinction I was making.

(Lore has it that the soul records a person's life so they can be judged once passed, though it doesn't say what happens after that. Quatach-Ichl and other characters' desire to live forever isn't necessarily a comment on the afterlife being worse than life, just that they fear the unknown, maybe. That, and the fact they probably would fall on the Hell side of things when their souls are being judged.)
