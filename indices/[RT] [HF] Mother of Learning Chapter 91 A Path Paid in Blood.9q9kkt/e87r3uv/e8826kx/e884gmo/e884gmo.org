Speaking of souls, there seems to be a minor plothole. IIRC "coming back to life" is a painful crippling experience.

#+begin_quote
  After going through Alanic's new soul awareness training a couple of times, Zorian could finally say with certainty that coming back to life was worse than dying. Having Alanic rip his soul out of his body hurt like hell, but only for a moment.

His ability to remain calm and think about whether or not to snuff out real world Zorian for 5 minutes seems to suggest he is not suffering the pain of "coming back to life". The pain supposedly lasts for a few hours so it is in general not overly detrimental, but it should have definitely affected his demeanor upon his successful contest over the ownership of "his" body.
