It was mentioned in this chapter and was a really big reveal in the previous one. Not sure how you even followed this chapter without ever realizing that, must have made it really confusing haha. Here is the mention in this chapter, it is right at the beginning: "They had informed the whole group about their second encounter with Panaxeth and what it meant for Zorian. Strangely, the group took another bout of bad news in stride. In fact, the knowledge that Zorian now shared fates with them seemed to significantly improve the mood of the group."
