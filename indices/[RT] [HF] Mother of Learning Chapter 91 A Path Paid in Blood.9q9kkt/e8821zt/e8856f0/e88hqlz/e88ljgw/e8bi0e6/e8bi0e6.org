  The sovereign gate's keys were scattered by the angels

As far as I know, this is never stated. Where are you getting that? As far as I know, the keys were lost due to the normal passage of time combined with the collapse of the Ikosian empire.

  The angels wanted a demigod on their side to fight the Primordial
#+end_quote

We don't know that. For all we know the angels actually just want Zach to stop the primordial from ever being released.

  Zach had to be controlled.
#+end_quote

There's no evidence that Zach "had to be controlled". In fact, the only evidence of compulsions so far point to someone trying to stop Zach from achieving his goals.
