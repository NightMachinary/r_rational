I reckon Zorian hasn't checked his memories yet. From what we've seen Zorian is a better mind mage than QI and Red Robe and has already been capable of getting rid of mind compulsions put on other people, if he saw Zach was compromised he'd probably be able to fix it.

Were definitely gonna see him check soon though.
