Okay I definitely wasn't expecting the exit to happen this chapter but I am so happy it did - I was on the edge of my seat for much of the chapter. Very curious what Zorian found in Zach's mind, and what he'll be doing to fiddle with the loop. Also, how will things be different now that he's in the real world?

...will we see a return of the Cyorian Aranea? I totally haven't been hoping for that ever since they started messing with markers...

I think it'll be a while, but one thing I look forward to is more character interaction time. We haven't really had much of any for the past arc as the crunch to escape the loop has gotten more and more intense, and I doubt we'll see much for a while as Zorian will have to work against Silverlake (maybe) and with the time loop (probably). I just remember that some of the reasons I fell in love with this story were Zorian exploring the world, learning magic, getting to know and interact with his classmates and friends, etc. The last arc had been really devoid of that type of character development, and that may have been unavoidable just because of the plot structure, but I still miss it.

How legitimate do people think QI's faith in the angels is? And if he is right to regard them as he does, how does that change things with Silverlake? Might she be of the same opinion, and part of why she was so willing to take Panaxeth's deal was she doubted it mattered? I forget the exact terms of the deal, so it might be that Panaxeth forces her to work against the angels... If she isn't forced to, and QI is right about their capabilities (assuming such capabilities go beyond Z&Z), and Silverlake is unaware of that, did she just become a much smaller problem to deal with?
