Of course there's no direct evidence stating Zach had to be controlled by the angels. However, just logically, it'd be in the angels very good interest to mind control Zach, because as I stated, the time loop allows for absurd power ups in mages if properly utilized. We know it's very likely he's under a mind control spell in some way, and its implied in chapter 90 that both the Angels and Red Robe put compulsions on his mind. If the angels did in fact put a compulsion on Zach's mind, it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to figure out their reasoning for it.

The compulsion that Red Robe placed on Zach made him not achieve his goals, and this is what we have direct evidence for, but since it is implied the angels could have done stuff as well, it is probable that there are still mind compulsions placed on Zach by the Angels.

As for the keyes, I may have misremembered that fact, so I will concede to your counterpoint as I'm not gonna search 40 chapters to try to find the text. I still think my original hypothesis stands, that Zach is under the Angel's control, but this is after all just theorizing at the end of the day.
