That's an interesting question. We never know if Zach woke up right away in the restarts - we just know that the one time Red Robe attacked at the very beginning, Zach was sleepy and in his underwear. So - I don't think he'd necessarily be awake. I'm sure Zorian can just power through the Noveda wards though and wake him up :D
