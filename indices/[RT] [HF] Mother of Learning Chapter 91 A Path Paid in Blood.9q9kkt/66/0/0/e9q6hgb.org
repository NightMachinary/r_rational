It said that zorian arrived before the one month before the release. And I think I vaguely remember something mentioned about the time loop being activated before the one month mark, just imitating the conditions of the one month before. But admittedly there's a problem with time in this hypothesis, since the time in pocket dimensions runs in the same direction as the outside world. But it would explain why zorian is the most important person to get out. Anyway. It was not the case.
