Hypothesis. Since this starts before the one month mark maybe Zorian is the one who enters Zach into the timeloop to begin with? And messes with his mind so he doesn't remember, so as to recreate the exact situation in the timeloop ending in his own release (an then Zach's). Maybe that's what he saw in Zach's mind, his own handiwork. He is the one who's good in soul and mind magic.
