I think the bigger impact is the information he retains, not the amount of time he spent in the loop (though those are tied together but not mutually exclusive in a hypothetical situation). That is the real reason he is the most important besides Zach. Even if he only retained his improvements in mind magic, he would still be the most important. The information he has is vital for convincing key allies, and has strategic information on how to counter the invaders.

Even if you had briefed any of the 6+ month loopers (time dilation chambers) it would be simply impossible for any of them to retain and retrieve the amount of information Zorian can hold.
