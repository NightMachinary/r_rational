They aren't completely sacrificing themselves though. Only the last year of their time in the loop. They most likely still packed Zorians head with their notes. Think of how valuable that will be when they get out. Locations to all 5 artifacts, dimension and time magic details, contacts, black room research. There is so much value that they will get once Zorian brings them up to speed in the real world. They probably saw there would be no way for ANY of them to escape, so at least they can use Zorian as a way to get their real selves educated faster and help with the invasion.
