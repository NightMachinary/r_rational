Are you sure those weren't just divine artifacts that they amassed? I recall Z&Z tinkering/dismantling with divine artifacts but not the Imperial Artifacts specifically. I could also be wholly wrong.

If they are replicas, there's still a chance that the memories are salvageable. If they are replicas, that means the Sovereign Gate itself stores the memories and not the orb. What could potentially happen is that the gate is programmed to eject all the memories into the real life orb upon completion of the final iteration. This would be helpful for the Gate's main use which is to prepare the Controller for whatever aims the gods have for him/her.
