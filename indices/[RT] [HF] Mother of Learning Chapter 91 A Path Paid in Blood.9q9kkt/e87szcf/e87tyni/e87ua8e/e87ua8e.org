Loopers first, prioritizing Silverlake. Red Robe is dangerous, sure, but he believes that he trapped Zach in the loop. Silverlake should be pretty certain that Zach at least is able to get out, and possibly more people, plus the fact that she compensates for her lackluster combat with traps that need time to prepare... Silverlake is priority number one by a large margin.
