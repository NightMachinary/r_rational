True, loopers first, if it's possible. But I think it's only possible to cripple their resources as the other loopers were probably only ejected only seconds away from when Zorian was ejected. They also are presumably on the move and 5 minutes has already elapsed along with however much time it took Zorian to conjure ghostly hands, divine for his body, and teleport to it.

So...

1. Cripple loopers.
2. Cripple low hanging Cultists/Ibasans
3. Convince potential allies
4. Recruit angelic help (spiritual realm contact is probably restored but it's potentially a double edged sword)
