- Zach has no reason to use the Gate on the next loop, right? In theory, there's no harm in using up the rest of the available loops (30ish?) now that he doesn't have to worry about Zorian.

- ...Does Zach know Zorian survived? He has soul-sight, but if he wasn't using it at that moment, he just watched Zorian get pulped right before the bridge.

- I really hope Kael's research notes survive somehow (Zorian kept a backup copy in his brain?) I don't think we ever saw that final results of all his work.
