I think being dead is also a requirement, as a lich is generally considered to be undead.

Whether Zorian would be considered "dead" is a good question. After all, his original body doesn't exist anymore. But then, his /original/ body has been dead for years, ever since QI first cast that spell on him and Zach.

My /guess/ would be, even if he had a phylactery, that people wouldn't think of him as a lich for the same reason people don't think of a platypus as a mammal: he might meet all the criteria, but /that's just not what those look like/. But for that kind of technical hair splitting, I think you have to ask the author.
