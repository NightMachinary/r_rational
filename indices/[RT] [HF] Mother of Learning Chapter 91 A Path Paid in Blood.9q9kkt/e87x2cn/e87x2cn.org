Him having to function as a pure soul entity is what happened after all, not quite the way I thought it would, but yeah. I wonder how much his mind magic improved while in the time dilated orb and wish there'd been more about what happened within it in general. Still amazing chapter overall, very exciting, we're finally at the last stretch.

The fact that we never learned what was within Zach mind means that he'll make it, also that he won't be on Zorian side.
