It seems good so far, though I feel like the summary spoiled something... rather major.

Meanwhile, I'm hoping that she does join the Wards, rather than join the Undersiders again. If she does join the Undersiders again, it would just feel far too like a wasted opportunity.

Finally: Shadow Stalker did /what?/ I realize she was kind of... psycho in the original story, too, but this seems a bit much. That won't break my reading experience by any means (because this otherwise seems good and, as you said, more rational), but it definitely required a lot more of my suspension of disbelief.
