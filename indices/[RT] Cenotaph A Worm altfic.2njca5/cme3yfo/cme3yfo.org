/Worm/, except where Taylor hesitates for a millisecond when talking with Armsmaster.

This fic benefits strongly from using /Worm/'s characters, but I think it might actually be a better story. Taylor does a lot more thinking and plotting, and is more independent all-in-all. Much more rational than the original, I think. Also features some very clever worldbuilding for parahuman!Earth -- things that made me go, "Of course things would be like that," but weren't mentioned in original /Worm/. Slightly deconstructionist, in this way, if that's even possible.

ETA: Also, I just plain enjoy the author's writing style. 4.2, for instance, seemed just masterfully written. Good quality stuff.
