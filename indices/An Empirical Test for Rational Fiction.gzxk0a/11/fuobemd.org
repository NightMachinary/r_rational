In cooking shows you get a detailed set of opinions from experts in their field, in fiction you get detailed descriptions from people who are usually not qualified to speak on any given subject except, on rare occasions, literature. Still better than believing most major news networks I guess but it sounds like the metric points to college textbooks as the only form of rational fiction.
