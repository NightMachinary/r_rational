Disclaimer: I didn't really like The Waves Arisen and didn't find it a rational story. Perhaps something about the writing turned me off, in any case I accept I'm biased.

This is arguing more for rationalist fiction than rational, I guess - you're talking about how the main character is displaying virtues of rationality, rather than the setting / story making sense.

  He employs quite a simple method of performing tests, writing down observations, and using those observations as a springboard for devising new tests. Simple math lets him take general ideas and turn them into specific hypotheses fit for implementation in areas where small differences in outcomes really matter, such as life-or-death battle

This is in fact the part of the story that bothers me. It's a pure nerd wish fulfillment power fantasy, dressed with meaningless numbers. We're shown some very stretched reasoning, which is then taken for granted, and proves to somehow preemptively solve any problems Naruto might have. It's all a bit too much.
