First, I'll distinguish "rational" from "rational*ist*," the latter category (in my opinion) better fitting the attempted "test" above.

A /rational/ story is one where the people and their motivations are realistic, their actions are plausible responses to the situations that they are placed in, given their motivations and intelligence, and the consequences of their actions are foreseeable given enough consideration (unless some twist is withheld, in which case, they still make sense in hindsight).

As for a /rationalist/ story, I would say that it is a story where the characters are shown to solve problems using rationalist skills, and the use of those skills is displayed in enough detail that someone who is unfamiliar with a particular skill could pick up the basics of that skill without reference to outside works, given the motivation to do so.

The difference between this and the definition/test in the OP is that my definition describes /the text/ (the characters, their actions, and how those actions are described to the reader) and the OP describes the /reader's reaction/ to the text. As people react differently when they read the same text (and even the same person can react differently to a text upon a second reading), using /reaction/ seems like a less-than-useful way of categorizing a work.
