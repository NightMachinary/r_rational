I like this definition of rational fiction, thanks for sharing it. It sounds quite a bit like what I would call good character development. :)

I've noticed the current trend in rational fiction seems to be promoting stories with high IQ characters as the MC (the techy, sciency sort of smart). Strictly speaking, though, that's not required to tell a rational story. It would be fun to read fics with more diverse main characters, I suspect it would lead to some interesting plot ideas.
