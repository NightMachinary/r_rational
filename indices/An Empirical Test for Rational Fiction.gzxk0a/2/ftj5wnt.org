  So if you're not becoming more intelligent from reading a character's viewpoint, not even a little, then the author must not be showing real intelligence.

There are... several flaws with that metric.

Let's start by clarifying your definition of "becoming more intelligent." Intelligence, as a concept, is difficult to nail down. Here, you seem to be referring to "intelligence" as a collection of skills, rather than something inherent, which is an unusual definition (but one I largely agree with).

So, "rational fiction is fiction that makes you more intelligent" becomes "rational fiction is fiction that teaches you a skill." Here's where things become problematic, because what someone learns from a work is very subjective.

Someone might already know the skill being taught: does that make the work less rational, because the reader already knows? Someone might be reading the work for a second time; is it less rational because they have already absorbed most of the lessons from it?

Someone who reads it might not appreciate the skill being taught, or finds that bit of prose boring and skips over it. Is the work any less rational because the person reading it does not absorb the skill being conveyed?

Finally, to go the other way, stories are very good at conveying experience. A person can be completely wrong about everything, and still convey an idea of why they believe such a thing; does a work become more rational because the person has learned something about the writer's worldview, even if the writer is not thinking particularly rationally?

It's true that /any/ test for rational fiction is going to be subjective, but this test in particular seems to take that a lot farther than is useful. A good test for rationality in fiction should not depend on what the reader already knows, nor their interest in learning a particular skill, both of which tests the question "Did this work teach me anything?" fails.
