Two essays in one day? You prolific son of a gun.

I've enjoyed both of these thoroughly, and I'm here to say that your previous essay on TWA/HPMOR and meteor strikes is the thing that got me to take fiction seriously as a tool for learning and growth. So thanks for the assist, and I'm looking forward to future work :)
