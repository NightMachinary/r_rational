I thought about this as well, even if Naruto is rolling the die really fast it doesn't seem like he has time to get more than 20-30 rolls in before he pelts it at Kakashi. This isn't actually too far from how many rolls he needs but he doesn't know enough math to know that.

It might have been interesting if Naruto had noticed he doesn't have enough rolls, or if he had some idea that he /might/ have enough rolls /if he knew what to do with the data/. There's one or two scenes later in the story, including a die-rolling one, where he does think something like "I bet there's a way to solve this but I don't know the math and can't figure it out right now." Then he could have thought, "Okay, the rolling isn't working, is there some way I can test the weight of the die by testing its /weight/?" Then he could have tried balancing it on his knife or something.

On the other hand, I also like the idea that even if you don't know much math and even when you can't think of an elegant test, you can still just pick the dumbest, most obvious route and start plugging away at running trials and gathering data. There's a lesson there: /aim for the data and do the work/. And don't feel too bad when someone comes along later and shows you how much easier it would have been if you'd taken statistics in school instead of knife-throwing.
