I'm waiting until my exams are done to read the sequel but i just wanted to throw in a recommendation for the first novel. It's political and economic scheming within scheming competence porn where you're always guessing what level characters are playing at. And most inpressive to me is the story does that with /so much feeling/. Without getting specific i'll just say: the stories gonna make you feel some things.
