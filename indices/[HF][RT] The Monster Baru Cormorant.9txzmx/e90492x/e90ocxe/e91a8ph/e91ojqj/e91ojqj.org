Having had some small interest in bio punk lately, I actually liked the new angles. One other reason is that it sort of contracts the space of possibilities in the universe, however I also don't really know the full picture so it could turn out a bit worse than I'm imagining. It does feel like half of a book in some ways. Either way it turns out, it's been an enjoyable few reads for me nonetheless.
