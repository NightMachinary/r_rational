Hmm, sounds good. I'll give it a try soon. I have review debt to that fiction that I'm impressed with, so I can't read this right away. Meanwhile, why don't you tell us about these:

1. Can we, as readers, feel characters has motive and read in the works they actually work toward it?
2. Do the antagonist or obstacle are actually competent or worth a struggle?
3. How's the worldbuilding? I personally tolerate single plot hole every 10k words. Pretty tolerant, I think. But I absolutely despise fiction that betray its premise: you can't say A is true at the beginning without A stays at least partially true at the end.
