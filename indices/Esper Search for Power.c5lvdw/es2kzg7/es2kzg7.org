I wanted to share this here since the author is posting again after a hiatus. It's one of those rare RoyalRoad gems with good grammar and an interesting premise, so I'm pretty excited to see it active again, and I'm hoping a boost in traffic from you folks might cheer on the author and help keep it alive.

​

Esper: Search for Power is a LitRPG story with a standard setup; our boy is given superpowers and yanked into another world to level up. It has a few refreshing little twists, but it's new enough that saying much more would be a spoiler.

​

Things I like about it, and things that set it apart from others in the genre:

- The protagonist doesn't take unreasonable, unnecessary risks for the sake of power
- The protagonist doesn't forfeit his humanity for the sake of power
- What luck the protagonist has appears to have an explanation
- It doesn't /appear/ to be moving toward a cultivation-style, every-man-for-himself clash of powered civilizations
