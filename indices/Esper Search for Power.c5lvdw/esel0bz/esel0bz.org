Thank you for linking this.

I'm the author of this story, and I'm glad to see it here because it's quite heavily indebted to the rational fiction genre, and in particular the rationally writing podcast. I'm not sure I could in good faith classify it as rational, as the story starts from a deeply irrational premise. However, I've tried quite hard to have the protagonist react rationally, within normal human bounds, to what is a deeply absurd and irrational situation. That tension seemed interesting to write about and hopefully to read.

This is the first serious attempt I've taken at writing, and I can't claim to be particularly good at it, but I've got no intention of stopping, even if there may be breaks at times (hopefully not as long as the first hiatus).
