1. Absolutely. There's a pretty clear goal in sight, and he's established a more sentimental one for himself. So far, basically everything has been for the main goal, but once the story finds its pace I'm sure the second will become more trying.
2. Uh.../sorta?/ It's extremely important to emerge victorious, but there's no single, clearly defined enemy to overcome, and he hasn't had any super close brushes with death yet. It's less like a breathless sprint to get to a gun before a murderer, more like digging people out of a collapsed mine. Hard, dangerous, but maybe not quite as risky or thrilling? (I'm not selling that well.)
3. So far it all seems internally consistent. One author's note mentions an edit to fix "a continuity goof", but otherwise I haven't noticed any problems, and at least he's not shy about editing to fix his mistakes.
