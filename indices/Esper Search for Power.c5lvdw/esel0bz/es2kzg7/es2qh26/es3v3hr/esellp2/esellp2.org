I am intractably biased as the author of the story, but here are my answers to your questions (minor spoiler warning):

1. I certainly hope so. At minimum I've done my best to create a protagonist with clear goals and the intended primary thrust of the story is about his decisions and analysis of how best to reach them.

2. The stakes are very high, so in that sense I think from the perspective of the character they are unquestionably worth struggling to achieve. On the other hand, I could see where readers could justifiably view them as somewhat forced or artificial.

3. This seems to address both world building and plot cohesion/following one's own rules. As far as the latter goes, I've worked hard to keep things consistent except where there is an organic in-universe explanation for the inconsistency. It is very likely that I will at certain points need to go back and ret-con a few details however. As far as the world building, I don't view that as a particular strength, but I've done my best to create a world with a set premise (perpetual monster attacks, which is a minor spoiler), and then think logically over how that would impact and shape society economically, socially, technologically (kind of), militarily, educationally and in shared values. It's still early on in the story though and most of that is still to come. So perhaps call the world building a work in progress?
