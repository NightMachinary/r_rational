I think it requires at least two factions. If the player is controlled by hive mind, then the author must provide equally powerful challenges. Without powerful challenges it devolves in boring munchkin shortstories similar to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=%5BMK%5D&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][[MK]]] here.

With multiple factions it becomes difficult to keep them separated. This necessarily means higher barriers of entry. If people manage to play in multiple factions this means factions can read each others minds. Ultimately I guess factions would self-destruct by espionage, distrust, and politics.
