Participation in prediction markets may actually constitute a beneficial barrier for entry. For me, the presence of a sane method of conflict resolution and strategy selection among players is a huge plus, so this would not keep me from participating. And if this barrier keeps out the average quest players, so much the better.

Damn. Now I want to find/create a fair prediction market that actually converges to Bayesian estimates. And to make a good Condorcet voting web site. If only I had the time.
