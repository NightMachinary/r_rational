The thing you really need is *a good writer* who can reliably hit their updates, and not have their updates spread out too far. Preferably someone with experience GMing a tabletop game, because I see a lot of similarities there. Everything else is going to hinge on that, and if you don't have it, it's all going to fall apart.

The second thing you're going to need is a reasonably large community. If you're down to just a handful of active commentator/players, you might as well just be playing D&D online. The whole idea is to have *a collective intelligence guiding the player*. To that end, you need quite a few people, which means *low barriers to entry* and ideally *brand recognition*. If you're talking about betting real money, or having people sign up with a faction, you're talking about multiple clicks to take you from someone linking to this thing, and actually playing it. That's bad.

The third thing you're going to need are *concrete rules that have been thought about ahead of time*. At the same time, if the players find some exploit in these rules, the aforementioned good writer has to be able to patch that exploit in a satisfying way that is consistent with the established canon /and/ doesn't make the game feel unwinnable.

For general genre, I would suggest *fantasy* because it represents a world that's in many ways less complex than our own (I literally have a computer in my pocket that connects to a global network of information).

I personally would have interest in following something like this, so long as it was well-written, which as I hope I've said, is what most of this will hinge on.

Edit: Oh, and I would split the difference as far as prediction markets go - give people some fake currency to vote with, ideally something that accrues as the chapters pile up. RationalBucks or something. But again you get into the problem of increasing the barrier for entry.
