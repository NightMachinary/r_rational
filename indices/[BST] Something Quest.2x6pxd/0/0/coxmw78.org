Re: Entry barrier, etc. Suggestion: two level currency.

(1) is used for voting on existing suggestions. (2) is primarily used for bidding on suggestion slots, and secondarily for betting and status.

Suggestion slots are limited, perhaps by having a fixed total or by sharply increasing prices past a certain limit.

(1) is given in equal measure to all participants just after an update, and is wiped every time just before a distribution.

(2) is earned by having voted on a winning suggestion. The total pool of (2) available is proportional to amount of (2) spent that round on suggestions. X% of the pool is won by the original suggester, and the rest is distributed pro rata to voters.

(2) can also be obtained by real money donation; by trade or bet (or possibly purchase?) from holders of (2); and by collecting on nonwinning suggestions through fanfiction (see EYs comment)
