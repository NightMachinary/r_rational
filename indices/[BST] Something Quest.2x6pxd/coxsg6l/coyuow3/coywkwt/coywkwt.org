- mspaforum. It's huge and there are hundreds upon hundreds of quests of every flavor. A story that was submitted here some days ago: [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46308-Deep-Rise-An-Illustrated-Xenofiction-Adventure]]

- forum.questionablequesting.com I only followed one story there and that one is long dead.

- boards.4chan.org/tg/catalog Filter by quest. Most of the stories are bad to mediocre, but there are some good ones if you keep looking.

- suptg is one archive for stories from /tg/. I can very much recommend Void Quest. It's been years since I read it, but I remember it being a pretty cool sci-fi story from the perspective a war-ship that finally managed to restart after 65k years of drifting in space: [[http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?searchall=void+quest]]

- Anonkun. Mentioned here several times. No story fitting the rational community comes to mind. The Reigns of Command has been fun. A lot of war, strategy, politicking etc. [[http://104.236.88.162/stories/top]]

I think that's all the relevant ones.
