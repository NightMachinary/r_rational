Hi, anonkun! I'm taking this moderately seriously but can't guarantee that I'll be the first author to step up. Also, although some others have spoken of using this on a fundraising basis, I would not mind being paid directly for my next artistic endeavor. (Of course I'd still free the IP for anyone else to use and get paid for, which is my own way of not being evil.) I worry that the system I envision is relatively complicated, but one must always ask before assuming that something can't be done. I'd want:

- The ability for any user to suggest a next course of action for the character.
- The ability for anyone to discuss those suggestions, using either nested or flat comments, but with comments being local to a particular suggestion.
- The ability to comment / post on a latest update in general.
- The ability for anyone to bid money on a course of action they prefer, which is collected only if that course of action is taken.
- The ability for anyone to bid money on the next N words, which is collected after the next N words are produced independently of any particular course of action.
- Ideally, the ability for the author to post one paragraph at a time, and for users to realtime-chat about the paragraphs.

After some worried thought, I've decided that it seems best for now not to award money to suggesters because it seems liable to create fights over a system that would otherwise operate well enough with just user interest. (Sadly, not everyone in the world is money-positive or operates emotionally well with market norms.) I hereby commit that, should I undertake such a project, 10% of revenue will go directly to some charity other than MIRI in order that I not profit personally from the above decision.

I would first want to run pilot paragraphs without money, but with voting, in order to see if the overall system works well for me as a format.
