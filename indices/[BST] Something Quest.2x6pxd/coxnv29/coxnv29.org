Sounds fun.

Anonkun seems be the most fitting of the listed options so far.

- The coder has been considering implementing monetary systems for a while now.

- Suggestions on how to improve the site are taken seriously. If a sizeable group wants a change, there is a good chance they get it within a few weeks or months.

- The current system is relatively good for discussion of different topics. There is a general chat with additional chatrooms for any topics users create. Voting is done easily, dice system is integrated.

- The owner has been discussion ways to safely increase the userbase for a while now. Fears have been that new users will either a) vote stupidly / only for â€˜funny' stuff, b) take issue with some of the morally questionable quests and intentionally try to ruin the fun of others. I think the rational community would improve the community if anything.

Of course there would be downsides:

- I's not as good for discussion as I would like. The chatrooms are mainly plaintext.

- It's kind of buggy. Dice work, but if the same user rolls twice only the second roll is shown, which allows cheating. Other bugs pop up every now and then.

- Anyone from the userbase can join any story. While I'll grant that the [[/r/HPMOR]] or the [[/r/rational]] community may play a very rational game, I'm not sure how it would fare if random users join in numbers.

- Kas sometimes decides to change things for his own reasons even if most of the community wanted something else. This may lead to a sudden influx of bugs.
