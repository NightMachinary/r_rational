Great comments on anonkun.

Right now I'm mostly concerned about nailing the product market fit through user feedback, so I'm really open to changes.

We're testing out a new beta right now with a totally revamped discussion system. It's way better at discussions now. See changes here: [[http://anonkun.com/stories/new-beta/HvPosMFoNvkzmF3hh]]

The dice thing is also fixed in the beta.

The userbase question is really interesting. I think if you're really concerned about that you can temporarily set the story to be "unpublished". It'll still be visible and you can link it to rational communities without our broader community interfering. Once you get your footing and establish the rationalist culture you can publicize it.
