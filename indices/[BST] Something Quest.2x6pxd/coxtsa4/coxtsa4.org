I've actually been considering doing this. I am writing full time right now, so I would have no problem hitting my updates. People seem to have liked my writing on 2YE, so hopefully that works.

One thing people should be aware of, though: since I'm trying to write full time, I need to monetize. If I were being the DM on this full time, I would ask that people either throw a few bucks at my Patreon, or spread awareness of my for-sale works, or in some other way help me get closer to that hoped-for "writer who isn't starving" state.

As to what the topic might be -- I'd be happy to do things in the 2YE-verse, or in the new manapunk-verse that I will be starting shortly. Obviously, if people have other ideas that's fine too.
