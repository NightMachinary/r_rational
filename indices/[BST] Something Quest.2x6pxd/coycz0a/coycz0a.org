  One author, or several?

As [[/u/alexanderwales]] points out, this is similar to GMing a tabletop game. In my experience, the quality of my campaigns improved dramatically when I started giving more authorial power to my players. So what if we did that, and had everyone playing some part in it?

There are quite a lot of non-story-affecting details that could be farmed off to community voting. To use HP:MoR as an example, you could have brought large chunks of Draco's personality or Hogwarts lore to vote, or really most of the background details inherited from Rowling's work.

I don't know if being able to vote on both creative setting details and munchkin/rational decisions would cause problems for some readers. I'd be down for it, but I suspect I'm weirdly good at this sort of split.
