I'll try out the new beta. Good to know the dice are fixed there. I think it was only 2 weeks or so ago when I did a bug report on that. (Though I don't know if I was the first to report that.)

Keeping the story unpublished for some time would work quite well to establish a baseline of appropriate player behaviour as well as a barrier of entry for low-effort posters. Good idea!

Of course we would still need to find a good, willing author with an interesting idea and a bit of time on their hands for the forseeable future...

Edit: Tried out the beta. Saw the mandatory comment feature. Will no longer use the beta.

Edit 2: Authors can now turn off mandatory comments.
