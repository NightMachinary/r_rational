  Chicken is going to be a massively difficult industry to disrupt until we can get lab-grown Egg White and Egg yolk to become things.

Just a quick note: egg-laying and meat-producing chickens are practically unrelated industries, the same as beef cows and dairy cows. The animals have a common ancestor decades in the past, and that's about it for links between the industries.

Completely supplanting the meat-chicken industry would have minimal effects on the egg industry (same with dairy/beef).
