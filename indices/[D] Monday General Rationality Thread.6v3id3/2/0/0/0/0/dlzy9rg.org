  Removing the cows won't remove the mosquitos.

This is in places where the only reason the water (which is a breeding ground /for mosquitos/) is there, /is because/ of the cows.

  Should we work to exterminate other methane polluters? Deer for instance likely produce much more methane then their utility in food
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic here or not... No species of animal should ever be actively exterminated. Deer aren't even a blip on the radar when it comes to methane production. What's the point of mass exterminating an animal while trying to save the environment? (rhetorical question)

Deer + Car accidents is something which can be solved with responsible engineering. (Presumably, Self-Driving cars + current road solutions being implemented will solve the problem, re: humans)

I'm for increasing Quality of Human Life while maintaining environmental stability and animal populations.
