Removing the cows won't remove the mosquitos. There'd likely be a reduced fly polulation do to less waste, so possible benefit there. Should we work to exterminate other methane polluters? Deer for instance likely produce much more methane then their utility in food, not to mention car accidents. The most looming concern for myself is antibiotics used in beef production, and it's impact, as well added hormones to animals. Anything that offers tasty options that improve health anf enviroment is a noble goal.
