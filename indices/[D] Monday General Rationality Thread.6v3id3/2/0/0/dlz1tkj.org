I'll admit, my opinion was formed before I found any studies that were produced. In fact, I'm not talking explicitly about red meat necessarily and health correlation, but rather, my anecdotal experiences regarding cattle.

The strongest point in favor of these replacements, is the sheer amount of cholesterol in the modern first world human diet. By creating a Burger replacement, I believe that reducing Cholesterol will help humans across the board.

As for disease vectors: Cattle that graze often require artificial water sources. Every time I've passed a water source for cattle in the wild, it was a massive breeding ground for mosquitos.

Other health benefits of getting rid of beef cattle would come with the freeing of land for more public use, and less waste as well as less methane/greenhouse gases in the air.
