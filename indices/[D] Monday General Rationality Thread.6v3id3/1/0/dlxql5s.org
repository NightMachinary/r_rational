I'm not sure if this is a right thread to discuss this, but I don't care because I'm a fan of this show. I stopped watching after the tournament arc so I could binge the rest of the season when it ends, so I'm happy to hear that she gets more development. All-Might has been my favorite character from the beginning since I personally relate to his struggle to live up to his own standards.

I feel like building up a hero as Superman and then revealing its a facade has become a cliche in its own right, but HeroAca pulled it off for me by showing he really is trying to be the most morally righteous person he can be in the hope that it will inspire others to do the same. He wants to help others more than anything and will risk his life to do so even if it's not always the "smart" decision.

HeroAca is a show that deeply understands the fundamental themes of the American superhero genre, reinterpreted with the story structure and style of shonen anime, and delivers on the emotional appeal of those stories. I love that the show has become as popular as it has among kids since it teaches great lessons using the superhero school as a metaphor for the questions kids face when approaching adulthood.

We see examples of kids who were never given the chance to prove their abilities because of flawed social institutions and prejudices, families pressuring their children and kids pressuring themselves into professional success, the toxic masculinity that pervades the culture of success and competition, and Deku's arc is all about showing how hard his goals really are to achieve so he needs to work smarter than everyone else only to still face setbacks.
