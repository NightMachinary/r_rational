So, /The Sequences/. I tried to read them in 2012 but didn't work very well for me. I've heard that being exposed to the wider rationalist community more or less makes some parts of them go the way of /John Carter of Mars/ or /Seinfeld/: people first exposed to them now are somewhat bored by them because they're cliche, but they invented the cliches so in their time they were groundbreaking.

So, is this sort of concept applicable to the sequences? And/or is there something else that has been released in the meantime that does the sequences but better?

Basically: let's assume I'm willing to read /one/ Rationalist Bible type document. Should that document be The Sequences or something else?
