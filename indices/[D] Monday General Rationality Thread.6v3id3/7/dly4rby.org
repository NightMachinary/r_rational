This is a well written political essay. It starts by looking at the rationale behind political conservatism based on failures in "rational design of social order", the history behind the move to neoliberlism and why most western countries are moving away from it. Then it transitions into reviewing a universal basic income in light of machine intelligence and compares that system with "social investment".

  Some people in National [the centre-right party of NZ] gloat about the prospect of social investment rendering their adversaries on the traditional left obsolete.'If we can deliver a more effective welfare system for less money, why would anyone vote for them?' A fair question, but here's another one: what does it even mean to be a right-wing party or a conservative politician in a society in which the state can make better decisions about price or resource allocation than the individual or the market? What kind of economy do we end up with once the state no longer needs to simplify its model of the world, and its maps can be as complex as the territory?
