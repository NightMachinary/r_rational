I am thinking really hard about whether or not my own story is [RTS] or [RT]. I am not even sure whether or not it is rational enough for this place.

Anyway, it's called [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][the Dao of Magic]].

I started writing it as a xianxia deconstruction and try very hard to have a certain amount of logical science in a universe filled with magic, mysticism and cultivators.

Should I post new chapters here? Maybe make posts once I have five or ten chapters written?
