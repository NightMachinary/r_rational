This story is awesome! It's exactly what I was looking for, and even thinking about writing myself, down to the lone cultivator who finds himself in the forest and has to figure out the magic system from first principles. And it's way better than I could have written it, so now I don't have to! Lol. Highly looking forward to the rest of this. I'd qualify it as a rationalist Xianxia for sure. Keep up the good work!
