This sounds interesting, I would probably give it a read.

However, I really like [[https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/thoughts-on-writing-serials/][Wildbow's advice for starting new webserials]] - which is that you should write a backlog of 12-15 chapters before starting to actually post. It's helpful for you as a writer (confirms you have a solid concept, gives you a sense of how long each chapter will take to write and thus what kind of posting schedule you can keep, etc), but also for readers (generally leads to a more solid intro, because you can edit those chapters as a group). Plus, if real life starts to intrude, you can skip a few posts' worth of writing, because you've got that buffer of chapters to fall back on.
