Yeah I agree that its not the case. That point in the essay comes relatively soon after discussing how the universal basic income might work in an era where machine intelligence has taken over the "white collar" jobs but that we aren't at that point yet.

So it seems a little inconsistent that the social investment section doesn't make that same point - we don't have those maps yet. Though there is probably a lot more market-related data than welfare data.
