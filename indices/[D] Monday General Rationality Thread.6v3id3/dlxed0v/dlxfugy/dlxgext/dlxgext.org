Oh, I'm certainly trying for rational mechanics in role, rules and balancing. I'm just stronger on the story end, and I'm going to probably need collaboration for the mechanics/ruleset both in scope and munchkin-prevention* (in the sense of preventing game-breaking early. I certainly want people to exploit the mechanics by the end of the game.)
