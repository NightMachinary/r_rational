I'm very much in favor of enlarging the house and allowing proportional representation.

That said, I don't think it will do much to fix the presidential election. The fact that elections are always so close is structural. Expanding the house wouldn't make much change in the long-term.

Look at presidential elections as a multi-player "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game][Split the Dollar]]" game.

Candidates go a group of constituents and say, "If elected, I'll have power. And I'll spend 30% of my time and energy on stuff you want. Vote for me!" Then, each constituency either accepts the deal (and shows up to vote) or they reject it (and stay home).

The incentive is to offer each group the smallest amount that will get them to show up. This lets you preserve points to spend on other groups, or to use on your personal agenda.

This, in my view, is what happened in the Trump election. Hillary gave groups (eg. Union Workers in Wisconsin) as much attention as her team thought it would take to win them. Once believed they were winning, Hillary's campaign directed their excess energy to a personal project. In this case, campaigning in Californian cities to help run up the popular vote count.

They miscalculated, and left too little margin for error. But, had they have gotten things right, the strategy would have looked brilliant. Hillary would come in with a clear mandate (read: big lead in the popular vote) and also not have over-promised her attention to any one group.

Changing the exact distribution of the house would make candidates re-distribute their energies a bit. But it wouldn't change the underlying situation where about half of people end up unhappy with the president.

So long as we have districts with one representative, an excessively large victory is just a signal that the candidate spent too much political energy getting people to vote for them. They'll pull back until just enough people are unhappy.
