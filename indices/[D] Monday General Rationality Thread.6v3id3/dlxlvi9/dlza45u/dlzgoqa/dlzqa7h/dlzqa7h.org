Population distributions have very little to do with it. Make states perfectly even, and a candidate could still win with 26% of the vote.

The problem is that Electoral College slates are assigned on a winner take all basis. This creates massively distorted incentives to focus on swing states.

Effort anywhere else is wasted (unless it brings in money to spend on swing states).

This is reflected in campaign spending/capita. Politicians pour money into swing states. High EC / capita states get basically no extra attention.

So, an EC vote redistribution might swing an election or two, until the system adjusts. But it won't make everyone equally important to a politician.

For that, use the state compact that assigns EC votes to the winner of the popular election.
