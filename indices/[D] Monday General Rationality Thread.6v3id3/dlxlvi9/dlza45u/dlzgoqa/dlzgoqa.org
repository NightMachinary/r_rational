This discrepancy between popular and electoral votes is caused by a plain outdated population distribution and is not isolated to this last election.

"Running up" the popular vote in an election where the popular vote doesn't matter is just plain dumb. But I don't actually think that's what Hillary did. I think she won the popular vote in California by a huge margin because more people there preferred the liberal status quo to a race-baiting wannabe fascist.

None of the issues in the campaign were local, even that one factory Trump made a fuss about. It was, in many ways, a referendum on globalism. The majority of Americans see the benefits from bananas to smartphones and find it at least acceptable, but there are areas that see the costs in closed factories and dying towns.

These people have been left behind by global capitalism at the same time that they have been given a gradually more and more outsized share of both the House and the Electoral college. They needed something, and Trump told them what they wanted to hear. (And then there are the straight up racists, but he didn't win solely on racism)

If Hillary made a strategic mistake, it was in not taking the demsoc platform Bernie proved appealed to those same left-behind-by-capitalism people and running with it.

Multimember districts are another good idea that will be a lot easier to do when most states have dozens to hundreds of Representatives.
