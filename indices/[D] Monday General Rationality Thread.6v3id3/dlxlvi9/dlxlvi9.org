TL;DR: House reapportionment as political panacea, discuss.

A question that's been largely forgotten as his actual presidency proceeds is how Trump got elected. He lost the popular vote by a large margin, but won the electoral vote, the vote that matters, on the strength of mostly rural states. Now, at first glance this looks like a problem with the electoral college, favoring rural states. But why does it favor rural states?

Each state gets electoral votes equal to their number of senators and representatives. So what varies the number of electoral votes is the number of house seats each state has. The number of house seats for each state is prescribed by the constitution to be not less than 30,000 people per representative, as counted by the census every ten years. They specified a minimum population under the premise that each state would want to maximize their number of representatives, and would try to do so at each census.

But the last House reapportionment was in 1911. Not only has the population grown somewhat since then, the population distribution has shifted. Cities are bigger and denser, farming takes fewer people for greater output.

So, I say, let's be constitutional originalists. Let's have a House reapportionment that reflects the actual population of these United States. What would this look like?

First, with a population of more than 300 million, the new House has over ten thousand seats. Let's build them a grand new hall designed primarily to invoke the overview effect astronauts and cosmonauts experience. What would it mean to have so many representatives? It would mean smaller districts, which have several benefits: your representative is both more reliant on each individual constituent and less worthwhile to buy. Each one would have less personal power, and niche or even protest candidates would be more viable.

Second, smaller districts are harder to gerrymander. You can't have a district that snakes all around a city and gets all the poor, mostly black or hispanic areas if those areas are several dozen districts worth of people, and slices that group rural areas in with cities would have to get really thin and obvious. This massive redistricting effort would also be a good opportunity to try algorithmic redistricting and other anti gerrymandering districting schemes.

Third, to bring it back to the opening question, if representatives were proportional to population, electoral votes would be too, and the electoral vote would naturally more closely match the popular vote.

By this one, admittedly radical and complicated change, we fix several apparently unrelated problems.
