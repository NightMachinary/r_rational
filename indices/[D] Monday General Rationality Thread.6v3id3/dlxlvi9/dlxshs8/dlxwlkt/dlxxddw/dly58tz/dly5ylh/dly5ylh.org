My point isn't that singular =they= is /new/, and therefore bad regardless of its merit. My point is that singular =they= is /ambiguous/, and therefore bad regardless of its age.

I have the same problem with =you=, =sheep=, =deer=, etc. I differentiate between =you= (with the identity of the singular target implied by the quoting system of the website that I'm using) and =you (plural)= with some regularity. [[http://i.imgur.com/q1RFB6A.png][Here]] are some examples from [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/][the Paradox forums]], in which =you (plural)= indicates the team of modders to which belongs the person to whom I'm replying.
