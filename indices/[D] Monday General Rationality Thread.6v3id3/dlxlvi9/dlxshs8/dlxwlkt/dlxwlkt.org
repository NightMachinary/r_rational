I know about that case. The court ruled that it was basically the House's job to figure out apportionment, and that they hadn't technically violated the constitution in fixing the size of their own body. However, that's because of something I already mentioned, that the constitution only set a minimum district size, not a maximum.

This is problematical because the founders were relying on the states competing among themselves for more and more seats as the country grew. However, the members' own personal power shrinks when the size of the house grows, and with the House in charge of setting its own size and apportionment, the states' incentive to get more representatives is overwhelmed by the representatives' incentive to maintain their personal power.

Reapportionment without changing the size of the house misses almost all of the benefits of a true reapportionment. Wyoming's single representative represents all 585 thousand Wyomingites, but each of California's 53 representatives represents about 754 thousand Californians, assuming roughly equal district size within the state. Following the 30 thousand rule, Wyoming should have 19 Representatives, and California should have 1308.
