I just stumbled on this community, and it's basically something I didn't know I was looking for. I'm creating a game in my spare time with several aspects of rationalist fiction.

First, a magic system that runs on an internal logic of the easy-to-learn difficult-to-master sort that the protagonists learn the 'rules' to as they progress.

Second, no objective good or evil. I will not be making the character's moral decisions for them, and conflict is driven by the same things it is in the real world, with every faction seeing themselves as the 'good guy'.

Third, I'm trying to create internally-consistent but blue and orange moral codes for several NPC factions, so resources are available to those who are willing to take the time to 'crack the code'.

It sounds like the most appropriate time to discuss my issues is only on Worldbuilding Wednesdays, and not the rest of the week. Do I have that correct? Thanks!
