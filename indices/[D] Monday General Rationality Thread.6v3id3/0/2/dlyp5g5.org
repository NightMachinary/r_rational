Fair warning: you're taking on a really, really, really huge logistical challenge here. (especially if you're doing this on free time)

Making a conflict-driven story with several (I'm supposing you want more than two) factions that are compelling to the player and delivering it through gameplay is... um, actually pretty hard.

So, um, I'm not going to give you advice you didn't ask on a project you didn't explain, but... generally speaking, try to read up on narrative-driven games ? (Extra Credits probably has more than a few videos that would interest you)

And good luck!
