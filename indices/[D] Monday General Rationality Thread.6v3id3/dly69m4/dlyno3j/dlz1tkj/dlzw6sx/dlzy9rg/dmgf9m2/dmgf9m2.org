What confused me was when you said it was water sources you saw in the wild, which i did not connnect to your earlier statement regarding artificial sources. Where you are observing this? I reside in California in a huge dairy area, and I find the biggest area for mosquitos is the rivers, and canals used for irrigation. I am pursing higher education with a data science focus, and maybe i can do a project on this. It certainly interests me, and has a lot of social value.
