I am an Omnivore, leaning towards the carnivorous side of things. I probably consume some form of dairy or meat product 2-3 times a day.

Burgers which aren't actually from cows burgers have recently made it out the doors, and the responses are positive!

There are at least two such companies which are producing such products in large degrees.

There's the Impossible Burger: [[https://www.impossiblefoods.com/faq/]]

Then, there's Beyond Meat: [[http://beyondmeat.com/]]

Their various approaches are admirable, and interesting. Impossible Burgers license their meats to relatively-high-end restaurants, while Beyond Meat is selling to retailers like Walmart, Albertsons, etc.

I am thoroughly excited for these products, and I firmly believe they are a key ingredient to a post-scarcity world. According to impossible foods, using the life cycle assessment method, their burger, when said and done, takes up

  1/20th the land, 1/4th the water, and produces 1/8th the greenhouse gas emissions.

Even if those numbers are off, and the impossible burger actually uses 1/10th the land and 1/2th water, I firmly believe that human QoL will be impacted positively if they can take a good chunk of actual meat producers.

  According to livestock researchers, animal agriculture uses 30% of all land, over 25% of all freshwater on Earth, and creates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all of the world's cars, trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes combined.

This statistic set is misleading because they just say 'animal agriculture', while I'm referring specifically to cows, so take that stat with a grain of salt. Soy farming and their heme mfg processes may not be so impressive if lined up with the chicken industry.

Sadly, these Beef Alternative companies are paying lip servise to the Anti-GMO crowd, which honestly, they really shouldn't. I believe they should be doing everything they possibly can to scale up their production, and dumping the Anti-GMO, 110% Organic crowds like rocks.

I believe that the Beef industry is one of, if not the largest factor in America's health epidemics, additionally, I believe that Beef is a product which actively hinders our ability to move post-scarcity: it consumes way too much land, it is a huge vector for disease, cows are immensely destructive to the (public) lands they graze on, and Cattle requires active redirection of mass amounts of water to places where it /shouldn't/ be.

We can produce Soy in such larger quantites per acre than cows per acre, and have so much less waste overall, I will actively advocate for the death of Big Moo.

Impossible Foods currently produces 8,000 tons of their burgers per month, and received funding to build a factory that can do >1 million tons of meat every month. I hope to see the Impossible Burger beginning to appear on menus all across the country.

I believe that they (Impossible Foods at least) are not attacking these industries in an optimal fashion.

Impossible Foods is branching into Chicken, Dairy, and other animal meat-based products. Instead of that, I would like to see them move to replacing the entire Beef Cow industry, then move toward other animals. I also believe that Dairy is a slightly less destructive industry on Human QoL than Beef. Chicken is going to be a massively difficult industry to disrupt until we can get lab-grown Egg White and Egg yolk to become things.

I would like to see a larger focus on beef's more difficult items to replicate like various types of Steaks and Ribs instead.

If you see any other groups with products that pretend to be beef/dairy/poultry/other items, let me know. I'm down for the animal replacements to come.
