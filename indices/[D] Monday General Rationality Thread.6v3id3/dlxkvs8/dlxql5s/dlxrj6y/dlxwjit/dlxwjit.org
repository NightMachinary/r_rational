And he did it after being told he didn't have what it takes to be a hero by his idol. Even in that state, knowing all the reasons he had not to do something and having basically no plan or, he ran towards the danger in an attempt to help someone who hated him because he had to do /something/. Seeing him do that, in a world where many heroes value their status as celebrities or fighters more than helping people, pulled All-Might out of his depression to take action despite how much it would risk to him. That his speech to Deku afterward cemented their relationship as my favorite part of the series.

Now, the scene isn't flawless. Deku did act rashly and took unnecessary risks without a proper plan, which the show kind of glosses over in favor. However, it makes up for it later by focusing on Deku's cleverness in every other dangerous situation, and it doesn't matter that much anyway because the emotions of the moment are incredibly built up to and paid off. That's HeroAca in a nutshell, it delivers on the emotional satisfaction of its story so well that I only notice the wrinkles in the writing because I'm paying really close attention and thinking about the story so much.
