I just want to express my appreciation for what /My Hero Academia/ did with Froppy two weeks ago. I know [[/r/anime]] says she's just some rando writer's favorite, but she actually /is/ an excellent budding hero. What's her Quirk? "Does whatever a frog can". Why's she even here? Because she's serious, studious, ethical, and works well with others.

Or in other words, instead of having some easily exploitable superpower, she's there because she has the personal qualities necessary to make /any/ superpower useful.

Meanwhile, they've also made the Captain Marvel/America-style brick-of-muscle hero into a compelling character on his own, who struggles to maintain the masquerade that superheroes really can maintain peace in a world where villains have superpowers too. He's still trying his hardest to be the invincible man who saves the day with a smile, the Symbol of Peace, even while he's slowly dying.
