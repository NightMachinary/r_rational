I recently watched an episode of American Horror Story. It was the second episode of the series I've ever watched, but that's beside the point. Spoilers up until the most recent episode of the new season, I suppose.

Anyway, vampires exist in this show, and one of the recently turned vampires is a doctor. She infects one of her dying patients (a young boy of about twelve) to save his life. He then immediately kills his parents, infects his best friend/girlfriend, kills his teacher, and infects his entire class, in that order. Then all of the students blame the killings on a random intruder and escape the school.

*The point is*, this got me thinking about the rationality of vampirism. Assuming you could become a vampire, and thereby be guaranteed immortality (only getting thirsty every now and then), wouldn't it be rational to do so? And isn't the kid acting quite rationally by granting immortality to his girlfriend? Doing the same for his whole class seemed a bit reckless, but all the others seemed to play along and cooperate, so that worked out well too.

In the end, two (possibly four) people at the school died to guarantee immortality for twenty children. Is that acceptable? Utilitarianism might say so. What do you think?
