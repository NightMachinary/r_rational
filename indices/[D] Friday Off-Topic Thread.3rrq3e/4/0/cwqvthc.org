This is something that I've given some thought. It really, really depends on your vampires.

- How much blood does a vampire require? In my /Robot, Wizard, Vampire/ story it's one pint a day, which means that a vampire requires donations from a rotating pool of approximately sixty people in order to survive. If vampires need one pint a /week/ then that pool of volunteer humans is reduced to eight people. If they need to kill humans, then there's pretty much no societal utility unless you can create some ethical scheme of euthanasia (which is what the last vampire book I read ended up doing).
- What are the effects of vampirism, beyond immortality? Immortality looks a lot less attractive if it comes with severe restrictions, psychological problems, or changes to basic values. If becoming a vampire makes you evil, as it does in some canons, then a good person wouldn't do it even if it granted immortality, because you wouldn't really be yourself anymore.
- What does the rest of the universe look like? If there's a provable afterlife and vampirism prohibits you from it, as it does in many vampire canons, then it doesn't make sense to become a vampire unless your afterlife prospects are especially bleak.
