Kind of surprised to not have heard about this here yet. What do you guys think is going on with [[http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/researchers-conduct-successful-new-tests-of-emdrive/]] ?

few questions which pop to my mind: Do you think its going to pan out? Is it going to only be relevant for deep space research? or it will reach power levels where it will be usable on earth as well? What is your guess as to its root cause if its real? If not do you have a best guess about what is causing the signals currently being measured? heat radiation? lorentz force? If its real how much further do you think its going to push space exploration? do you have any predictions about how this story is going to progress if its real(i.e. will NASA pioneer it? will private companies be the first? will private companies monopolize the tech with patents?)
