For anyone interested in banking and fiction, I'd recommend /The Dagger and the Coin/ series by Daniel Abraham (starting with /The Dragon's Path/). The main character is a banker, most of the characters are smart, and the ones who aren't smart are at least consistent and very believable.

Also, on the topic of fiction and finance, I'll plug /[[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv][The Cambist and Lord Iron]]/ by the same author. It's a short story, and more about trade than about banking.
