  So from what I can see, there is no "writing rational fiction" technique. There's just "general writing technique", and "having rationalist ideas to write about". Maybe that is why people do not have a lot to discuss.

That's part of it, for me.

I actually think that there's a subset of general writing ability which is "writing things that [[/r/rational]] would like", which largely consists of things like:

- how to write compelling exposition
- how to properly escalate a conflict
- how to foreshadow the solution to the plot
- how to show two people as having a legitimate disagreement

You can write fiction without knowing these things; there's no need for conflict to escalate, it's just something that [[/r/rational]] tends to like. So I do think that there's some room for a more [[/r/rational]] focused approach to writing technique, it's just that these things are hard to do well and if you /can/ do them well it's hard to distill the practice down into practical advice.
