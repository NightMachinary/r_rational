I feel like I talk about writing (mostly plot structure and character arcs) a lot. But if I wanted to talk about broadly applicable writing topics, I would probably take them to other subreddits, where I could get feedback from a wider, more specialized audience: [[/r/writing]], [[/r/fantasywriters]], [[/r/scifiwriting]], etc.

More than that though, there are a huge amount of resources for writers such that I don't think discussion is all that valuable. If you want to know writing technique, that's a very well established field and you're almost certainly better off reading the ten best books out of the thousands of books that have been written on the subject. Or you can take college courses from accredited professionals.

Basically, I do talk about writing technique, but the reason that I don't talk about it /more/ is that there are already a whole host of resources that cover almost anything I'd want to say and which do that more eloquently and concisely than I would be able to manage. (I also have a degree in English, which further reduces my expected returns from talking about writing technique here.)
