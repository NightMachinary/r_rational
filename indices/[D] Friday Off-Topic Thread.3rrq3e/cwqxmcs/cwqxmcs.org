I made a cool thing for Reddit this week! Someone in [[/r/askhistorians]] asked why there are so many people named Smith in America. A lot of the answers revolved around their being a lot of people adopting Smith, but I thought a bit of modelling might also provide a bit of explanatory power. So I made a little model that created a population of 100k people and created 100 last names. Each person was assigned a role with a 50% chance each of being a last name giver or taker and also given one of the last names at random (each one being equally probable, resulting in an almost even split of all last names). Then when a generation is born the model randomly pairs givers with takers and each pair gives a pair of offspring (a tiny amount get 3 offspring to make up for the different amount of givers/takers). The offspring get the giver's last name. You can play the web version of the model yourself [[https://lastnamedistribution.5apps.com/][here]], the colour of the bar represents particular last names (so you can track one over time), the height of the bar is how common it is, and its place in x is its rank (in terms of commonness). After running it for awhile, I got [[https://i.imgur.com/sosgzc2.png?1][this distribution]] which resembles [[https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/chalabi-flowers-feature-commonname-2.png?w=610&h=610][this histogram]] from [[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-the-most-common-name-in-america/][this article]]. Here's the [[https://github.com/kerbalNASA/LastNameDistribution][source/Github page]] (its written in Haxe).

This makes me think its a plausible partial explanation of what's going on. Of course, there's a lot of factors it doesn't model. For example, certain last names may be correlated with different amounts of offspring each generation, as well as different chances of pairing with other last names. I suspect these factors would amplify the speed at which that distribution forms as well as why certain regions go to more extreme forms of the distribution faster than others (e.g., in Vietnam 40% of people are named Nguyen, IIRC).
