I think there's a difference between epistemic probability and physical probability. There's no expectation divergence, but it's enough to change my actions.

Specifically, if I'm given the ability to make the universe split in two, and I die painlessly in one, and gain some benefit in the other, then, barring certain caveats about selfishness and other possible problems, I will take that option.

If I'm offered the same thing, but instead of splitting, we flip a coin, and I don't believe in a multiverse, then I would /not/ take it. This is despite the fact that my expectations are the exact same in each scenario.

This means that my expectation for what is "real" affects my actions, even though it doesn't affect my expectations for future observations, and even for a completely selfish individual.

I don't know if I could formalize that. I probably could, because it doesn't seem that paradoxical to me, but I haven't, nor seen anyone else who has.
