I think a better example is picturing metaphorical Death as a gardener. He watches a bush grow from a seed into a bush. The branches extend upwards and outwards into different directions, but he occasionally prunes the branches and they get snipped off.

(For sake of clarity, let's say that the Y axis is time, X/Z axes are the quantum bubbly decisional forks that OP refers to.)

There is no theoretical branch that escapes Death and grows up infinitely into Heaven. Based on empirical evidence of what I know of the world, I am certain that all of theoretical peasant's branches stop growing at some point, because even if he gets frozen perfectly in ice, the branches of his world-line, Galaxy-line, or whatever is higher that... ALL LINES END.

Be sad, but then be thankful you get to grow branches and think about this in a meaningful way at all.
