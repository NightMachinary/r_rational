Well, by "doomed" I meant that you are in a situation where 100% of timelines lead to death.

There's no such probability as 1.... You mean that out of the infinite timelines, there's at least some timelines where peasant's consciousness survives forever? So at any point where he could have died there's an identical version of him that kept living?

So there's an infinite amount of universes with infinite versions of everything.... So there's infinite identical versions of me.... And identical versions of me /are/ me....

So there's a version of a peasant who is tortured for infinity, there's a version of peasant who has sex with Emma Watson, there's a version of peasant that lived a billion years before the "original" one died...

At any point there's infinite versions of my consciousness that stop existing, and infinite versions of me doing everything that is possible to be doing.....

A weird thing to wrap your head around..... Seems like something is wrong with this logic....

Like "immortality" is a concept that deals with my personal consciousness, my experience as a living mind, and this theory doesn't just talk about immortality, but makes it irrelevant.... Because there's always infinite versions of everything happening to the piece of information that is "me"....

[these are just my rambling thoughts as I'm trying to think on the topic, sorry it's not very coherent....]
