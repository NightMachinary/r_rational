Perhaps I'm missing part of your argument here 'against betting in worlds where one does not exist'... but the whole point of life insurance is to bet on a timeline in which you cease to persist. The return benefit is not intended for you, but rather your spouse or family.

You seem awfully confident that the probability of death does not = 1. Ignoring scenarios of afterlife/dimensional transcendence, future life-preserving 'technologies', or other similar shenanigans, please state in plain English how you intend to explain away the heat death of the universe. Or barring that, please give me several real-world examples of immortality that demonstrate how the probability of death is < 1.
