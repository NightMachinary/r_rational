The problem with quantum immortality is not in the anthropics; in fact, anthropics is the counter to quantum immortality. Post facto, any observer must realize that they survived, and that survival was absolutely necessary to be an observer. 'In 100% of the worlds that I could possibly observe, I survived.' The problem is that quantum immortality is conditioning on this and treating the conditional probability as the total. Say you have a 50% chance of surviving some event. The point of anthropics is that actually there are 50% of worlds where you did not survive, even though you observe survival as 100% likely. Now then, what happens when all possible worlds contain your death? You /die./ Conditioning on your survival, you see the same 100% survival rate, but the conditioning probability is 0.

I believe I understand anthropics. Is there anything you know you're particularly confused about?
