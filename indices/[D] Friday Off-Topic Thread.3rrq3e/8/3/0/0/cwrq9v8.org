OK:

- If I repeatedly survive a potentially-lethal event by "pure chance" over and over, does that strongly imply that the events /would/ have killed me, or strongly imply that I was mistaken about how likely they were? Or is it not strong evidence either way?

- If /Earth/ avoids - say, an asteroid impact - thanks to a hilarious string of coincidences; does that suggest it would probably have killed us, or just that it would have massively reduced the population?

- Does any of this impact your attitude to the Doomsday Argument at all, or vice versa? That definitely confuses me, and I kind of mentally label it "anthropics", but I'm not sure it's the same thing.

- If I create a copy of myself and then one of me is instantly killed, do I have a 100% chance of ending up as the copy - as if I just teleported a foot to the left? Or is that just survivorship bias, and I had a 50-50 chance of dying?

- If I create two copies of me, give one a red ball and one a blue, and split the "blue ball" copy into two ... do I have a 2/3rds chance of receiving the blue ball, subjectively, or 1/2 chance? (Modified Sleeping Beauty problem.) Or do I have some kind of 50%-now-but-66%-later probability that varies over time?
