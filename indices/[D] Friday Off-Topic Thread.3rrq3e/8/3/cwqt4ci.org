Firstly, for practical reasons, I think I recall reading that sufficiently "improbable" quantum events run out of quantum stuff to represent them and are probably destroyed. You're not literally lining in a world where everything happens with some small-but-nonzero probability; you're living in a world where certain events "split" events in half, or split off two-thirds, or whatever.

"Zero and one are not probabilities" is a fact about epistemology, not physics.

With that said, I don't /think/ I buy that this is how anthropic probability works. I don't think I even understand anthropic probability looking /backwards/, let alone /forwards/, but ...

I think if you say "X would have killed me with 99% probability, and Y would have killed me with 1% probability, but we've no other evidence so /who knows/ which one happened?" then you'd be wrong like 99% of the time.

So that's probably /not/ how it works - you can probably treat "I'm not dead" as evidence, which in turn means "I'll die" must have some specific probability, unless we're throwing Bayes out the window here.
