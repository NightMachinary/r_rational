  There's a lot of threads about munchkining, brainstorming, or exploiting hypothetical situations. I love these threads a lot and I wish there was more of them, participating and reading responces is very enjoyable. But I've read several comments about people disliking these threads, saying that there's too many of them and that they don't really fit on [[/r/rational]]. So, do you think maybe we should create a weekly thread, or a subreddit for that kind of stuff?

As one of those people, it's not that I don't think they fit here, it's that a lot of them are low effort. If the prompt is just "you can move backward in time up to five minutes" then you just end up with lots of questions before you can even get to the meat of it. I would like those threads much better if they started with "here's what I came up with in the first five minutes". Worse, someone will just say "rational X?" which is a complete miss for me and usually earns a downvote.

(I'm generally against talking too much about works before they're complete, but that's because of my belief that it saps a large amount of the incentive to read/write.)
