On the one hand, Pallaiko is an idiot that never should have been put in charge of anything, and is childish, generally overconfident, and cringeworthy.

On the other hand, it's quite realistic IMO, and I could see a person like him riding the wave of one disastrous success after the other to get to where he is.
