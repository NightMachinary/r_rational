  If the rate of people who will have a medical problem is lower than the cost of the preventative care divided by the cost of the treatment, then it's a net negative.

That's what I'm questioning here. I suspect that the cost of preventative care is vastly cheaper then the cost of treatment, because public sector spending seems to be a lot more affective then private sector funding.

Obviously the data is pretty limited. You seem a lot more certain of this then I am, do you have citations?

  Why on earth would you assume that all medical issues would fall on one side of that dividing line?

/All/ medical issues don't have to, we're still talking statistics, right? I'll chalk that up to a poor turn of phrase.

  Now you're moving goalposts.

The general hypothesis is that preventative healthcare will provide a lot more utility then reactive healthcare, and that capitalism disencentivices preventative healthcare.

We don't have a lot of data on the subject, there are a lot of distracting factors clouding the data, so it's difficult to say.

Going to the doctor is like a reverse lottery. You can avoid it, save some money, and you /probably/ won't lose big.

That's just one example of the whole "captured value vs created value" thing. Something a bit closer to my heart is open source software. Getting software to interpolate is /hard/, but it becomes an order of magnitude easier when you can freely access the relevant source code. Programming moves too fast and code quality varies too widely for any kind of system like academic journals to make sense. The only practical option (right now at least) when you want to reduce those barriers to interoperability is releasing the code in full.

The entire internet is built almost entirely on open source. Reddit is open source, all the webservers you use are open source probably running on an open source operating system, the web browser you're reading this on is open source, your phone is open source, etc.

Open source is necessary for the internet to function, because most of the things you can try to do to capture your codes value actually decreases the value a lot, because they mean your code is less able to interopolate.

But that lack of a mechanism for open source code to capture value had led to some pretty [[https://medium.com/message/how-i-explained-heartbleed-to-my-therapist-4c1dbcbe1099][bad consequences]].

There are a lot of places where mechanisms to capture value significantly reduce the value of the work. See "golden screwdriver" for yet another example.
