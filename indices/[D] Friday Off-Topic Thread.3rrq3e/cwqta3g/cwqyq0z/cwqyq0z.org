Henry David Thoreau has a good take on it in reference to government:

#+begin_quote
  Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them. They think that, if they should resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults, and do better than it would have them?

Corporations/people/governments get good at doing one thing, and become complacent. They then try to protect the thing they are doing well, and vehemently oppose all efforts to change for the better because it hurts their livelyhood. Blockbuster, Tower Records, etc, all faced the same problem, an outright refusal to accept that their old profit models were no longer tenable in this world due to changing technology.

To understand why they don't, you have to understand the capitalist and the profit motive. The profit motive incentivizes a capitalist to strictly increase the accumulated wealth he has. Chasing new technology runs the risk of losing wealth, which is antithetical to accumulation. In aggregate capitalists very rarely take risks to their accumulation, even when it would be beneficial for all in the long run. Short sighted quarterly profit doesn't care about structural analysis and sustainability. So you end up with these corporations trying to protect old profit models, and cutting costs, slowly dying, instead of shedding their skin and being reborn with new technologies and methods.

tl;dr: Corporations preferentially protect the profit they have instead of chasing new, un-tested profit.
