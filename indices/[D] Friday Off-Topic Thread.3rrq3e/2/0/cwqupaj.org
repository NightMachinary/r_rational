  Why are hugely wealthy entities (be they people or corporations) so stagnant, relative to the power their wealth enables?
#+end_quote

It really depends how they got the wealth, but let's list out some obvious reasons:

- There are upkeep costs to huge amounts of wealth, since there's an extreme scarcity of places to invest gajillions of dollars of capital for very high returns with very low risk. You or I can say, "woot, a year's salary, let me stick that index funds". A lifetime's salary can't be invested that same way without being murdered by inflation.

- Loss aversion, straight up.

- Debt load and other general forms of illiquidity. Many large-scale fortunes are simply not liquid. They are often weighed down by repayment obligations with various time-scales. It's hard to pour everything into fusion-power research when you need to repay bonds next week.

- The actual costs of running the business that generates the massive wealth can be, well, very large. Not so large the capital base can't handle them, but enough that the capital base can't keep the company running /and/ put everything into fusion-power research.

Those are generic to practically every large enterprise.

  This may be a bad example, but consider: In America, Internet Service Providers infamously hate doing anything to improve the lines in comparison to other nations. Why? They have nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying to capture bigger future markets than just squatting on the present one.

Now let's address some structural issues, mostly via plausible speculation that might be totally wrong but fuck it:

- Wealth inequality and knowledge inequality go together. If your average cable-company CEO wanted to invent fusion power, what the fuck would he know about whose research to subsidize or how it all works? He mostly knows about cable and finance, /if that/. Worse, an American cable-TV CEO is far less likely to have had a really good technical education than someone in, say, some other country where the best technical universities are state-supported and cheap-or-free.

- Short-termism. Most leaders can't enact policies their job-security can't cover and be confident everything turns out at all, let alone right. This especially applies in a day and age where job security is very low, even for CEOs and such, so a 20-year program of investment and research is hard to run.

- Incentives! Capitalism gives incentive to generate /profits/, not /value/. This is why the thing with the ISPs and cable companies: if they've won a monopoly or can rent-seek on something else (land in Manhattan, for instance), they've achieved a local maximum, and their incentive function is going to read anything other than exploiting that local maximum as a "decrease" in net utility. This becomes a stronger effect when short job tenures are normal, because personal ideology and belief can make less impact when the leader knows he'll be replaced in a few years.

- Ignorance! Most people don't really believe in science, except as "that thing which happens in laboratories and big white coats". Their knowledge base is so far from the research frontier that they tend not to have any idea how much remains undiscovered. This lack of knowledge also makes it harder to know where more R&D effort would be helpful.

- Disturbing lack of faith! Again, /most people don't really believe in science/, not the actual scientific method and /certainly/ not that /ever-so-outdated/ modernist ideology about "better living through science". In fact, a great many people believe that scientific knowledge /makes things worse/, and that /real/ problems are solved by changing people's personal behavior or through "virtue" or through "opening our minds" or through religion or some other nonsense.

- They're busy buying politicians! Hard to buy scientists when you're busy with these other costly public servants who don't add to next year's bottom line.

- Lack of connections. So you want to invent fusion power! Again: who do you talk to? If you can find their office via online listings, how do you make an appointment when you're just /some guy/ with a lot of money, and /they're/ as busy as you are?

- Disturbing lack of vision!
