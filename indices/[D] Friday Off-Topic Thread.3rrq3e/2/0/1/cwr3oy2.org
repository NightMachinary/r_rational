A quibble on incentives. Capitalism does typically force you to generate value. (Try selling something that everyone agrees is worthless) But value is tougo to nail down (see all the fan duel commercials) But the incentives of the stock market can be notoriously short sighted. Then again elected officials often cannot see past the next election.

I would place the blame on the agency problem (managers , including CEOS who have goals differing from owners)
