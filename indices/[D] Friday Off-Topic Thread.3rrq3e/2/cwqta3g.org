[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pwxo5/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cwa5fvj][Continuing to ask]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3quhyp/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cwimhrl][unanswerable questions]], here's another one: Why are hugely wealthy entities (be they people or corporations) so stagnant, relative to the power their wealth enables? Outliers like Elon Musk or even the Koch brothers are just that, outliers. There are millions of people with the funds to do "newsworthy" things, but I feel like I only ever hear about the same thirty or so people or conglomerates doing anything.

This may be a bad example, but consider: In America, Internet Service Providers infamously hate doing anything to improve the lines in comparison to other nations. /Why?/ They have nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying to capture bigger future markets than just squatting on the present one.

Hm... a better way to put it is: Why do powerful entities find one utility-generating method that works, then run it into the end of time, instead of trying to get ahead of the curve and thus get richer than the curve?
