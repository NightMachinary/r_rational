Hey, everyone! There's a few things I wanted to talk about:

1. There's a lot of threads about munchkining/brainstorming/exploiting hypothetical situations. I love these threads a lot and I wish there was more of them, participating and reading responces is very enjoyable. But I've read several comments about people disliking these threads, saying that there's too many of them and that they don't really fit on [[/r/rational]]. So, do you think maybe we should create a weekly thread, or a subreddit for that kind of stuff?

2. Several months ago I have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3foue8/i_have_created_a_chat_room_for_us/][attempted]] to create a chat for this community. A few people really liked the idea(42 signups in total), but that wasn't enough to sustain conversation, so the experiment failed. The main problem was that the sign up process on slack was difficult, and not everybody liked the platform. I should've discussed that with people here first. So, do you think we should repeat the experiment? What do you think about that idea?

3. I have recently created myself a [[https://medium.com/@rayalez][blog on medium]], so I wanted to share it here. As I'm learning to write, I post my scifi stories over there. They are not "rationalist" - I'm not very good at writing rationalist stories yet - but I still think they are pretty fun, people seem to like them, so come check them out =)

4. What do you, as writers and readers, think about Medium? I have been very fascinated with this platform recently, it seems pretty cool, and I would really love to hear your thoughts about it. Do you like it? What do you think they are doing right(or wrong)? Do you have a blog over there?

5. I am listening to "Harmontown" - amazing and hilarious podcast made by Dan Harmon, a genius creator of TV shows "Community" and "Rick and Morty". If you are into that stuff - you sould check it out. You can begin by watching "Harmontown" movie. It doesn't have anything in common with rational fiction, except that it's clever, I love it passionately, and I believe that you will enjoy it.
