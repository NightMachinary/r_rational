Feel free to ask whatever you'd like, but I'm not sure how much help I could give you because I pretty much write the way I think. I haven't really looked at any writing guide since high school, and if one said something that didn't match my taste, I'd ignore it anyway. I know I have weaknesses in writing; I think I'm worst at developing a set of characters that work well together (so it helps when I can use someone else's).
