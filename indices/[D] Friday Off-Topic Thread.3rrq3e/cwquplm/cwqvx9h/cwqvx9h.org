Yeah, I wish I could get some hints from [[/u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/qbsmd]], and others.

Though from what I understand, "writing" and "rationalist" are pretty much separate skillsets.

"rational" part is mostly about knowing science, philosophy, and beig smart enough to exploit things, and all that is discussed on LW.

"writing" part is the same as non-rationalist writing, and is discussed elsewhere.

It seems like writing rtf comes down to knowing and liking "rationalist" topics, /and/ being able to write good fiction in general.

So from what I can see, there is no "writing rational fiction" technique. There's just "general writing technique", and "having rationalist ideas to write about". Maybe that is why people do not have a lot to discuss.

Although, if there's any discussion on the subject - I'd be happy to participate!
