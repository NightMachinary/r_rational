You are correct in that the article i linked is not the most accurate source of info, unfortunately i wasn't aware of an article which was more accurate. If you want the most accurate info you should head over to [[http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=38577.msg1440938#msg1440938]] and follow the messages by "star-driver", he is the guy from NASA actually involved with the experiments.

From what i could gather of the messages there the data is very positive, but he can't give the actual data spreadsheets because of NASA procedures which require it first be peer reviewed and whatnot, so it will only be released on the first half of 2016.

But basically what he said is they managed to significantly dampen the Lorentz forces that may effect the experiment, and they built a model which is giving them the estimated force from the heat radiation, and still the anomalous thrust remains.

re: physics is fundamentally flawed, physics is not my specialty but a bunch of guys on that board seem to suggest that there are a couple of theories that explain this without breaking conservation of momentum. one of them required an extra spatial dimension, but i heard a bunch of times suggestions that it is possible there are a few more dimensions.

regarding the skepticism, i agree that skepticism is in order, but i don't think its either you completely accept that we now have reactionless drive or we assume its 100% not possible. I think the fact that the EMdrive reached the point where it is now implies that the probability it is real is much higher than some random theory that enables some technology. it may only be 20% or even only 2% that it will pan out, but even such probability is noteworthy when you consider the possible effects of such a discovery. of course the effects of the discovery will depend on the efficiency of the drive, which at the moment is anywhere between "only relevant for long term space exploration over 10s of years" to "we can have flying cars". for which we also have some data to make predictions with [[http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/xindex.php,qaction=dlattach,3Btopic=38577.0,3Battach=1076410,3Bimage.pagespeed.ic.Uq54kPxn5u.webp]] .

Anyhow my point specifically for this forum\reddit is that it seemed like something out of a writing prompt, so i figured it would be interesting just for that value and for the fact that even if the probability for it living up to its maximum potential it is extremely low, it is still currently the closest we have ever had to some technology which will propel humanity to space exploration which seemed like something many people here were in favor of.
