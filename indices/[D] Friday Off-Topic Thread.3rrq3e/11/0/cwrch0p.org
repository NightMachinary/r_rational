That article is clickbait; what it should say is not "EmDrive thruster really works" but "some possible sources of error have been eliminated by new tests".

One of two things is true:

- There's a currently unidentified source of error which will render the EmDrive practically useless once found.
- Our understanding of basic principles of physics (conservation laws) is fundamentally flawed.

Extreme skepticism is warranted; don't go getting hyped.
