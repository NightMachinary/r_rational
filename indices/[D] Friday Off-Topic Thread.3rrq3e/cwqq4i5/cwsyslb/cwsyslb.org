There is actually a pretty nice interpretation of QM that doesn't lead to many worlds and the associated shenanigans. It's called quantum bayesianism. The basic idea is that QM is about observations and our bets (predictions) on them and our state of knowledge is encoded within state vectors. Within that framework the whole quantum collapse issue seems rather silly, since the "collapse" is actually a bayesian update of probability distributions associated with a quantum state and the discontinuity makes perfect sense.

It's a beautiful interpretation and provides an interesting counterpoint to many-worlds as far as thought experiments like this go.
