You would agree that changes to a person's mind don't constitute a death of experience, correct? Bashing your head on a wall and losing a few brain cells maintains your experience?

I'll assume this to be true, because it's somewhat idiotic to say otherwise. So, imagine that you have a monotonically decreasing mind. Your brain is not growing, and it is losing a random brain cell every thousandth of a second. We have around 86 billion neurons, so this process takes about 2.7 years. Your mind grows increasingly simpler; imagine Charlie from Flowers for Algernon, and your experience is maintained throughout the entire process. But it doesn't stop at the level of mentally challenged adult. You gradually lose all higher functions, becoming akin to a paralyzed animal or infant, simplifying further and further, until you're no more than an ape, a monkey, a lemur, a vole, a worm. A bundle of nerves. A single neuron. Then nothing.

Your experiential complexity has decreased smoothly. Even if some sort of quantum immortality or 'fungibility' (from Balthasar999) held at some point in the process, you would not continue experiencing things from the level of your original self, or even from the level of a particularly challenged human. Your experience is not especially differentiated from that of a monkey's, or a vole's. You're made of the same mental construction.

Your experiential observation is not Platonic, it is the effect of there being a complex substrate that calculates it. When the complex substrate transforms, the experiential observation transforms with it. In the cosmically slow process of, say, a car crash, your brain is shocked and battered, even breached by foreign material, and the computation of experience continues, even as brain cells fail and connections are disrupted. Your /mind/ is irrevocably damaged. The causal processes that used to /have the effect/ of analyzing information and directing action in a manner identified with intelligence are instead made to have entirely different and not nearly so intelligently-identifiable effects.

This question comes down to the metaphysical. I am theoretically an adherent of mathematical Platonism, but the unyielding consistency that I have observed in reality makes me question that. If there are Tegmark worlds that contain the exact same mind as myself, then why have I not observed myself being entirely wrong about reality and history? Is it really that much more likely that I am a mentally healthy individual in the world that I expect to be real rather than a delusional sot in any of an infinite plethora of alternative worlds? If fungibility is real, then why is the only fundamentally incorrect experience I have been that of the Berenstain Bears being spelled Berenstein?

I suppose I could hypothesize that the memories themselves change with the alternate histories. But if my memories themselves change, then how can I even say that this 'fungible self,' this immortal kernel, can even be identified with me? If fungibility is real, then is it not more likely that I am (at any particular instant) actually a historical simulation of more advanced descendants of this universe? Or astronomically more likely that I am in any number of possible simulations of alternate physics in any number of possible real physics?

I'm going to read the Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover again. But ultimately, the answer to this question comes down to whether you consider your experience to be a cause of the material effects you observe, or to be an effect of the material causes.
