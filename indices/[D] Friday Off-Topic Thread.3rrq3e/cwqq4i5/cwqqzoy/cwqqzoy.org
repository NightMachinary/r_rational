I'm fairly sure most of this community doesn't think quantum immortality is real - it's an amusing but flawed thought experiment.

  No. You should actually expect to survive 100% of the time. Your memory will never contain the event of your death. You will never experience the loss of a bet that was on your own survival.

You're confusing the event of my death with the memory of it. Just because I don't experience or remember a thing, doesn't mean it hasn't happened to me. Tree falling in the woods, and all that.

By the same token, should it be impossible to forget anything? Since you can't experience forgetting things - you'd have to be consciously thinking about the thing at the very instant you forget it, which is obviously contradictory.

  There is no point in investing in future universes where you don't exist, because you will never exist in a universe where that investment pays off.

Other people will exist in those universes. I like some of these people. I want them to be happy.
