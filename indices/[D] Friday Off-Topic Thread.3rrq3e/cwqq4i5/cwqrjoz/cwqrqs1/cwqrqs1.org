As I said, there's no such probability as 1 or 0. So if Schrodinger's box has decided to kill you, then sometime in the next week, something is going to happen to get you out of it. That's vanishingly unlikely, though, so Schrodinger's box is very likely to simply decided not to kill you at the beginning and you're therefore unlikely to wind up in that situation. If you're being eaten by a shark in the middle of the ocean, well, /something's/ going to happen to save you, but it's once again so unlikely that your winding up in that situation in the first place is unlikely.

And yes, universes where you have ceased to exist do exist, but you don't exist in them. They're as beneath your concern as universes where you never existed.
