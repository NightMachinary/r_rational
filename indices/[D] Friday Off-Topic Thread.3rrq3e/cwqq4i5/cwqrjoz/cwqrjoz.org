I don't know a lot about the topic, but I have questions:

- What if the substance in Schrodinger's box doesn't kill me immediately, but let's say after a week? Wouldn't a consciousness of a guy who lived in the box for a week before dying be different from the consciousness of a guy who survived? So that they wouldn't be identical, and the guy who lived for a while in a "doomed" timeline dies?

- Just because there's no point in investing in the future universes where you die, doesn't mean that there's no such universes. You discard all the outcomes that lead to your death because they are useless for planning, for practical purposes, for guiding your actuons as a rational afent, but not because they don't exist. If you are "doomed", if you are being eaten by a shark in the middle of the ocean it may be /useless/ to bet on outcomes where you stop existing, but you still can expect that you will stop existing.

Or am I horribly misinterpreting something?
