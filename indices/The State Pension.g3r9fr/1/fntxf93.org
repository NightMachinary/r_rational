Can...can....can I opt out? I rather live poor than risk my life for riches and glory.

I know, I know. I'm a pathetic one-worlder, but gosh darn it! I never entered in the lottery while growing up, and I just don't have any experience with gambling like all of you rich sobs out there.

It might be silly and old-fashioned of me, but I reeeeally don't feel comfortable entering into any [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vYsuM8cpuRgZS5rYB/lotteries-a-waste-of-hope][lotteries]] out there.
