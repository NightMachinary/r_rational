also RE: romance novels, I'm writing one, three chapters are on AO3 and I'm ~mostly committing to posting another three chapters (+ three interludes) this year.

I'm not committing to them being the same quality as the first three though as I am not sure if my editor will get them back to me before I go on my sabbatical, but I gave him the first chapter at the beginning of December and despite repeated reminders it's not looking like they'll be done before the end of May, which is when I hope to queue them.
