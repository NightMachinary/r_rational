I skimmed Jane Eyre a bit when I read it for AP Literature, which means I'm qualified to make assertive statements about the contents inside of it. Personally, when I read it, I didn't think Jane Eyre was particularly concerned with being realistic. It's filled with conveniences for the sake drama and tension, like Rochester's mysterious and tragic backstory, or the tree that he proposes too Jane under splitting because of a lightning strike that very night. Or Jane surviving the act of wandering through the English countryside in the middle of a storm with no food or water until she /happens/ to stumble across a church.

In an ideal world all of those old romance novels would trade plot-realism for character-realism, but Rochester alternates between abusive and caring for basically no reason. If he was reasonably motivated, he wouldn't have let his immense lust for his new [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governess][secretary]] overpower his common sense. And maybe he would have sought actual help for his first wife, instead of locking her in the attic and then brooding over it for the rest of his sorry life. Speaking of, supposedly she was the way she was because she went /insane/, which was treated with all the nuance and intelligence you would expect out of a novel from the period where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria][insane women were locked in asylums and treated with genital mutilation]].

I'm sorry if someone else here has read the book and has a higher opinion of it than I do - like I implied, I'm not super confident about the assumptions I'm making here. What I do know is that looking for rationality in a story written nearly two-hundred years ago is almost a lost cause.
