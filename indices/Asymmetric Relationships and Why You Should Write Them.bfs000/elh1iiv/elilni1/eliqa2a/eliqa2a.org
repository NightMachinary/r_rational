  I think it's important to remember that we read fiction (particularly fantasy and sci-fi) because it's more fun than our day-to-day lives.

This is a statement of personal preference. There are lots of reasons that people read fiction, not all of which are about fun. Sometimes we read to get a different perspective, because something is emotionally resonant, because it gives us a feeling that we're in need of, etc., not all of which are analogous to fun.

To stop reading something because you didn't find it fun anymore is completely fine, but I really disagree with the notion that fun is the only reason that people read, or more to the point, what authors should strive for when writing.
