Whether or not it's justifiable has nothing to do with whether or not it happened in canon - it only matters whether or not it makes sense within the context of the story. Even in /Young Justice/ letting Nabu take over Giovanni Zatara was ambiguous and poorly thought out - it contrasts with the characterization we've come to expect from the Justice League, and it only really serves to emphasize the divide between the Team and the professional heroes. A /rational/ story wouldn't let the event happen at all, although maybe in a more polite way than Renegade did. And it would have handed over the capability to make that decision to the people that should logically have it - the Justice League. The only reason the burden should be on the shoulders of the author-inserted character is authorial fiat.

Fanfiction only has to resemble canon if you allow it to. If you migrate something from canon that doesn't make sense, and then the /only/ change you make is that you [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging][point out it doesn't make sense]], that doesn't mean you've fixed the problem. You've just made it /your/ problem. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzocnfLccs8][If someone starts pissing in the middle of the street]], shouting: "I'm pissing in the middle of the street!" doesn't absolve them of the very real crime of pissing in the street. In fact, it makes it worse, because it demonstrates that they were /aware/ of their own poor behavior.

The self-insert spends literal /years/ whinging about how strange and illogical it is that his role models would do such a thing, when the only reason it happened at all was that the author made the arbitrary decision that it should. This is another one of those situations where the author really should have /listened/ to what his characters were telling him. Why /yes/, this plot point does happen to make no sense whatsoever - why don't we just not do it?
