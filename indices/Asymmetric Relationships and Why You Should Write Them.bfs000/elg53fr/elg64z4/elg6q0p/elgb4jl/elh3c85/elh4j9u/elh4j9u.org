I'm not saying the plot couldn't have been done justice the way it was in the original, necessarily, just that it would have been harder for no reason in particular. Every dead-man's switch, magically binding contract, and hour of prep-time is another complication tacked on to the end of the plot. But if Zoat had bothered with all that (which he didn't) it doesn't get rid of the stink of improvisation. Nabu suddenly acting more competently after the deal has been struck doesn't eliminate the fact that the circumstances that led up to the deal are kind of stupid. Like, if Nabu waited for hundreds of years in some tomb in the ass-end of Egypt only to agree to a timeshare in Kent Nelson's body, why is he jumping at the bit for a full-time position after only forty years of neglect in the Tower of Fate?

(This argument continues ad infinitum - maybe the post hoc explanation for that is that Nabu witnessed Chaos commit an act of mass terrorism. But that only pushes the scrutiny further down the line. Is chaos so much more dangerous now than it was in the two thousand years he was just chilling out in a cave? /Why?/ Oh - it's the Light? More complication! Why are there suddenly more evil acts of superterrorism /now?/ The point isn't whether you /can/ come up with an explanation for this - with enough time and effort, of course you can. The point is that, for each explanation you have to come up with on the fly, you're spending exactly that much /more/ effort than you would have had the initial plot been sane enough that it didn't draw scrutiny in the first place. That's more effort than a plot point that was barely thought out in canon deserves.)
