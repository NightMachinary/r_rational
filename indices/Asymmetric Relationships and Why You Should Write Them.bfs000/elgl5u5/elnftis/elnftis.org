Personally, I thought Jane Eyre did a fantastic job at creating realistic characters. Everyone in that story is struggling with a difficult situation, and they all have different ways of handling it.

Jane Eyre: A plain woman with no money, connections or family. Can't express herself freely, has to constantly act like a proper English woman of her station, and has a very small chance of carving out a meager life for herself. When she finally gets a chance for real happiness, she has to decide if she's willing to sacrifice her principles to obtain it. Her constant struggle is to find a way to be true to both sides of her nature, the head and the heart.

Edward Rochester: Passionate rich man who lived a life of dissipation. Could always get what he wanted with his money, until he was struck by tragedy. After learning to live with unhappiness, he sees a chance at freeing himself, and rationalizes himself into thinking it's okay.

St. John Rivers: Polar opposite of Rochester. He is a kind, noble person who is also very cold and austere, in part because religion demanded it of him. He gives up the opportunity of happiness with a girl he likes, to go abroad as a missionary, because it was the more logical choice.

While some fiction elements of this story are classic gothic tropes (scary dreams, ghosts, etc.), that doesn't really undermine how real the characters are. The story brings up a lot of social issues that affected the people of that time period, especially regarding how women and the poor were treated by society. But it's still a relevant and relatable story today because of how the characters dealt with the hand that life gave them.
