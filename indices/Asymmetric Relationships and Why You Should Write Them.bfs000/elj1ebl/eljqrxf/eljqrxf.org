That's a needlessly agressive way to put it. For one, I made it perfectly clear that romantic comedies and television shows do this - I'm not claiming that this is exclusively in the domain of rational fiction. Just that stories like /Worth the Candle/ use it on a completely new scale. And putting a new coat of paint on it is /important/, because sometimes it's hard to tell what parts of traditional writing are compatible versus what parts are holdovers from hundreds of years ago.
