In a sense. But I think it requires /tremendously/ more effort to retrofit logic into a setting that didn't have any (or selectively applied it) than it does to go with your gut and write something better. Writers are not infallible, and classical superhero writers even less so.

(Zoat disregards canon when he wants to anyway. What that implies, at least to me, that he either made the conscious decision to keep that fuckawful plot point, or somehow forgot that he could just change things whenever he wanted to.)
