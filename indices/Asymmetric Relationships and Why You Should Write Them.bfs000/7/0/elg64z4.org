Having read more of /With This Ring/ than I honestly should have, I think it squarely falls into the /maybe/ category. On the one hand, the author is really good at mixing things up by having the social modeling of the SI go awry. Jade's reaction to Grayven's annihilation of the Light is a prime example of this, and what makes the following arc one of the author's best. On the other hand, he has the disconcerting tendency to just /forget/ that characters have agency outside of what they're like in the show and comics - Luthor insisting on remaining EVIL and the Justice League's reaction to Nabu being the premier examples of this - the only reason those plots play out the way they do is because the author failed to consider those characters as wholy realized humans the way he does with the others. The fact that he gets it /half right/ is one of the most persistently infuriating things about the series.
