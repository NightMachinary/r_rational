Anyone's thoughts on the relationships in With This Ring? There's definitely some degree of mismatch, in both the Paragon and Renegade timelines, although it's further complicated by superpowers giving more obvious gaps between them.

Paragon and Jade are particularly interesting because he has empathic vision, letting him literally see how she's feeling, know that it doesn't exactly mirror what he's feeling, and work on that.
