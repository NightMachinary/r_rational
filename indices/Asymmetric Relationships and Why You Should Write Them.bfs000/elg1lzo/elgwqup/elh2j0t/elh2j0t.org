  That opening sentence = whiplash.

You know when you start a paragraph on one point and then you get distracted and end on a completely different one? I have a bit of a problem with that. If you thought that was bad, I should post my first couple of drafts.

  Counterpoint: focusing on asymmetricality detracts from the relationship gestalt because the spotlight is split between what each character wants (skewing toward Machiavellian/utilitarian archetypes), rather than what they get and how that shapes the relationship's course.

I think it was a mistake to phrase it so much in terms of give/take. The giving and the receiving is part of the equation, but it's not always on the literal level. Two characters sitting out and literally negotiating the terms of their friendship would be counterproductive - which is also why, whenever that happens in /Worth the Candle/ or /HPMOR/ there's loads of stuff left implicit. Juniper seeks out relationships because he's still grieving over Arthur's death, and to a lesser extent, grieving over the friendships he tore apart in the wake of Arthur's death. Not only does he need allies in a utilitarian sense, he's also trying to slot people into his old worldview, which is why he isn't super introspective about people he's gathered into his new in-group until a crisis comes up. Draco /believes/ that he and Harry are exploiting each other for their own mutual gain, but he eventually realizes that what he got out of it didn't cost Harry anything at all, and that's when his character arc hit its peak.

The important part isn't that one character gets something from another. The important part is that they are /different people/ and have different emotional needs. It's that realism that I'm advocating for. Otherwise, the line between characters gets blurred. Which brings us to -

  In this case, if characters have clear goals and motives, that presupposes that they think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. And when all characters have psychological depth, it's pretty hard to write one-dimensional relationships.

I was going to mention this in the original essay but then I got distracted. Sure, you /can/ rely on plain ol' human intuition to fill in the blanks in your relationships, but if you do, you risk falling back on old habits informed from years of dumb media consumption. (if HPMOR feels more allegorical than organic, it's probably because of that) The same way I wouldn't advocate someone writing a level 1 intelligent character by saying: "Do it the same only /smart/ this time!" I wouldn't advocate writing a meaningful relationship using only your experience with other stories. That doesn't mean the source of self-awareness needs to be a focus on relationship asymmetry (although I would be flattered by that) - just that it needs to be /something/, otherwise you risk filling up stories with a jumbled mess.

Sure, if you're smart enough to write an intelligent character, it's /hard/ to write a relationship that doesn't have at least a little bit of depth. But not only is it still /possible/ that you might get it wrong, it's likely that you won't use that relationship to its full potential. If you get anything out of this, it's that you should treat the interactions between two people with the same care that you treat the people.

([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network][If you picture a group of characters as vertices on a graph, the intuitive way to connect them is with relationships as the edges]]; relationships are as much of a concrete mathematical object as characters are, whatever that means to you.)
