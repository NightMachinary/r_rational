I assume you've read it based on your comments about Wildbow's works, but in case you haven't I'd recommend Ward. I've only read until Arc 11, but thus far it's essentially one giant group therapy session with bouts of combat in between, but the combat also functions as group therapy.

Personally I find it unrealistic that everyone in a story would be doing some meta-analysis of their own emotional states and motivations, but as you mentioned, to each his own. I much preferred Worm's style where Taylor was often literally unaware of her own emotional reaction to things because she's offloading it onto her swarm.
