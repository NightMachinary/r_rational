I actually dropped it for similar reasons. The relationship drama was just too heavy for my tastes without providing sufficient payoff or reward for me as the reader for suffering through it.

I remember one particular instance that was quite a turnoff for me fairly early on where, in a flashback, one of the MC's female friends was psychoanalyzing him and his reaction to Arthur's death to his face in a very irritating way. I would never want to be friends with that kind of person in real life, but more importantly, I don't particularly want to read about them in fiction either.

I think it's important to remember that we read fiction (particularly fantasy and sci-fi) because it's /more fun/ than our day-to-day lives. When certain aspects of reality are missing from fiction, it becomes a detractor to the story for those of us who prefer rational fiction. *But that doesn't mean that the more reality you stuff into fiction, the better that fiction is.*

Fiction contains an implicit promise of a /satisfying payoff for anything the reader is made to suffer through/.

- If I sit through a boring info-dump or a lot of exposition or a description of fantasy mechanics, I should later gain some satisfaction from being able to better understand the world or predict a plot point or solve a mystery because of that information I put effort into reading, understanding, and remembering.
- If I'm feeling sympathetic pain for a character in a story because of their circumstances, I should later feel sympathetic catharsis or happiness when that pain is eliminated or avenged or ends up leading to something good instead.
- If an unpleasant aspect of reality is dragged into a fictional story even when it's not necessary, I similarly expect a payoff from that sooner or later (preferably sooner). So when that flashback character in WtC does annoying psychoanalysis on Joon, I will only feel it's worth it if he either has some kind of mental or emotional breakthrough because of remembering that event or if he establishes a new relationship that's refreshingly different from that old one.

That's one of the primary charms of storytelling as opposed to reality, so having the readers suffer along with the MC purely for the sake of realism and rationality is not something I can get on board with.

Asymmetric relationships are definitely more realistic and that asymmetry can absolutely be leveraged to make the story more interesting, but I don't think that focusing on that asymmetry for the sake of realism is a correct decision unless there is a satisfying enough payoff for the trouble.
