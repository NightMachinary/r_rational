  letting Nabu take over Giovanni Zatara was ambiguous and poorly thought out

  - it contrasts with the characterization we've come to expect from the Justice League, and it only really serves to emphasize the divide between the Team and the professional heroes. A

  rational

  story wouldn't let the event happen at all, although maybe in a more polite way than Renegade did. And it would have handed over the capability to make that decision to the people that should logically have it - the Justice League. The only reason the burden should be on the shoulders of the author-inserted character is authorial fiat.

Nabu asked for a guarantee that Zatara would put on the helmet. Zatara gave his word in backwards magic speak. Since Nabu considered that sufficient Zatara breaking his word most likely has consequences we aren't aware of. Zatara being unable or unwilling to follow through might have killed him, turned his magic against him or placed him within Nabu's power regardless.

​

Afterwards Nabu was an extremely powerful wizard with prep time. He could easily have set up various dead's man switches to secure his position, coerced the members of the justice league into magically binding agreements, spied on attempts to make plans against him, started a takeover of the surface magical community and eradicated chaotic practitioners like John.
