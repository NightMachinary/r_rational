I definitely agree that this is an enjoyable aspect of good writing and that it can accentuate various enjoyable aspects of rationalfics in many contexts, but I disagree that it's /itself/ a rational element. In terms of the intensional definition of ratfic as stories with consistent characters and worlds and so forth, it's neither sufficient nor necessary as a criterion. In terms of the extensional definition of ratfic as stories such that people who read this subreddit are likely to enjoy them, it might in some sense increase enjoyability, but not obviously moreso than any other way of adding depth to the story would.

So, while I think this is a good and interesting bit of writing advice that I may very well take as inspiration in my future writing, and that it's as relevant to ratfic authors as it is to other authors, I'm not convinced that your assessment of it as making a story /more rational/ is correct.

(Which, to be clear, isn't an attack against your posting it here, just a disagreement with a chunk of your content; I enjoy the various long how-to-write-well posts people make on this subreddit even when the posts' advice isn't ultimately all that particular to ratfics.)
