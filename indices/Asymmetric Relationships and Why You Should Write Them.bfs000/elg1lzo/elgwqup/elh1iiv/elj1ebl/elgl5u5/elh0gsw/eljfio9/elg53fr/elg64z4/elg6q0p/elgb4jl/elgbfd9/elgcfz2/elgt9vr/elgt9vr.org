Every once in a while Zoat will understand that some canon element is so bad and would have such negative impacts on the story that it's simply better to not integrate it into the story.

But generally he's painfully anal about following canon, even when not doing so would massively improve a part of the story and would make it so he doesn't have to bend himself into a pretzel to explain away some moronic decisions made by a previous author/executive.

It's been a point of contention that's been discussed in the thread more than once by his readers.
