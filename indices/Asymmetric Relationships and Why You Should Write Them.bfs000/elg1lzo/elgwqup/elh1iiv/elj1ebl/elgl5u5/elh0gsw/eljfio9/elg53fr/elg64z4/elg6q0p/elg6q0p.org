"characters have agency outside of what they're like in the show and comics"

I'm not sure what you're trying to criticise here. In the case of both Luthor and Nabu, the author showed two quite different ways of dealing with them, resulting in quite different outcomes in each timeline.

But he generally does try to let canon happen unless it is disturbed by ripples from the SI's actions. So, the League's reaction to Nabu is entirely justifiable. And since the Paragon timeline has never had the same insider view of the Light as Renegade, I think it's premature to say that Luthor is out of character. Especially since it's been established that one of his major character flaws is paranoia.
