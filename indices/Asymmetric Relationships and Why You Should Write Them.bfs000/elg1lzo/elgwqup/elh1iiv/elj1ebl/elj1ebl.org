You're just kinda repackaging a basic concept of effective relationship writing and calling it 'rational', dude. Yeah, well written relationships often have some sort of core disconnect or tension between the two people that they have to deal with as part of the conflict of the narrative. This is how most rom-coms work. Hell, this is how friggin' Fifty Shades of Grey works. It's not good at it, but it does it.

This sub really should take stock and figure out what is actually a feature of rational fiction, and what is an already existing principle of fiction writing that you're just giving a long winded coat of rationalfic paint to.
