I guess I was a bit loose with my words when I said "more fun". You're absolutely right. I guess a better description than "more fun" would be "more satisfying" or "more rewarding" or even "more condensed".

Nobody would ever read a complete moment-by-moment breakdown of the daily life of even the most interesting people on the planet since most of those details are boring and irrelevant to the reason the person is considered interesting to begin with.

Fiction has evolved well-known patterns to cope with this tendency of people to want to focus only on the interesting and relevant details. Of course, even in fiction, not /everything/ can be interesting. That wouldn't work for the story structure and it wouldn't allow delivery of details that are not interesting by themselves but that are necessary for the story. That's why fiction typically delivers its "payoff" according to a general pattern. When there's a long stretch of something that's not the "payoff", it's usually followed by something that /is/. Otherwise the reader won't stay engaged.

The "payoff" I'm referring to, within fiction, does not, of course, have to be "fun" or "happy" at all. It just needs to be "whatever fulfills the implicit promise" of the work, whether that's emotional resonance or catharsis or a different perspective, or a particular emotion or whatever. And it doesn't have to be only one of those things either. However, I think it's /usually/ fairly easy to draw a line between "stuff that's included to keep the story moving along or for the sake of realism or consistency or detail" ("story glue" if you will) and "the meat of the story" or "that which the reader feels as if they're gaining from reading the story" (what I previously referred to as "payoff", but that word implies resolution or release of tension, which isn't fully accurate).

Traditional story structure theory talks of rising action, climax, falling action, etc. This pattern typically repeats multiple times in a story, eventually reaching higher and higher heights. Every part of that curve is all the "meat" I was talking about earlier, but even within that category, there's still an implicit promise that when tension has accumulated for a while, it will be followed by a release of some sort. That's because tension building adds psychological discomfort to the reader which needs to be rewarded for the reader to feel satisfied.

My claim is that "story glue" and "meat" share a similar relationship. Reading "story glue" adds psychological discomfort (because it isn't the "meat" for which the person is reading the story), so if a reader "suffers" through it, they then need to be rewarded with "meat" or they'll become dissatisfied. That "story glue" should also eventually prove important to some future "meat" or else the reader will feel dissatisfied that they wasted their effort reading it. Therefore, /excessive/ detail and realism are often not good for a story and should be minimized except for when they can be considered "meat" in themselves.

That line between "story glue" and "meat" is not easy to draw at all in real life though. In real life, most details are not relevant to any particular aspect of your "story" that you may want to focus on. Most conversations and experiences don't significantly affect your mindset, your relationships, your progress toward your goals, or anything else. They're just "story glue". Any "story" you might tell about any aspect of your life would ignore most of those as irrelevant unless they're necessary to understand the story as a whole or are inherently interesting. When telling a story, /Conservation of Detail/ is important.

A story is only worth telling if it's in some way /extraordinary./ If you can perfectly predict how a story will go after being told the premise and the starting point, then it's not so much a /story/ as it is just a series of logically connected events. It's that /extraordinariness/ that is lacking from most parts of normal daily life that people seek when reading stories. There's a limit to the detail that can (or should be) included, so most of what's written in a story should either be relevant to some "arc" in one way or another or be the "glue" that holds the story together.

That's what I meant when I said that stories are "more fun" than reality. They're more condensed, they ignore the boring parts, they primarily focus on the extraordinary and interesting details, and they provide something that's not common in everyday life (even if it could in no way be classified as "fun"). Therefore, when a story strays too far away from those aspects in the name of realism, it feels like it's missing the point.

I believe that even for rational fiction, realism for its own sake when it's not also either interesting or extraordinary falls into the category of "story glue", so it should be omitted except where necessary in favor of focusing on the "meat" or "payoff" of the story.

Of course, different people consider different things interesting and people will feel different levels of psychological discomfort from the same event within a story, so there's no perfect standard. I guess I either have a lower tolerance for invasive, unhealthy, and toxic relationship drama in my fiction than other readers of WtC or I find it less inherently interesting which causes me to accumulate more perceived "debt" for having read it than others. So for me, while I won't say that it was completely irrelevant to the story or Joon's character growth, I didn't feel that I was adequately compensated for the psychological discomfort that reading it caused. It felt more like pointlessly detailed realism for the sake of realism rather than for the sake of using it to enhance how interesting or satisfying a future "payoff" would be.
