To each his own? I guess I can agree - it is very emotionally draining to read scenes like that. But I think it's relatively easy to find a middle-ground between constant group-therapy and action scenes.

(I had trouble with /Worth the Candle/ for the opposite reason - I felt like the plot kept dashing in to ruin a perfectly good group therapy story! Maybe both of us would be satisfied if Alexander Wales let the characters 100% solve their interpersonal issues before the next plot point came up, that way I would get resolution to the character drama and you would get to experience action uninterrupted.)
