That opening sentence = whiplash. Re: asymmetric relationship, I don't think it's so much a feature of /rational/ fiction as much as writing complex relationships applies to /fiction/ as a whole. It's also sort of implied by ratfic feature #2:

  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

The current sidebar definition was an active effort to move away from describing good fiction in general and distinguish /rational/ fiction. Unfortunately that also means some literary characteristics are left implicit. In this case, if characters have clear goals and motives, that presupposes that they think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. And when all characters have psychological depth, it's pretty hard to write one-dimensional relationships.

Counterpoint: focusing on asymmetricality detracts from the relationship gestalt because the spotlight is split between what each character wants (skewing toward Machiavellian/utilitarian archetypes), rather than what they get and how that shapes the relationship's course.

IMO, relationships are a weakness in WTC and HPMOR. In WTC, the weird asymmetry is expected from a DM-hand-selected cast of companions and there's always the suspicion that every character is some sort of commentary on Joon. But Joon's not prone to self-reflecting on his relationships and the relationships sit on the surface of that asymmetry and rarely poke beneath. Even now, it's not clear what Joon is /getting/ from his relationships. In HPMOR, the relationships suffer exactly from the asymmetry - they feel more allegorical than organic (though the story doesn't take itself seriously).
