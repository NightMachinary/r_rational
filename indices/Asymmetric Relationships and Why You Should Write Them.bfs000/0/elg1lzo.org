If we're already recommending Wildbow works, I have to throw a vote for [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. It's a coming-of-age story with a devious social manipulator as the main character, laced with Wildbow's trademarked biohorror and set in a Frankenstein-inspirated 1920ies America.

Sylvester is awesome if this kind of relationship interests you, because he's able to recognise such relationships (...when he's not mentally castrating himself to keep things from getting awkward) and he's then able to use these relationships to get people to do what he wants.

There's a fan-made [[http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/][audiobook]], but it's only up to Arc 6.5 at the moment.
