Flicker does the most difficult thing.

I ended up cutting a lot from this chapter either because they were cool bits that don't belong in this story, or because they were details the writer needed to write but the reader doesn't need to read.

Getting close to the end: 1 or 2 more chapters to wrap up Princess. Enjoy.
