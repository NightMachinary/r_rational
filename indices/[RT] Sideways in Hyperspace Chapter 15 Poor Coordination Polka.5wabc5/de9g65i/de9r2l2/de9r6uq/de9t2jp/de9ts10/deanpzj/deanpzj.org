It doesn't sound that way; they plan to evacuate us on the basis of us being warlike. Think of how we would evacuate a lion from an approaching forest fire.

On the other hand, if we launched any kind of effective attack, then at the very least, I would expect them to abandon us to the tender mercies of the Reshapers.
