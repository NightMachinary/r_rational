Humanity abysmally fails its first interstellar contact with stupidly shortsighted infighting, and you would fix this by attacking the aliens that are /still planning to evacuate us from the star-consuming galactic menace/, because they're just that much nicer than us, and you want to persuade them to instead leave us in the lurch?
