I'd say humanity both does and doesn't deserve the judgment that we're a bunch of liars. The aliens are essentially right that we're violent and warlike; the peace between Earth and Mars was always uneasy and based on the threat of mutually assured destruction. Which, incidentally, is what it took to make the fleets disengage here, the realisation that many had begun to die on both sides.

On the other hand, the allegation that everything that humans had said was a lie - that was based on the aliens' inability to accept that someone else could have discovered an FTL principle that they had not.
