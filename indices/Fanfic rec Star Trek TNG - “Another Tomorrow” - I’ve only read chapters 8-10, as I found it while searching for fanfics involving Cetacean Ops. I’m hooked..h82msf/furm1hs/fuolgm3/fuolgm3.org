This author has some of the crunchiest and most clear minded scenes I've ever seen in any fanfiction. In its serious, thoughtful tone, it reminds me of the official tie-in novel /The Buried Age/, one more Star Trek story I'd recommend to this audience in particular. The site isn't English, but the story is.

I found it while searching for fanfictions involving Cetacean Ops, so I joined the story /in media res/. +It appears to+ It definitely takes place between seasons 2 and 3, and coincidentally, I've been rewatching seasons 1 and 2 with my father. However, the introduction chapter (linked) is a framing story with Commodore LaForge.

I'll follow up once I've read more with if it's complete, apparently ongoing, or abandoned, and if it retains that air of quiet competence that made me post it here.
