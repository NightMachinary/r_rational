I'm sorry; I couldn't get past the first chapter because of the writing style. I used to read a lot of webcomics, and there's a tendency of webcomic fanfics to reduce everything to dialogue-dialogue-dialogue-action-action-dialogue without any space devoted to character reaction or introspection, or exposition about the setting. It's become something of a pet peeve, which this fic aggravated in spades.
