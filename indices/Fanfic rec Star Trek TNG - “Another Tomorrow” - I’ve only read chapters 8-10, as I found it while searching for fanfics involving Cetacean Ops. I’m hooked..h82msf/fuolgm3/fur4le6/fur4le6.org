Well, it was certainly interesting enough to speed through, but I'm left with a bit of a sense of 'Why?'. It was enjoyable enough, as any competent brief star trek novelization. I don't complain about the various relationship focuses. But I don't know that I learned anything new about any of the characters (The obvious bits with Jordi, and Riker's willingness for Bird-people aside) and they don't explore the conceit of the wrapping story (trans galactic drive), so it just kind of feels like having watched an episode and not anything more deeply gratifying.

It was fine?
