Might I suggest [[http://www.paultwister.com/lpt01/][The Tales of Paul Twister]]? It's about a man who gets pulled into a fantasy world, his natural advantage is a personal antimagic field (which is also a disadvantage, as he's immune to for example healing magic), and he makes his way by being a profession cursebreaker and thief.

He constantly uses names like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne in order to see if anyone recognizes them, indicating they are from Earth.

As a side project he started an academy of the sciences to start his own mini industrial revolution under the name Anthony Stark.

It's a very good series.
