From what I did read so far last time, it's not my cup of tea. It's not bad from what I read so far, but it wasn't really appealing.

I am not even sure why you have a reincarnated character if Earth knowledge didn't really play any significant role to the story even if it's simple as 'germ theory' or vague knowledge of scientific concepts. I am not asking for an industrial revolution, which is an unlikely scenario.

Anyway, what do I look for in fics nowday?

Support roles, less combat, civilization building, engineering, worldbuilding, logistics.

Though I do make certain exceptions for fics that doesn't have any of those if they are sufficiently good.
