While the main character is kind of a dick, I find myself liking a lot of the side characters quite a bit. Tong Da Hai for example is basically Cool Old Master combined with Reasonable Authority Figure. Akanai is basically a more bloodthirsty and proactive Karin of the Heavy Wind from Zero no Tsukaima. Taduk is the Old Master with a quirky personality (Hare Supremacy and his darling daughter).

Even Sumei and Mei Lin, the resident Tsundere and Genki Girls are alright, though I'm starting to root more for Adujan at this point.
