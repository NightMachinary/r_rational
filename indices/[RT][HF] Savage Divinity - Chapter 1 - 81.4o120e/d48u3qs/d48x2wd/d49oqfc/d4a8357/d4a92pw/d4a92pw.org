He's exactly the opposite of arrogant, he thinks he's shit compared to everyone around him even when he performs impressive feats, because he's ignorant about those feats being impressive, or his skills being impressive, as nobody tells him anything they assume he should know.

He causes fights because he's a lush who hates bullies, slavery, can't keep his mouth shut, and has basically no concept of Eastern face-saving or values, refusing to give in to corrupt nobility. Plus he can't help rubbing it in. This is not helped by everyone around him assuming he knows all of this and that he's doing it on purpose, /despite them raising him from a half-feral escaped slave child/ and having never actually taught him this stuff.

After the 7th time that happened I assumed it was a conceit of the genre that every single noble except Tong Da Hai's family were assholes.
