It sounded like a fun premise, but /man/ did it get boring. Started out good, and then there was chapter after chapter of Paul trying to woo this heart rendingly generic angel girl while barely anything happened, and it was all so stereotypical. After ten chapters of angel girl being literally the only other character of note, I still didn't give a toss about her. She could have died the very next line and I would have sighed in relief.

It read in all like a story that should be told round a camp fire, or as a bet time story. The prose was dry and dusty, and the characters lacked zest. I was a few chapters from the end of the first book and I just gave up reading.

Now granted it's not as bad as I'm making it sound. It's as good as a middle of the road fantasy novel that you'd find in a book store.
