There's another fic that I liked, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/leaves-of-grass-naruto-si.28246/][Leave of Grasses]] that does a much better job of using an Earth-born reincarnated character.

There's not going to be an industrial revolution or anything like that, but you at least know that there's some Earth influences running in the MC, so the reincarnation isn't a pointless feature.

It also managed to keep me interested despite the slow paced nature of the work. It's approaching eighty thousand words but I felt it's just the beginning.

So what is the difference between SD and Leaves of Grasses? If I have to summarize my gut feeling..it is that I don't care about SD, not the main character, the world, or even the side characters.
