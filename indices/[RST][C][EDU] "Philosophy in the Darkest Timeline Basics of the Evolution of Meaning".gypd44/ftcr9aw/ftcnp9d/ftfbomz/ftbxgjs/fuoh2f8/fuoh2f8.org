So is the reader assumed to be sone kind of stupid? Either way the neighbor was messing with "you," no need to fall apart and start throwing around big words you don't know the meaning of.

Like gaslighting or photosynthesis.

As for defining meaning, C is the wrong tool for the wrong job. Better philosophers have already tread this ground, and they didn't even need to use a quarter dozen data structures to do so.

I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm this annoyed is the abysmal use of second person combined with the smog superiority of the writing style. Ugh.
