Point A: the Manton Effect limits most targeted powers to affecting either living or nonliving things, not both. The most relevant examples are Regent, Panacea, and Gallant, none of whom can affect Endbringers.

Point B: I have read Worm /several/ times.

Point C: While telepathy is possible in the Wormverse, /general/ telepathy is not. WoG states that specific, specialized shards would be needed to create a working "template" of a human mind, which would work with other shards to generate telepathy. The Entities would have to deliberately design a shard with the ability to read the Simurgh's mind, which they obviously wouldn't - and arguably couldn't, depending on how exactly they created the Endbringers.

EDIT: And, as a point of order, the Simurgh is not telepathic.
