Point A: All powers are not the same. Clockblocker's power works on a a person as well as a sheet of paper, which is why is works on the Endbringers. A mind reading power would not work on the Simurgh any more than it would work on a rock.

Point B: /The Simurgh is not telepathic. The Simurgh is not telepathic./ Repeat it until it sinks in: omniscience is not the same thing as mind reading, any more than telekinesis is the same thing as having hands.

Point C: As I just said: WHILE TELEPATHY IS POSSIBLE IN THE WORMVERSE, GENERAL TELEPATHY IS NOT, as Wildbow explained [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wormverse-ideas-recs-and-fic-discussion-thread-40.311933/page-11#post-15208733][here]].

In order for a cape to read the Simurgh's mind, it would require a shard that contained a working model of the Simurgh's mind with which to interpret the brain she doesn't have. That would require the Entities intentionally /create/ such a model, which they wouldn't, ever, for about a billion reasons, starting with the fact that the Simurgh knows the truth about them and working towards the incredible danger of giving access to unrestricted omniscience to a random schmuck.

Moving on, we have issues with the fact that her mind is hosted entirely in her shard and therefore in another dimension, Manton limitations because she's inorganic, and the fact that she knows you're reading her mind and will probably kill you.
