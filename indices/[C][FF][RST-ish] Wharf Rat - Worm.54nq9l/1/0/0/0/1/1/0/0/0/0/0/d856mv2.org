What Doctor Mother did is in no way remotely the same thing as the deep memory reading powers described in the post that precipitated this whole thing. The two are so dissimilar, there's no point in lumping them under the term "mind reading" as you've been doing. Scanner allows her to pick up an incredibly vague stream-of-consciousness that doesn't even account for a quarter of a percent of the Simurgh's /surface thoughts,/ let alone her memories, and he's actually probably just scraping data off her shards' black boxes rather than decrypting her mind. Besides that, it's almost guaranteed that the Simurgh was faking the whole thing, just like she faked being subject to Thinker interference, being bound by the Endbringer schedule, all the limitations on her microtelekinesis, being killed by Scion in Golden Morning, and every other "weakness" she's ever shown.

Which Doctor Mother /says outright in the update you linked,/ Mr. Reading Comprehension:

  /Need to take notes. The Simurgh... I could read her. Better than I should be able to. She's trying something./
#+end_quote

Obviously, this isn't the point I'd been arguing before. Up until now, I had thought you were referring to a hypothetical chapter in the fanfiction (which I haven't read) in which Doctor Mother reads the Simurgh's mind, and arguing from the position that the /Simurgh's/ ability to read minds justified the ability laid out in the fic, it having not occurred to me that you might make the absurdly tenuous connection between it and Scanner's power. And so, I'm forced to admit, you're right about one thing: while running completely contrary to the themes, principles, and patterns of Worm powers, and not making any sense whatsoever in the context of the Cycle, the mind reading you described isn't technically impossible in canon. It's just fucking stupid.

That power being allowed to come within ten thousand miles of Eidolon, on the other hand, is impossible.
