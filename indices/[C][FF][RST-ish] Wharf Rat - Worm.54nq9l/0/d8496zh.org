It's not even RT, tagging it as RSTish is a stretch of imagination. The story is plot railroaded, antagonists are always flanderized and juggle idiot balls, protagonist solve things mostly by convenient capabilities of its own powers and an intuition that heavily relies on author knowledge of canon plot.

It's very hard to find a character that's not an NPC all the time and rarely they do things off scene that matter.

I've read it up to chapter 14 and while it was interesting initially it quickly became the kind of wish fulfillment fixfic that gives fanfic a bad name.
