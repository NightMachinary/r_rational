A few random theories:

1: I don't think Malicia vs. body double is actually an 'or' question. I think with her powers, either Aspect or magic, she can swap places with her double when she wishes to.

2: I think if/when Cat kills Malicia she is going to reshape Akua into her form, and send her to rule the Wasteland as a biddable puppet. The talk about how the masked guys can be delegated to, and how Malicia doesn't have a huge public presence, is all foreshadowing how this will work.
