One of the greatest compliments I can give to this series is that whenever I read it, all I can do when I'm done is sit and think. The subject matter is so interesting, the characters so compelling and the plot so gripping that not doing so would feel /wrong/, not considering the implications of what occurred for the story each chapter would feel odd and not giving it the thought it deserves.
