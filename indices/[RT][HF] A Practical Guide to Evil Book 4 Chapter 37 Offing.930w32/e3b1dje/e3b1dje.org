It occurs to me that the Dead King /wasn't/ a name until Neshamah pulled it off; there was no pre-existing Role that he stepped into. He forged his own.

I can see Cat doing the same with the Black Queen. It's not an existing name, but I can definitely see it becoming one.

Malicia and Black are close to that, in how solidly they've redefined their Names and Roles, but they still walked into existing stories instead of forging a new one.

It's like their are tiers of names. Instances, Archetypes and Owners. Lone Swordsman (and all the heroes that snuck into Callow only to be seen by the Observatory and offed by Woe) are instances; it's "a" Lone Swordsman.

Ranger is probably the best archetype. It's hard to imagine anyone being more Ranger than this one, but she's not redefining the name like Black and Malicia, who are on the border between archetypical and owner.

Then there's Neshema, and possibly Cat. Names that had not yet existing coming into being solely through impact. He /owns/ Dead King in a way few others own their names, for few others have actually /made/ a Name.

I can totes see Catherine becoming the Black Queen, [carrier of grudges] (among other things).
