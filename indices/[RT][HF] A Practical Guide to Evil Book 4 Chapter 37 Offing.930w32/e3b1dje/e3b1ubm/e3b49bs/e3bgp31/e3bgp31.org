I think it has to do with the Scale of their powers and the Role that they fit into. Squire is a precursor to Knight, so they will never be as powerful as a Knight as that is their Role. The Dead King came into his Name through an immense consolidation of necromatic power, Adjutant came into his name through tireless and precise work for Cat.

I think that a large part of the power around Names is the Narrative story that is weaved around them. Cat's earlier ability Struggle perfectly exemplifies that. She struggled to gain power, so her power became to struggle. Names get shaped by the story around them, and if the Name is connected to a larger story, a more important role, it will become powerful as well. Additionally if the actions of a Named differ enough from their Name they will eventually transfer into a new name that fits their current Role. There are clear tiers to names. Transitory names that tend to follow a path to the next awakening. e.g. Squire > Black Knight. But I don't think that these are hard-coded tiers of power, but more a natural progression of power in the individual to match the scope of the name. It's not that Squire leads to Black Knight, but that the natural progression of the name of Squire most always leads to Black Knight. We can see this with Masegao turning into the Hierophant, his natural progression differed from the norm, so his progression went a different direction.
