Very much so. And Tyrant is an old name, but the current one /owns/ it.

It still feels like Adjutant and Dead King are in different categories. Maybe it's just scale? Or - Adjutant is an assistive Name, like Black Night. It implies a pairing / team in a way that Dead King and Black Queen just don't.

Grey Pilgrim and Saint of Swords also seem like they might have Made their names, although maybe out of existing ones?

Again, it just feels like there's a categorical difference between Dead King (and where Black Queen could go) and other Names.
