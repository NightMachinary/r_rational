Hahahaha. Cat runs into one of Gods know how many Fairfax kings from so long ago that his successors are near mythical, and his immediate sentiment is that Procer can go eat a whole bag of dicks. Some things never change.

It's been a major sticking point of Cat's character that she doesn't see herself as a legitimate Queen of Callow, just a warlord trying to hold things together until the Kingdom can be rebuilt properly, but goddamn if that conversation didn't make me think of how proud Callowans will be of her in the future. I don't usually get warm fuzzies from this story, but they are appreciated when they come.
