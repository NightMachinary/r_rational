This is totally canon in my head. The sad thing is, the stargate is actually incredibly safe by Ancient standards. It has an intuitive interface, failsafe mechanisms and it outputs its warnings on stderr.

Most of the problems the SGC has with its target are due to the fact that they are using a housemade cobbled interface that physically manipulates the gate instead of the normal "press the buttons to activate" DHD. Plus, Goa'ulds always sending super-powerful energy beams at it to blow up earth.
