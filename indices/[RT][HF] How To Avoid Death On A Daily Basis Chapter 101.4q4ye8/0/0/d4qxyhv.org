Yeah, fair point. The idea is that after a certain point, the more desperate the situation, the less fearful Colin gets. Once he accepts things are going to end badly (which he tends to do very quickly) he gives up hope of winning and resorts to sarcasm. Threatening him is a bit like threatening someone about to commit suicide.

The problem is if I make him too flippant it can take the tension out of the scene, so I do struggle with getting the balance right.
