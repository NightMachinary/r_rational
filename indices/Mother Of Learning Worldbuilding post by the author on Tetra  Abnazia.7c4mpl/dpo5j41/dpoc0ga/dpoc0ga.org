It's not inevitable, but it's highly likely.

First of all, the Splinter States still have memories of the Old Alliance and a lot of people feel that it's only right for the continent to be united under someone. That's something Europe didn't really have since the fall of the Roman Empire.

Secondly, a lot of the Splinter States are too small to resist their neighbors in the long term and only came into existence because the Splinter Wars shook up the political landscape so heavily - even if the disunity of the continent continues, it is likely that many regions will eventually consolidate themselves into larger, more viable political entities. Small federations and medium-sized kingdoms and such.

Finally, the powerful nations trying to unite the continent are not trying to literally integrate everything into a China-like super-state. They're trying to crush their rivals, secure their home regions and then make the other states submit as their vassals/tributaries. A lot of the states would still exist, albeit with a high degree of autonomy rather than total independence like they currently have. It's a lot like the Holy Roman Empire, only with an Emperor that is not elective and whose dictates have actual teeth. This is what the Old Alliance was, and they don't see the reason to mess with a known solution.
