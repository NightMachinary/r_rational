I really love these worldbuilding posts. They add a lot to the immersion in the story.

It's not clear to me why having many small states would be unsustainable. Our own history has examples of both large stable empires (China) and regions with many nations. Historically Europe has nearly always had many small states. Powers trying to grab the entire continent have nearly always been unsuccessful.

It makes sense that all the powers in the region are constantly vying for dominance. But I don't see why it would be inevitable that one of them is going to succeed.
