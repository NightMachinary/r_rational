I actually make very modest amounts of worldbuilding. :) I thought I'd be far more prolific about it, to be honest, but somehow it did not work out that way.

Besides, MoL /started/ as a worldbuilding project. I always knew I wanted to release some of the worldbuilding that went into MoL. I mean, half of the work has already been done by the time I started writing. I just need to clean up my notes and add some extra material... except that is turning out to be harder than it sounds. Oh well...
