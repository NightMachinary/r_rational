The most impressive thing about this Rickroll is that it loaded almost instantaneously--faster than I would have expected mere text, never mind webpage audio. Meanwhile yesterday focus issues caused me to click on the wrong link on Lesswrong, and it took nearly 30 seconds to get where I was trying to go.

Never gonna let you down indeed.
