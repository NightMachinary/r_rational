For me at least, scene level outlining is essential to creating a workable story. But this does not preclude using other methods of outlining. Before I make my scene level outline, I make a less detailed outline very similar to your first method, which starts at the end and backtracks to figure out how to connect the dots of the high level plot. Then I use that to generate the scene level outline. I think a lot of writers with an analytical temperament end up with a similar method over time.
