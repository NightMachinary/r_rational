TL;DR: In the future, everything has gone to shit. The clathrate gun hypothesis held water and fired in 2034, causing ~2Â°C of warming in 4.5 years and eventually kicking off runaway global warming.

Eighteen years later, in an underwater community near where Manila once stood, an AI becomes sentient and invents /causal loop engineering/ AND learns about the existence of three other AGIs who just became sentient hours before it. Cue a seven-day 200M+ casualties war of increasingly elaborate causal gambits as the AGIs battle across time and space for control over this universe...

...which kicks off our story set in 2016. Four college students find themselves solving puzzles in desperation after the apparently supernatural suicide of a student proves to humanity that time travel /is/ possible, but not exactly /how/.

Right. So:

I'm 2/3rds of the way done (~21/32 chapters written) but everything's pretty settled at this point so it's probably gonna be a breeze to finish this December. My main concern is keeping the pacing tight whilst trying to cover all the possible plot holes via foreshadowing and/or lampshading (really important due to the Novikov time travel aspect).

Honestly, I didn't think I'd finish. In the beginning I thought it'd just be storytelling practice for me (I write nonfiction essays primarily) and boy did I learn a lot about it! When and where to reveal key details, how to write compelling characters (and of course, how to be a /sadistic bastard/), how to exploit [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SA79JMXKWke32A3hG/original-seeing][Original Seeing]] to keep my word count high, etc. But anyway, even more than that it was a test of how effective my newly prescribed ADHD meds really are. I've always had trouble finishing long-term projects and this is a testament to the wonders of modern medicine.

It's really counterintuitive to me how much the /just write/ advice works. I mean, I figure the stereotypical pseudo-perfectionism we usually encounter before the act is similar to the logical-feeling but entirely irrational justifications we tell ourselves before, say, going bungee jumping. Every time I felt like I should plan out a scene and preemptively plug all the plot holes first, I turned out to be wrong. *Editing is impossible with a blank page*, and it was RaNo that made me understand it on a gut level.

That said, I had aspirations of debuting as a /pantser/ but I faltered midway. I tried following WubbaBubba's process: imagine all your really awesome scenes and just write towards them. That worked for a while, but there's only so many intense scenes you can put in a novel-length format. Buildup is a key limiting factor: you have got to spread out your awesomeness or else you'll get the Escalation Escalator that was Pact.

Another aspect that I was surprised I was able to do in realtime was foreshadowing. I'm the sort of reader who can't predict endings to save his life, so imagine my surprise when it turns out you can actually put in a Chekov's Armoury with nary an afterthought if you're the God of the Universe. I mean, lots of things can have satisfying post hoc justifications: you just have to keep writing fresh detail after fresh detail. And I guess the whole Novikov thing was an effective forcing function for me as well.

Oh! Two things I have to accomplish this month: /research/, and /worldbuilding/. I guess the bar for the former is even higher for alt history fics but one of my primary goals while writing the thing was to /make my university feel alive/. I still have trouble balancing characterisation, worldbuilding, and plot advancement so I suppose that's one of the things I'm gonna improve by January. My point of reference here is ATLA: I think it has one of the most compelling worldbuilding in any media I've seen so far and I wanted to evoke the same feeling in my work. If I can figure out how to do that without sacrificing the pace of the story then all the better.

As for worldbuilding, it's a tempting distraction, really. The bulk of my first attempts at fiction is on [[/r/PostWorldPowers][r/PostWorldPowers]] and I really, really like this community's insistence on consistent rules. Consistency is important not only as a grammar Nazi-like surface rule but also as a way to maximise the impact of key scenes on your reader. *The less time the reader spends confused, the better*. Note that confusion does not mean not knowing. For instance, in writing Fair-Play mysteries (which I have in the middle section of my book) you need to be able to show the /possible solutions/ as early as possible: the Fair-Play aspect comes from having to decide /which/ path is the correct one, not being kept in the dark of key details to evoke cluelessness.

In a way, I see worldbuilding as a /long-term investment/. A fast-paced plot can captivate and entertain the reader, but only a compellingly built world can make him/her keep picking up the book way after he/she has finished reading it. This is even more true the closer you are to the speculative fiction cluster.

Oh, and I also have to fill in the puzzles I left for my future self to make.

Nah, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Just have to figure out the puzzle sections. :)
