I failed to actually write a story of any notable length this month, but I made /significant/ progress improving my outlining procedure. Prior to this month, my general procedure for outlining was "figure out the True State Of Affairs, figure out what each character knows as of the story's beginning, and then lay out the plot as a series of reveals-of-information and actions-based-on-that-new-information". It was always very difficult for me to actually /write/ stories outlined in that fashion, because even when I knew what I wanted to happen on a big-picture scale the outline rarely provided me with any guide on what to have happening in a given scene beyond "get the character the relevant information by some means".

This month, I outlined a story using a different method, replacing the usual information-level overview with a scene-level overview wherein literally all I had was a list of one-sentence scene summaries whose content I found particularly emotionally moving. And the scene-level outline made it /so much easier/ to write than the information-level outlines ever did, to the point where I ended up just pivoting from writing my original planned NaNo story (which I'd spent several weeks before November outlining in the information-centric fashion) to the story which I outlined in the new way (whose outline I scribbled down over the course of maybe an hour or two early in November), and managed to write more for it than for the story I'd originally planned to write.

(And then I stalled out at about 3.5k words between the two stories /anyway/, because schoolwork escalated and I stopped having spare time and energy for writing. But nonetheless the effect of the new outlining method on my productivity was pretty dramatic during the time in which it applied.)
