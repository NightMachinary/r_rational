  It's really counterintuitive to me how much the just write advice works.

This was surprising to me, too. I found that writing a scene often forces me to fill in details that I didn't even realize I was missing. Then once I have those details in my head, everything is so much more vivid that it's easier to generate outline for the rest of the story.

Like for example, I had a group of characters that I was planning to establish. I knew what role they needed to play in the plot, but in my head they were just blank faces. So it was hard to fill in the /details/ on what they actually do in the story. I just thought they would be minor characters and I didn't really care to fill them in. I didn't realize how much their lack of substance was hurting my ability to think about the story.

Then when I actually just sat down and wrote the first scene and figured out their names and personalities... BAM, now my head was exploding with possibilities for what they can do in the story. Now I can't believe I ever thought these guys would be 'just minor characters'.
