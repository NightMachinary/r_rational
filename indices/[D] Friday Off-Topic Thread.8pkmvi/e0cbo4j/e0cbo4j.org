I never knew Richard Dawkins was a neck beard. In his book The Selfish Gene, he can't help but spend an entire chapter talking about memes, and then spends another chapter talking about how "science says that nice guys should finish first". You'd think he could have finished a single book on biology without delving into personal issues and unrelated interests.
