I went on a two day training course that was an introduction into a traffic modelling program that I regularly review output from in my job.

It was really interesting and the technical aspects reminded me why I love my field, even if right now my boss is... suboptimal.

So now of course I'm considering signing up for this master's degree: [[https://www.monash.edu/engineering/master-transport/course-details]]

But... I'm already studying nutrition part time (and super enjoying it). A relevant master's degree is something my work would probably give me paid time off for (AWESOME). It would take me 2 years, max, to finish and I'd possibly get it done in one year if I got two days a week off for study. And if I decide I don't like it I can actually exit early with a lesser qualification, so it's not necessarily even any "wasted time".

I see myself at a crossroads: either ultimately becoming a researcher or programmer (I /do/ have a computer science degree hanging up somewhere gathering dust, but I hated cutting code, was more interested in management/documentation/QA/etc...) in the transport space, or continuing as a (generalist?) project manager, or doing a complete 180 and becoming a nutritionist / dietitian / similar sort of public health officer (which probably would require a pay cut).

I have so many options, and it's exciting to think about, but it's also terrifying because I could make the "wrong" decision. I've been studying nutrition for nearly 3 years now and I've gotten so much out of it, but there's still another, like, 4 years before I get my bachelor degree unless I study more units at once (which I could do, my HD average means I can afford to put less effort in), take more time off work (I take one day a week off already, and it obviously involves a pay cut), or like quit my job or something. Really with nutrition I'm quite happy to keep studying at a snail's pace since it'll take so long anyway.

I guess I'll finish my nutrition study for this year, and if I still am excited about getting a master's in transport engineering, then I'll change over. See how I like it after six months.
