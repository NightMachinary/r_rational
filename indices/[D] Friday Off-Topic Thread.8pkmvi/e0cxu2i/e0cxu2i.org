Has anyone here successfully slowed down how fast they talk?

I tend to just perform a brain dump, speaking whichever word happens to be in my brain without forming complete sentences. Or at least, that's what happens when I'm even slightly nervous.

And it turns out "Dude, just slow down" is not very helpful advice....
