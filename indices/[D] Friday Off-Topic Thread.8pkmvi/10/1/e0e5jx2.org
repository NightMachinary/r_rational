This might be low effort on my part, but this sounds a lot like a multiplayer visual novel. Apart from the voting/quest part of it I would say the rest has been done. If you weren't already aware of this consider looking into it. If you /were/, then yes I would say there is room for it? You would probably need a "better" author but voting doesn't seem radically different from normal quests so whatever works there I suppose.
