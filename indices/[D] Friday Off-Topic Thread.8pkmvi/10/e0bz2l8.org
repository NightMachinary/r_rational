Quests usually work by people voting on choices. Is there room for a quest that branches in many directions?

Basically, the QM gives three optinos, A, B, and C. The audience votes as normal, and A wins, so the QM writes a chapter/post for A, which gives options A1, A2, and A3. But where we do things different is that /options B and C are still there/. The audience can vote for A1, A2, A3, B, or C. And if they voted for B, they would have A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, and C, and so on until there was a whole decision tree.

This would have a lot of obvious problems.

1. The QM would run a lot of risk of repeating themselves. In theory, some of this would be avoided by audience voting, because the audience wouldn't vote for a branch that looked redundant. In practice, I don't know if you could actually avoid things like introducing characters two or three different times when different branches first encounter them. You could do some copy+paste on that stuff, but it seems lazy and unsatsifying, because part of the fun would be seeing the different possibilities.
2. The audience would have foreknowledge. As an extreme example, something learned in branch A1B3A2A3C2 could be used in branch B to bypass some of the plot or metagame.
3. Quests are typically done on a forum, which doesn't really favor branching. Custom UI would solve the problem (and help solve the problem of ever-expanding choices, all of which need to be voted on).
4. You'd need a fast, competent author who's planned out a lot of things ahead of time, or is really good at working within constraints.
5. Voting is a problem all its own. Ranked choices? Approval voting? Something else?

I was thinking that one interesting thing might be to work the branching into the story itself; the first time your audience selects a prior branch, the protagonist remembers things from the other, later branch. In that way, it's not so much exploring other branches as it is a form of time travel, which then creates a meta-narrative. But if you have to lean on meta-narrative, maybe it isn't such a good idea after all.
