I don't consider it worth my time to slow down unless it's for a speech where I'm being marked on speed. Most people can follow it fine, and I /regularly/ get told I speak quickly.

It sounds like your issue is not the speed of your words but talking before you have fully-formed ideas? I do that sometimes too but never really have a problem with it. I think you might want to work on techniques to address nervousness/anxiety rather than talking speed.
