I was having trouble organizing the order of events in the first three chapters, but I had a breakthrough and solved it by turning them into /five/ chapters, so hopefully the next update will come in a reasonable amount of time. Also, the title currently on FF dot net for chapter two isn't correct, that's just what chapter one used to be called.

I've said all this before over the past year so don't take it as a spoiler, but it was formerly:

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 1 - Something to Protect: Tom Riddle

  Chapter 2 - The Truth, Pt 6, Riddles Reiterated

  Chapter 3 - The Truth, Pt 7, A Riddle Unraveled
#+end_quote

And now it's:

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 1 - A Vertical Velocity of Zero

  Chapter 2 - The Truth, Pt 6, Riddles Reiterated

  Chapter 3 - Something to Protect: Tom Riddle

  Chapter 4 - The Truth, Pt 7, A Riddle Unraveled

  Chapter 5 - The Truth, Pt 0, The Lines of "If"
#+end_quote

It's possible that chapters 3 and 4 might swap places.
