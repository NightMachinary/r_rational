Out of the like 10 people who poke their heads in from time to time, only about 3 have programming experience, and with the exception of a single pull request no one else has contributed code yet (which is due to me wanting to get XGEF in order before having accessible work for others to do rather than lack of available ability). The Discord is mostly a lot of discussion and hole-poking and worldbuilding, so you'd be in good company.

Ha, no need to think this. I can always use a good kick to the pants, and I'll be sure to make my abandonment public if I ever do reach that point.
