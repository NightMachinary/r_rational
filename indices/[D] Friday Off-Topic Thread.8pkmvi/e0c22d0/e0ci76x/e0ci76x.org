  [W]hat statistical sorcery makes me get no attention?

Do you want math? Probably not, but here we go, starting with the following assumptions:

- A lot of people get “ghosted, harassed, ignored, [or] disrespected”
- “[W]omen mostly get a majority of obviously copy-pasted messages and complain about it”
- “There's like 10x more men than women in online dating”

First, I note that the second point is much stronger than the first: A lot of people may still be a small fraction, especially online, where there is a selection towards those more likely to speak up. Depending on the origin of your data, your analysis could end right here. But that is not very interesting.

We are interested in the fraction of ‘jerks' of your competition. If, say, 90% of the messages sent are ‘jerky', then we can assume 90% of your competitors to be jerks, right? Well, that depends on the amount of messages sent. I do not think it would be a stretch to assume that copy-pasting messages leads to a larger volume of them. The break-even point here would be at 9x, so if they sent 9 times as many messages, you could conclude them to be 50% of the competition. Obviously, the exact numbers are guesswork.

Still, I think that the combination of selection (disrespectful messages can generate a lot of complains even if making up a small fraction of messages, also it does not take a lot of them to ruin one's day) and asymmetric amount of messages sent should lead you to the conclusion that the fraction of jerks is not that large. Personally, I would believe them to be a minority, but for the sake of argument, assume it to be 50%.

Hence, any non-jerk is in the top 50%. Now the third point becomes relevant. There is a disparity of the number of competitors and potential matches. Your 10x wasn't meant literally, of course, but I don't think the number is too unrealistic. You would then have to be in the top 10% of the competition to beat out the supply-demand imbalance. But non-jerkyness only gets you to the top 50%.

All of the above is very much simplifying, based on flawed assumptions, and the numbers are pulled from thin air. However, I think they are more on the conservative side, and can certainly inform one's intuition. /My/ intuition certainly tells me that not being a jerk is at most a slight advantage.

Final note: I would strongly recommend against analysing social interactions using numbers, intuition is much better at that. Trying to understand one's intuition is fine, though.
