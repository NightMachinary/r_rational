I agree that an example of a first message would be very helpful, and are you still using OKC? Maybe try tinder and use the right-swipe proportion that articles recommend (too many and they think you're not paying attention, too few and they don't want to risk showing people your picture if you probably won't be swiping right to your right-swipers). Tinder also has the benefit of automatically working out which of your pictures are the best by the proportion of right swipes (my husband's tinder ended up with a photo that had our dog in it but not him as his best photo: thanks for showing I have good taste, swipe app!)

OKC's changed recently so that women are only showed messages from men they've "liked". I only log on to OKC very rarely nowadays so I'm not sure what women who actively use it are doing with regards to messages.

EDIT: OK, I went on OKC to see what it was like, and just logging in and responding to a couple of match questions, I got a message in my inbox. Great, and now trying to find who messaged me on the "match finder" thing I instead found someone who seems really interesting and I guess I'm going to message him and if I end up getting married to him because of this then you will have somehow managed to in a fit of irony got someone /else/ romantically connected.

I guess in the interests of potentially maybe helping you, this is what his profile looked like:

The self-summary is what got me interested.

EDIT 2: I found the guy who sent me a message. Empty profile and the message is: "Hey have you ever wrestled someone?". I am swooning over here.

EDIT 3: And another guy had apparently sent me a "hi there".
