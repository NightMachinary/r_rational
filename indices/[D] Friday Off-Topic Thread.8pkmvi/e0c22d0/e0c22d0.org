Today in CouteauBleu's wacky love life: Online dating baffles me on a deep level.

I see a lot of people reporting their experience of getting ghosted, harassed, ignored, disrespected, etc, and a primal part of my brain thinks "Great, I don't ghost, harass, ignore, or disrespect people, I'll probably have a ton of success" (which is totally something stories condition you to believe with the "emotionally wary girl who thinks all men are jerks learns to open up thanks to the caring respectful male protagonist" archetype), which is not how it works in real life.

But... why? Like, people do online dating to find dates, and I know for a fact that lots of women mostly get a majority of obviously copy-pasted messages and complain about it, so what statistical sorcery makes me get no attention?

Running theories, with some overlap:

- I'm a fine introverted, socially isolated young man with niche hobbies who spends most of his time on the internet, which is as high-supply-low-demand as you can get on dating apps. No amount of clever message writing can get me past the "uuuugh" factor most women feel when looking at my profile / photos.

- Women on dating websites don't get more non-crappy messages than I think, it's just that the ones who only get crap are more likely to report it.

- There's like 10x more men than women in online dating and I'm not especially attractive, which means I'm in a "waiting line" kind of spot where women have an abundance of more attractive men they want to try their luck with first. The dating algorithms may even have noticed this and given me a low priority on women's swipe lists.

- The major difficulty in online dating isn't weeding out harassers and ostensibly bad people, it's that two randomly selected people (especially on a dating app) are unlikely to be mutually interested in each other, even if they're otherwise good people.

Mh.

Bonus theories, unknown plausibility:

- There is an ocean of invisible jerks permeating everything both among men and women. Dating is therefore a coordination problem where the non-jerks try to reach each other but end up only ever reaching jerks and getting a skewed perspective. (it goes without saying that any lady who's uninterested in my romantic attention qualifies as a jerk; also, every guy who isn't me)

- I have a bad model of people because I'm way more self-aware than average. People like to /signal/ how virtuous they are and rail against eg ghosting and copy-pasted messages, but when you look at their actual incentivized habits on dating apps where they have relative anonymity and no consequences, people are perfectly with ghosting other people, and don't make a sincere effort (besides complaining) to get or reply to pertinent messages.

(I don't actually believe in these two theories, but I'm curious how you'd argue against them)
