I re-read HPMOR a few weeks ago and had a theory. How prevalent among the community is the theory that everything that happened at the end was part of voldemort plan? That he actually wanted to be killed/defeated, or that possibly he didn't actually get killed and it was all a fakeout of some kind? I did read the discussion threads at the time (three years ago!) and I don't recall whether this was discussed as a possibility or not.

I think the crux of the issue is that it is too far-fetched for such a smart character as Quirrellmort is purported to be to leave Harry possession of his wand after the unbreakable vow, or for him to do so and also stop checking for betrayal in parseltongue. It doesn't make sense if he wasn't holding the idiot ball, which Yudkowsky promised he wouldn't do. Also, not really his style, IMO.

So what does that leave, if not an obscure interpretation?

One thing I thought pointed to this theory was that when Quirrellmort went "full voldemort" and started making those horrible sadistic threats in parseltongue, he mostly used conditionals, not statements. Even if what he said was strictly true, he could still say these things if he was strongly committed to precommitment(heh). "If you don't do x, I'll do y to the world". And he did say earlier during the Stanford prison experiment arc that he intended for Harry to rule magical Britain in parseltongue.

The only explanation that I can think of that doesn't make him into a dunce with his over the top voldemort act and breaking all his villain rules is that he was trying to "decondition" Harry of his affection toward Quirrelmort, so that harry would go through with killing him. IIRC, the part where he mentioned that he had lost count after hundreds of horcruxes was not in parseltongue. In fact, he switched on and off parseltongue a lot, for no apparent reason. He had all the power, and he expected to kill Harry soon. Why so much careful misdirection when he was in the midst of monologuing(another villain rule broken, btw)?

+Another thing that points to this theory being true is that the three wishes with 1 plot promise was almost certainly carried out. Now this one is just conjecture, because I think Eliezer didn't want to spell it out too obviously and so just let it happen off-screen, but he did make give a few clues that make very strong circumstantial evidence. Quirrell disappeared the snitch in order to distract people and abduct harry. So all the students were at this overlong quidditch match when they learn of voldemort's rebirth/redeath and Quirrell's death. They might even associate Quirrell's martyrdom with the interrupted quidditch game--probably never resumed--which had in the balance the house cup between ravenclaw and slytherin.+

+I think we're supposed to conclude that due to the students putting Quirrell on a massive pedestal, the school honoured him by realizing his plot to make Ravenclaw and Slytherin win the cup simultaneously, and that the students would also consider changing Quidditch on their own. All in a single (unrelated) plot.+

PS. This post was partly prompted by listening to the podcast Yudkowsky did with Sam Harris about AIs, which was pretty good. Go listen to it.
