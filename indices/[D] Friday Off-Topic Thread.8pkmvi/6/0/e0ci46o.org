This theory is being re-discovered with various variations fairly frequently. Its main problem, in my opinion, is the way it overrides Riddle's canon motivation.

Riddle wanted Harry as an eternal opponent initially, true, but he abruptly changed his goals when he heard the doomsday prophecy. After that point he no longer cared about installing him as a nemesis, or his totally-not-friendship with him, in comparison to the existential threat he posed.

This theory's Voldemort has a reason for leaving Harry his wand, but /doesn't/ have a reason for /not/ doing his best to kill Harry the apocalypse boy. Which is a bigger problem. You may say that he realized that killing Harry was impossible, that the prophecy created a stable time loop --- but no, there are canon precedents for foiling prophecies completely (e. g., Dumbledore vs. omnicide), which is what Riddle was aiming for. It was supposed to be hard, yes, but Voldemort acknowledged the possibility of a failure, and responded to it by installing more countermeasures (e. g., Hermione the immortal morality chain), not by giving up.

In summary, this theory tries to explain Voldemort's mistake by postulating a discontinuity in his motivations, which doesn't seem satisfying.

... Or, well, that's how I see it.

  Anna stayed in the stadium, and watched the rest of the game, ignoring her body's need for sleep, and her eyes that often blurred with tears.

  The Ravenclaw team put up a valiant fight.

  But there was no Quidditch team anywhere that could've defeated the Slytherins that day.

  Dawn was tinging the sky when the Slytherins won their final game, the Quidditch Cup, and the House Cup.
