Just writing not living up to standards.

The scene on the cemetery was planned from the beginning. So some mistakes came from that.

It would have made more sense if Harry had a second wand hidden (transfigured?) somewhere and Quirrell didn't think about it, because wizards have only one wand. Would make more sense than the rock in the ring.

Still would be a big Batman Gambit, what Harry would do. Maybe Quirrell thought Harry would kill him and he made a new Horcrux somewhere and didn't expect a mind wipe. Harry could also have learned the True Imperius Curse secretly (You get controlled without any saving rolls) and a decoy would have been discovered that way. If I remember correctly we didn't know Harry learned the Memory Charm in secret either (but it was hinted at I think).

But yeah it was stupid to let Harry keep the wand. I don't know if anyone mentioned Quirrell faking his defeat, but I didn't follow fan theories. Everyone was happy to be correct or why their prediction should be correct.
