Not the point, you can't think of all possibilities. Maybe Harry made his bone into a wand. Removing Harry's bones would be crazy. But leaving his wand in his hand is just stupid.

I would have liked a HPMOR more where Quirrell took Harry's wand away, but Harry had a secret second one.

Did Quirrell have a second wand? Can't remember.
