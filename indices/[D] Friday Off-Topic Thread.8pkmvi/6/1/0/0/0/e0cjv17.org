  But leaving his wand in his hand is just stupid.

This I agree with.

I just mean, I don't think Harry could've relied on any outside-the-boxing thinking that didn't /also/ involve secret knowledge. (Knowledge of how to turn your bones into a wand qualifies.) You can't think of everything, but you can think of a lot, especially with prep time.

  Did Quirrell have a second wand? Can't remember.

We never got to find out. I would be surprised if he didn't.
