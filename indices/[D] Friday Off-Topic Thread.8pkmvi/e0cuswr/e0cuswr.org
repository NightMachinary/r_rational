Crossposting from myself:

Every time there's been a series of warfare chapters in A Practical Guide to Evil, I get in the mood to play some RTS or strategy games. A few days ago I found one that /really/ fits the feelings evoked by the Practical Guide's writing.

For those that don't know, Total War games are all about top level turn-based strategy, combined with up close, real-time warfare tactics. I've never really been able to get into the series, but awhile back I happened to get the Warhammer one in some bundle or the other. After these recent chapters, I decided to try it, and Gods Below does it fit!

Setting archers up on high ground to rain arrows down on the enemy? Check. Using siege weapons against infantry to make up for differences in army size? Check. Spreading your formations out so that none of the enemy can break through and pincer your men? Check. Giant monsters that will clobber their way through your lines if you don't have something to stop them? Check.

Let me tell you, the first time you send your cavalry unit around some forest to avoid their defensive pikemen so you can stampede all over the enemy archers without being seen, then use them to plow into the back of enemy infantry as they're locked in combat with your front lines, you'll feel like Grem One Eye himself. If he had mounted knights to play with, anyway.

What made me post this, though, was a recent battle I was just in. The game also has Heroes in it, kind of like the Warcraft 3 RTS, both Lords (who command armies and act as the overworld units that go from place to place) and Heroes of all kinds, who can also act in the overworld or take up an army unit slot and use special abilities. My lands got invaded by some vampire Lord who was sacking one of my cities, and I scoffed when I saw his army size. My nearest Lord had 18 units in his army (each of which contained anywhere between 40-120 individual soldiers that move and fight in formation), made up of swordsmen, pikemen, archers, cavalry, the works, plus 1 Hero, a Witch Hunter. The enemy had maybe 8 units... and though they also had 4 Heroes with their Lord, I figured I'd just have to wear them down once I scattered their army.

It was a massacre.

My cavalry were stopped cold by one of the enemy Heroes, who just shrugged off their charges and kept knocking them down one by one. Some banshee Hero kept flying around and disrupting my archers, and I had no one to send at her to stop the harassment because my Witch Hunter was stuck in combat with another. My army formations kept getting holes blown in them for enemies to spill through thanks to huge AoE spells from some caster Hero, and when I reluctantly dragged my Lord away to try and deal with him, their Lord used some ability to rapidly deteriorate my troops' morale, causing them to start routing. (Normally troops will break and run if they're taking too much of a beating too fast, regardless of how much health they have. Having a Lord or Hero around helps avoid that but normally it takes a little while)

I walked onto the battlefield with ~1800 troops not counting my Lord and Hero, while they entered with about ~700. I was forced to retreat with a scant 1/3 of my army, while they lost only half their forces. I managed to kill one of their Heroes, but they killed my Lord and wounded (temporarily incapacitated) my Hero.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still new to the game so probably screwed up royally a few times. But since then, I've had immensely more sympathy for Cat and Juniper's current difficulties. The alignments may be reversed, and she rarely has the numerical advantage, but fuck, being outnumbered in Heroes is a /nightmare/ to deal with when all you can throw at them are mere mortals who'll get cut down or tossed around like toy soldiers.

Sadly, though there are like a dozen different factions and races with their own unique units, you can't make an army out of orcs, goblins, humans, etc all at the same time. Still, 9/10, would recommend.
