I'm aware. Making a joke.

To explain and kind of kill the joke, in the chapter about memes, Dawkins talks about memes as a unit of cultural evolution, drawing parallels to genes which are units of biological evolution. "Nice guys finish first" is about how completely self interested agents can outcompete others through mutual cooperation, and how this strategy is stable even in the presence of agents that continually take the option that benefits themselves the most, along with different strategies of enforcing this mutual cooperation.
