additional, the profiles you are writing are inactive or fake (depending on the site you are using).

I got somewhat 1:20 responses when I tried online dating. (And I did use a cartoon picture as profil pic.) And I only wrote active profiles. Still they needed always a few days to answer.

I also opened a fake profil with some random female picture (not a model). And got like 15 responses without filling out the profile in a month. I asked all what they get for replies and most couldn't/wouldn't answer that question. Some only wrote "Hello" and didn't respond to anything else.

Also I heard someone made a profile with the same info he had on his but with a male model as pic and got the famous "hello" from females. So looks count.

So what you can do:

- Change your posture (in RL and on your profile pic). I assume you have a bad one because you are saying you are introvert. Try to have an open body language.

- If you have pets, on the pic with them.

- Change to a site for some subculture you belong to. Maybe try niche hobbies with more females in it.

- If you get a response, ask for a meet up fairly quick . Like a coffee shop you go to or some niche hobby location.

Anyhow I found a gf in my friends group and had only bad dates with online dating (three). So not sure how much you should listen to me.
