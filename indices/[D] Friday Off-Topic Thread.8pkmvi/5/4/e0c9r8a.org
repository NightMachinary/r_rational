Simpler solution that I can't know is true: you have a subpar profile page. There's only so much of yourself that you can show in a short conversation, and much less that you can show without seeming incredibly desperate, but a profile page is the method of showing people who you are. It's not just a way of expressing yourself, it's telling people what aspects of yourself that you're willing to publicize. As a woman, it would make more sense to weed out potential dates based on what men choose to show in their profile, because you don't have to spend multiple minutes on every guy asking what his hobbies are, career, general personality, etc. It just isn't worth the investment to ask all those questions to the people who haven't put the effort into making a decent profile in the first place.

Also, photography matters. A good camera is correlated with matches last time I checked, but even besides the camera your ability to make yourself look good in your profile picture is important. Good lighting, camera angle, framing, etc. I think women learn these things more often than men, and the lack of them is more noticeable.

Similarly, dressing well is a good way of selling yourself. While I don't think that most women have special insight into men's fashion that could be expected from interest in their own fashion, the lack of fashion is usually fairly obvious. Well fitting clothes, decent color matching, outfits that seem cohesive, just general thought put into your outfit is a good way to make a better impression.

Working out and being/looking healthy I think is sufficiently obvious as to not warrant further discussion.

Generally, I would try to look at the simple stuff, and try to fix that, before making any wider conclusions about either yourself or other people. If my mouse isn't working, I check that it's plugged in before filing a bug report for the mouse drivers.
