Turn the table around and look at it from their perspective. Suppose online dating apps were instead flooded with women and 90% of them are very interested in sex, perhaps almost solely interested in it, and would absolutely sleep with you if you just gave them a date, time, and location. You now have the option to be picky, and you might as well be. Each new partner is of course a new STD risk, so you might as well try to get someone you'd be happy with in a long-term relationship.

Ideally, you're trying to get that dream situation, a long-term relationship with a smart, funny, emotionally stable, slim, and attractive woman who shares your interests, is working a decently-paying full time job, and will not have terribly high expectations of you, so you can occasionally cook, do some chores, and not necessarily have to go to work. This is generally not a thing for men. For women ... it's unlikely, but it happens, and often enough to keep the hope alive.

It's not necessarily that you're up against 10 or 100 other guys. It's more that you're competing with the /idea of a perfect or near-perfect guy/ in the mind of a person who has every reason to be picky. The picky mindset only goes away when the interest declines, which can come with increased age and weight gain/obesity, where the mindset gets closer to yours, that it will be difficult to find anyone to have a relationship with.

You basically have four options:

1. Wait a very long time, possibly indefinitely. You can continue using dating apps, and trying to meet up with people IRL, but just be aware that it may be a very long time before something works out.

2. Improve yourself, become more attractive, learn to be more sociable and funny, get whatever education you need to get a job you like that pays well, and see if you get better results.

3. Lower your standards, pursue women that most other men will not go for. This is quick and theoretically easy depending on your interests and tastes.

4. Pursue women in a different demographic. You could try building friendships with women in developing countries like China, South Korea, Thailand, etc. In those countries, more people walk rather than drive, take stairs more than elevators, and generally eat a diet with more vegetables, so weight tends to be lower if that's a big factor for you. You will also be relatively taller than you would be compared to men in most English-speaking countries, so overall attractiveness may be higher in both directions.
