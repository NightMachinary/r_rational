Honestly, I feel like dating apps by themselves are skeevy and crass. I interpreted your use of dating apps and your concern about your own appearance as "Looks matter. A lot." and went from there. The first, most prominent factor in every dating app is the picture of the other person. That's a tool you use when appearances are a high priority, if not the top priority. If you're looking for someone who is smart, rational, level-headed, mature, etc. and you don't necessarily care about appearances, then dating apps may not be the way to go. You might have better luck ditching the dating apps and trying to meet someone like that at a university.
