I have a new kitten. That makes four cats in total now (I'm a 29 year old dude and I'm already basically an old cat lady, but whatever). I wasn't planning on getting another cat, I just found her and felt emotionally compelled to rescue her.

I'd like to know if anyone here can come up with an alternate explanation for how she came to be where she was when I found her, because she was only 5.5 or 6 weeks old and she shouldn't have been separated from her mother and littermates yet, and my running hypothesis is that someone may have thrown her out of the window of their car.

Six days ago (last Saturday), mom came home from work and then we left to go to PetSmart to get cat food and kitty litter. We had to get on the highway to get there.

It's hard to judge distance in a car, but if the on-ramp is like 1,500 feet long, Lyra was maybe 300 feet from the beginning of the on-ramp, and if it was (let's see... road lanes are about 12 feet wide on average, so...) 25 feet wide, she was on the right/passenger side of the road about 7 feet from the grass, so not in the middle of the road but still in severe danger of being run over.

I thought she was roadkill at first and I normally avoid looking at roadkill, but some unconscious intuition noticed that she wasn't flattened in any way whatsoever, and then we passed her, and I felt compelled to look back and it looked like she was rolling over. I screamed at my mom to stop and turn around, and she reversed a little bit of the way, but you're going about 80 feet per second at 60 mph, so we were already like 600 feet away and we could see cars starting to come, so I got out of the car and ran in the middle (not quite the middle, skewed left from my perspective and skewed right from the perspective of oncoming cars) of the road back to her, waving my arms up in the air to my right (oncoming cars' left) to direct people away from her, then saw her up close.

*Observations:* There was fresh blood on her nose and on her mouth and around the claws of her front two paws. She was dirty, and covered (well, not /covered,/, but, y'know) covered in flying/biting insects that looked kinda like smaller/angrier mosquitoes (I'm a bit concerned about how many times I got bit, but I'm fine now so I'll just assume it's fine). We continued to PetSmart (because they have a Banefield Vet office inside the building), but it was after 5pm so the vet was closed, so we took her to an emergency vet clinic whatever thing, and they looked her over and said that, other than the blood and a flea infestation and being slightly malnourished and probably having worms, she was fine, no broken bones or internal bleeding or anything (/obviously,/ since it was after 7pm at that point, they couldn't actually /do/ anything).

The blood was fresh, and she was clearly in shock, so whatever caused the blood had almost certainly happened extremely recently on the road itself.

While it's theoretically possible, I think it's extremely improbable for her nose and her mouth and her hands to have all been perfectly aligned to be /just barely/ grazed by the side of a tire without anything being crushed or broken. I'm pretty sure that any amount of contact with a tire at all whatsoever would have led to significantly more damage than what was observed. The pattern of the injuries is consistent with what you'd expect from landing face first with the arms extended.

I don't think it's likely that she was the new kitty of some little girl who due to age and inexperience rolled down the window for her new kitty to look outside and then kitty accidentally fell out, because 1) she was too young at 5.5/6 weeks for it to be likely for her to have been adopted and 2) this kitten was clearly born outside due to the fleas and biting insects and being skinny enough to see her ribs and worms.

(She /does/ have roundworms for now, but we took her to the vet the next day and got her $150 dollars worth of medicine and shots (god, we've already spent like $400 we don't really have on this cat), and she's got a followup appointment for another round of shots/meds; most kittens have worms anyway, and I've been feeding and touching (oxytocin is incredibly important for not growing up to be neurotic, and she's not getting the physical contact she should've had from being groomed by her mother and from sleeping 16 hours a day in a pile of 5 or 6 kittens) her religiously, so she's basically in "perfect" health now.)

Basically what I think is this: She was right around the age when she'd be starting to venture out of the nest with the mama cat. I think someone had a cat living on their property, and that cat had kittens, and then the kittens reached the right age and started coming out on the prowl with mom, and then whoever owned the property noticed the kittens for the first time and decided that wasn't acceptable and that the kittens had to go.

There's the issue of her being a singleton, and Whoever would've gotten rid of the entire litter, but there's a guardrail followed by a steep drop-off at the edge of the on-ramp, so it could just be that Lyra got lucky and was kinda dropped while the others were fully thrown. It's also possible that I unknowingly passed a few kittens on my way back to Lyra and just didn't see them because they'd been thrown farther into the grass and didn't hear them because they were in shock and not making noise, but if we all spent all day thinking about all the death in the world we'd go insane, so I'm going to assume that these theoretical kittens were thrown farther into the grass instead of landing on the road and so had more time to orient themselves to land correctly in the grass instead of landing nose-first on the pavement and that because of this they weren't in shock and ran into the woods out of fear of the cars.

Another issue is that I don't know why someone would go to the trouble of throwing kittens out of the window of a car - not even on the highway itself, but just barely at the beginning of the on-ramp where they could've easily been seen - at 6:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday (the blood was fresh and she was still in shock, and a lot of the people who live in this area are ignorant rednecks who might think it's funny to purposefully run over an animal, and a lot of people are stupid and don't pay attention while they're driving; I'm assuming she couldn't've been there for more than 3 or 4 minutes when we found her), instead of dropping the kittens of at a shelter/pound or a farm or something.

Can anyone think of a more likely explanation for how my little Lyra came to find herself in that situation?
