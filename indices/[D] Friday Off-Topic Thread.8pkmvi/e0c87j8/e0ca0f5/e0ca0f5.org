Based on your description of how skinny she was, and the issue of roundworms, my best guess is that she was born as a stray and got separated from her mother. Unable to find her way back, she ended up severely malnourished and dehydrated along the side of the road. My best guess as to the blood on her claws and face is that a bird might have mistaken her for roadkill, like you almost did, and tried to start picking bits off of her, except she fought back causing the bird fly off to wait a bit longer.
