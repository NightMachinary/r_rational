Kittens of that age tend not too wander particularly far from their mother and the nest. A large enough bird would've carried her off or killed her, and a bird too small for either of those things would've backed off as soon as Lyra fought back.

I guess didn't really describe the damage well enough. Her left eye had a bit of a scab on the bottom eyelid, right where you'd apply eyeliner. The area between the eye and the mouth, where the whiskers are, looks a bit scabbed on the left side as well. Her bottom left lip is the only part of her mouth that's still a little swollen.

Her injuries don't look like a result of a bird pecking at her, they look like a result of friction, and there's a pattern to her injuries. The nose is the only central injury, the mouth and the whisker area and the eye injuries are all on the left side of the face.
