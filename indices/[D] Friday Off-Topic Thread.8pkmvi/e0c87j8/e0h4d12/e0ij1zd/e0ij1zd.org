I don't know. They /really/ don't wander any meaningful distance away from their nest/mother at that age, and I feel like it's unlikely for a mother to have made her nest near there. And she wasn't on the side of the road, she was full-on in the almost-middle of the road; it's just that that particular on-ramp, near its connection with the main road, is close to twice as wide as a single lane. I suppose it's possible that a stone could've been launched at her face, but I really think it's improbable that she was in the middle of the road because she walked there, I think she was there because someone put her there, and I think she would've gone into the grass almost immediately if she wasn't in shock.
