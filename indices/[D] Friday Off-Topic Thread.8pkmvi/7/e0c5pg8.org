Here is simple problem that seems like it should be solvable and would provide a lot of value to me if I could solve it, but it has eluded me for a while.

The problem is ad-blocking on mobile (android).

As far as I can tell, I can't just install the ad-block chrome extension on android chrome (although I'm not entirely sure why---I guess mobile chrome just doesn't support extensions).

I found that I can install an "adblock browser" app, which does block some ads, but it is slow and buggy and the experience is just worse than chrome with ads. (Incidentally, I did realize it /is/ convenient to have two browsers installed on my phone, so just so I can have multiple "tabs" open at once, but that's a separate issue.)

Has anybody here found a nice solution for this?
