Huh, never thought of the sleep thing. I really should have noticed that at some point... In any event I should explain myself a bit better than my original comment, written a bit late at night. The way reality works in this system is that all standard, nonmagical things exist on the material plane, any any magical or otherwise "rule breaking" thing lies on an overlapping intangible plane inaccessible to everything and everyone save a select few. Magic users are those few who can interact with the immaterial and make it take form on the material level. The Imaginary Friend was created entirely out of magic and, despite having access to the bulk majority of the plane, can't interact with anything material, directly or indirectly, save you and your friend. (Your friend because he made her, you for reasons unknown)

She can't make anything she doesn't understand, so no phones and defiantly no internet, but if she's seen a book before she can make an accurate copy without having read it. The series of events that resulted in her creation have some really infinitesimal odds attached to it, with only a few dozen such creations having happened throughout human history, only two of which are still alive. They can perceive each other and interact, though one has secluded himself in a corner in the middle of nowhere for millennia and the other is magically imprisoned. Accordingly, in all functionality there is no one else there with her.

She can interact with you two both directly and indirectly, so fire, cold, and her picking you up would all work. (There would be another way to solve the existence problem, now that I'm thinking about it) In regards to general abilities, "pretty much anything" was me being lazy, so, in the order you listed: yes, only to you/your friend, with training maybe (but she has no real access to said training, and in any event it would only be affected relative to you three), same as the last one, no, once she knows what to track, if she finds someone who already can use them or a book describing how to. She can't make sentient life, so no ghosts, animals (actual animals can't perceive her), friends, or copies of people.
