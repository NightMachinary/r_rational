  She can't make anything she doesn't understand, so no phones and defiantly no internet, but if she's seen a book before she can make an accurate copy without having read it.

"Understand" is a vague term. If you gave me a book, I could understand the concept of "book" and the concepts written in the book, but I don't have total recall of every single sentence in the book. I probably don't even understand how ink sticks to paper and how printing presses work. In what sense can she "understand" a book in a way which lets her create a copy containing every single sentence in it, without memorising the sentences or the molecular bonds between the ink and paper, but would not also allow copying a cell phone or some other thing that she also only sees part of?
