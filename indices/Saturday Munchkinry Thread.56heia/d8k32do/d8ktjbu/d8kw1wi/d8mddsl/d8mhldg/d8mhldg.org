By understand I mean she has to know how to make one of whatever she wants to make. She was created some time before you met your friend or her, and in that time she realized the potential value of making books and accordingly learned how to do it (i.e. had her friend look up stuff on bookbinding and read over his shoulder). Given sufficient effort, she could construct a cellphone, but, seeing as it would have no way of interacting with the material Internet, there wouldn't be much of a point other than serving as a walkie talkie for you and your friend, which would be made redundant by her teleportation. None of you know why she can copy a book without knowing its contents though.
