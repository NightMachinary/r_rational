You have the power of imaginative pyromancer, which mean, you can make no limit amount of fires which seem real only to you. Meaning you can walk in total darkness and can still see with the fire in your head. That's all, you can't burn yourself or heat anything. Just light.

Edit: Yes, you could form the fire into any shape. And it would persist as long as you wish it. Meaning you must constantly will it into that shape, otherwise it will behave just like normal fire: it will extinguish, or spread out.

The fire attach to anything and move along with it. Plus you will always know where your fire is. There's no limit to how much fire you could control, you could call a fake meteor with no trouble. And let's just say that when it came to fire, your concentration and will power is limitless. (You still need to be concious though)

Putting flames where you can't see is OK, as long as you know where that is relative to you. Can't just say, 'burn the warehouse at 23 Wall Street' if you don't know where that is, and even when you do, can you really tell where is it (relative to you) in your head?
