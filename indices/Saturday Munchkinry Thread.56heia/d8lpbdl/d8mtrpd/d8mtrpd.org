Okay, so this is an inherently personal-focused power, it has no effect whatsoever on anyone or anything other than you, so the real question is 'what can I use this light-creation for to gain knowledge?'

The first and simplest idea is blunt illumination. You can keep a room dark and still see everything as clear as day. This has very limited applications, since the only situations in which it benefits you is one where you explicitly benefit from the room you're in being dark while also being able to see in it. Sure, there could be some situations, like reading a book without bothering anyone by turning the lights on or fighting in a dark room where only you can see clearly, but that's not much.

So now the question is, how versatile is this fire? Can I form it into distinct shapes and leave them that way? Do they persist as they get further away from me? If yes to both, I can use them to make notes that only I can see, which can be significantly more useful. For instance, the day before a test I could create notes on the desk out of fire, and look at those notes during the test.

Do the fires attach to moving objects, or are they fixed to the earth's surface? If they can be affixed to moving objects, I could take people and use the fire to write their name and other information I know on their bodies (presumably this could show through the flesh, so I have the entire frontal surface area to leave the notes). This improves my social skills by making sure I never forget a face or name or details about their life and also helps my memory by reminding me of something I might have wanted to bring up with them later.

Can I put flames where I can't see? On the other side of a wall? In China? Do I have to have geographic positioning of what I'm looking for? That last part is horribly exploitative, to the extent of information-from-nothing with can be leveraged into any-information-I-want (for instance, I could take a dictionary and put a flame on the first word of the sentence imparting me the most useful knowledge. Since I don't have to know where that word is, the flame would show up at the corresponding word). Apart from that, tricks mentioned earlier become easier with the fact that I no longer need my physical presence to write the notes.
