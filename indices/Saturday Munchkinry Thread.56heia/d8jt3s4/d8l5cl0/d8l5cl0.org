I'll assume that the me-in-the-box inhabits a nice virtuality (say at least a decent appartment), because sensory deprivation would be... bad. And that I have a general purpose programmable computer in there, which runs at subjective time and can send and receive bytes from outside.

Now I can partition my interests, and address the relevant subset with an internet-connected EM. This is very useful, as I spend a lot of time working with computers...

Presumably the black box should be secured in a reputable colocating exchange, for minimum latency and maximum throughput (ie multiple 10Gbps links). It's probably worth spending a lot of time and money on hardware and caching strategies to reduce EM latency, since whatever the tolerable threshold is that maximises dilation of subjective time (even if you can 'sleep(10)' the EM).

Pay for all of this with freelance development work. Read a lot. Watch movies. Collaborate with physically-instantiated self. Investigate telepresence :)
