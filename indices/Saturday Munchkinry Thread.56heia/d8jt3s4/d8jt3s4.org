You have a black box containing a copy of your mind as it is now, only able to communicate with the outside world via a single text interface like a chat program. The copy of your mind has access to several computer functions like a notepad, a drawing program, and a calculator, but isn't any smarter than you are; these tools are only to help them organize their thoughts.

You may pause the copy of your mind, and you may speed it up a significant amount - say, 100 x real speed. You may copy the copy of your mind, but the mind-copies can only run on the black box, which you can't replicate, and you can only run one copy at a time.

What do you use this for?
