It's probably better to find a ruler and cooperate with them than to try to do everything alone. Granted this would water down a lot of potential changes, but I think it's still net beneficial. With low tech, there's realistically not much you can do to monitor and prevent sabotage attempts from within. Major upheaval should be avoided, because if the locals are displaced and disgruntled by it then there's not a lot you can do to stop them. That means working within the established system.
