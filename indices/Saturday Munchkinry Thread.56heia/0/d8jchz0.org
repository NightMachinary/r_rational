You have been thrown back in time and somehow became ruler of a small feudal territory in a medieval era, and other lords and barons are watching to see you fail and take your territory. No one is going to outright invade, but you need to keep your territory running smoothly and producing wealth despite potential sabotage. What would you do?

If you can't tell, I'm desiring recommendations on stories where a modern day person is sent back in time or to a more primitive world and attempts to improve it.

P.S. [[/u/gods_fear_me]] have you considered letting the auto moderator do the posting from now on?
