Assume England at 1200 C.E.

Pasteurization would be a big deal. I fund the building of small civic centers in every moderately large hamlet. Under a new law, all cow farmers may sell their milk on the market only if it has been "treated" by someone at a civic center that I have told how to pasteurize (the treating is free of charge).

The civic centers also offer smallpox vaccination by cowpox. Before that, tests are done to determine the correct amount of cowpox dosage to insure smallpox immunity. The vaccination is distributed among the largest urban centers to begin with, but eventually are made available to the larger population.

I believe that I could design a gravity based plumbing system that would be a moderately large boon to sanitation in urban centers. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would do much to slow the massive death tolls in cities at the time.

These benefits to the health of my subjects would allow for larger cities. Using the funds from the "magic milk" that my farmers produce, I would begin further development of the central city of my territory. I don't know enough about engineering to allow for huge buildings, but a better plumbing system combined with sensible urban planning would allow for a continuously growing city larger than its neighbors. I fund the development of a few more large schools and offer tax breaks to literate citizens. The environment of the time wouldn't allow me to introduce chemistry or advanced biology yet, but it would still provide a greater base of educated citizens to generate innovation.

To generate more wealth, I could provide a base form of insurance to nobles of the surrounding fiefdoms; they pay me money every year, and when their grain harvest isn't enough to feed its citizens, they get grain supplements from me, among other things.

I'm not a huge military tech buff, but I could plant the idea of the cannon into the heads of some local craftsman and see what happens. Within a generation, I might have cannons (or something similar) at my disposal. I think I'm reasonably good with diplomacy, so that could reasonably suffice for a time.

From here, I aim to alter educational, social, and economic systems such that, after my death, innovation and urbanization would continue. I get an heir and have him or her co-rule with me for a long period. I probably wouldn't take military action against other fiefdoms unless I had to.

Sorry if it's a poor quality answer, I'm new at munchkin-ing.
