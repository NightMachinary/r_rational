  Pasteurization would be a big deal.

Pasteurization is very much a boon for increasing the shelf-life of milk. However, that only became a concern when people started living away from freshly-squeezed milk during the industrial revolution. Your subjects would likely all have their own cows or access to freshly produced milk, making the need for pasteurization limited to those not living on a farm, i.e. probably just you in your castle.
