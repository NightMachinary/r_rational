Why would you ever choose the pro-social option for your alternate selves and press the suicide button, though? Wouldn't you keep thinking "oh, okay, well, it's unfortunate that it didn't turn out how I wanted, but I still want to live"? Quantum suicide exploits require a precommitment and I don't see how this is any different.
