I can't figure out how this is a power. It's functionally equivalent to a suicide button from your perspective. If we live in a quantum multiverse that splits every time something variable happens, then you can get the same result in real life with any device you can reliably kill yourself with. (According to the interpretation of some people, you'd need some kind of "quantum universe-splitting" randomizer to use as a coin-toss, but I disagree; I'm pretty sure the universe naturally splits enough to cover all your bases.) The only difference is that this power usually destroys the entire universe instead of just you, but a major point of quantum immortality is that from your perspective, these are the same thing.
