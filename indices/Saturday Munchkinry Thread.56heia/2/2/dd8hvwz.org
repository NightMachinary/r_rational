It would be a very bad idea to split the timeline too many times (by sending back the bit you last got each time) without a certain strategy to get rid of most of them, because some of your selves would have /bright ideas/ that start with splitting some more, all of the resulting selves would be the sort that have bright ideas and split a lot, and in short order almost all of the timelines are whatever singleton is most efficient at getting its timeline to split.

This rules out the strategies of "use the binary number your timeline is labelled with to win the lottery and terminate all timelines where you didn't win", "open the binary number as a text file and read it as advice" and particularly "compile the binary number and run the code" as foolish.

It doesn't immediately rule out more careful strategies like getting some hardware that has its probability of hardware failure below p, existential-risk-grade-carefully writing correct software, and then speeding up some NP-type problems by a factor of O(1/p).
