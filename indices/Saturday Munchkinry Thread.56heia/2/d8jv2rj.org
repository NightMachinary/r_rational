*From your perspective:*

Your power gives you the ability to send exactly 1 bit of information back in time to the last time you used your power. It /appears/ to function under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov self-consistency principle.]] That is to say, if you receive a 1 or a 0 from your future self, you will, for some reason or another, end up sending that exact same bit back in time. Each time you send a bit back in time, you immediately receive another bit from your future self. You never end up trying to create a Grandfather paradox. (Either you never got around to testing it, you always got cold feet at the last second, or it doesn't seem worth the risk to you.) You wonder if your power can be leveraged in any meaningful way.

*In reality:*

Your power works by splitting the timeline into two. In one(Timeline A), it feeds you a 1, and in the other(Timeline B), it feeds you a 0. These two timelines are otherwise identical. It lets the two timelines run until you attempt to "send" a bit of information back in time in one of them. This is actually a delusion on your part; your power does not actually send the bit back in time, it simply receives the input and compares it to the bit it fed you in the past. If the bit you attempt to send "back in time" is the same as the one you received, then it splits that timeline and repeats the process. If the bit does not match, then it ends the timeline. This is why it appears to follow the Novikov self-consistency principle; all timelines in which it doesn't are instantly deleted. You are unable to communicate with any of your copies in parallel timelines.

Example: Suppose that in Timeline B(the one in which you received a 0) you attempt to "send back" a 0 to your past self. Since this matches the bit you were given in the past, Timeline B will instantly split into two timelines, Timeline BA and Timeline BB. In Timeline BA, your power then feeds you a 1, and in Timeline BB it then feeds you a 0. Timeline A still exists. There are now 3 timelines;

Timeline A: In which you received a 1, and have not yet attempted to "send back" a bit.

Timeline BA In which you recieved a 0, "sent back" a 0, and received a 1.

Timeline BB In which you recieved a 0, "sent back" a 0, and recieved a 0.

If instead, however, you attempted to "send back" a 1 in Timeline B, that timeline would end, and only Timeline A would remain. (the one in which you received a 1) If you then tried to "send back" a 1 in Timeline A, it would split into two timelines, Timeline AA(in which you then receive a 1) and Timeline AB(in which you then receive a 0).

If there is only one remaining timeline running, and you attempt to "send back" a bit that is the opposite of the one you received, then your power will simply kill you instead of ending the timeline.

There is no limit to the number of timelines you can have running concurrently.
