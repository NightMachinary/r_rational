I'm pretty sure I would kill myself with this. Since I don't know how the power works automatically, all I know is that it appears to follow the Novikov self-consistency principle. The reason I know that is because that's how it always happened, right? But to learn that I'd need to experiment on my own.

In fact, I wouldn't even know that it /was/ time travel if all that happened was I sent the bit of information back and immediately got a new one. For all I know there are aliens sending me single bit messages and watching when and how I respond for whatever reason.

Since I know nothing about this power except for that I am receiving one bit messages and can send one bit messages, one of the first, most obvious things I would do is send the opposite of the received bit. After all, maybe the aliens sending messages want me to show I'm not just repeating them.

Boom, every timeline dies. The simple fact of the matter is that I wouldn't go anywhere near munchkinry until I understand the powers I'm wielding, and I won't get that far without sending the wrong bit back and seeing what happens. While you could argue that one of me would decide not to take the test, the difference between me that received a 1 and me that received a 0 is so minimal it wouldn't change the outcome of my decisions.

/But/, let's assume I get past that hurdle. Say I got a neatly wrapped information packet telling me everything you say I should know about this talent. Here's something I'll end up trying, even if it doesn't make sense by what the packet tells me about the power.

I'll sit down at a computer, refresh the message and get a 0 or 1. I'll type it into a web page that translates between binary and decimal and repeat. Dozens of 0's and 1's creating ludicrous amounts of timelines, but also forming a binary code in the translator. The key here is that for every exponentially large number of timelines where I receive garbage info, there's a few timelines in which I receive coherent information completely by random (It is also likely that I receive 75% of a coherent sentence, and am prompted to continue until it 'completes'). One timeline might end up being warned about rain tomorrow (regardless of if it rains tomorrow or not), another might get a message predicting the death of a celebrity.

Most of /these/ messages are worthless garbage predictions as well, but since I've brute forced /every single possible binary code of that size/ I'm guaranteed that every piece of information that I would consider an accurate prediction gets at least one timeline in which it is expressed. The me in those timelines become convinced the power produces information ex nihilo, and do it more. What's more, if I go into another set with a goal in mind, there will be a timeline with an answer that satisfies my 'question'.

Among an incalculably large sea of disappointed and disillusioned failures to produce useful information, there will be at least one of me who can sit down at a computer, have a question in mind, and abuse time travel so hard that I get the answer out of nothing. Impossible equations would fall before me. The solution to the world's greatest problems in an afternoon, so long as I ask the right questions (and even then, my power could 'correct' me). I could ask how to become supreme ruler of the world, and versions of me would hear /every possible way to do it/, with the methods even taking into account factors no one on Earth could predict.

And, from inside the timelines, I would never even realize that I'm leaving thousands of me, millions of me, vigintillions of me, quantities of me we don't even have numbers for, stuck with garbage nonsense and a power they consider far less useful. Some precious few of me will generate misleading information and resent my power for it, and there will be one poor sap who, every time he tries to get coherent information, ends up with the rickroll url.
