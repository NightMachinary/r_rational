The understanding I had was that the real, physical universe split into two simultaneous, physical, real timelines upon each bit sent back in time. From there, every universe with coherent information produced is as real as the originating universe, and also as real as every universe without coherent information.

It's a fantastically broad scope, since it means the power literally duplicates the entire universe with each use of the power, and that sending the wrong bit back literally destroys the entire universe.

And the fact of the matter is that the goal is not to have one true timeline with maximal success. With the complete and utter separation of the universes, which are all real all at the same time, it doesn't matter to the most successful version of me what happens to any other version of me. And just the same, the relative success of another version of me in another timeline does not weigh on any judgement of whether to physically destroy my current, entirely real, universe. And that's not even taking into account that I /don't know/ that the timelines work that way. Each and every version of me is utterly oblivious to the nature of the power, and also to the existence of any other versions of me.

There will be countless versions of me convinced they have a powerful time-travel oracular ability, as that is how it functioned for them. There will also be countless versions of me convinced they have a limited time-travel oracular ability, as that is how it functioned for /them/. There will be countless, mind-boggling, incomprehensible quantities of me convinced the power conveys no information, as that is how it functioned for them. There will be a few of me convinced of falsehoods, tricked into committing evils or great wrongs. Some of me, I expect, will be driven insane by the pure chance of environmental factors and the wrong messages properly interacting. All of these versions of me would be real people, in real physical universes living real human lives, and there is no reason for any of them to end their universe. Not even if I become convinced I've stumbled upon a supernatural power to generate the binary form of the rickroll url.
