This seems literally entirely useless to me. You can't learn anything about the future this way. What are you going to do, precommit to send a 1 back if event A happens and send a 0 back if event A doesn't happen? Sorry, but once you check to see whether you got a 1 or 0, you're obligated to send that 1 or 0 back regardless of whether event A happens. As described, this isn't a time machine; it's a random number generator.

How could this be tweaked to be a useful power? Well, I can think of one pretty simple way. Have the power /print out/ a 1 or 0 from the future every time it's used. You can then choose not to look at the slip of paper, and instead give it to someone else along with the rule you have in mind for deciding which number to send. Then, that person can receive information about the future, so long as they don't expose you to this information ahead of it coming true - in that case, they'll corrupt the process and make the number random by forcing you to say what you already said.
