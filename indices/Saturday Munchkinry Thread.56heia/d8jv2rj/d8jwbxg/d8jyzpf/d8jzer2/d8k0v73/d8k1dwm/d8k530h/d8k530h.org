  Wouldn't you keep thinking "oh, okay, well, it's unfortunate that it didn't turn out how I wanted, but I still want to live"?

Right, but you don't really ever know that it's a suicide button. From the perspective of the you in the parallel timeline, it's a shot at possibly rewriting the past.

Let's say I'm betting a million dollars on a coin flip. In one timeline, I get a 1 and choose heads, in the other I get a 0 and choose tails.

If the coin lands on heads, then the me in the second timeline would be tempted to "send back" a 1 instead in order to change the past in order to win. After all, to my knowledge, the worst that could actually happen is that a couple seconds of time are retconned. I'm not actually aware that it's a suicide button that destroys my timeline. Hell, I'm not even aware that there /are/ other timelines.

  Quantum suicide exploits require a precommitment and I don't see how this is any different.

This is true. In order to munchkin this power, you have to come up with protocols beforehand as to how to make choices based on the bit you get, otherwise your success rate will be unaffected by the power. Does 1 correspond to yes or no? True or false? High or low? Safe or risky?
