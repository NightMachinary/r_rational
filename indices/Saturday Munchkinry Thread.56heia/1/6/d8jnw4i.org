When you say it has the same effects on you mentally, I assume you mean in terms of your ability to remember it and not, say, making you extremely tired.

If a book had an emotional ending, would you find yourself feeling that emotion after your speed reading? Would it be possible to mentally poison the speed-reader with a particularly disturbing or psychologically targetted passage inserted into a book?

There's also potential munchkinry about what constitutes a book. If you pay somebody to stitch a bunch of books together you could read them all at once, though why you would bother when all you have to do is touch them is another matter.

More importantly, if you could somehow manage to read Wikipedia you could absorb a lot of information, although you'd run up against normal human memory limits extremely quickly even with the world's best memory techniques.
