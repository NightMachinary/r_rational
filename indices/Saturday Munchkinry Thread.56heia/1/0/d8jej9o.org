Reverse munchkinry: Drop a heavy object on the person. Or just shoot them.

Munchinry: Go to a library, start with books on memory management/enhancement and end with the last book in the library. If you don't manage to remember the contents of a book, touch it again. Go to another library. After the first library, choose national libraries or university libraries. Read books on learning languages if you encounter a book of a different language. See if the power works on audiobooks. What counts as a book? See if you can print all the data from Wikipedia on a print that's barely enough to read from and bind it into a book or more than one if necessary. Don't expect all data from books to be accurate.

Power munchkined.
