Well, I'd just go into my local university library and run my fingers along the spines of the stacks.

That should probably be sufficient, but I may book a trip to the Library of Congress. If there's a decay, I might try to procure books which are especially interesting to me.

What would I do with that knowledge? Probably try to establish multidisciplinary connections in research. After all, I won't have encyclopaedic knowledge, but I should still retain enough to see how things connect and know what is and isn't applicable.
