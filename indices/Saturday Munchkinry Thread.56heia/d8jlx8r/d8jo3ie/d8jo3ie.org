Doesn't literally everything have momentum, even massless particles like photons? So more or less it's god mode over everything within 1 foot of your body.

With that in mind, about the only thing you could really do is seal the momentum master in a vacuum large enough that they couldn't reach the edge before they suffocate, which would pretty much require them to walk inside your vacuum chamber of their own free will.
