Mastery of momentum

I can arbitrarily change or nullify the momentum of anything within 1 foot of my body the momentum I can impart has no upper limit. Once something with momentum enters my area I have perfect control, if something has momentum I can not be surprised.

Shoot me and the bullet comes back with the power of a railgun.

Burn me and I laugh as the temperature around me remains pleasant due to the molecules slowing down

Touch me and your fingers accelerate in different directions at high speed.

I am the master of momentum and I am Invincible!
