  Once something with momentum enters my area I have perfect control, if something has momentum I can not be surprised.

Does this mean you also have insanely good reflexes? Are you always in slow motion? Or is there some sort of automatic detection that is able to recognize when something "dangerous" enters your radius rather than a speck of dust or an air molecule.

Additionally, if you're able to control temperature by controlling molecules, do you have to consciously apply your power on every molecule individually? Or is there some sort of subroutine that you can call by wanting to "cool down the air" and then it understands that and applies your power to the necessary molecules.

Does this have infinite processing power and can do anything no matter how complicated instantaneously?

Does it have infinite precision? If I flood the area with poison gas can it pick out and reject all of the poison particles while leaving the oxygen untouched?

Does it work while you're asleep? Do you have to tell it ahead of time what sorts of things to protect you from, because if so I can try all sorts of weird wacky things and hope you didn't think of one. If not, how does it recognize "danger"?

Depending on the results of the above, and the resources I have available (since "no upper limit" means you're capable of annihilating the earth, I expect every government on the planet wants you gone, so I expect to have a lot of support.) I tentatively propose:

chop your head off while you sleep

nuclear bomb

poison gas bomb

flood the area with water (even if you keep it away from you with a 1 foot bubble, no new air will be entering the system)

burn everything (locally to remove oxygen, or in a wide area to cause you to starve)

poison your food, and/or use some sort of narcotics, depending on whether you can detect "poison" as a danger since you picking it up will give it momentum

And so on. I just have to hope that even if one of these does work it works quickly and you don't decide to annihilate the earth in revenge anyway because op op op op.
