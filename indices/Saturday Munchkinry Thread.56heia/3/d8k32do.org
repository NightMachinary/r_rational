You've recently made a friend who, despite being well into high school, still has an imaginary friend he regularly associates with, to the degree of having conversations with her in public. Normally, you would find such activity strange, but this is different, because you can see her too. In reality, your friend was unwittingly granted temporary access to powerful magic, which he used to think up an imaginary friend who, thanks to the magic, is now very much real. The only problem is that neither of them believe this, believing her to be merely a strangely intelligent figment of your friend's imagination.

Seeing as she exists only through vague magic, the conditions of her existence are as follows. She is invisible, inaudible, and intangible to everything and everyone save you and your friend, essentially existing in an overlapping plane to our own with you two being the only things to overlap. On her end, she can do pretty much anything, from pyrokinesis to matter creation, but the only things her powers can interact with are, again you and your friend. She rationalizes this as a) your friend made her, so of course he can see/interact with her, and b) you being clinically insane and out of touch with reality, interacting with some sort of overlapping copy of her.

My challenge to you fine people: convince the imaginary friend of her existence. Bonus points for munchkinning her power, limited as it is.

P.S. Sorry if the problem doesn't quite fit here, I'm a bit new to this sub, and thought this might be a place to crowdsourcing it (for reasons of defeating plotholes before they emerge)
