How does she interact whith you ?only vison or you can touch her or be affected by her powers ? How is that the imaginary friend thinks she isn't real if she can perceive things that the "real person"can for example if she enters in a room she knows things the "real"person doesn't and that should make obvious that she is real, I would propose using that to show her existence to the "real" person if it wastent to the fact that the "imaginary" friend for some reason is convinced that it doest exist so that probably indicates she ist self conscious or something (or really different from human minds at least)
