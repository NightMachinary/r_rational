She definitely knows she's real, because what does she do when he's asleep?

As for munchkining, any physically hidden information is yours. Cheating on tests is trivial. Winning the Randi prize is easy. There's definitely more exploits of the power as described...

...but I want to move onto questions.

Does the internet work in her "world"? Can she get a cell phone and look things up? Are there other other people there, and can she interact with them?

If she's not intangible to you and your friend, how much force can she exert on you? Can she pick you up? If she makes fire, does it warm you? If she makes cold, does it cool you?

Does "pretty much anything" include: Teleportation, telepathy, manipulation of time, manipulation of space, the creation of complex things you don't know how to make (cell phones, alzheimer's cures), tracking/tracing magics, learning/memory magics... I'll stop there.

Are there types of magic she can do that imply things like souls (ghost summoning), or that animals have intelligence (talking to them)?

Can she make friends that only exist in her world? Can she makes copies of herself? Can she make copies of "real" people (you, your friend).
