  she realized the potential value of making books and accordingly learned how to do it (i.e. had her friend look up stuff on bookbinding and read over his shoulder).

That doesn't really help. Okay, bookbinding tells you how to use paper, ink, and glue to make a book. Does she know how to make paper, ink, and glue? (If she can make something without needing to know how to make its components, that's an obvious exploitable loophole.)

  Given sufficient effort, she could construct a cellphone, but, seeing as it would have no way of interacting with the material Internet, there wouldn't be much of a point
#+end_quote

Using a cellphone isn't good for Internet, but it does let her send electrical signals that are interpreted by your cellphone as sounds. If she were to lift you and drop you, she would be able to use that to send slow morse code messages that everyone can hear. Sending a message to your cellphone is the equivalent, except instead of lifting and dropping you, she's lifting and dropping the speaker thousands of times per second, which other people should be able to hear for the same reason.

  None of you know why she can copy a book without knowing its contents though.
#+end_quote

Is it possible to figure it out and/or exploit it, or is this just an unknown that can't be researched?
