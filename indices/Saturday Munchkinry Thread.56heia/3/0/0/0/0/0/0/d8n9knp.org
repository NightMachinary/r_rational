Rule of Understanding is relative, only applying fully to complex items, namely anything requiring motion beyond the molecular scale or a power source to function. In essence, the harder something is to make, the more she needs to understand to make it. Books are simple enough that she can copy them with only a basic knowledge of how to make them. Components like paper and ink are simple enough that she needs only to have seen them before to make them.
