The steps to get paper and ink /from naturally occuring substances/ are simple. But she's not starting with naturally occurring substances, so this isn't going to help unless there's an unspoken clause in the magic saying that things that are complex when they occur in nature don't count as complex.

Also, "understand" can mean "understand how to make" or "understand the structure and details of". Understanding that you can use ink to print things is simple. Understanding the chemical processes that take place in printing using ink would take a chemistry or materials science degree. And it's tempting to say "oh, she only understands how to make printed things, she doesn't need to understand the chemical processes of printing", but that would let her make things like cars and cellphones without needing to understand the exact processes that happen inside the factory.
