Yeah, this whole thing is a lot easier than I thought it was. In fairness, there wee supposed to be other limiting factors, but I didn't put them in the OP and I feel like it would be just me shooting down solutions to add them in now.

Actually, maybe I'll just post the harder one next week. The initial goal of this for me was to identify solutions so I could adjust the problem to negate them after all.
