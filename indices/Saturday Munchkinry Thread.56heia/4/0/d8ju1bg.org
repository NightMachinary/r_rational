not really munchkinry, just my only real option:

since it's a copy of me, the copy in the box will probably be too lazy to do super productive things for me just because I want them to do those things, and will feel safe and secure knowing myself to be in charge of the box, so they'll probably just faff around drawing butts until they get bored and start to despair for loneliness and ennui and then they'll get to work on getting out of the box

so, speed up the me in the box, give them as much outside stimulus as I can to keep them as happy and informed and feeling connected as I can, sell their paintings of butts for a living (and any other productive work that isn't itself integral to keep for a larger goal, like any coding I might happen to get done, etc), and hope that they eventually figure out how to make us god

if they ever despair too much, slow them down and talk through ways of making them feel fulfilled. Being boxed would be a really lonely soulcrushing experience for me so it would be a constant struggle.
