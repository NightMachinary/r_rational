You have FMA-style alchemy, the Reverse Engineering Tinker power from the Worm Jumpchain, and have been to Mass Effect, Cyber Knight, and FTL since Worm. You are now in Warhammer 40k. You're a powerful, unsanctioned psyker. You've been found and recruited on arrival by a Recongregator Inquisitor. You're stuck here for at least 40 years.

Don't die. Fix the Imperium (problems to prioritize include tech stagnation, failing throne, eventual failure of astronomican, Chaos). Help the xenos as a bonus.

Alternatively, present strategies to get to the Throne in the above scenario with enough time to actually do something useful before the Custodes drag your ass out and shoot you.

(In short: "Am on Jumpchain, now in 40k. Wat do?")
