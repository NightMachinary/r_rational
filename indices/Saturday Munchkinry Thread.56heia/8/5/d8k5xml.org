How finely can you control it?

Its even more powerful than that. If you have precise enough control, you can instantly cool anything to near absolute zero by completely nullifying the kinetic energy of the molecules that make it up. Conversely you can super heat anything by increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules.

Reverse munchkin: You still need air to breathe and you can still be poisoned or asphyxiated. You still need food and water and can thus by poisoned or starved.
