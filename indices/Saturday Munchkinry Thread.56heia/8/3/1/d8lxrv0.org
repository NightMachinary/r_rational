Points like this bug me. They remind me of the moments where Wile E. Coyote runs off the edge of a cliff and is magically running on air, but as soon as he looks down he starts to fall.

Gravity doesn't work like that. Sure, you can't walk on air, but what's /worse/ is that the difference between walking on air and falling is whether Wile E. Coyote knew that gravity was misbehaving. It's as if Wile E. Coyote could suspend the laws of gravity because he didn't know they were supposed to apply.

Either this power over momentum works against all logic of reference frames, just like Wile E. Coyote could initially run on the air, or it never works like expected because of the problem of reference frames, just like when Wile E. Coyote falls to the ground. But not both, and definitely not because they suddenly became aware that what they were doing was impossible.
