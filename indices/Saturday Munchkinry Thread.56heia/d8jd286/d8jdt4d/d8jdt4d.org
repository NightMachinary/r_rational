How slowly?

I imagine most people have a number of reading speeds, speedreading, casual reading, contemplative reading, etc. If you read a book cover to cover over the course of 10 hours instead of 5 I would say most people would soak more of it in.

Also how does the outcome of this occur emotionally on you? Say you read something that makes you laugh, and cry, are you filled with all of the emotions at once?
