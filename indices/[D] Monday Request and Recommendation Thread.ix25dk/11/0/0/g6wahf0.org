Here's some more that I've found to be pretty good:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] is a Worm fanfic where the SI is the shard. Technically not SI, since you follow the pov of the main character Joe, but he's written well enough that it might as well be SI. Does characters and incremental power advancement really well and updates frequently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13398050/1/Going-Native][Going Native]] is DC/DBZ SI, except the SI gets almost all his Earthly memories and behaviour beaten out of him through Saiyan culture. Explores Saiyan culture and politics pretty well, and it's a good crossover of the Frieza Force into DC.
