So I've just recently started getting into rationalist fiction. A couple months back I read Unsong and yesterday I finished Mother of Learning. Mother of Learning was really enjoyable for me because it helped scratch the time-looping itch left behind by finishing the visual novel [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/648100/Raging_Loop/][Raging Loop]]. I mention it here in case anyone's looking for the reverse: something to scratch the itch of Mother of Learning with a story featuring an intelligent protagonist who systematically works their way through a time related mystery. I would highly recommend it, especially if you're already into visual novel stuff
