To be fair, the time loop mechanic in Purple Days is equally as traumatic. I thought the author of Purple Days did a really good job of showing how the time loop breaks Joffrey and then stitches him back. I wish that sort of thing happened to Subaru as well. It's not a story I enjoyed much, but it's still technically good.
