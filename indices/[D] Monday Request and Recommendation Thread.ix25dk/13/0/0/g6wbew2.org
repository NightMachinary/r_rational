I don't know if it can be called simple earnestness, but Ar'Kendrythist is half slice of life and half magic political drama. The slice of life aspects of it really show the simple enjoyments of life and community well. It's a somewhat controversial story in this subreddit but if you can get past the main character in the beginning it has some really nice slice of life.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover][The Demon Lord's Lover]] is an isekai romance story where the mentor of the current generation of Heroes falls in love with the Demon Queen. Not rational at all, but very enjoyable and has some nice worldbuilding and action.
