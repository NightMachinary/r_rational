I've never read/watched any of the works you've listed, but "intense earnestness and simple heart" sounds like a good description of [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]], Wildbow's latest webserial. It's about three girls who are brought into the world of Magic by the Others of their town, to investigate the murder of one of their number. It's a lot less grim than Wildbow's other published works, and even though it takes place in the world of Pact, it doesn't require knowledge of that story. It's been written explicitly for people who haven't read Pact, and won't feature any cameos.
