The Wild Card series (which I read back in the day) is basically a shared universe that GRRM edited. So yeah, the stories vary wildly based on the writer/character. There were gems strewn among the lesser pretty stones. (I can't think of any story in the first few books that was terrible, although some weren't to my taste. But its been decades and rose colored capes and all that).
