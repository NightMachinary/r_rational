Nope not at all, so now I just read worm fanfics :)

I did however find one series that hit some of the same notes. Chronicles of Fid has Dr. Fid, the world's greatest supervillain, fight to save the world. The main character's pretty edgy and the story is an age old cliche, but it's a fun romp regardless. He comes off adult in his edginess, and his development isn't as straightforward as it could've been, which made it interesting. It's also complete at 3 books on amazon.

For worm fanfics, recently I've really enjoyed Brockton's Celestial Forge. It's a tinker OC fic, with the powers being basically Inspired Inventor lite from worm cyoa v1. It depicts characters well, and while the main character is increasing in power really quickly, he's still shit at dealing with PR and politics, which means conflict ensues! It's really good, and updates with 10-20k words every week.
