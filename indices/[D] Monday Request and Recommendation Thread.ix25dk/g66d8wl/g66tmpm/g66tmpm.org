There's that amazing The Shocker story. I think [[http://forgotten.faithweb.com/MaxLandis/legit01.htm][here]] is a good place to read it.

There's the Superman fic Veritas by ShayneT, that's good.

There's some gonzo journalism story about following a group of minor supervillains that's you might like, but I forget the name.
