I've been reading that one recently as well. I love the detail put into the 1930s scene-setting, and the character building (of main characters as well as mooks) is stellar.

However, I would caveat that the beginning built up my expectation for a fairly rational story. Thus, the second half felt disappointing due to (in my opinion) overuse of tropes and the scarily competent opposition suddenly picking up lots of idiot balls. It's still an enjoyable read overall, though.
