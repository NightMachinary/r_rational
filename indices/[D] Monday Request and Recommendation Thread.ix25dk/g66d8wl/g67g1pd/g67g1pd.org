Citadel: Training in Necessity is, as far as I've read (book 2, ~chapter 35), an excellent superhero story.

[[https://unillustrated.wordpress.com/monster/]]

Book 1 is primarily an exploration of powers and training a class of heroes, while allowing for plot development & progression amidst dramatic tension.

It is at least rational-adjacent and might be considered rational (I'd have to re-read to confirm, but it was posted here a fair bit years ago).

Although it is on hiatus (since 2017) and incomplete, I still strongly recommend it if you're able and willing to deal with the general disappointment of an incomplete work for the sake of the rest.
