I think you're gonna have to look for stories that are mostly or entirely from one pov.

Dungeon Crawler Carl is sorta like that. We always read from his pov, so anything we learn he learns. He also tries to be smart with his decisions, although from time to time he makes emotionally charged decisions as well.

Miles Cameron's Masters and Mages mainly follows one character, which leads to reader having same info as character. It's not entirely rational since the magic in it is more mystical and people more emotional.

In Ar'Kendrythist we almost always follow the main character (with side story chapters from his daughter at times). The perspective character isn't rational, but the world is.
