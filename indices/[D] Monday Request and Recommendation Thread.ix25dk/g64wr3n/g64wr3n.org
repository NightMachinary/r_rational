For various reasons related to COV, publishers have held off on big releases until this month. That means that September is a great month for books in general, and fantasy books in particular. If you like published fantasy (or feel like getting into it), it's a good time. Here are a few books, and their associated series, that you might check out.

[[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609361/a-deadly-education-by-naomi-novik/][A Deadly Education]] --- A novel in a new series by Naomi Novik. I enjoyed her novel /Uprooted/, though I haven't gotten into anything else by her yet\\
[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089CLRRKR/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Battle Ground]] --- /Dresden Files/ is a great series about a wizard detective in Chicago. This book is the second half of a split novel, the first half came out a few months ago. The series is a little slow to start, some people recommend reading from the third or fourth book.\\
[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0865TSTWM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Piranesi]] ---The last major novel, /Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell/ by Clarke came out in the early 2000s. It was pretty amazing (and a massive doorstop). I'm excited to see what she's been cooking up for one trillion years.\\
[[https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Peace-Age-Madness-Book-ebook/dp/B0847KH373][The Trouble with Peace (The Age of Madness, #2]] --- If you ask my opinion (yes, I know you didn't), Joe Abercrombie might just be the best contemporary fantasy author. This is the second novel in a new series set in a (very) low fantasy world undergoing an industrial revolution. He's also written a young adult series that's pretty good. If you're looking for a place to start with him, I recommend his standalone novel /Best Served Cold/.
