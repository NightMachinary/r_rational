Yeah exactly. He's deliberately made to be someone who is hard to root for. That works with some people, didn't work for me. I thought that Subaru stayed too similar to what he once was even after experiencing many traumatic deaths and loops. Purple Days is sorta similar in having an unlikable protagonist at the start, but in Purple Days Joffrey gets lots of character development in the first 10-20 chapters.
