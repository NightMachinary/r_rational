I would say you might get more out of it from not having read the books or seen the series. As you get to see a lot of plot devices fresh and many twists that readers of the books see coming will be even bigger for you. As someone that has read the books he basically does a lot of development about people and places that are only briefly mentioned in the books, so you'd be just as ignorant as the rest of us when he takes the plot to new places. And every time he does introduce a new character he fleshes them out pretty solidly so you're never really confused about who is who and why they're acting the way they are.
