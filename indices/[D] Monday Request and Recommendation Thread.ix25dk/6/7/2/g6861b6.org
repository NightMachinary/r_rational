I really enjoyed the Shocker when I read it a few years ago, though the female characters felt shallow and one dimensional and the writing gave me a sexist vibe. I couldn't give you any specific examples of it, but the fact that when I just googled him and saw that he has had multiple sexual assault allegations against him, I can't really say I'm surprised. Again, I read this a few years ago, so I could be remembering incorrectly.
