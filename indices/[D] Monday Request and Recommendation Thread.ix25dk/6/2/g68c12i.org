I don't have anything exactly like worm, but here's some stuff that scratches some of the same itches that Worm did for me while being good enough that I can unqualifiedly recommend them:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]] The original rational superhero work by AlexanderWales, set in a somewhat AU superman. Discussion and use of (And well written use of) decision theory consequentialism, proxy conflict, and existential risk. Front warning that for better /and/ for worse it's from Lex Luthor's PoV, so that colors the story.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.27163/][Batman 1939]] One of the best DC AUs I've ever seen, or just AUs in general. An excellent series of stories, about batman, that genuinely feel as though they were set in the late thirties. Excellent writing and research, heavy focus on realistic result following from the premises, doesn't shy away from negative results but only includes them when they're sensible.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-liv-olivia-octavius-au-quest.53960/page-3#post-12218583][Spider-Liv]] Excellent Spider-Man fanfic in an AU marvel setting; among others, Olivia Octavia as Spider-Person, here Arachne. Features transhumanism, politics, AI.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/][Assimilation]] Somewhat self indulgent DC fic, but much better than pretty much everything in the glut of YJ fics. Makes heavy use of nanotech, transhumanism, and DC lore. Main character is not always fully rational but it's the kind of thing that I'd expect people on r/r to appreciate.

--------------

These aren't really similar to worm at all, but I do think they can stand in terms of quality.

My Hero Academia is a fairly textbook Shonen Superhero story, but it's a well executed example of such. It doesn't have much in the way of new ideas, but if you like those there's a lot to reccomend it.

One Punch Man is hilarious if you don't mind a setting not taking itself seriously. The protagonist is good, but the best of it comes in the secondary characters like King.

The Incredibles and Into The Spider-verse are the best two mainstream superhero movies in the last few decades, if you're looking for something more mainstream.

--------------

If you're in the mood for more worm, I can reccomend some fanfics for it, starting with [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/][Impurity]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-finely-honed-blade-worm-kara-no-kyoukai-garden-of-sinners.32454/][A FInely Honed Blade]], but I could go on so I'll hold off unless you're interested.
