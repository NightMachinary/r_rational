Yep, I just finished /Swimming in the Styx/ an hour ago and I see the author's been working away at the third installment this year. It's been a very enjoyable two weeks' worth of downtime reading, so very much obliged to your recommendation.The stories seem criminally underappreciated on the aggregating sites and I would've never found them.
