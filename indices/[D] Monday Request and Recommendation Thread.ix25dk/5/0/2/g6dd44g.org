The Percy Jackson universe has Roman, Egyptian, and Norse gods. I believe they had to deal with their own world ending scenarios at roughly the same time.

I once read a Percy Jackson/Fate Stay Night fanfic where Percy messes around in a FSN universe where gods are ships/AIs. I think the AI/ship gods are a thing in something called Atlantic Lostbelt. It was alright.
