Yeah exactly, and that's what I love about the story. The main character knows he has to change but he doesn't want to lose his core qualities. He tries to abide by both and ends up half assing both of them, and being a hypocrite to boot. Rationally he realizes his flaws, but in real life it's hard to change yourself. I'd say it's pretty realistic tbh, if not entirely rational.
