Ar'Kendrythist starts similar, and is about twice as long. Also updates with ~14k words per week.

Infinite Realm has more xianxia, and isn't as focused on exploring the system. Updates with 12-15k words per week in 3 chapters.

This subreddit is also the wrong place to find finished works :)

Other than those none of the other ones are that long.
