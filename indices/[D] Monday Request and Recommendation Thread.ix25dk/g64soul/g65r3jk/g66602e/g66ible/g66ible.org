There aren't many that are rational to the standards of this subreddit. Honestly, it's a preference thing. I personally am fine with something that isn't rational as long as it's enjoyable to me. But here are a few litrpg that have been recommended in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in the recent past.

- Ar'Kendrythist
- Delve
- Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends
- Shade Touched
- Never Die Twice
- Menocht Loop
- Blue Core (has explicit chapters that are labeled)
- Blessed Time

and a few more that I can't remember.
