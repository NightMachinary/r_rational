This is the first I've seen Rational Reads. It looks like it has the potential to be a very useful source! But it also looks like nobody has submitted new works to it in a while.

I'm going through and adding several.

(Also... it doesn't have HTTPS, so don't reuse a password on this site, even moreso than normal.)

Edit: I voted on and added everything I could think of that I've read, but it's still missing a lot. Looks like there hasn't been a big push to update it in at least a year. That means it's missing a fair chunk of stuff on the front page of [[/r/rational]] right now, along with a lot of LitRPG and Xanxia stuff from these rec threads. I estimate catching it up would only take around five rec thread readers doing the same thing I did.
