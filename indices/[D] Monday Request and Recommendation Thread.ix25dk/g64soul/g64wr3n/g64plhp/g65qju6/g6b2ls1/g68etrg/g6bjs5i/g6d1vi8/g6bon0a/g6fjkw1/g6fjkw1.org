The big difference is the length of the loops. Joffrey in Purple Days has sometimes years to decompress between traumatic resets. Subaru has less than a week at any given point. That said Subaru does get stitched back together after a pretty traumatic series of loops. I love Re:Zero though and I dropped Purple Days a few updates ago.
