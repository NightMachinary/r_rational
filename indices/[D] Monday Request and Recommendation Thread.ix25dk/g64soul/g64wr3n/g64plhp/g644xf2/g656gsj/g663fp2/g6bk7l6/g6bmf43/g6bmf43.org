For the Merchant Princes: " It's deconstructive. An ordinary girl one day discovers that she's the lost princess of a magical kingdom and gets whisked away to a life of adventure... except that the "ordinary girl" is a 35-year-old journalist who has her own life, and the "magical kingdom" draws more from /Game of Thrones/ and medieval Britain than it does Disneyland." Plus a lot of effort put into realism and eventually fully exploiting the abilities introduced.

For Empire Games: Dueling alternate timelines paired with near future technology and a surveillance state.
