I don't know of anything that stands up to Worm, but I have enjoyed reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21716713/chapters/51801295][But Doctor, I Am Pagliacci]].

It's a DC alternate universe story in which the Joker wakes up sane in Arkham, is told that the Batman does not exist, and then embarks on a well-reasoned quest to figure out what has gone wrong with reality.

Aside from that, I second the recs for Metropolitan Man and Batman 1939.
