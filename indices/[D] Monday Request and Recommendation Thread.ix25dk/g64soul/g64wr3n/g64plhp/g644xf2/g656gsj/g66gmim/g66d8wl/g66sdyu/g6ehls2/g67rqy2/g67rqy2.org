  For each Master, a Servant. For each Servant, a Master. The relic system was never introduced, and every Master in the Grail Wars has always received a Servant based on their own personality alone. Now, the Magus Killer goes to war - and receives his greatest weapon yet. But even with all of Assassin's skill and treachery, can they stand against the raw power of the Fourth War?

Fate Zero AU. Same Masters, different Servants, very different story. Mostly rational. Very well written. 18 chapters so far, still getting updated.
