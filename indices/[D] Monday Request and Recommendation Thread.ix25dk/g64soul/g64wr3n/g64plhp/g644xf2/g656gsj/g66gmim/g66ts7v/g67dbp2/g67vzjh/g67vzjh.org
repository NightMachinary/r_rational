I guess that could work. The thing is the original books were like that too where the gods suddenly gain character development after thousands of years. Kind of makes the main character seem like the chosen one which I don't like (even though he technically is in canon). Also I never really understood what they did all day when they couldn't help the heroes in the first four books.

I would love to see a version of “The Lightning Thief” where everyone realizes how stupid and insane it is to send 12 year olds to retrieve a nuclear bomb.
