The Dr. Dire series by Andrew Seiple and the Wildcard series edited by George R.R. Martin. Parts of wild cards are excellent, but there are no true main characters, it's more like a rogue's gallery of short stories in the same world. Not sure if Neil Gaiman's illustrated Sandman would be considered super-hero, but it is in the medium (comics) and it's good. Also the Watchmen (just one hardcover graphic novel) is one of the good ones.
