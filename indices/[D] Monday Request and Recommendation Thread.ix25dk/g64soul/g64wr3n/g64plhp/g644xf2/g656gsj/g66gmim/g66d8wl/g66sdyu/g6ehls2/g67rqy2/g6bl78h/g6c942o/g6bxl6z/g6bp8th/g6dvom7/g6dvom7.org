In contrast to the other conservative and safe commenters, I think you can beat the market by picking the right sectors to invest in. You'll do better by picking the sectors on the leading edge of growth. Growth is likely to be lopsided and biased towards certain directions. In the 1870s it was railways, in the 1920s it was automobiles, in the 1950s and 60s it was consumer electrics, 1980s electronics and for the past 10-20 years its been digital and electronics. This is a riskier path, where you have to think about speculative booms and busts, actually manage your money. And certainly, you can lose a lot of money if you get timing or target wrong.

But the potential rewards are much higher. Who isn't kicking themselves that they didn't invest in bitcoin in 2012? Google in '00? Facebook, Tesla, the FAANGs in general have been going up because people realised that this is where the leading edge is. The best way to do well is to be in on the leading edge before everyone else finds out.

You ultimately have to decide where you think the global economy is going. I think, along with [[http://ark-invest.com/][others]] that world growth is going to be clustered in AI, blockchain, genetics, robotics and so on. There are even ETFs that focus on these sort of innovative technologies.

Furthermore, I believe that no investment is really 'safe' outside boring stuff like gold. Index funds are just as vulnerable as crypto to these world-shaking systemic shocks: Coronavirus especially proved this. Better to hold a lot of risky investments that yield high potential rewards than just be picking up pennies from under a steamroller. The most you can lose is 100% of your investment, while there's virtually no limit on the upside.
