I knew that Riordan wrote about Egyptian gods but didn't know they were in the same universe. If the gods are in the same universe, that solves some issues leaves gaping holes in the rest but it's fine. Though what the hell happened that resulted in three apocalypses in the same time period lol? Thanks I'll refer to it for any material I may need.
