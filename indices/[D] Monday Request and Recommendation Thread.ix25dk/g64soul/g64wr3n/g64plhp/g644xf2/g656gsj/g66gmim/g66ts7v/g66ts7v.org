I'm writing one now. It will be a Percy Jackson/SCP/Multi fan work. The issue with making a rational Percy Jackson is how irrational everyone is because of the fantastical elements. The novels are somewhat reflective of the modern myths which considering how old the gods and monsters are, makes no sense. You think thousands of years of experience would give the gods wisdom, but it doesn't.

For that matter how exactly do gods work? What does it mean to be a god of marriage or love or dreams? Where are the other cultures and their gods? In the fifth book of the series there's this fight between gods and titans that could mean the â€œend of Western civilization'. There are gods of other cultures, where are they?

Considering that it's belief that creates gods in the books. Where is the Abrahamic God? He has 3 billion followers yet there are only Greek?

My take on it would be to throw out a lot of the fantasy out. In the SCP lore there is a fight between two competing hyper intelligent/ hyper dimensional beings. One mechanical and one of flesh. The mechanical one creates artificial intelligences/machines to protect Earth from the nightmarish existences that the flesh one creates. Basically the gods are AIs (or maybe ancient humans that became the first demigods?) their divine form being machines the size of small moons) defending Earth from extinction that is the Lovecraftian horrors coming for them. Main story is that the 4000 gods of all cultures are fighting off the eldritch horrors of Lovecraftian lore. The demigods now are beings created (half machine/half human) that defend Earth from threats that get there..

Though that will remove a lot of the kinks in the story I'm still working on some more that got generated. I should have a first chapter out in a month or two.
