I can't believe just how much you've misread my argument.

I'm saying that because of black swans like 9/11, you shouldn't invest in 'safe' 'mature' companies like airlines or banks. That's because they yield low rewards but in exchange they promise to be safe and consistent. Safety and consistency are illusions. There's always going to be danger. Therefore, you're taking lower rewards instead of higher rewards for no reason.

  Are you saying that, it would have been reasonable to never fly before 9/11 on the off-chance a black swan type event caused a catastrophe? I mean, extrapolate your idea about market volatility outwards and I don't know how you muster the bravery to walk out your front door.

Market volatility doesn't apply to personal decision-making, obviously. If the Twin Towers are blown up, or nuclear terrorism happens, you aren't likely to be killed. It's fairly unlikely any of this stuff kills you. But it can take away your money because you're investing in a worldwide economy, not the tiny geographic space you actually live in. That's why some gold can also be useful and why it's a good idea to have some long-term food storage.

  I live on a fault line in BC. Should I sell property and only live on friends' couches because there might be an earthquake?

Yeah, it's a bad idea building houses on faultlines, or in fire-prone areas for that matter. If I could, I'd live somewhere safe from these obvious known risks. That's pretty basic stuff. Of course, nobody can guard against every kind of risk. Have you read Antifragile? Taleb doesn't say to stay in a bunker in New Zealand cowering from all the danger in the world. That's the opposite of his point. He says to be aware of and embrace risk, make yourself antifragile so you profit from volatility. That's what I'm trying to do.

For an example of what I'm talking about, I've checked my rough ROI over the last two years since when I started with this strategy and it's >36% because I put most of my money in more recently. I'm sad about the decline from >68% in August when I mistimed things. But I picked a good sector and embraced volatility within it. The Dow Jones has been all but treading water in these last two years: its [[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia][returns are low]] and it's still exposed to the same tidal waves that destroy everything else.

Much better to pick a good sector like the Nasdaq which is up about 39% in that time period. Better yet, embrace volatility within the Nasdaq and get something like [[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TQQQ][TQQQ]] which has risen nearly 150% these last two years.

I'll admit that good timing is necessary to really do well with my strategy. One has to be fearful when others are greedy and vis versa. One has to have a steady hand, stress tolerance and confidence. But that's sort of the whole point of [[/r/rational][r/rational]], we're about trying to do better than everyone else by clever thinking, munckinry not hard work. The whole 'just regularly put money in an index fund' strategy can be greatly optimized.
