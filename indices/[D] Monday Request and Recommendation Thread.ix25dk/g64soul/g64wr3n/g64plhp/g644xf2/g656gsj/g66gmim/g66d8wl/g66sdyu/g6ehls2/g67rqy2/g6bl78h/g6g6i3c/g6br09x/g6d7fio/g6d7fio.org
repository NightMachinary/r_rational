You're probably gonna have to lower your standards for rationality. Usually in books you'll find a combination of emotionally charged decisions and emotional characters. Not much room for rational decision making there.

Most of Brandon Sanderson's works are internally consistent and have believable societies and munchkin-ing. However a lot of people don't like his prose and direct way of storytelling. Still higher quality than most webnovels.

Joe Abercrombie's stuff isn't entirely rational, but his character writing is top notch. To the point where all decisions feel in-character and justified.

Robin Hobb's character writing imo is even better. Her main Fitz series books are her most well known works. Fitz himself is pretty stupid though, and keeps making the same mistakes while telling himself that he'll get better next time. Similar flavor of suffering as Joon from Worth the candle.

Murder mysteries are probably another good place to find rational books.
