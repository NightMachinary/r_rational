I'm probably missing a comprehensive advise thread on the same subject somewhere in there, but do you know any books or series similar to Mother of Learning - not necessarily in the sense of making magic just a technology that doesn't work in real life, but in its mood?

I'm not sure what exactly I'm talking about; maybe it's the gradual and thorough establishing of obstacles and well-founded overcoming of them, maybe it's more the general optimistic view on problems, one that acknowledges the existence of the insurmountable ones but leads the storyâ€˜s conflict to hinging on the solution of the more mundane ones. Or maybe it's just the cinical person's coming to terms with other people having just as complex and valid motives as themselves. How would you describe that?
