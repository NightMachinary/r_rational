I wish there were a way to short your bank account in particular, friend. I can't believe you're sitting there with a straight face. Posting results-based evidence from a two-year ROI in what has been a seriously bull run of the market as support for your methodology being sound when it seems apparent from your postings you don't understand the basics of expected value assessment. I have to choose to believe for my own sanity this is some elaborate ruse to waste my time or trick the poor OP into dumping his bankroll somehow.

If you had put just all that money into AAPL stocks, you would have had a 104% ROI over two years.
