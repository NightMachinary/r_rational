Sure, there are a lot of meme coins. I don't buy them. It's pretty clear that YAM or whatever the newest ones are aren't legit. Some basic level of analysis is necessary. How big is the market cap? What does the white paper say? How long has it lasted?

My whole point is that given the most you can lose is everything, you should try and maximise the potential upside. Danger can't rise like reward can. Boring shares don't fall 80% like some of my crypto did. But they don't go up 57x either, like another coin. That's my point. The more volatility, the better.
