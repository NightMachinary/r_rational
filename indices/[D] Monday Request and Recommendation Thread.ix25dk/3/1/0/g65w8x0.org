You know I never saw it that way, but looking back I suppose so. It's got the YA action and dichotomy of good vs evil, but the series was my first into to 'structured' magic as it were. Even though it's nowhere rational compared to anything recommended here.

There are a lot of people with Martyr complexes in this though, Nina, Bug-Jesus, Ponch. Not to mention the very, very clear universally ordained bad guy who was once a good one.... Huh man it really is kinda Christian.

Still I would recommend it as the YA it is, it's certainly got more nuance with ideas about growing up, dealing with things like death, first love, loss, and making friends. Not to mention it's one of the few stories where the reasons for power levels maintianing throughout is explained. New Wizards have more raw power, but less control and the scales tip as one grows.

Not to mention the Aliens introduced as part of the main group in book 4(?) are a riot. The acceptance of the cheesy Tropes of trashy novels for Wizards of Mars, and the teenage angst with that.
