No. I'm being perfectly clear.

You can't lose more money than you put in (-100%). You can gain more than what you put in (+7000%). Given that the potential loss is limited, you're better off buying more 'risky' investments. Remember, the majority of risk comes from unknown unknowns: black swans like coronavirus or the GFC. Better to get something out of an inherently volatile system than just get hammered on 'safe' investments that yield low returns. Nothing is truly safe in the long-term.

Think about the poor Germans who invested in government bonds in WW1, the ones who did the 'safe' thing and left their money in the bank rather than buy shares or property. All wiped out in the 1923 hyperinflation. The world is volatile and we should embrace and profit from uncertainty.
