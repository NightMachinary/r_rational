I mean, I think you've gone all the way down the rabbit-hole of crazy person investing ideas. Do you think you deserve a high-effort response? You're upthread touting gold as a good long-term investment by comparison.

Let's talk about black swans. One of the examples Taleb mentions in his book is airplane hijackings. Before 9/11 they were (the next best thing to) basically unpredictable as a vector of risk. Pilots cockpits were open to the public, etc.

Are you saying that, it would have been reasonable to never fly before 9/11 on the off-chance a black swan type event caused a catastrophe? I mean, extrapolate your idea about market volatility outwards and I don't know how you muster the bravery to walk out your front door.

I live on a fault line in BC. Should I sell property and only live on friends' couches because there might be an earthquake?

Your premise is that the market is highly volatile and there could be an extreme risk. But you overcorrect and lean into this absolutely bizarre idea that the best investment strategy is to aim for the highest volatility approach possible. I'm sorry, it's nonsensical.

If I offer you three to one odds on a fair coin toss, you should take it, even on the off-chance I might die before you can collect. That miniscule chance doesn't mean you should take a bet where you get 1:2 odds just because I say I will take as many bets as you want to place.
