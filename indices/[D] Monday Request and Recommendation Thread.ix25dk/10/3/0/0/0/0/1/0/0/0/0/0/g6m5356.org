You're just exposing your own incoherence at this point.

Putting all that money into AAPL is literally a strategy I support! It's part of the pool of strategies I'm proposing. I'd have done it or things like it if I had better tax-accessibility to US markets.

And as for 'expected value assessment', that's ludicrous. You can't quantify risk accurately, numerically on a whole-market scale. It's a scam designed to separate suckers (you) from their money by providing false confidence. It's fragilista Mecca.
