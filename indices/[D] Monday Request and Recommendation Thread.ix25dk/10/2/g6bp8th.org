Check out [[/r/financialindependence]] and [[/r/personalfinance]] (or the personal finance subreddit specific to your country). They're good starting off points for saving and investing strategies. Wealthsimple and Robinhood are pretty decent hands-free investing options, or you can go fully manual and invest and trade stocks yourself through something like questrade.
