Personal finance is surprisingly simple. First, check out the [[/r/personalfinance]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics][wiki]] and follow the [[https://imgur.com/lSoUQr2][flow chart]] (if you're not American there's likely a version for your jurisdiction listed).

For equity investing, there are a few widely-accepted stylized facts which you should be aware of.

- You basically can't outperform the market. A lot of very smart people with the best credentials are paid a lot of money to try. Some of them succeed, but not consistently, and it's difficult to tell if they just got lucky over a short period and are about to revert to the mean.

- Corollary to the above point -- there are some things about investing you can control. You can control what mix of assets you invest in -- which will have different expected returns and behaviour. You can control the fees you're charged. You can't control the actual returns of what you invest in.

- Salespeople will suggest that because their product has outperformed over x number of years you should be willing to pay higher fees to invest in it. Generally this is wrong. Past performance does not reflect future results and there are a number of strategies in the active management industry to make it look like their product is worth the fees. One of the most classic is to start a number of funds (ten or more) with different investment strategies and wind down underperformers. After five or ten years, one of them will have outperformed the market by chance, and this will be the one they're pitching to you ten years later. The fact that this has performed better than the market by chance in the past does not mean it is likely to perform better in the future!

- Because of this, the best investing strategy is to invest in the broadest possible basket of companies at the lowest cost, typically using broad-market mutual funds or ETFs. You accept that market returns are fine for you (keeping in mind that market returns are much better than what the [[https://www.thebalance.com/why-average-investors-earn-below-average-market-returns-2388519][average equity investor receives]]).

There are also some popular niches like real estate investing, which actually are complex.
