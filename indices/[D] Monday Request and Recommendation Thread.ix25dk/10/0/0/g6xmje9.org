  One of the most classic is to start a number of funds (ten or more) with different investment strategies and wind down underperformers. After five or ten years, one of them will have outperformed the market by chance, and this will be the one they're pitching to you ten years later. The fact that this has performed better than the market by chance in the past does not mean it is likely to perform better in the future!

That reminds me of an early email scam I read about. It promises to sell a program predict football results (presumably for betting). It works like this.

You start off with a large dataset of active emails. Before the next match, you split your set in two and send two emails. The first group has team A win, the second has team B win. The email says this is a free trial and you can buy latter when convinced.

No one is going to be convinced by a single correct email prediction. So before the next match, you take the email set, throw away those you gave incorrect predictions, divide the remainder between Team C and Team D and sent out the predictions.

This contains on and on, with people believing you've successfully predicted many matches. Your software must really work!
