Empire Games is a sequel trilogy to the Merchant Princes series. I recommend reading Merchant Princes first to avoid spoilers, though I think it takes a few books to get to the dueling alternate timelines part. Omnibus versions are supposedly updated and better than the individual books, though I didn't read that version.
