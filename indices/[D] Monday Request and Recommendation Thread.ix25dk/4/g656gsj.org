Two of the three sequels to Charles Stross' Merchant Princes series, Empire Games and Dark State, have been released. Only recommending in the recs thread for now since it isn't complete yet and ends in a cliffhanger. The third book Invisible Sun should come out at the start of next year. I previously recommended the Merchant Princes series [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5rrykz/the_merchant_princes_series_by_charles_stross/][here]].
