I don't know about /more/.

I'd put it at "more Christian than Middle-Earth" (which is still Catholic if you know where to look) and "less Christian than Narnia," personally. Somewhere in the vicinity of Madeline L'Engle's /A Wrinkle in Time/ and other /Time Quintent/ books.

(If it weren't for the Satan stand-in, I'd actually say that /Young Wizards/ is more Jewish than Christian.)
