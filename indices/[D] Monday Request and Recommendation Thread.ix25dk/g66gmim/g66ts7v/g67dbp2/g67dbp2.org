  I'm writing one now. It will be a Percy Jackson/SCP/Multi fan work. The issue with making a rational Percy Jackson is how irrational everyone is because of the fantastical elements. The novels are somewhat reflective of the modern myths which considering how old the gods and monsters are, makes no sense. You think thousands of years of experience would give the gods wisdom, but it doesn't.

There's always the classic cop-out - that they're shaped by belief in such a manner that they can't change from the people who made those mistakes, because those mistakes are fundamental parts of the mythos and thus the belief that they rely upon.

One possible goal for them - possibly suggested by an outsider, given the nature of the problem - could be to overhaul those stories somehow, and improve themselves that way.
