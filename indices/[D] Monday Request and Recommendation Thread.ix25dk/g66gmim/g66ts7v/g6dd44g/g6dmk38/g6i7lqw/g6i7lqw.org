There's a crossover story between the MCs of the Egyptian and Greek series. The MC of the Norse series is the cousin of the one of the MCs of the Greek series. The Egyptian gods make a few references to meeting the Greek gods, and One minor plot turn involves a Roman soldier given an Egyptian burial, who ends up stuck between afterlives until the MCs free him to go to the Roman afterlife. This is briefly questioned and then dropped.
