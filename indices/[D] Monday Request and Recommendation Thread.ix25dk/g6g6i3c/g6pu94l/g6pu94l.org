What are your requirements / What are you looking for, and what are your standards? There are a fair number of "pretty good" SIs, but the list of ones I'd consider great is much shorter. The intersection of these fics and rational fics is near nil. I've got a list here of all the great and/or rational ones, plus a smattering of the better ones among the rest. If you're willing to take isekai too the list expands a good deal.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] Rational LitRPG SI, original setting. Probably the only SI on the list that I would describe as definitely rational, though some are arguable.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/][Assimilation]] DC SI fic, but much better than pretty much everything else in that category. Makes heavy use of nanotech and transhumanism, rational adjacent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244][Santize]] Naruto Warring States period. SI competence comes from a realistic comparative advantage and believable advances, good writing. Fair warning on lots of OCs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors][Vapors]] are two of the best naruto SIs. They're pretty long but quality is maintained fairly well throughout, if you just want to ig into an SI fic for a long time and not let go these are your fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22408759/chapters/53538715][Abolish Private Property]] Naruto SI, 3rd war perior. I did not know I needed this fic until I found it, but I did. Not as serious as some of the other works here.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/eye-of-the-gorgon-fate-grand-order-si.610048/][Eye of the Gorgon]] Fate/Grand Order Self Insert. Has the serious advantage of not trying to overbloat the main cast and not starting in Fuyuki, both of which I have 0 tolerance for because everyone tries them. Solid premise as well. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/but-it-wont-be-easy-sw-si.832994/][But it Won't be Easy]]Star Wars old republic SI. Sith SI, but like, the author doesn't drink edgelord sith kool-aid so it's a way better execution of the premise than the norm.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sunshine-superman-1960s-marvel-si.847345/][Sunshine Superman]] 1960's Marvel SI. Doesn't really have anything exceptional but it updates frequently and has solid writing.
