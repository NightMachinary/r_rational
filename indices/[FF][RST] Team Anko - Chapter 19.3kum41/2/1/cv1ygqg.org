Just wanted to chime in with a "yaay, thank you" -- the poly alternative to the normal teen angst love triangle plot (or worse, the anime harem plot where jealousy is used to demonstrate the immaturity of the female members) is refreshing and appreciated.

Given that Anko was described as being in a poly triad in the first chapter, it makes a lot of sense that it is developing this way. As in, even if Shino gets over his crush and it doesn't actually go that way, it's still good to see it being /addressed/ in the context of "yo, kid, these are some options you have" from Anko, and would be weird for her character if it didn't.

Can't speak from experience on how accurate any of what she says is, mind, just that it follows the story logic well enough and is believable for the given characters. So keep up the good work!
