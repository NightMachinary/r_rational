Ye gods, that was a long and convoluted read.

I had this entire long comment typed out as a reply to this, and then I realized I'm not comfortable posting that much personal information to the web, so it's gone.

TP;DW: I can see the comments [[/u/eaglejarl]] made, and I disagree with them, but my evidence is anecdotal and my conclusions are colored through a worldview that prizes monogamous sexual loyalty with a single long-term partner due to my disbelief that polyamorous relationships can work for the reasons stated in my above comment, and while it's great that [[/u/eaglejarl]] knows "tens of thousands" of people for whom it has worked, tens of thousands of 7.2827 billion people on the planet is a measly 0.00006875 percent if you give it the generous round estimate of 50,000, 0.0000275 percent of a more conservative 20,000 people, which is a very, very small percentage of the world's population in either case, and fits with the theory that "it doesn't work for most people".

Hell, even if we bump that to 500,000 people the world over, the percentage becomes 0.0006875, which is still...well, 68 ten thousandths of a percent of the world's population. Well outside the norm.
