You mean the cliffhanger? I think it was hinted over the last few chapters, so this comes as little surprise. Particularly in that it's likely a ruse of some sort to allow the team to escape.

I did like how it was covered Hinata was a bit harsh in dealing with her enemy, crippling then roasting her despite no longer being a threat. Wonder if she'd get reprimanded? Anko didn't seem annoyed...
