I like how you dealt with Shino's problem, not preachy nor forcing a path, instead providing multiple options. Anko makes a good point about youth behavior.

Orochimaru keeps skirting between gray and dark morality, which is a good way too keep his actions hard to guess by the reader. Liked how he goes teacher to tormentor role back and forth.

Good call on the throat injury. Makes sense to have some repercussions on such a fancy move.

Okay that's it so far.
