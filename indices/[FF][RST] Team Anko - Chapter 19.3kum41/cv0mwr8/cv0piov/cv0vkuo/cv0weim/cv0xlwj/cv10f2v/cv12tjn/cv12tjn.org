Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble poly relationships don't work for most people rabble rabble NaruHina rabble rabble Hinashino rabble rabble NaruShino rabble rabble shipping lanes rabble rabble rabble.

I think I covered all the bases there.

I mean, me personally I would prefer the story NOT take a poly approach to romance, but my objection is based more on my personal knowledge of human psychology and sociology.

I think Anko's "less then even" thing is bullshit, to use a strong term, unless she meant "less then even" as "below 50%, hovering at around 0.05%". Poly relationships don't tend to work for real people, because real people rarely form romantic bonds (and I'm speaking purely of romantic bonds formed of mutual respect and/or adoration, rather then romantic bonds of convenience, emotional or financial stability and/or security, or their non-romantic ilk) that can stand the pressures of not being the central point of the other person's similar romantic bond (again, pure "I love you for you, and you for me" romance romantic bonds).

There is always the creeping uncertainty in poly situations of one point being weighted more strongly. To make an example, Naru-Hina-Shino triad may face the following relationship creepers:

- Naruto and Shino are in this because Hinata, but don't really like each other in any sort of romantic sense, and are doing this for Hinata's sake. Unstable in a myriad ways.
- Hinata's long-standing Naruto love is more noticable then a growing affection for Shino, and Shino begins to worry if Hinata actually loves Naruto, and just kinda sorta likes him. Unstable in a myriad ways.
- Naruto notices Hinata starting to warm to Shino in the same depth that she's warmed to him, and becomes jealous, similarly to how Shino feels now but more Jinchuuriki SMASH impulsive jealous (perhaps egged on by a bored Kurama). Unstable ain't even the word for here.

These are just the "off the top of my head" examples, and perhaps I am off on something due to the whole "child super-soldiers" thing fisking with normal psychology a bit, but I think the point still stands.
