Thank you, I'm glad you like it. It always strikes me as...well, not surprising, but a little sad, that people don't even /think/ about this as an option when they're facing a love triangle. Most people haven't heard of poly, fewer are willing to admit the possibility that it can work, and obviously most -iads wouldn't work. Still, I always find myself looking at the done-to-death jealousy plotline and thinking "wow, wouldn't this be much easier if these guys were all poly and willing to take a swing at it?"

Which, I hasten to point out, is not necessarily what's going to happen with Team Anko. I made sure the option was presented to them, but the characters haven't finished telling me what they intend to do about it.
