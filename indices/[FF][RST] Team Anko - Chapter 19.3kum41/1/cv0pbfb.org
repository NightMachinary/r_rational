  "Shino, is it possible that you have a bit of a white-knight complex?" Anko asked.

Hmm. I wonder what type of testing Orochimaru is putting Hinata through? Seems to be checking how well she can concentrate on tiny details in the middle of combat, where dodging blows would take up most of one's attention.

Also curious about which solution Shino will pick for the issue of his crush on Hinata, for that matter. The fact a poly relationship as an option was mentioned is new, as most people these days wouldn't think of it. Seeing as Anko /is/ in one of those types of relationships, though, I'm not too surprised she brought it up.
