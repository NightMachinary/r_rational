The author addresses those exact points (at least the two story related ones):

#+begin_quote
  how long until Jake's 2 years are up?
#+end_quote

Each section of the recent chapters have the current date of Jake's reign when the events happen so...

#+begin_quote
  is this the end? are there any plot points needing to be resolved still?

Chapter 72 talks about the state of the story with regards to Jake and the other nobles. In short it's they're so massively overpowered now that there's not really any actual threats left so Book 2 is mostly about the regular people who are suddenly powerful, also Suze and her dealing with the mantle of Death.
