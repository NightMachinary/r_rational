  how long until Jake's 2 years are up?
#+end_quote

101 weeks as of the end of chapter 71. The events of Book 1 took 20 days.

#+begin_quote
  is this the end? are there any plot points needing to be resolved still?
#+end_quote

Chapter 71 was the end of Book 1...actually it was the end of Books 1-3 if you go by wordcount.

This is not the end. The rest of the story relates to the fallout of Book 1 -- the reconstruction, and Suze's growth into her new office. There might be some reappearances of old villains, as well. (hint, hint)

I have an additional 'story' entitled "Not a story: FAQ for The Two Year Emperor"; you can see it if you go to my profile page. I would link to it but Fanfiction is pooched right now. All of these questions and a bunch of others have been answered there. You might want to follow that 'story' so that when I update it in future you'll get the new Q+A's.

EDIT: It's back. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10838202/1/Not-a-story-FAQ-for-The-Two-Year-Emperor][Here's the link.]]

  what skills did you develop as a writer during the writing of this story?
#+end_quote

Foreshadowing, editing, and pacing.

  (and i'm really considering purchasing your short story)

Cool, I'm glad to hear it. One note: it's on sale through SendOwl. SendOwl is a service that manages the digital download and any necessary retries. The actual credit card processing is done by Stripe, which is the standard payment processor used by plenty of high-profile sites.

I mention this because a few people have balked at putting their credit card details into a site that they hadn't heard of before. At some point I'll likely turn "One Hot Night" into an ebook and sell it through Amazon, but that time is not on the current horizon. Also, when I do it will cost more than the current $1.99.
