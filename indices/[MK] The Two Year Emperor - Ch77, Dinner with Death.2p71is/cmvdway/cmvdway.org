i wonder where you're going with this now- i just spent the past few hours catching up from about chapter 40ish. I really feel like the stories been finished, the worlds been saved etcetc-

however, some questions:

how long until Jake's 2 years are up?

is this the end? are there any plot points needing to be resolved still?

what skills did you develop as a writer during the writing of this story?

(and i'm really considering purchasing your short story)
