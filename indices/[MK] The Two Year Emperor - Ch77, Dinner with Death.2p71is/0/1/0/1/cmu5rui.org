I think the gods are going to be pretty hush hush on the subject of "Thing that can kill a god". As to the Mindscrape, it is mind-affecting. I can't see why every person who has been through FLEA wouldn't keep a permanent Mind Blank on for quick and easy immunity to that, plus a contingent Mind Blank and or Programmed Amnesia in the event of a Mindscrape.

It's really the most dangerous spell available.
