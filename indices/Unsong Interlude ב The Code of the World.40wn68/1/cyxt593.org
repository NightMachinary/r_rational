Re footnote 1

#+begin_quote
  mass is carried by baryons
#+end_quote

Not quite correct in that other things than baryons also carry mass (eg the electron), but correct in the sense that of the visible matter in the universe (excluding dark matter and dark energy) something like 99.999% of the mass comes from baryons (in particular protons and neutrons).
