  Wish real world religions put that much effort into making everything make sense.

They do, they really do.

I suspect that esoteric mysticism is a kind of high-functioning schizophrenia that manifests in its sufferers as religious (and ideological) literalism and obsessive pattern-matching, and it shows up all over the place. Present mystics read the works of past mystics, and write new works for future mystics to obsessively glean for meaning. You can do it yourself, if you take a low-to-medium dose of a psychedelic.

Read Umberto Eco's books /Foucalt's Pendulum/ and /The Name of the Rose/, for some examples of the European Catholicism version of the phenomenon. I suspect that the Freeman On The Land movement is a libertarian version of it.
