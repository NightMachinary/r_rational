  For example George Washington could have first name Adam, and you wouldn't need to explain how George is farmer and Adam is dirt so basicaly the same thing.

Well, there's also the conspiracy theory that George Washington was secretly replaced by Adam Weishaupt of the Bavarian Illuminati, in which case George = Adam = farmer = earth; G.W. = A.W., drop the W's (burn the bushes) to factor out A.G. (Atah Gibor = "you are mighty"; half of the God-name AGLA = "you are mighty forever, o Lord").
