It's not hard really. You have bazillions of ways to stretch it to fit by translating into Latin/Greek/Hebrew, summing up letter values, truning them into Roman numerals, taking synonymes as equivalent, etc.

Funny experiment is to look at alternative patterns that could fit better for each explanation, but haven't occured, so the author had to stretch it somehow. For example George Washington could have first name Adam, and you wouldn't need to explain how George is farmer and Adam is dirt so basicaly the same thing.

As for other countries - I can try my :)

Polish history started with migrations of Slavs to Europe from Asia (through the Pontic steppe most probably - so basicaly a desert), but the turning point was much later in 966 after prince *M*ie*s*zko I (*M*e*s*co in Latin) united many western Slavic tribes into one country, accepted christianity and baptized the country.

BTW Mieszko was blind until he turned 7 y.o. according to Gall Anonymous chronicle. Moses was blind too for a while.

BTW2 Polanie tribes and Poland got their names from burning primal forest and using these clearings (polany) for farming. Buring bush, anyone?

It's really easy to make 100 different patterns fit if you want.
