I believe on one of Ross O'Donovan's levels played by the Game Grumps, there was an entire level based around being forced to kill Yoshis to progress. I think it was called 'You Are A Monster'. Apparently one of the hardcore gamers, I think the one that playtests Ross's levels, managed to get through the entire level without killing a single Yoshi. If you've seen the level, that's impressive.
