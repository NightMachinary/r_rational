Ok, so watching the whole structure of the level some things jump out at me. The first two biggest problems:

1. Lives are not valuable in Mario Maker - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGcB8CFUynk][Quoting superbunnyhop]], "Here's a Mario Maker tip, the one-ups don't matter. The 100 Mario challenge gives you so many lives that throwing you any more on the pile doesn't do anything. (...) put a power-up there with it." so there's no value whatsoever in the 1st choice.

2. Players do not attribute values for Yoshi by default, so there is no taboo in letting them fall towards their death. It wasn't that special in the old days of Mario World romhacks when ProtonJon got famous by doing it repeatedly, and it's even less nowadays.

So to try and work with the concept(and because I lack ownership of an WiiU and this game), here's what I think should be the kind of concept for a more "rational" level.

1. Get a clear objective for the player to fight for and include it in the title. For instance: "Get the flagtop", and add reinforcement checkpoints for that. If between each challenge there is a checkpoint flag where only the correct behaviour leads to, but they are not 100% punished for failing it(as in, the wrong path does not allow them to activate it, but allows them to continue) then the player will try to accomplish that goal in every iterate of the problem.

2. Get more phases for the level. Two data points do not serve for fitting any function(well, you fit a line to it, but it's certainly over-fitted). If you just use two steps then nobody will learn anything for it, it will just look like an unfair and random trap.

3. Attribute value to the things you want your player to lose. Show them that the jump towards the flagpole/checkpoint is only feasible with a Yoshi, then give them the choice towards keeping/letting go of the Yoshi and then invert their choice by level-design. This still does not align completely with the concept of the taboo trade-off, but it's better than the initial version.

4. Try to really temp the players with things they find highly valuable. A path with a cape where they end up having to face a lot of projectile enemies versus a path done by sacrificing themselves into small Mario and where at the end they get a mushroom is a far better trial for the players. Almost everyone will want to go for the cape unless you train them well beforehand.
