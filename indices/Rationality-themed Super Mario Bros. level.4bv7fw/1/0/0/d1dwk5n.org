I did say the first part was better than the second in the OP. :) From a level design perspective, you're supposed to use what you learned in the first part to make you question your tactics in the second part. The second part was mostly for laughs.

  Presumably it's impossible to throw a yoshi through a one way door?

Curse you for bringing this up! I discovered earlier today that if you jump at the right time with enough momentum, it is possible to propel the first Yoshi to solid ground and save all three. (Although the third one becomes a Cape Feather since the game doesn't let you have more than two Yoshis accounted for, so utility-wise they're mostly equivalent)

I have a revision with the brick floor extended several blocks through the One-Way Doors that I will replace the current version with when this thread is old enough to be disregarded; I'd've done it before, but then the original link, that someone could already have Bookmarked, would be a 404.
