/Linear Magic: Oathbreaker/ is a low poly 3d graphic novel about a girl who, in attempt to raise her friend from the dead, finds herself [[#s][chapter 1 spoiler]]. Together, they discover that magic has more potential than most mystics realize, but they'll need to break all the rules to actualize it.

This is experimental and I'm happy to receive any and all feedback. I lurk around these parts, but this is the first time I've released anything here. I've considered telling the story without the graphic element and I'm particularly curious if anyone here values the graphics enough for them to be worth the additional investment of time it takes to produce them.
