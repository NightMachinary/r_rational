I liked it on the whole. One issue is that she appears to have just been hanging out in her room, then the fact that her dad came in to the room was impetus for her to put her friend's soul into her head? There doesn't seem (to me) to be any reason for her to have done it when she did rather than an hour earlier, other than that the plot demanded that her dad enter the room first.

I'm definitely very interested in the ideas behind the plot though. Keep on writing!
