Sorry to trend on the "true anarchism^{tm"} but I'm an an-cap so fuck your end all capitalism, and government; end states, you are not acquainted with individualist anarchism in the least; I'll point to two sources "natural law"/"no teason" by Spooner, suggesting that the government, not states is not an invention by an-caps alone; and while I don't remember the source in the book "markets not capitalism"(I assume this represents multalism on a whole) one of the essays is on the meaning of "wages are theft", where they retreat from the impaction, its a crime but rather a vice they would never violently oppose.

They are incompatible, for the simple reason either "social contracts" overwrite individual rights or they do not. And taxation rests on social contracts, while extreme vices rest on individual rights. So even if you did believe all the horrible things about wages, it still falls into extreme vices so replace it with "meth" or something similar. Taxation is taxation regardless of how good a cause its funding, like saying "buying out all meth labs to destroy all meth", which our methhead wage slave may not be for; but the question is simple would you force him to give up meth or not if a "direct democracy" voted to get rid of all meth? Does your moral code protect exterme deviants?
