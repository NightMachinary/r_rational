What's a traditional anarchist, I've never once heard that phase and I'm not exactly a novice. These ideas come from the separate schools of anarchism, individual and collective. Basically to hold both at the same time you would need to hold two very contradictory ideas to the question "how should disputes over resources be settled?" Either you believe in property rights or communistic democracy (or a state) as ought to be the final arbitrator.

To take a simple example, an anti-gay store, either you respect property rights and allow them to continue to opperate or mob rule overrides it and you /force/ them to serve gays or shut down there's no middle ground here.
