The D&D alignment system is terrible for everything but a very black and white game. It's trying to put round pegs into square holes. Either the pegs aren't going to fit, or you're going to end up cutting off all the interesting bits in order to make them fit.

I've gotten in some big fights with people that stem from the ability to cast things like, "Detect Law", or the existence of weapons that require you to be a specific alignment. It's not enough to say, "My character thinks that taxation is theft and labor is slavery", you have to slap some kind of label on it, and unless you're explicitly playing to a defined type, you're going to run into trouble pretty quickly.

If you go look at those pages, it's easy to see the counter-examples, or the corner cases. I can be chaotic evil, driven by hedonism, and still not be a murderer (expect to the extent that any adventurer is). If I'm "chaotic evil" and also think in the long-term, I'm still not going to stab my supposed friends in the back, because that's a short-term solution. If I keep my word, people will know that I keep my word, and then those suckers will be tricked into trusting me. And then I'll abide by the agreements that I've struck, because that means that the next suckers will keep on believing that I'm trustworthy, which gets me better jobs and makes people treat me better. You can play a chaotic evil character who plays by the rules and routinely does "good", because he thinks that's the most convenient way to live life. (This is how I tend to play CE.)

When I DM, I ditch the alignment system entirely. Tell me what your character values, what they fear and what they love, who they have connections to and what their breaking points are, and we can come up with something a lot better than D&D uses.
