  These ideas come from the separate schools of anarchism, individual and collective.

Not really, no. All anarchists agree on getting rid of taxes and the government, and all anarchists agree on getting rid of wage-labor and capitalism.

Individualist variants of anarchism, like mutualism, still do not tolerate wage-labor, though they'll accept loans issued by a community provided that it doesn't result in a class of people who don't have to work like everybody else. Collective variants of anarchism, like anarcho-communism, still do not accept taxes, though they encourage voluntary communal arrangements which ensure that everyone produces what they are willing and able to produce and freely give away whatever they don't want to the community, and they are freely given things made by other members of the community, so it's effectively a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy][gift economy]].

The statement, "Taxation is stealing the product of our labor, and the wage labor system does the same" could easily come from any of the anarchist variants.
