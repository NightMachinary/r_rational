  [Lawful good characters] will obey the laws and customs of the area that they are in, but will attempt to find legal loopholes to disobey a law which is clearly evil or unjust.

Never understood that. So the LG crusader enters the Kingdom of Evil and is therefore expected to follow their laws? What?

What if a Lawful character lives in a lawless and anarchic country? Is he just free to do whatever with nothing to differentiate him from his mostly chaotic surroundings?

I always saw Lawful as the most subjective alignment. A mix of inner consistency when it comes to actions (do what your rules say not what you feel like doing) and a preference for conformity on both themselves and others. A LN character that also doesn't go into any extremes on any other type of axis (orange/blue morality) would probably prefer to have rules that everyone around him follows too rather than stick to his own laws even if everyone around him disagrees with them. It's only when Good, Evil, religiosity, loyalty or some other moral conviction comes into play that he wants to see his morals codified and if possible forced upon others.
