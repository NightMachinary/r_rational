It's hard to create genuinely hard choices in fiction as an author. You have to set restrictions on yourself and the flow of fate.

You have to also keep the balance of consequence and growth.

It is not easy to do this in general, it is even more difficult to do this in a situation that you are also trying to run everything rational and have the reader be able to make a decision one way or another on it.

To make the fiction work in that regard you need to build reader empathy with the characters. And characterization is not always very strong in rationalist fiction.

Barring empathy with the characters making the choices you have to show people what happens because of those choices.

And it will not necessarily be easy to show people what the other choices the reader might have taken will have as consequences unless you also show some one making that choice.

And that will increase length, require more tuning to keep the pacing of the story working and so on.

There is a degree of there are many difficult tasks you are going to end up taking on as a author, Rationalist fiction is one, but that is only one small part of a larger whole of all the other things needed to pull off what you describe.
