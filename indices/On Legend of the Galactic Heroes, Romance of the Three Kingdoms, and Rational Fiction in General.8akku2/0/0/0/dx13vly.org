I agree it is possible and it does occur. I'm just saying it increases difficulty in a none linear way. Handling those situations is really the tricky/skilled storyteller skill on its own. Then if you want to have the audience not just decide the character is an idiot you need buy in/empathy from the audience.

Then for rationalist fiction (to meet the full criteria) on top of that you need to run not just the 'sim' of is this person operating with the full extent of their ability and knowledge to accomplish their goals or even pick their goals.

Then to make this not mess up the previous elements you have to then take time for the audience to follow along and ingest the information in a well paced manner.

It is easier at this point to just cut some corner somewhere.

In my own writing I tend to cut on clarity for the maximum audience members. I aim for the emotion and pacing in favor of keeping the audience up to date on ALL information that the characters making decisions in the story are using.

But I'm also writing a pretty heavily 'foreign' xenofiction story that is trying to take in some of the themes you are talking about.

To use your example of an untrustworthy character.

At the whole believable/rationality failing look at grima wormtongue in Two Towers.

Operationally this is the scenario you describe about trustworthiness but I'm pretty sure we would both agree the execution leaves both 'hard decision' and 'rationality' lacking in its execution.

When your trying to juggle a lot of spinning plates human authors will tend to focus on somethings in absence of others.
