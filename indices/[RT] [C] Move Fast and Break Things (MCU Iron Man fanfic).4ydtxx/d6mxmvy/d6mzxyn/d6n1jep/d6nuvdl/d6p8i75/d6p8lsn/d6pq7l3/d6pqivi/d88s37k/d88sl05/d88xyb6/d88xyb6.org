Around july or august right now its September for me.

I hope that gives you an idea.

If it helps if I search up the chapters I could find what the author previously wrote for example for chapter 3 I found when searching on google I can see pieces of the text "Three of the criminals wrote notes right before they died. .... A Nigerian serial rapist, currently under arrest, would die of a heart attack after". He hasn't rewritten it yet but he's cleared the previous one with the other chapters in a attempt to start over. The current one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9380249/1/Rationalising-Death]]

where previously it had 10 chapters.
