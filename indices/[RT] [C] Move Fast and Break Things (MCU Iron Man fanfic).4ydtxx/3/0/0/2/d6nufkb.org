Calling Ozy a particular gender could be insulting, or they may be fine with it.

But I vaguely recall them going on record as "owning a vagina". I don't read a lot of their stuff. They're rationalist-adjacent(-adjacent?) though.

And from what little I've read of their stuff, Toni sounds like she has a lot in common with Ozy.
