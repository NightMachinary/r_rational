  TRP model of women is like a shoddy Ptolemaic model of the heavens, sometimes capable of regurgitating accurate predictions but utterly wrong about how things work.

Hey now, the Ptolemaic model was fuckin' GENIUS! While perhaps not nearly accurate enough to land a probe on Titan, it was more than sufficient to predict how some fiddly planets would move during a lifetime (perhaps with some minor recalibration). There's a reason it lasted over a millenium! Don't be dissing Ptolemy by comparing him to TRP's ramblings -- if anything, geocentrism is relatively better than whatever ("wrong") bleeding edge models psychologists/human behavioral ecologists/neuroscientists use to predict human behavior, given our lack of knowledge and predictive ability there.
