  Mostly from the rationality point of view.

I think that when a female character in a story being rational bothers you it may be time to reevaluate some of your beliefs.

Whatever TRP inspired ideas about mating, dating, and dominance you choose to subscribe to, history does not support the idea that women cannot be rational or intelligent. Books by female authors can be indistinguishable from ones by male authors, which is strong evidence for similarity of mind and intelligence.

And all that crap about wanting to be dominated and everything that may derive from that that TRP thrives on? I find it hard to believe that evolution was so tidy when building the brain that it managed to segregate that by sex. It's in everyone, of either sex, pushed to the fore or pulled back by social circumstances or perhaps hormones, but always there underneath waiting to come out, just like the corresponding drives to dominate, whether you are male of female.

Those articles The Red Pill likes so much about how women are always teenagers or less intelligent or need to be dominated are sickening, like Nazi tracts about Jews or white supremacist rants about blacks. The fact that there is a whole lot of very weird and partially sex related dominance stuff in the human brain does not make any of the rest of that crap at all true, any more than the fact that some people have dark skin makes the white supremacists right.

TRP model of women is like a shoddy Ptolemaic model of the heavens, sometimes capable of regurgitating accurate predictions but utterly wrong about how things work.
