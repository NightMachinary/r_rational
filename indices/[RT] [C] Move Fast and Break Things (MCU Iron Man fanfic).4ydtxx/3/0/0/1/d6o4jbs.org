  or just a male in a female's body (Taylor from Worm here is the absolutely perfect example of this).
#+end_quote

Errr, Taylor from Worm wasn't very interested in sex as far as I could tell. Emotional support and bonding/defense against the rest of the world were the goals, and just once these led to sex as almost a footnote. How is this like a male in a female's body? Isn't the standard stereotype of males that they're always interested in sex?
