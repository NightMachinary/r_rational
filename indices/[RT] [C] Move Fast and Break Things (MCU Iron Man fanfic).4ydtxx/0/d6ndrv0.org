Nice.

It's a rational-ish adaptation of the MCU, which goes through the stations of canon HP:MoR style: fast, out of order, and with extreme prejudice.

Toni Stark is funny, witty, and true to canon. The universe is more or less consistent, and feels like the Marvel Movies, except with more details and a somewhat stronger continuity.

One thing that bugs me is the portrayal of the western militaries and weapon manufacturing in general, as the fic seems to imply that basically every bullet that ever goes out of a factory /will/ be put in an innocent cancerous orphan's head, or, failing that, in his adorable puppy. In real life, gun traffic is a really complicated issue with lots of ugly aspects, and collateral damage is only one of them. Stark Industries weapons probably kill more dissidents in banana republics than Afghan civilians.

The thing that bothered me most, though, was how liberal everyone was about joining a super-secret terrorist group without requiring any proof of its good intentions or even having an idea of what the group does. It sort of fits Toni to do this on a whim, but I'd expect Pepper to say something about how people who send a super soldier to murder people they don't like on a regular basis, have no oversight of any kind, perform regulatory capture, shoot witnesses and won't let you see any of their leaders... aren't exactly guys you should join two weeks after you decided you hated violence.
