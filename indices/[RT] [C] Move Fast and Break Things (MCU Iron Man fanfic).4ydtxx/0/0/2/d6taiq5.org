[[#s][Spoiler and MCU spoilers]]

Non-spoilers: this story was clever, funny as hell in parts, and I think it might have pulled off the "superintelligent protagonist with major wisdom failures" trope even better with HPMoR did, if only by taking more opportunities to make ironic jokes about it.

I am also quite impressed with Ozy for, [[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/sexism-as-artistic-flaw/][after spotting a glaring missed opportunity in the Iron Man stories]], proceeding to fix it rather than just ranting about it as I would have done.
