Assuming that the html checks out, the chapter will have links in it, exactly where you'd expect them to be. I remember one story where every mention of a character turning on music or otherwise hearing some important noise was a hyperlink to an appropriate youtube video.

You can also embed images, change font colors (and make use of a couple of different types of font), and do some other minor formatting tricks. When you add tags, the ease with which anyone can respond to anyone else's comments on a chapter and others can follow the thread of each conversation, the myriad ways to search for stories, and the overall cleanness of the site, I cannot think of a single thing that FFnet does as well as Ao3, let alone better.
