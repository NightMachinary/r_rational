  I don't think that the audience factor is something that FFnet "does,"

Would "offers" be a better word?

  and depending on the fandom it just isn't true (Homestuck has more than three times as many fics on Ao3 as on FFnet; Supernatural has 30K more on Ao3; the Captain America films have six times more fics on Ao3; Worm's numbers are dismal on both sites, so you're better off posting on SV/SB).

Okay, that's fair. Last time I checked was a couple years ago and I didn't go through every fandom. (I'm also not a a fan of Worm, so that isn't an issue for me.)
