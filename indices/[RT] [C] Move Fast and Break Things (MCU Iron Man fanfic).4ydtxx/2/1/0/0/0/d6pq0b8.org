I don't think that the audience factor is something that FFnet "does," and depending on the fandom it just isn't true (Homestuck has more than three times as many fics on Ao3 as on FFnet; Supernatural has 30K more on Ao3; the Captain America films have six times more fics on Ao3; Worm's numbers are dismal on both sites, so you're better off posting on SV/SB).

You're right about statistics though! I didn't think about that (I care about comments more than views, so I rarely look at the statistics).
