  I cannot think of a single thing that FFnet does as well as Ao3, let alone better.

I agree with you that A03 is objectively better about tags, HTML, appearance, and a bunch of other things. Most importantly, it lets you reply to comments, which is an ENORMOUS problem I have with FFN. There's two things that FFN does better, though:

1. It has a larger audience.
2. It gives better statistics.\\

AO3 will tell me how many views the story got. FFN will tell me when they happened, what countries they came from, and a whole lot more. There's something really thrilling to me about knowing that people from very far away are reading my work, so every time I see the Isle of Man, Serbia, Korea, etc, I get a tiny shot of "I need to keep doing this!"
