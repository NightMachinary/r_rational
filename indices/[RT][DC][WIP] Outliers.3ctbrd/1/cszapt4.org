Starts really badly. Non-narrative start, too chipper and quirky, not sure what is happening or why I should care. In media res in a book I don't care about from this fictional universe makes me think I've stumbled into the writer's worldbuilding blog, not a serial novel.

Not downvoting, because it isn't OP's fault, but is this actually worth going further than the first dozen paragraphs?

*edit: Okay, look. That sounded harsh. Some background on this. As a writer, I see someone starting with background and characterless worldbuilding as one of the worst things they can do. That's where I'm coming from.

*read more edit: Writing isn't very punchy. Lots of back and forth dialog that goes nowhere. Throws out a lot of names that mean nothing to the reader with very little description on anything--which is modern, but not helpful in this sort of story. Someone is Indian, someone Canadian, but what are they like? Where are they? In front of a door? We've been in front of this door a while...

Second worst issue so far: the I...I...I problem. Starting too many sentences with "I" is sort of a novice first-person issue, and one a lot of writers miss until it is pointed out to them. It makes action and descriptions chunk badly and avoids those helpful declarative narrative statements that ground a reader in the world. The ones we do get are, yet again, character background.

Typically, you have a layout of action -> recover and review -> action. During action, you just jump in and go. During R&R, you lick your wounds and talk about your ex-boyfriend. Instead of starting with action, and for a second chapter in a row, we get background. People we don't know, with objectives that are not the focus of the chapter. Instead, we get a lot of people /talking/ about action. About how cool their powers are, and those of the people behind the door. We get talking about awesome stuff. Which is fine, but a slow start once again.

And a minor thing. Dialog paragraphing is sometimes off, with single lines instead of double-spaced. Sometimes, a lot of other characters' actions get stuck behind someone else's dialog in the same paragraph, too.

That's me having read the second chapter (or first plus prologue, whatever). I think this comment is done for now.

So again, worth reading more, if this is my opinion so far?
