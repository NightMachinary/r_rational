Well given my particular positions on identity I wouldn't be ethically able to ever use the golems (even were I totally selfish when you activate the golems the odds of you ending up as a golem are always between 1/2 and 1/3, so you're inevitably going to kill yourself this way).

However someone with a different philosophical framework would conclude they would be best served by using the golems to become extremely famous, since that's the minimum bar for accomplishment when it comes to superpowers (if you're the only person with magic). Plus I suppose you could use the golems to learn about how others perceive you and other neat things.

Actually now that I think about it I could accomplish a significant fraction of the fame just by the sheer weirdness of having these weird copies of myself even if they were never turned on. I would also be able to use them if they have some level of experience during their "rest" as opposed to just being turned off completely.

Still I think you're probably not going to do better than using this to get famous, since the copies aren't fundamentally capable of anything extraordinary enough to let you: become arbitrarily rich, generate new tech/science, or achieve world domination through mind control or coercion, nor any other obvious avenue to extreme wealth or power.

PS: A long term note regarding singularity stuff is that these golems could prevent the heat death of the universe by eternally turning a crank or something. They aren't totally resistant to damage either so you could probably link them into a physical style matrix setup while their body was controlled and made to perform maximum power generation. Given computing efficiency after the heat death them turning a crank (assuming they don't regen since that would let you get /way/ more power by feeding small black holes) could probably let you run a decent sized civilization: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ]]\\
Also there's probably ways to basically "upload" with singularity tech that wouldn't be counted by the golems as death (replacing neurons gradually with nanobots or something), but that assumes you want to stay linked forever which shouldn't matter that much because you could always create digital copies of yourself in a setup similar to the golems.
