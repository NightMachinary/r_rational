You have two 'golems'.

They look like you, and you can will them to turn on for a certain amount of time ranging from 1 second to 1 day, and a copy of your mind at the time they turn on will inhabit the golem and go around and do stuff. Once one turns off, you will be able to remember everything it did during that time, and it will need to 'rest' for an equal period of time before you can turn it on again.

They don't feel hunger or sleepiness and resistant to high levels of damage but do feel other sensations to the same extent you would in analogous situations, so, if e.g. someone shot one of them with a bullet, it would hurt a lot but there'd be no physical damage. Once you die, the 'golems' finish whatever amount of time they may be turned on for, have their resting period, and then turn on and off for 24 hour periods, each golem remember whatever it did and whatever is available from the other golem based on that golem's on/off schedule. If you live long enough to see mind uploading technology, and upload your mind to a computer and abandon your natural body, this counts as dying from the perspective of what happens with the golems. Basically a mind fork for up to 24 hours at a time, with some constraints. What are the most interesting things you could do if you A. tried to lead a basically ordinary life with this extra tool and the prospect of living on in the golems after your natural body's death B. decided to do something cool like take over the world or become a caped crimefighter or something
