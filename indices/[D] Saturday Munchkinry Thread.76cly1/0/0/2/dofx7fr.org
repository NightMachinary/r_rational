  Once you have these two set up, you're good. Your odds of long-term survival may actually be better in this new world than the old one.

The odds of you personally surviving for more than your natural lifespan are very close to zero. There are probably going to be a few scientists that survive the carnage, but it will be a long time before they can start focussing on life extension research and without facilities or access to the collected knowledge of the people left on earth it will take much longer to get there.

Humanity as a whole does have significantly better odd of surviving long term in this world, though. So I guess that's something.
