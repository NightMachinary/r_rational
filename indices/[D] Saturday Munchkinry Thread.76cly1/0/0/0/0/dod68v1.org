I am pessimistic for any sort of organized play of this. The people who I give best chance of surivival are military command structures. Soldiers carry weapons, food etc, if you have a pioneer platoon you get a ton of tools. They are used to order, able to fight, and have the survival mindset drilled into them.

Other people will survive because they were adjacent to those islands of ressources.

The composting phase is going to be a huge problem. Without all the specialized flora/fauna corpses rott from bacteria alone, dry out and mummify. The stench is unbearable.
