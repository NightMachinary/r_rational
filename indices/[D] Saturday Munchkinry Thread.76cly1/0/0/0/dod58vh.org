Very interesting! I think it may work out in theory.

What about the practice? How do you manipulate people to go down this road, convince them to listen to you, organize them, ensure that you stay alive?

Developing all of this and waiting for the plants to grow would probably take several months, during which you would need to ensure that the engineers and the infrastructure aren't threatened. How do you do this, since engaging in cannibalism for at least a short period would probably still be necessary, and the skilled ones are a minority?

Same questions to [[/u/SvalbardCaretaker][u/SvalbardCaretaker]], as to someone with a similar answer.
