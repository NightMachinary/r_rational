You have been transported to a different world. Rather than [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld][how it usually goes]], this world is pretty minimalistic: it has one indestructible flat surface for a floor, inexhaustible quantities of air, and featureless white sky providing some illumination.

You're not alone; in fact, a virtually infinite number of people found themselves in this situation alongside you. The entirety of this world is crowded with them, four people per one square meter. Their selection seems to be a sample of general population: some elderly people, some children, mostly adults. Miraculously, they all speak the same language you do.

(You may also assume that cannibalism-related diseases are conveniently decommissioned.)

What do you do? Is long-term survival possible?

I've found this idea in [[https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82][a Russian creepypasta]] of all things, and thought that it's an interesting challenge to take on.

Original story included some munchkinry in the form of convincing people to hold hands and pass on a message to do the same to the person behind them, which created a long chain of people. Using this chain, hand-written messages were transported. It helped organize people, and collect information about the world beyond the horizon (namely, that it's all the same there). Later, similarly-constructed spirals were also used.

Some additional information:

- Yes, there's more than seven billions people speaking English (or whatever your preferred language is). Original story used what is for all intents and purposes are procedurally generated people created for this very occurrence to explain it.

- People have whatever objects they remember wearing/holding before being teleported there.

- The story also hinted that people were selected/created for this such that they have basic impulse control and rationality, so that they're more likely to cooperate with organizing efforts and less likely to make idiotic decisions. Of course, it stops mattering after several days, when stress and hunger start driving them mad, but may be important at the beginning.
