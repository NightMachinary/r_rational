  80% relevant webcomic, finished: [[http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html]]

I had to do a double take when I saw that webcomic. I've never actually read it, but it's author (known as "Chatoyance" on fimfiction) is infamous for being perhaps the most controversial MLP fanfiction writer.

So for anyone looking to read it, be forewarned that there will probably be some controversial authorial viewpoints in there.
