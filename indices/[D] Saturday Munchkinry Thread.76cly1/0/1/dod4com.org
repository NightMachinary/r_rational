If there is a featureless white sky it gives light that is conducible to photosynthesis, even if its not at sun strength.

And if /everyone/ from earth is transported there, that means we have a supply of seeds/mud from farmers/gardeners and worms (from fishers). The first seed cycles would be incredibly rough, but it should be possible to get something longterm going.

You also imply that there are many many more than the 7 billion people from earth - virtually infinite people! So that means cannibalistic survival is possible until you run into a fundamental limit. Not the 7e9 down to one person limit, but:

When people/food density gets low enough that you cannot travel far enough in the additional time one person gets you. Thats kinda hard to estimate, how fast does meat spoil etc. But probably less than 250km before you hit The Wall, if you are really good with food conservation about 1000km maybe?

Unless of couse you secure yourself a more efficient vehicle! Bicycles, skateboards, inlineskates, garbage cans, bureau chairs, child strollers all have wheels and should be plentiful. And the one good thing about living in a featureless infinite plane is the fun to be had on wheels. So your limit stretches.

You might even get some form of car going - couple solar cells and electric motors from power tools, hair dries, kitchen mixers etc and you are good to go.
