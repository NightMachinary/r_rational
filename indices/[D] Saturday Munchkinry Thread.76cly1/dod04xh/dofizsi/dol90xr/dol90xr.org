How would a non-massless flat object with surface area of infinity affect gravity? I'm not wholly sure, so I'm inclined to just rule that the surface (and the ceiling) are magic, have zero mass despite being indestructible, and the whole thing is accelerating upwards at one /g/.

That said, if you have something interesting in mind regarding gravity effects, go ahead.
