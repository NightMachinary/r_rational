So far we thought that food would be the problem, but drinking water is actually the bottleneck. You need to kill and drink about one person every 48 hours! Blood doesnt keep, so thats the actual hard limit.

Now lets talk about short/mid/long term "planeology". Water: in 24 hours the entire plane is covered in urine. If the lightspending ceiling has a low finite height in a finely calculated range, we might get some sort of weather pattern and a water cycle with clouds/rain... If the infinite air does /not/ contain enough water and the ceiling is too high, all the water in all the humans just evaporates and never comes back.

Depending on if there is a heat sink and wether its in the plane or the ceiling, we also get amusing outcomes: no sink means everything gets as hot as the light emiting ceiling, *sink in the bottom means we actually get perpetual ground fog!* Only sink in the top has a chance of normal cloud pattern.
