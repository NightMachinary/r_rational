This is getting more and more fascinating.

Wouldn't no heat sink mean that the air would be getting hotter and hotter with time? It's not an issue with an unlimitedly-high ceiling, but would cause problems otherwise, in my understanding.

The ceiling in the original story did have a finite height, yes (building a hill of corpses to reach for it was a plot point). You're free to assume the same for my prompt.

I suppose the density of the fog/the clouds depends on the ceiling's height, yes?
