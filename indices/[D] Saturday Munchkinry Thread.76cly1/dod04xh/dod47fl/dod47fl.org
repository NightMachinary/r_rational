Simply put, if you're unfortunate enough to be in the middle, you're screwed, there's no hope of survival. Only the people on the edges can escape the bloodbath in the center.

For long-term survival, you will need some way of growing food, otherwise you would simply eat up all the other humans and then starve to death. But the ground is indestructible, so plants can't grow on it (their roots wouldn't be able to penetrate the ground). Luckily, you have plenty of human bodies to turn into soil and manure, and blood to turn into water, which you can then try to grow plants on... and since people arrive with whatever they are carrying, there are pretty decent odds of finding some seeds or grains.

But that brings us to another problem: there is no sunlight. All you have in this world is a featureless white sky providing *some* illumination. It is unlikely to be enough for growing plants.

Hope you left some engineers alive, because you're now going to need them to build some tools and systems.

(*Light System*)

Build solar panels to collect the dim illumination of the featureless white sky over a massive area of land, so you can convert it into electricity, which you can then use to generate enough light to grow plants on a much smaller area.

This is actually pretty doable. Since people arrive with whatever they are carrying, that will include a LOT of metals. Keys, wallets, cell phones, iPads, laptops, etc. So if you find enough engineers with the right knowledge/skill sets, they can change those metals into the required solar panels and artificial lighting systems.

(*Water System*)

The world contains inexhaustible quantities of air. Question is, what's in the air? Is there water vapour? Is there hydrogen that we can burn with oxygen to create water? If so, then you can use the electricity from the Light System to extract water out of the air so you don't run out of water.

Otherwise, you're going to need to build a large, airtight dome around the survivors, to keep water from evaporating into the air and diffusing out far away until you have no more water in your new home. You're going to need a lot more building material for this, but luckily, it doesn't have to be made of metal this time. So you could probably use anything from books to clothes to human flesh, after a lot of processing to break them down and turn the raw materials into airtight walls.

--------------

Once you have these two set up, you're good. Your odds of long-term survival may actually be better in this new world than the old one, since you have inexhaustible quantities of air (mass), a constant source of light (energy) from the featureless white sky, and an infinite amount of space (otherwise we would have been crushed to death by all the infinite air on arrival). So we wouldn't have to worry about entropy or the heat death of the universe.
