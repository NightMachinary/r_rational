Survival is only one of the things human beings value.

We're driven by instinct to value survival, but those same instincts, as well as (I'd argue) an unknown psychological process by which we acquire new motivations drive us to value things like love, freedom and the preservation of various things other than ourselves. Those aren't means to accomplishing any greater purpose (in this context), they're the fundamental basis of our decision-making.

A decent society is a social contract meant to promote what its constituents value. In Hannu Rajaniemi's novels, the Sobornost seem to do a very good job of promoting one of the things it's people value, but at the expense of seemingly every other thing. The uploaded minds in that society seem to be little more than tools, lacking most of the parts of our lives that we value for their own sake.

The Zoku seem like a much more representative society. I can't remember if their reasons for not keeping lots of backups of their minds around was ever fully explained, but I get the impression that it's more of a cultural aversion than something strictly disallowed. That said, the way the Zoku volition affects their minds is worrying. Can a society really be representative if it modifies what its constituents value?

While I'd greatly prefer the Zoku to the Sobornost, I think if I lived in that setting, I'd want to find a third option. Maybe one of the smaller, politically unaligned tribes.
