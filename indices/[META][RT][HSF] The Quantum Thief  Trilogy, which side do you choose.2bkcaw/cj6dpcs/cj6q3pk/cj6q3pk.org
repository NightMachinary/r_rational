Agreed argument is bad. My desire is for intelligent discussion of what prices are acceptable to pay, in order to complete the great common task. The le Flambur trilogy brings this question up in an interesting way, considering it is usually only brought up and discussed by those of us who are predisposed to be cheerleaders for the "kill death" faction.

Re the [meta]tag my thought process was, that if the hoped for discussion develops, then it will be more about what we in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] are willing to pay to give everyone immorality, than the le Flambur series I didn't express that well last night.
