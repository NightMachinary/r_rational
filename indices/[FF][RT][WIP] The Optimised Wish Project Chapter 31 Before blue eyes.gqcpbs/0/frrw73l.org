First post after a while. As I explain in the end notes, I've been busy and all sorts of stressed out due to the pandemic and that has affected my writing. It turns out having to commute with nothing else to do to work and back every day was a really key part of the creative process for me. Also, I've been doing some work connected to pandemic modelling myself, which took precedence and had me really focused for two-three weeks. I hope to start posting again, more or less slowly, though I don't think I'll be able to achieve my original one chapter every two weeks objective (not that I've really managed that most of the time either).

But the fic's not dead, so that's the good news.
