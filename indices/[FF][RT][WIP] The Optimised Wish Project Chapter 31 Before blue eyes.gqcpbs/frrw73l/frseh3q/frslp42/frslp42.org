Thanks! The work from home in itself wouldn't be that much trouble for me (I don't have children so it's not like the house makes it hard to focus), and I already used to work from home once in a while since I only need a computer anyway, but I guess not having a sharp cutoff makes it harder to get "out" of the work mindset? In practice I ended up spending most days unable to do anything vaguely creative at the end, and in fact often working for /longer/ than I usually would. It doesn't help that it's been a legitimately busy period.

And yeah, I have a lot of fun writing those sort of fights. In fact I'd say having the chance to do so was one major reason why I thought up this fanfic to begin with.
