It's great to know that you're okay. As someone who has also been doing work at home, I agree that it has additional challenges.

Also, the chapter was great. There were so many good parts it's hard to pick just one. Black was Good, Bulma was good, Goku was good, the end chapter reveal was great. Somehow everything made seemed to make more sense after reading it. Also, the general strategies you tend to have skilled but tech focused enemies use against conventional martial artists is great.
