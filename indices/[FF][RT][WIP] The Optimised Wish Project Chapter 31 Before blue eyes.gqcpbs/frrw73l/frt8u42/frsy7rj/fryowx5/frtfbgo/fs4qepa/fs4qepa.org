One set of objectives that lead to survival is simply call dad, update Black via speaker of the mutiny and maybe the theory of Baba's involvement, then hold out until Black talks Copper down. Hell, Black is competent and may have already realized and be dealing with Copper.

So Bulma mainly has to get to a phone and then hide. She has the advantage in terms of being able to reach inconvenient hiding places. So that seems more or less doable I think.
