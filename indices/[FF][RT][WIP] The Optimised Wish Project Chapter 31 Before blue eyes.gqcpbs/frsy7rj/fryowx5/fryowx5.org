I'm betting on Bulma's survival, if the rule about Shenron not granting the same wish twice* remains in play.

* this rule apparently includes wishes made in conjuction with other wishes, since for all intents and purposes it was used to try and make resurrection harder. The Namekians breaking the balance at the end of Z was really annoying, and felt like Toriyama had written himself into a corner and couldn't, Idk, wish for Shenron to come back early or something (there is precedent whenever Shenron / the Kami experience mortality difficulties, and Buu /did/ blow up the---wait, I just remembered I'm not using spoilers.)

The Youtube review series DragonBall Dissection pointed out an opportunity to use the "no repeating wishes" rule without it being exclusively for resurrections, which would have made a really painfully stupid plot point much better. I've kinda wanted to combine that with some of my ideas and try to squeeze something resembling a ratfic into the gaps filler weirdly ignored, but I somehow don't see myself ever getting beyond summaries. And it would be irrelevant to tOWP, because this story has already strongly implied that the catalyzing events will differ dramatically, if even happen at all.
