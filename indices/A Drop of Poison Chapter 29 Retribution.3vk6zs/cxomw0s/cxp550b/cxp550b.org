Overall it's fun and I enjoy reading it, but it has a couple weaknesses: First, the spag is often a bit flaky. Second, the author handed Naruto too many advantages. In particular:

1. Early on he finds this giant abandoned mansion belonging to a now-dead OC clan. "Two kilometers" below it (for the record, most coal mines are only about 300m deep) there is an absolutely enormous training ground -- it seems to be 2-3 km across. Also, there is a network of tunnels leading from there to everywhere in Konoha and the surroundings, and no one knows anything about any of it.
2. Naruto has clones search around the woods around Konoha for any lost or abandoned gear. This makes a lot of sense -- logically, ninja training out in the woods should frequently lose kunai, shuriken, maybe even occasionally a sword. In addition to those things, though, Naruto finds not one but /two/ summoning scrolls. (Along with other stuff that is also disbelief-causing, but the summoning scrolls are the big thing.)
3. The OC now-dead clan who owned the mansion were creators of forbidden jutsu, and they left behind a giant library of their techniques. Also, Naruto raids the Uchiha estate and finds even more.

Fortunately, those advantages don't actually play up that much. The main effect they have on the story is to introduce the rabbit summons, who make good and not overbalancing characters. There's also a lot of clones doing jutsu research which is fun to read about.

Behind those flaws, though, there's a good story. Naruto establishes multiple permanent identities [[#s][]]

The characterizations are good, and interactions happen in an organic way, with some people's opinions of Naruto changing in believable and well-earned ways.

So, yeah. If you can ignore the flaws, give it a shot. It's a fun read.
