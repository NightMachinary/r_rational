  logically, ninja training out in the woods should frequently lose kunai, shuriken, maybe even occasionally a sword
#+end_quote

I feel like this has never made sense for the ninja who actually train with weapons and tools. There should be some workaround for this; a seal that the shinobi can ping or summon or something. Either this is the case, or kunai and shuriken are incredibly cheap.

  a now-dead OC clan
#+end_quote

The 'Urahara' clan. I presume the name kido comes up a lot? This character is from Bleach, and has a space-warping desert (with an apparent blue sky) underneath his tiny Japanese shop.

#+begin_quote
  there is a network of tunnels leading from there to everywhere in Konoha and the surroundings, and no one knows anything about any of it.

Completely ridiculous.

  they left behind a giant library of their techniques. Also, Naruto raids the Uchiha estate and finds even more.
#+end_quote

Also ridiculous. What, does the author think that no one would ever think of such a thing, and that Naruto is either so original or that shinobi are so respectful of the dead that there would be anything left? Assuming that shinobi even write techniques down commonly. I think the forbidden scroll of seals is the only example of anyone learning anything from a scroll or book in canon, am I wrong?

I'm even more glad that I stopped reading where I did.
