I stopped watching Bleach around the second time Ichigo died, so I missed that reference. And the physical henge is pure cannon based on when Naruto was thrown by Sasuke in the Wave arc as a Demon Windmill Shuriken, unless Sasuke has trained extensively in throwing human sized and shaped projectiles. Naruto doing the jutsu wrong and basically brute forcing the physical henge has been fannon for a long time, to make up for a seemingly limitless physical transformation technique being one of the main 3 taught to beginners.
