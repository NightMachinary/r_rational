This fic has a few unlikely coincidences, including Naruto getting the Hokage to go along without giving him much information, getting a place to train lots of clones, scavenging unreasonably well, and being unreasonably lucky in gambling. Also, physical henges may be canon, but I don't think clones that can take damage are.

And pulling this plan off requires that Naruto be a perfect actor, including creating several adult personas, something which is hard for someone Naruto's age to do even all by itself.
