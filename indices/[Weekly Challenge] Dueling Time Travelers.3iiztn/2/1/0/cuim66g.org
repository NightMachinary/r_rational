Thats disappointing, I guess I wrote it too much like a fan fiction instead of a standalone. I prob should've had a paragraph at the beginning that made the implication that he's trapped in a loop clearer.

Question. Was it at least clear that he was being controlled by fate to act out the role of the enemy he briefly spoke about in the beginning?
