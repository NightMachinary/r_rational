It's more coherent than you might expect because it's not ASCII. It's encoded in a way that is designed specifically to preserve human speech at a high level through low-bandwidth, high-latency, high-noise ship-to-ship communications. It would actually be harder to send something that is just /slightly/ wrong.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
