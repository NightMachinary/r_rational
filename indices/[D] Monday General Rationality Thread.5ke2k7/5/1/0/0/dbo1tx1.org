The Faith vs Logic/Science argument is one that a lot of supposedly smart people are either really bad at understanding or fairly bad at articulating, so I wasn't particularly surprised that the video failed at it, and I particularly checked it to see if the channel stood out in that regard. I really need to get around to writing my own article on it.

As for good channels, QualiaSoup tends to be well done, and I particularly like their "Burden of Proof" video, especially since so many people, particularly religious apologists, are really bad at understanding it:

Another good channel is This Place. They made the "How Does Do Science?" video, which is a great, quick overview of scientific and rational epistemology and why it makes sense:
