well, i feel a little like banging my head against the wall. He's just like every intelligent christian apologist, creationist or climate change denier I've ever seen.

First of all, he says that he isnt going to argue against whether people should be effective altruists or not, and then he goes on to do exactly that. He then mentions a slightly inaccurate definition of utilitarianism, puts emphasis on the words "happiness" and "pleasure" in his slightly inaccurate definition as if to imply that utilitarians are hedonists without explicitly making that accusation. Then he explains what consequentialism is and makes it clear that he doesnt agree with either, but then he goes on to explain why he thinks that effective altruism is a bad thing using clearly consequentialist reasoning!

One claim he made is that effective altruism contributes to economic dependency of "developing" countries on the "developed" countries. First of all these dependencies would exist whether money was donated to the developed world or not. Effective altruism does not make these dependencies any more or less likely to go away any time soon.

Secondly, when he talks about economic harm of lost jobs compared to lives saved, he's forgetting that human lives are more important than money, and that the only reason that jobs and economics are important are /because/ they contribute to human life and wellbeing. also, having a job is useless if you and your whole family are DEAD from malaria! And maybe if more people donated money for tents, the business who sold those tents wouldnt have run out of business!

The third claim he makes is that we have a greater obligation to our friends and family or to people right in front of us than to the wider world. Well, if there was someone tied to traintracks and you had a button that you could press to save their lives, and you didnt have to do anything but press that button, and you choose not to press it because you have "a greater obligation to your friends and family", that's just moral laziness. you dont have to sacrifice the needs of your friends and family to press that button, and how near you are geographically to the person tied to the train tracks has nothing to do with that.

Also, it's an unfortante truth that no one can sustainably donate most of their income to help important causes. There is indeed a point where you must prioritize your own and your family's and friends wellbeing above that of a bunch of random strangers, but that is because otherwise you would not be capable of giving sustainably. if you do not take care of yourself, then you are not a sustainable source of income to donate to effective charities and you will save less lives. However, that point is well beyond where Carneades thinks it is. 10% of your income isn't necessarily that much of a sacrifice (dependng on how much you make) and donating what money you can reasonably give effectively is better than not donating it at all, or donating it to whatever gives you the feels instead of what actually does the most good. And if one is not willing to donate that much of their income, how much are they willing to donate exactly? how much does carneades think is the limit to how much of one's income should be spent on effective charities? as far as i can tell he thinks the answer is $0. i think the limit should be /whatever one is able to reasonably give while still being sustainable as a positive net source of good in the world, where good is defined as increase in human well being and decrease in human suffering and death./ nobody is saying that you should donate all your money to effective charities and leave none for yourself. not only will that make you miserable and poorly adjusted, but it will also make it harder to save more lives.
