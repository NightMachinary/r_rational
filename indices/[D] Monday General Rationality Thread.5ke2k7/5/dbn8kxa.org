Not exactly rationality, but I want to recommend one of my favourite youtube channels, [[https://www.youtube.com/user/carneadesofcyrene][Carneades]]. It is greatly underappreciated channel with hundreds of short videos on philosophical concepts.

It has some great videos, including [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmzTAJUspc8][thoughtful criticism of Effective Altruism]], [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz0n_SjOttTcmP-7y4beuYv49L3qiRtwn][overview of voting systems]]; criticisms of both [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz0n_SjOttTfTcXvrvy8_KV9pXCI635PR][atheism]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz0n_SjOttTd6ff_lDOliGEW6IIxrH9kp][religion]].
