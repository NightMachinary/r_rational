I don't think there is anything that can replace personal experience in the field. Often, there will be particular plots or techniques whose quality can be immediately judged if you know what a typical example looks like, but will be difficult to compare without that knowledge. From outside the field, you can see glaringly poor presentation of data (e.g. different representation of numbers in the same table, switching between stddev and FWHM to mislead a reader), but have a hard time finding honest mistakes (e.g. a poor background model, leading to something erroneously being listed as a peak).

For me, personal relations help quite a bit. I have a number of friends on facebook who will post research papers from their fields that they find interesting. With their approval of the paper, I can focus more on understanding it, trusting that the conclusion is reasonably valid.

This has the interesting side-effect of reducing my perceived reliability of other news sources for research results that I had not heard of before. A research article will get picked up by personal friends if it is interesting and correct, but will get picked up by wider social media if it is interesting, regardless of how correct it is. Therefore, within the fields that are covered by personal friends, pop-sci articles that come out without me hearing of them earlier are likely to be interesting and incorrect. I don't discount them immediately, but they certainly get a greater level of scrutiny.
