Well experts are going to do the hard work in any field. It's like saying "the people who are competent are the people who are competent".

There are two definitions of expert, as near as I can tell

- Someone accredited

and

- Someone competent

Of course competent people are competent. The problem is that accreditation doesn't seem like a reliable indicator of competence. Of course it's /evidence/ for competence, but not nearly as strong evidence as I'd like. Well actually I think a lot of post-secondary education is a crude stand-in for classism, so it being more accurate would be bad for breaking down classism, but accurate prediction of competence is probably worth that.

Anyway, I digress. The point is simply that I don't feel academic accreditation is a very good indicator of expertise or skill in a /lot/ of fields. It's often counterindicitive, in that I deal with a lot of fresh uni grads that don't know how to make a maintainable code base. And engineering is one of the disciplines that I imagine it's easier to measure peoples competence in.

Presuming that university prepares you similarly in other fields, and that the local universities are anything close to representative of the average, I predict that university only barely prepares people for solving real-world problems. Basically I expect people who do a lot of self-educating to be competent, and university doesn't really indicate whether someone has that tendency. It's a great resource if you make good use of it, but not much more.
