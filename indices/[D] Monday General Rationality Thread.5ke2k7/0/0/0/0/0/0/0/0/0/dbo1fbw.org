I'm glad that you can sympathize.

(My latest adventure: A couple of nights ago I had to explain to my fourteen-year-old brother how it is that, if one person says that smallpox is a virus, and another person says that it's an affliction caused by an evil spirit, /one of those people is objectively wrong./

The big sticking point was when I tried to convince him that even if the Evil Spirit Hypothesis posits an evil spirit that acts like a smallpox virus in every manner, it's still better to take that final step of believing that smallpox is caused by viruses and not evil spirits, because even a small mistake like assigning it to the wrong category can lead you to develop other errors along the way, or make it harder to updates your beliefs when it turns out that you were ever-so-slightly wrong about potential vectors or something.)
