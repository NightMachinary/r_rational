  So I have to ask what some of the problems are with my plans in my answer, and how to improve them.

IMO, of course, but I think your current story outline suffers from that particular type of Mary Sue-ism when everything in the universe works out exactly the way you want \ expect it to. For instance, this bit:

#+begin_quote
  Making objects immovable is also a great way of blocking off entrances, all you need is a sheet. If you cast it while moving a object you could also make it keep it's relative momentum which can be used to crush enemies to death in enclosed spaces and even use it to tunnel through solid rock.
#+end_quote

upon which you're later on essentially building most of your success and further solutions, established several major universe mechanics laws that were not mentioned in the original CYOA image:

1. that something that was originally distributed with the expectation to be used only as party tricks could be used as such a powerful weapon and tool (even if it was made in some Bioshock-type sub-verse);
2. that making an object immovable would mean essentially freezing its velocity \ momentum, and not, say, making it nailed in place in a specific (caster's?) frame of reference;
3. that the phenomenon which the pamphlet's author described as object immovability also essentially makes it indestructible (for instance compared to more commonly “known” form of immovability whereupon you freeze something up and are then free to start dishing out abuse at it at your leisure).
4. etc

You're free to choose to expand the canon's rules in your favour as much as possible, of course, but then the story becomes boring because most of the difficulty and conflict from the original setting disappear.

That all being said, I'm not too familiar with these one-image CYOAs and how the community around them expects them to work, so maybe making them as easy as possible /is/ the purpose, and your rendition on this one is actually doing rather swellingly despite my ministrations.
