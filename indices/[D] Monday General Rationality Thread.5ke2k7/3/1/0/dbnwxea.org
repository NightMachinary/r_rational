I'm just going with the rules as written interpretation that I think makes most sense. For instance since there's no absolute reference frame, the only way immovability could work is by freezing it's relative speeds. If it instead made it stationary relative to the caster, then you could do all the same tricks by briefly moving the caster as you finished the spell.\\
As for it being indestructible, well you can't cause damage to something if you can't move it, every conceivable form of damage would involve moving the item, remember it doesn't say it holds the item in place, it says /it makes it immovable/.

You could argue I'm not staying in the "spirit" of the CYOA even if i'm following RAW, but that's not really the point of this sort of rational munchkining.

  IMO, of course, but I think your current story outline suffers from that particular type of Mary Sue-ism when everything in the universe works out exactly the way you want \ expect it to. For instance, this bit:

Still even if i'm keeping with RAW I do worry that some parts of my plans do suffer from overoptimism. For instance I have some doubts about some of the logistics of later parts of the plan, and would welcome advice on how to fix them, as I mentioned in another comment.
