  the object wouldn't remain stationary from its own reference frame
#+end_quote

Isn't the object always stationary in its own reference frame (so long as it doesn't split or deform)? I.e. It isn't moving relative to itself.

  I said in another comment if it uses the reference frame of the caster at the time of casting then it can be exploited in a pretty similar way.
#+end_quote

I believe you misread my comment. I said to use the reference frame being the planet, not the caster.

#+begin_quote
  Even if the world's a simulation we can demonstrably see that motion within it works in relativistic ways that make the idea of an absolute reference frame incoherent.
#+end_quote

I feel a bit silly asking, but how would you demonstrate this? From my understanding, even if you could demonstrate it's not possible in our world, you can't determine that the simulator's world doesn't have properties that would allow you to simulate in a way we can't.
