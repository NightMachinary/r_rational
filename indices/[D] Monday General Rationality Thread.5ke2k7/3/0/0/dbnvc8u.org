  The island seems to have been constructed from a variety of different worlds and ages. It could exist in the far future, as part of a simulation, or somehow outside of time. That you'd leave the island only to find the rest of the world exactly as you left it seems like one of the less likely possibilities- although, if people and objects from different worlds and times can travel to the island, maybe it is somehow possible to travel to those worlds and times from the island.

My pet theory is that the island is in some other universe along with a bunch of other very crazy islands ("You're on a crazy island" was a popular subgenre at one point, with most examples having more or less the same mechanics). You can escape, possibly, but the odds of getting back to your original universe by chance alone are...not good.
