I'm sad to say that I mostly just use the standard skeptics toolkit. Is the claim outrageous? -5 truthiness. Is the body behind it notably biased? Are the results hard to measure, or do they deal directly with physical reality. Do the authors support postmodernism?

I'm never getting any real certainty from research papers, outside of very specific fields (we built a room-temperature maser, here it is) but I am getting a lot of evidence.

Take a look at the psychology replication crisis, as an example. I think there are even odds that any given paper is going to be bunk, which are horrible odds for something that's supposed to be pretty solid.

You can find papers that support pretty much any viewpoint. The answer seems to be that you've got to use the rationalist toolbox to asses them. Which sucks massively becouse it's supposed to be more reliable then reason.

Raw data is nice though.
