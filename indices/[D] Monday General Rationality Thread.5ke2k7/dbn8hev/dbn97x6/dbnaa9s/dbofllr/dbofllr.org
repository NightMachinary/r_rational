I'd say for best accuracy you should

- Gain a rough familiarity with the field. The accepted facts that seem as undisputed as possible.

- Come up with a hypothesis.

- Look through the available literature to see if you hypothesis is disproven, considered a crank theory, etc

- Run whatever experiments you can on the cheap.

--------------

Crafting hypotheses is a whole other subject though.
