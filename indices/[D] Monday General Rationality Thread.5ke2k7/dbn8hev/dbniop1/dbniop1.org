Mendeley.

  Personally, I'm finding that despite having a moderate background for this (several years of undergrad research, multiple courses on statistics, two MOOCs on data analysis, and years of reviewing papers recreationally / articles on the subject) I cannot definitively make a determination on most papers, in particular if they're not in my field.

Well, if it's outside your own field, you're supposed to go ask an expert. If it's in your field, you still need experience reviewing to get good at it.
