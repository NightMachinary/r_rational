Weekly Monday Update

In an effort to have no more zero weeks (see: zero days), I am now making a post in Monday general threads to catalog personal goings-ons and efforts. From what I've discussed with those on Discord, the post will be great. To that end, if you enjoy these or I don't make one one week, please pester me. It means I'm depressed or don't feel like anyone else enjoys these, and seeing someone care can make a big difference.

If anything I mention here seems interesting, let me know and we can discuss in more detail!

--------------

This week was Christmas, and I'll still be reeling from New Year's next week, so don't expect much.

*Story*

I have come up with what I believe to be a solid idea for a rational Pokemon story. With [[/u/DaystarEld]], [[/u/alexanderwales]], and the help of many of you on Discord, I think I have the underpinnings of a pretty good story! I don't want to go into too much detail on the story, but I can discuss the efforts in worldbuilding. My goal is to create a story first, and then kind of fit the world around it. So I have some main priorities that have to happen to fit the world, and then to have a world which can span from that and still feel like it actually exists. And as DayStar has mentioned in the past, the Pokemon world is full of terrible, terrible inconsistencies. Even the TV show and movies, in my experience, have only shown to keep things more 2-Dimensional. I just can't watch the shows and movies and see people living in those worlds, as they show enough to get me to start to ask questions, but not actually answer the questions either. How do trainers earn money? Can a trainer live in a pokemon world and still not know about Pidgeys by the time they're ten years old?

The plot holes are endless.
