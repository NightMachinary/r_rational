welcome. though i doubt it will do much if any good since im preaching to the choir here. the chances that anyone who watched that video will stumble across my rebuttal this far down the page and then change their minds or even consider what I said at all if they didn't already agree or partially agree with me on this seems pretty slim--for the same reason that i doubt a creationist would stumble across a defense of evolutionary biology and consider what it says at all or change their minds. Some positions are so reasonable and accurate that in order to maintain the opposing viewpoint you must either not ever be exposed to any more reasonable perspectives, or use weird motivated reasoning with linguistic loopholes and irrelevant knockdown arguments etc. This is the case for anyone who would defend slavery or who would say that the earth is the center of the solar system or that climate change is a hoax. /Maybe/ there's some sort of evidence that reasonable position is wrong on these things, but if that's the case it's really unlikely that some joe shmoe on youtube has access to super special secret knowledge that the rest of the world does not. Even if he were right, random joe shmoe on youtube does not know that.
