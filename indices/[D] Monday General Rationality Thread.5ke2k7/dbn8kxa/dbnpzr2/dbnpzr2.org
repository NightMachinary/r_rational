Tried to watch his "Are Faith and Reason Contradictory?" video. Was not impressed. He does the usual thing of playing fast and loose with the definition of "faith" so that he doesn't actually say anything meaningful about it, and so he can claim that reason can't justify its own axioms without faith.

Not a particularly rigorous or analytical thinker, in my view. Sorry: maybe his others are better.
