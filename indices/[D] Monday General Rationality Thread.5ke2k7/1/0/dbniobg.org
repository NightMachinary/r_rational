A. Similar =/= the same The fact that kids use similar methods doesn't automatically mean they're just as good at using them, just like with motor skills. Thus, they make more mistakes and believe more false things.

B. Children have less experience, less total knowledge of the world to sift through. If a baby was born with the same level of rationality as an adult, or if an adult from an alternate universe was warped into ours, they still would believe more false things than a normal adult does because of fewer reference points and general understanding of the universe.

C. One of the important methods of effectively learning in the real world is trust. Nobody has the time nor skill to derive all of science and mathematics and investigate all of history and art from scratch. Instead, many things that you know are learned from other people. Hearing or reading about things is much faster than experimenting for yourself, but carries the disadvantage of sometimes giving false information. The most reliable way of sifting through this is to gather information from multiple sources and weigh them against each other, and believe more strongly information that's provided by multiple sources. Additionally, some sources are more likely to lie than others, so you give more weight to sources that you deem reliable.

Since parents typically have their children's' best interests at heart, they have little incentive to lie, at least about anything important, and they provide an extremely large amount of correct information to their children. Thus children rationally categorize their parents as reliable sources. Thus, when their parents tell them that Santa Claus exists, and all of the adults around them, who are also trustworthy, corroborate this information. And the media tells them it's true, and all of the children around them also believe it, it's entirely rational to conclude that Santa is real. If you leveraged this level of conspiracy against any adult who grew up in some country isolated from the first world, they would believe it too.

When you tell someone the truth all the time and then lie about this one particular thing, they're going to think it's the truth too.
