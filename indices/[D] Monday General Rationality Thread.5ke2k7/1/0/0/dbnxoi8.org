On a sidenote for C,

1. I find that the experience of actually going through & deriving Maths & Physics from the base up (as presented in text books) does wonders for your understanding & application, rather than blindly applying the end "short cut formula" derived.

2. I don't know if it's just me, but my science classes generally do have lab sessions to replicate out the experiments.

All in all, not much you can do about Non-Newtonian Physics (like fracking Relativity) though. I also admit that no-one really does the non-basic experiments that's too complicated to practically do.

And you do have to take History & art on trust.
