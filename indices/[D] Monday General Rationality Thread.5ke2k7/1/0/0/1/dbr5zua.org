  All in all, not much you can do about Non-Newtonian Physics (like fracking Relativity) though. I also admit that no-one really does the non-basic experiments that's too complicated to practically do.

I've found that "The Time and Space of Uncle Albert" is a great way of presenting that; it provides setup and results of fairly easy to understand (but implausibly difficult to actually /do/) experiments, describes the results, then has a pair of characters who don't start out knowing the answers discuss the experiments at length.
