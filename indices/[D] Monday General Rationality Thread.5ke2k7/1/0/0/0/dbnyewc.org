Yeah, they're useful to do later after you already know and have been using math for at least a decade, but I don't think a five year old is equipped to understand any of that. They learn the basics much faster by simply trusting the teachers, and can gain many skills that way before eventually learning how to do things more rigorously many years later.

And I'm not just referring to "school" knowledge, but just general common sense about how the world works. I'm sure you know what cars do and have ridden in them and perhaps driven one without knowing how to build one from scratch. You probably use lightbulbs and washing machines without inventing them yourself. You probably eat all sorts of foods that you just assume aren't poisonous without having to do your own tests. And so on. Some of that you possibly discovered on your own when encountering them, but probably a great deal more was learned from your parents or other people who you implicitly trusted.
