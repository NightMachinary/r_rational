An Ny Mag article on what causes kids to stop believing in Santa [[http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/12/what-makes-kids-stop-believing-in-santa.html][(link)]].

  When it comes to evaluating information --- and separating the real from the bullshit --- kids aren't that different from adults, Woolley wrote. Over several studies, she and her colleagues illustrated the similarities between us and our younger counterparts: When learning something new, kids, like adults, take context into account; they measure the information against what they already know; and they consider the source, evaluating its trustworthiness and expertise, before deciding how much to believe.

  The question, then: If children are just as capable of seeing through nonsense, how come we adults have figured out that Santa doesn't exist, while kids still happily wait on line to sit on a jolly guy's lap and throw their energy into composing letters to the North Pole?
