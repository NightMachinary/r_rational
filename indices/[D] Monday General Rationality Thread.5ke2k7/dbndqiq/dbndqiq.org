So I wrote an answer to this CYOA: [[https://sli.mg/n1YlMv]] which ended up so long I had to put the full thing in a google doc: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbr8snCia58_2rjyUIn7oa768CS25VI8h1E8lYKWgEE/edit?usp=sharing]]

However I feel I really couldn't do it justice even in a few pages, so I'm actually considering writing a story about it. So I have to ask what some of the problems are with my plans in my answer, and how to improve them. Obviously I left out quite a lot of logistics, but I'm also kind of dubious about part of my plans, for instance how people would react to you suddenly launching hundreds of craft into space in a single day, as well as how well mass threat of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment]] from space would work as a way of forcing world governments to do what you want.\\
Earlier I also dig massive tunnel systems miles underneath the ground using magic, to launch coordinated strikes at the centers of government for a bunch of countries (sticking mostly to countries that don't have powerful allies). However i'm not sure how well that would work, or whether people might notice beforehand.
