See I wanted to use a strategy that could be done in a few years, because the more technology in the outside world gets to advance while i'm prepping the more difficult this sort of world domination scheme becomes.

Yeah the tunneling does seem tricky because of ventilation problems, and if you want to tunnel up to get air you would have to do it on an island and thus go through layers of soil/rock that will let through water, requiring you to constantly pump out water.\\
You know I might end up needing to make some excursions to the outside world early with some sort of "puller" based aircraft low to the water that wouldn't be noticed, I would have a wyvern rest on the craft most of the time, but when adjustments needed to be made (with the craft weighing 10%) the wyvern would replace any other propulsion system. Of course I need to be careful to remain totally secret to maintain the element of surprise. Still the fact that spell allows free energy ought to make a great deal of schemes easier.

As for the island taking place in modern times I think it makes sense to assume there is a great deal of time dilation style effects but i'm not sure any plan is workable without /some/ assumption about how the time effects work. Also keep in mind that most of the stuff on the island supports it being synched up to time normally, and there's nothing from the future as far as I can tell.

As for conquering countries with technologically primitive people, the training here isn't too useful anyway since I have less than ten thousand soldiers. Honestly I'm mostly banking on the element of surprise and the fact I would be tunneling directly into seats of government.\\
Also conquering the people on the island seems like obviously the easiest way to utilize them, they are preindustrial and thus probably pretty religious, so I can almost certainly leverage that by appearing to have godlike power, not so sure how well it would work with the lizardmen but it would definitely work with the cannibals.

Also as for wyverns/wolves being tame animals, i'm not so sure that applies to the wyverns: it says they can tear through the massive thick shells of titan hermit crabs like paper mache, also adult wyverns have a wingspan over 100ft based on my estimates (they can pick up dire wolves like mice). My point is their bodies are probably made of supernaturally tough material to allow them to claw through stuff that easily, and to just support their bodies. So I think it's probable that they can withstand small arms fire at the very least. Dire wolves can also grow to insane sizes so they similarly seem likely to be made of super tough materials.
