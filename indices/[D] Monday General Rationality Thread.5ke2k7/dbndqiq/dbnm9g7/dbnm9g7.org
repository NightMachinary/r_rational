That's pretty good.

An ocean-spanning tunnel still seems like a pretty vast undertaking even with a perfect cutting tool and 90% weight reduction- but if the lizard people have muskets, then they probably have a reasonably advanced civilization, with the potential for an industrial revolution. Rather than trying to conquer them with the cannibals and some tame animals (which I don't think would go well given the technological difference), it might make more sense to sell them technology, found a company recognized by their laws, wait a few decades for them to get the hang of building factories and steam engines, and then use that industrial capacity for the tunneling project. At that point, though, aircraft might be more practical.

I do think that the idea that the island is located on present-day Earth is a big assumption. The island seems to have been constructed from a variety of different worlds and ages. It could exist in the far future, as part of a simulation, or somehow outside of time. That you'd leave the island only to find the rest of the world exactly as you left it seems like one of the less likely possibilities- although, if people and objects from different worlds and times can travel to the island, maybe it is somehow possible to travel to those worlds and times from the island.
