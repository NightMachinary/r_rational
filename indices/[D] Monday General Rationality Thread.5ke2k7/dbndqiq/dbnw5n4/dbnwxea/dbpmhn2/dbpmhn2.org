Maybe my understanding of physics is incorrect if so please correct me: I think Earth's orbit isn't a straight line. Under your system, when you tried to freeze something in place, it would appear to move to you since it would continue moving in a straight line. It seems unlikely that a spell that makes an object start moving would be stated as making it immovable. Some options that are more likely would be: your planet is the reference frame (so it stops moving when the spell is cast); or there is an absolute reference frame in magic (eg. you're in a simulation that allows magic and the simulation has absolute coordinates).
