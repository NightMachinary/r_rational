  Isn't the object always stationary in its own reference frame (so long as it doesn't split or deform)? I.e. It isn't moving relative to itself.

Objects can feel acceleration and deceleration so if the object didn't appear to keep moving with all the same relative velocities then it would definitely have to feel like it was moving. Though I should have worded that better because obviously it would still be stationary in it's own reference frame even if it was still feeling the effects of movement.

  I believe you misread my comment. I said to use the reference frame being the planet, not the caster.

Right I should have also addressed that example specifically: The planet as a reference frame wouldn't work that well because the planet doesn't actually have a single reference frame. The whole thing spins and as a result different parts move at different speeds, plus the magma that /makes up most of the planets mass/ is constantly moving in convection currents.

I think it makes the most sense if you resolve things such that if you were on/in the object when it was made immovable you wouldn't experience any acceleration/deceleration even slight. The scenario that seems the least arbitrary seems like the one where you can't immediately tell when the spell is cast if you were sealed inside the target object. Idk I just feel like that's the most intuitive schelling point.
