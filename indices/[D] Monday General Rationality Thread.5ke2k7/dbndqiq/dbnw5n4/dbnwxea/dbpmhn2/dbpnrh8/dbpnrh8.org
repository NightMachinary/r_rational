Well I assume the item has to retain all the same relative motions I would assume, otherwise there's no way to avoid the spell basically just being a relativistic bomb. I assume the spell must work in a way similar to how I describe otherwise the object wouldn't remain stationary from its own reference frame, and as I said in another comment if it uses the reference frame of the caster at the time of casting then it can be exploited in a pretty similar way.

As for a magical reference frame, that idea is pretty untenable. Even if the world's a simulation we can demonstrably see that motion within it works in relativistic ways that make the idea of an absolute reference frame incoherent.
