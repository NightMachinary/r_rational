You should use uBlock Origin, as it is far and away the best adblocker available. I assume Adblock origin is trying to piggyback on its good name to sell exemptions to ad companies, or sell user data. It works by preventing the blocked stuff from even being requested in the first place, so it actually makes pages finish loading faster, unlike every other adblock I know of which just removes them after download. (Not to be confused with uBlock, which was the old version which some company bought out. The guy took the money and immediately made uBlock Origin.)

A supplemental extension, uBlock Origin Extra, also deals with sites trying to insist you turn off your adblocker to access them.

​

Don't use Utorrent, it started leaving exploits open from version 2.2.1 onwards, and in 3.4.2 literally installed a bitcoin miner. Use Deluge or Transmission, which are essentially the same thing (torrenting clients) except not bundled with ads and malware. (I use Deluge.)

​

I'm not familiar with libgen.io, but I can confirm that watching tutorials on youtube at 2x speed is a huge timesaver.

*EDIT: Went and re-familiarised myself with Utorrent after having stopped using it over half a decade ago, it's worse than I remembered. Also apparently in that time they bought out BitTorrent and did the same thing with that, so don't use that either.*
