I'm autistic, and basically had to learn my romantic skills from pickup artists because the vast majority of people react with disgust to any explicit discussion of sexual conversation technique.

It's really annoying, too, because pick up artists /are/ typically sleazy. I think there's a natural [[https://siderea.livejournal.com/1230660.html][asshole filter]] going on here. Discussing how to escalate intimacy is a transgression of norms, so only people willing to transgress norms lead those discussions. (Romance novel authors also talk about this kind of stuff, but fall into an entirely separate set of failure modes.) Sictumbo's book recommendation is a good on for non-sexual-context social skills, but enforcing the taboo against seeking sexual-context social skill advice only reinforces the asshole filter and does nothing to improve the happiness of you or the people you talk to.

My advice /would/ be to avoid the kind of youtube channel mentioned above however; a lot of their advice is sound and hard to find elsewhere, but it's mixed in with a sprinkling of shit. It takes conscious effort to filter out the shit. And script-based approaches aren't broadly applicable because they depend on the mannerisms and charisma of the person who developed the script. For example, if you have social grace, you can tease people and deepen your emotional bond using words that on their surface seem insulting. (Non-romantic example would be shit-talking your brother.) But if you lack that social grace, your words just come off as actually insulting and you get xkcd strips written about you. But there's the catch: if you have the level of social grace needed to execute the scripts, then you don't need the scripts in the first place. (Also, they're closer to reality tv than to the scientific method. They choose footage that maximizes viewer retention rather than footage which maximizes information transfer.)

Instead start with the basic self-improvement checklist:

- Get fit
- Get clothes that fit
- Clean yourself up
- Conquer anxiety

This kind of advice is non-taboo and easy to find. You could follow the pickup artist technique and get over anxiety by approaching dozens of women, but anxiety is crippling in all aspects of life, so I'd recommend a more general [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_Therapy][rejection therapy]].

Then from there, seduction is basically just having engaging social interactions with escalating physical intimacy. I'll second "How To Win Friends And Influence People" as having great conversational advice. But how do you do the whole escalation of physical intimacy thing?

[[http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/sextips/][This guide]] has some pretty good advice about reading body language. And the author ran a sanity check by having several women read it and leave in-line comments, so the shit ratio is pretty low.

But an important thing I would add is [[http://terryodell.blogspot.com/2010/03/12-steps-to-intimacy.html][this list]]. It's a list of the stages of human intimacy as described by a zoologist (an actual scientist, not a webshow producer), and the linked page is discussing it in the context of portraying realistic romance in a novel. Each stage involves increasing vulnerability towards the other person. How you put this into practice is that you advance through each stage in order, looking for *enthusiastic reciprocation* before escalating to the next stage. (PUAs call this 'kino', but that's stupid terminology.)

If you're socially clueless like me, just go ahead and memorize the list. I always discuss it with my partners once we get to the heavy-petting stage. Its a simple way to bring up my social disability and lets me transition to a more verbally explicit and less body-language-focused relationship mode. "I'm not as good at reading body language as I pretended to be on the first date". And at that point, there's enough buy in from my partner that they're willing to tolerate the slight violation of their instincts. But they also come to understand their own feelings better as a result of internalizing the model.

My best friend came to me asking for advice. She has a preference for women but had dated only men. I explained to her the whole tiered intimacy thing, and the lightbulbs went off in her head. She had had these intuitions about when romance just 'felt right' and now all these inexplicable emotions became explicable to her. She's told me about how it's helped her out, and I'm really happy to have helped a friend. But at the same time, it feels like something has to be messed up with our norms if a person has to turn to their autistic friend to get actually useful social advice.

Anyways, the *TL;DR* is that the pick up artists have some taboo memes which really should be adopted by wider society, but most of their useful advice can be found elsewhere, and believing that their approach is scientific is a bit like believing that a magician really does have nothing up their sleeves.
