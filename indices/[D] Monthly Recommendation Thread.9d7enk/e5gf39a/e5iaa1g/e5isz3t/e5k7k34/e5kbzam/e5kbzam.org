Possible, not likely, our science is getting to a point where things are more or less known, little adjustments here or there will come and new things will be discovered.

But things like this will rarely get discarded, it's like Newton and physics most of his theory is still correct, Einstein made a few adjustments and added a few things, but Newtons math still works with a +95% accuracy in most cases.

Anyway I just think that if a better tool is available and you know about it, refusing to use it seems wrong, like stubborn old person behavior. You know like old people that refuse to learn how to use their new phones because it makes them uncomfortable, so they just don't bother and say that what they know is good enough.. They can miss out on a lot of useful new features that way.

I think your use of it is fine though, it's a useful abbreviation that could save time among people that know what it means.
