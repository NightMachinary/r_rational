Not really, that's the uninformed view of it. I understand the initial reaction but try being more open minded.

These are the least creepy guys you'll ever see..

They are actually more honest than most guys out there that are trying to use money, bragging, tricks and trying to get girls drunk.

These are the good guys that respect women, teaching other good guys how to get women.

These are not the assholes and bad boys that are mean to girls.

They are nerds, using their brain and rationality to improve themselves and get the women they deserve.

Most people would prefer to get girlfriends in a roundabout way, i.e become a doctor and get a hot wife.

These guys are doing the same thing but with a more direct approach.
