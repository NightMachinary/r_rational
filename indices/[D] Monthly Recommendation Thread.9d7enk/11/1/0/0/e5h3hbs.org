Claiming to be a nice guy (unlike the assholes/Chads that are mean to girls but get dates anyway) is a fairly common defense of PUAs and related subcultures. I don't find it convincing, however, and every PUA I've ever seen came off as manipulative and self-justifying.

By the by, the framing here--that there's some sort of clear demarcation with Nerds on one side and Assholes on the other--strikes me as a pretty dangerous mental framework to build on.
