Great comment, I just feel there are some things I should try to clarify.

Canned lines are mostly not used anymore, the technology advanced a lot since then.

The words and abbreviations they used to use, come from their past in forums, typing "enthusiastic reciprocation" every time you want to refer to a concept is too time consuming.

Also it's always been part of their culture to field test things before deciding if they work or not. That's exactly what the scientific method is, you develop theories and test them to see if they are correct or not.

But everything you said is correct, and the things they teach that are of most use to most people can be found elsewhere. The reason I feel the recommendation is valid is because it's in an easy form, all found in a single 'place' and it's easier to get men to do things that are good for themselves with women as motivation rather than health or well being.
