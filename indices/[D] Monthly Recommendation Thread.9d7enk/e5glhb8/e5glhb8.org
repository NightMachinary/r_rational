[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/485510][/Nioh/]] definitely is the most-fun game that I've played in several years, on a level with /Dark Souls 2/ and /Crusader Kings 2/. [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7obqov/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/ds8ese9/][I've recommended it in the past]], but here's a supplement to persuade anyone who's heard that it has "too much loot" or "overpowered magic".

--------------

As I said previously (more or less), /Nioh/ is a combination of the cautious combat of /Dark Souls/, the flashy combat of (rebooted) /Ninja Gaiden/ and /Dynasty Warriors/, and the equipment effects of /Diablo/. Some people (/e. g./, Joseph Anderson and Bick Benedict) have complained that the /Diablo/ influence is excessive---that they're paralyzed by the complexity of judging, editing, and equipping items, and that they're annoyed by the necessity of constantly having to dump items out of their overstuffed inventories.

I really can't see any merit in this complaint. /By no means/ does /Nioh/ require the player to min-max his equipment's special effects if he wants to be good at the game. If you want to ignore your equipment's effects and focus exclusively on your equipment's level---to simply equip your highest-level stuff and sell/disassemble/donate/discard your lowest-level stuff---you can do that without putting yourself at a disadvantage. Indeed, it's actually /recommended/ that you /ignore/ the special effects on the lowest difficulty level and /refrain/ from wasting your money on tinkering with them at the blacksmith, because the equipment that you get on the lowest difficulty level (Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Exotic) isn't completely compatible (for blacksmith purposes) with the stuff that you start getting at New Game Plus (Divine) and at NG+3 (Ethereal). In my estimation, even the /most casual/ player, who shuns the blacksmith waifu as if she were a leper, can go all the way through NG+1 without trouble.

NG+2, I admit, probably /does/ have the blacksmith's "soul match" function as a requirement, and I suspect that NG+3 and NG+4 get into the territory of /requiring/ min-maxing of equipment effects and magic self-buffs---but the game is great /even without/ those difficulty levels. I've spent my 300 hours of playtime /almost entirely/ on NG, NG+1, and NG+2 (in two separate playthroughs), with NG+3 barely started and NG+4 not even unlocked, and with equipment effects and magic self-buffs hardly explored.

--------------

In a similar vein, some people have complained that the magic in /Nioh/---particularly the Sloth Talisman, which drastically slows down for several seconds all the animations of the enemy who's hit by it, making dodging the enemy's attacks much easier---is overpowered to the point of sucking the fun out of the game. This may be /close/ to true on the lowest difficulty level, but I personally think it's a vastly overblown problem. Yes, you can use the Sloth Talisman to make some bosses into jokes in NG, but you certainly aren't /forced/ to do so. In any event, debuff magic like the Sloth Talisman becomes next to worthless on harder NG+ levels (debuff durations on enemies are greatly diminished, to the point that a Sloth Talisman's effect lasts for just a few seconds on a NG+2 boss---not enough time for you to get much benefit out of it), and you'll be spending most of your time playing on those harder difficulties, so it really doesn't matter.
