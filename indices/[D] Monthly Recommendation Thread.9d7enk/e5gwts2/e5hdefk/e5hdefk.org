Hasn't ÂµTorrent become bloated with ads? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_(software)][Deluge]] is what I would recommend for torrenting.

And if someone wants to play around with the bittorrent protocal, but doesn't want to violate copyright law, [[https://archive.org/details/bittorrent][behold!]] The Internet Archive was granted an exemption from the DMCA in order to archive vintage software, so there's a lot of very old video games even.

I actually had one of my professors tell me about Library Genesis. And later a different professor told the class that he selected the textbook because it was the best one that could be easily pirated. I don't know if my math department was just full of pirates, or it that's a general feature of academia.
