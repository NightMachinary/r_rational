Good list. I would add Taskmaster (UK) as my favourite TV show. Its commedians given absurd tasks and they come up with creative solutions or do rediculous things thinking they are creative solutions (which makes for a great show). They are all great but you can start with series 2 ([[/r/panelshow]] has links if you can't view it in your country).
