The worldbuilding and global plot was pretty interesting, even if there were too many bad writing tropes ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][IdiotBall]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter][OoC]] moments in particular).

Very fertile ground for possible decounstruction fics and rat!fics. Also, great attention to details and character designs.

Thanks for dropping that recommendation, haven't heard of that show before!
