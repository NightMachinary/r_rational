Holy shit guys. [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/][The Gods Are Bastards]] is /so/ good. It's got the banter and mood of Practical Guide to Evil with the wide cast and worldbuilding (and length) of Worm.

It's a DnD-esque fantasy setting on the tail end of a magical industrial revolution, where the age of marauding adventurers and heroes is limping its way to a close. The Pantheon are a group of known and (mostly) approachable deities who interact with the world through their respective cults, and are themselves mortals who ascended eight thousand years ago following mysterious circumstances. The story follows a group of young magical oddities, prodigies, and scions who attend an adventuring university ran by infamous 3,000-year-old adventurer/archmage/menace/magnificent bastard Arachne Tellwyrn, who has graciously decided to pass down her historic ass-kicking skills to future generations.

It's got intrigue, plots, manipulation and counter-manipulation, thrilling action, appealing character arcs, twists galore, and excellent banter (and it's also got one of my favorite tropes, which unfortunately is a spoiler just to mention, but still). I much appreciate the author's willingness to timeskip the boring parts and focus on what matters, with liberal sprinkling of interludes to cover side events and backstories.

I can't recommend it enough. If you enjoyed Practical Guide you'll like this.
