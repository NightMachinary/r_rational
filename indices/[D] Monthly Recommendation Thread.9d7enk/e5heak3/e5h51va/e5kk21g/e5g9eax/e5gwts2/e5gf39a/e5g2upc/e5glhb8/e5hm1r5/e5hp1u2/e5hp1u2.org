  Does it play well on mouse+keyboard?

The combat of /Nioh/ is somewhat faster /and/ somewhat more complex than that of /Dark Souls/. If you've successfully played a /Dark Souls/ game with mouse and keyboard (ISHYGDDT), I /guess/ you could try to play /Nioh/ in the same fashion (M&K support was added in a post-launch update), but I wouldn't expect too much success.

  *Or* would you say it's a console game mainly?

That's badly worded. Many PC games can accept controller input, and some console games can accept mouse-and-keyboard input.

For PC, I highly recommend the Xbox One controller. To use it on PC, you'll additionally have to buy the USB adapter---or the Bluetooth dongle, if you prefer playing wirelessly (and spending money on batteries)---but it definitely is well worth the money.
