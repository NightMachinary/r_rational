  It was recommended by my therapist but I can only read a chapter every few days. Can anyone recommend something similar that isn't as grating? Preferably something focused on better communication and social skills.

What was it recommended for, exactly? Just good communication and social skills? Have you read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/reader][Marked for Death]] by chance? Their Clear Communication No Jutsu is a nice look at what good communication and efforts to improve social skills can involve.
