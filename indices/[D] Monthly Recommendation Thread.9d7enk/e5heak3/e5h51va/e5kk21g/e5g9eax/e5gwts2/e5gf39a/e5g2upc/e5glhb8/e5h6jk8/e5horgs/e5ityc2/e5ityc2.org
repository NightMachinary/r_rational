Sword Art Online is pretty good isekai. Just joking...

Or am I? I thought the SAO: Progressive light novels were fairly entertaining YA fluff, that fixed most of the inconsistencies in the source material. It's a shame it's probably stopped on book six. Having more focus on Kirito and Asuna's buddy-cop dynamic instead of harem antics really makes the story so much better.
