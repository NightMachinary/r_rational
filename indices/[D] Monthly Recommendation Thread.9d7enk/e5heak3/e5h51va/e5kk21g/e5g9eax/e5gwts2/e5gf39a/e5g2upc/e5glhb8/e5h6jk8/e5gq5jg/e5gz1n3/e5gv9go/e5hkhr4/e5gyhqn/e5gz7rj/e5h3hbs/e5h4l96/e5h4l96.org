I think it's telling that the first comment initially talked about how they will teach how to get more and better sex, and changed it to girlfriends after seeing my response. If the comment was talking about managing social anxiety, how to hold a conversation with new people, how to get over irrational fear of rejection, I would be all for it. But no, the advertising is how to get women to be glorified sexdolls, which gets rebranded almost immediately when they see that objectifying women doesn't go over well with this particular group.

Seriously, "get the women they deserve"? (From the comment two above this one) I couldn't come up with a more typical creepy, objectifying statement if I tried.
