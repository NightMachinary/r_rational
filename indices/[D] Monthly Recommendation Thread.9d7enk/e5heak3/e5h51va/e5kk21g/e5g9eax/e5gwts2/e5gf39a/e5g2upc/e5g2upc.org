I enjoyed binge-reading the webcomic [[http://dragonhusbands.com/][Dragon Husbands]] last week. It's a cute gay fantasy story, sometimes NSFW (penises, sex), set on a space colony with a magical underground.

Also, James Clavell's 1975 novel /Shogun/ was good. It's very Neal-Stephenson-esque in that the book shows the effects of a character upon the setting, but the book remains about the character's progression, not the setting's progression, and the setting's major plot is unresolved at the end of the book. It's a very good presentation of culture clash.
