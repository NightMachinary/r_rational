/How to Win Friends and Influence People/ is actually kind of good if you read it a certain way. There is a sense in which the advice is obvious, but few people actually follow through. It's stuff like actually care about what people are saying. You might try reading it and forcibly suppress the eyerolls, you would probably get a lot out of it if you can do that.

The INTJ types that hang around here have a hard time with advice on social interactions because the advice isn't intellectually interesting. That kind of practice can't be boiled down to algorithms and we tend to think we already know the heuristics. As an INTJ type who once had poor social skills and now has a wide network of friends and a much enriched life, it ultimately comes down to repeatedly putting yourself out there and attending to the needs of others. It can be intellectually engaging in some respects but not the way we initially want it to be.
