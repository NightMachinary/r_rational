  If the comment was talking about managing social anxiety, how to hold a conversation with new people, how to get over irrational fear of rejection, I would be all for it.

It sounds like the same end goal. You just made it sound PG 13.

It is a recommendation. As I said, most people are not going to like it. It's a useful tool, if you are too proud to use it, don't.

High moral ground may make you feel good and protect your ego, but try not to let it keep you from using the tools available to you..
