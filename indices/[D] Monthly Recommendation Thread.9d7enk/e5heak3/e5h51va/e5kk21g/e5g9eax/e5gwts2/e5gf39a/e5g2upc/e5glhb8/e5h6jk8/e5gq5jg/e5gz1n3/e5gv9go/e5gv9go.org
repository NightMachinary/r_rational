For anybody looking to improve their social skills i recommend checking out RSD Max on youtube and pick up in general. (Max isn't my favorite teacher but he's a good introduction imo).

​

They are basically guys systematizing pick up. i.e how to get girls in a step by step approach.

​

With systems and rationality, it can be very politically incorrect though.

​

I mean these are guys using the scientific method to test and find the most effective ways to get more and better girlfriends.. They go really in depth, and even have proof with hidden camera footage.

​

They are literally applying rationality to make their lives better IRL. They can be pretty offensive to a lot of people though.

​

Another recommendation is a manga: Goblin Slayer.

​

It is a fantastical depiction of rational combat. I mean the author even had to put artificial rules in place so the series doesn't get boring, i.e MC can't use fire, water, or poison to kill his enemies. Before then he was flooding caves, smoking goblins out of their holes, gassing their air channels with poison etc.

​

Even now it's still fairly tactical and interesting, a few episodes ago he filled a room full of flour sealed it and lit it up causing an explosion. IDK about you but that's some very interesting way of getting around fighting a powerful creature.

​

The series itself can be very adult, i.e goblins assaulting women (I know inter species attraction is silly, but he gives a reasonable explanation i.e goblins are sort of like viruses they use humanoid females to breed), gore and the like.

​

But it's very interesting, the MC is at least a level 2 intelligence guy. He exploits his world and fights in interesting ways with tactics and strategies. Some people are going to hate it though.

​

Anyway I'll probably delete this comment in a few days because it's kind of weird xD
