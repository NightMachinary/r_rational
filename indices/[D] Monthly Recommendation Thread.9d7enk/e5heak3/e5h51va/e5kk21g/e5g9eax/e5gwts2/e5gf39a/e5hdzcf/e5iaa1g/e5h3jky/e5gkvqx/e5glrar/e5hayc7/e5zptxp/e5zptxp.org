I agree. It was my first original fiction. Before I leaned anything about plot and structure. Many revisions have gone into the grammar and spelling and whatnot, but very few major edits.

Whenever I re-read parts of it, I groan and grump to myself about how bad a writer I was then. But it still has a fairly large number of hits per month, so I leave it up.
