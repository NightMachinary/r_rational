These were helpful to me, maybe they'll help some of you.

​

Adblock origin. This is an ad blocker, it blocks ads on pretty much every site you go to. It saves you time and makes your browser faster and safer..

​

Utorrent. It can be useful if you are a kid without a credit card. A good website I use is [[https://zooqle.com][zooqle.com]]. Don't buy into the fear mongering out there, most people are just afraid of what they don't understand while spreading anecdotal false stories they heard about it from some random uninformed source. Watch a youtube guide and you'll be fine.

​

[[https://libgen.io][libgen.io]]. You can download pretty much any book for free there. It can be useful..

​

Watch youtube at 2x speed when trying to learn things.. You'll get used to it and it can make boring things less boring and fun things more fun.

*Edit Requested from the replies.

Use Ublock origin instead. This was a typo, I'm actually using ublock origin myself, it was late and I was tired sorry.

Utorrent is apparently not good anymore. I never noticed because I use an older version of it, my bad, instead use one of the alternatives from the great replies bellow.

I think that's all =D
