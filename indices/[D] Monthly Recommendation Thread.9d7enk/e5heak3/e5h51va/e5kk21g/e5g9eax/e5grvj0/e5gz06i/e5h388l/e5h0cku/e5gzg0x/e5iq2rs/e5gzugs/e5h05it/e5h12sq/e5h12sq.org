I mean, that's fair, but if you stopped reading */literally months ago/*... why continue judging? Starry's current arc is dealing exactly with what upset you. It's like judging an alpha build for the 3.0 resolution.

Not saying you need to like it. I disapprove of like... half of Starry's choices. But that's the nature of a quest fic, no? Your argument is good against a specific plot point, but if you stopped reading... like half a year ago (or more!).... why do you think you understand the current issues?
