The thing that impressed me about /Shogun/ is that the characters make plans, then their plans change as their information and circumstances change. They also update their values and their planning reflects that. The characters are forced to respond to things outside their control, of course, but the reader also gets to see their thought process in the face of unexpected complications. Many long-term possibilities are discarded when they become implausible to the characters; some are merely daydreams.
