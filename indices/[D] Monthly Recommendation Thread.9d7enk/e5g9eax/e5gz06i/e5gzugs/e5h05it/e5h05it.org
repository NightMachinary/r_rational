I stopped reading at that point so I wouldn't know what Charles becomes like later on, but that still doesn't justify Cindy's actions at all and doesn't redeem her IMO. The whole scene was very gross and the way Starry manipulated, lied, and essentially blackmailed him into having sex with her was very off-putting.
