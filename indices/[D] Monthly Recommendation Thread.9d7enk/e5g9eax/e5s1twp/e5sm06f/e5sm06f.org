  I'm kinda bored, skipping chunks of text.

If you're skipping chunks of text, you're likely missing some important signs of the deeper issues that are to come. IIRC, the early parts of the story are very much about Cindy/Starry testing out her new powers and stats, and getting used to the concept of the Erogame. After her time with Charles the meta-plot starts becoming much more developed... I forget exactly when, but if you've gotten to the part where Cindy reviews the perks, there are a variety that are clearly horrifying to her and show that the Erogame may have less than benevolent intentions. I THINK that's around the time that she goes to the hotel with Charles, because the room they get has references to several extremely disturbing hidden perks in the form of paintings/pictures. I can't recall if Cindy reviews the perk list before or after that, though.

But even before then there are worrying signs, as well as a lot of internal conversations about self-identity by Cindy herself. Probably the two most notable warning signs are when Cindy tries to change her hair style and the result of doing so, and when Cindy learns Slack and immediately gets inundated with messages from several alternate-future selves, all of whom have met various kinds of terrible fates.

To each individual point you wrote:

  the Mystery of What Is Going On and Why Cindy
#+end_quote

This is currently still a mystery. Characters provide several theories, and there seems to be some progression toward more understanding, but there's been no true answer.

#+begin_quote
  are no Stakes or (external) Conflict to keep things interesting
#+end_quote

Well, there are stakes even through what you've read already (see: terrible fates of alt-future Cindys), but I believe Cindy's already been reflecting on larger issues about the effect she is having and what it means. Like... what happens to ugly people as the world becomes more "ero"? Or the old, or deformed, or asexual? Will they be forced to change to something against their will, or simply deleted from reality? There's a ton of conflict as well about what Cindy can do, what she should do, and who that makes her (for example, how Charles freaks out when he thinks Starry is an alien who ate and absorbed Cindy).

#+begin_quote
  Like she has to avoid being murdered, exiled, whatever, and reality is constantly bending itself to contrive such situations.
#+end_quote

This happens literally right near the beginning, doesn't it? One of Cindy's first quests is "Gift Sex," where it's heavily implied that if she goes to an alley in the wrong part of town, she'll get raped. But doing so also rewards a perk point... but later I know there's a lot of discussion about whether she wants her Erogame experience to go like that or not, and what will happen if she increases her LST. Some of the perks echo that this is a legitimate concern ("There are no brakes on the rape train" and "Let's not turn this rape into a murder" for example).

#+begin_quote
  Or some kind of eroge nemesis that Cindy has to defeat.
#+end_quote

This hasn't happened yet, although she does have a potential rival or... what's the Homestuck word, /kismesis/? with a girl from her university. That will likely progress later but hasn't thus far.

#+begin_quote
  So I guess what I'm saying is, I don't really get why I'm supposed to care about Cindy's adventure.
#+end_quote

There are several elements that seem to appeal to readers. IMO: the first part is the mystery of what the Erogame is, what it wants, and why it chose Cindy. All still very much question marks. The second part is Cindy's development herself; how does someone with sexual-based, reality-bending superpowers react, feel, and think about them? The third part is the worldbuilding and implications to society at large when the Erogame takes over, and what happens to the people in it who don't fit the "new world"? A ton of the story is regarding ethics and morality in the setting. Fourth, it's the meta-commentary and crowd participation that give an even better insight to Cindy then she herself does. And finally, it's the humor and references that draw in people. The writing is really freaking hilarious at times and catching the references liberally interspersed is a treat for careful readers as well.

It's a lot of writing, and if you're not a fan of it now you likely won't be later. If you're skipping chunks of text, I don't think you'll find nearly as much enjoyment as readers who like poring over it for deeper meaning, philosophical implications, or hidden text.
