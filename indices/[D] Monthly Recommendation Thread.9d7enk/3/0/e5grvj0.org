HIGHLY second this. The Erogamer blows my mind every time a new update comes out (Sexual innuendo only /somewhat/ intended). It also has some fantastic moral questions, and is extremely inclusive, sexuality-wise. If you liked Masego being a good Ace character portrayal in APGTE you'll likely enjoy the most recent arc of The Erogamer, where an Ace character (and the protagonist) have to resolve the question of "if reality is being remade like an eroge, where do non-sexual people fit in? Or if they don't... what happens to them?"

Following up on that suggestion... if you've enjoyed The Erogamer but also enjoy videogames, I would recommend [[http://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]]. It's less meta than The Erogamer, but, uh, keeps the same kind of genre. It's a free RPGMaker game that's being constantly updated, and while the setting is inherently sexual (you're in a world where the Incubus King is threatening to turn all the nations into sexual slave states), the decisions are extremely rational in execution and the MC is much the same, using his sexual power to advance his agenda. Perhaps it's more... rational-adjacent? Either way, it's a fantastic game, and the choices you make early on may come to haunt you later. The sex scenes (and there are MANY) are all text-based... or 8-bit graphics... so don't worry too much about skipping them. Sex is a tool in this game - totally not the goal.

You'll need to download both the game and RPGMaker to play it, but both are in the link. Can't beat the price (FREE!) either!
