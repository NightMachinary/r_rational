Yep; each chapter has arrows at the top and bottom to skip to the next chapter. The arrows are on either side of the "Index" link on each post.

That being said, the comments contain some really good debate from time to time, and it's a treat to watch how the thoughts of the posters get integrated into the story. There's also a lot of commentary that will point out things you missed, like how some chapters have hidden text you probably didn't notice. It definitely makes it a LOT longer to read.
