I think [[/u/AurelianoTampa]] covered most of what I would have said too, but I hear your points about the structure of the plot and agree that it's a mostly stakeless story when it starts out. It's basically an extended version of that part of superhero stories where they test out their powers. But I think it was engaging for me because it was written so well, and the implications (both for her as a person and for the world) were so well thought through and explored in the text, that I was just enjoying the sheer novelty of someone approaching an Erogame with anything like a rationalist mindset. It gets even better the deeper into it you go, and more stakes and risks start becoming explicit, but I understand if you're just not feeling it and let it go.
