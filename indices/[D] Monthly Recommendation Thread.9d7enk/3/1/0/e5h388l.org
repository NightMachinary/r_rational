No, it's not good as porn, but I don't think it's meant to be, any more than Game of Thrones is meant to function as porn just because it occasionally includes people having sex. Obviously the theme of Erogamer is much more pornographic, but the point still stands, I think.

As for the spoilered text, In my view, the author tried to take a very delicate and rare theme and play with it from both sides. On one side you had someone with a (clearly and self-admittedly unhealthy) kink for non-consent, and on the other side you have someone who's in the absurd "what if you actually had to rape someone to save humanity?" position that often remains the "Last Exception" of consequentialist morality.

I think it handled it really well, personally. I get that not everyone would be comfortable with the concepts being explored, but neither character came off as unrealistic or unlikable to me afterward.
