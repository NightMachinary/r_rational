I have to recommend against it. As porn it's not very good with how slow-paced it is. As a story that tries to take itself seriously, the main character is not likable at all IMO. She has a very twisted attitude towards consent and morality. She thinks losing her virginity in consensual sex would be unsatisfying since it wouldn't make her feel desired enough, so instead she manipulates a good man into thinking that her powers are due to her being an alien and that he has to rape her in order to save humanity.
