Can I suggest reading how the most recent chapters handled the fallout of the situation you are talking about? Because you're talking about a thing that the protagonist has regretted doing.

I'm talking about chapters from " [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-213#post-2116196][(6.7.5) Confession]]" all the way to the most recent " [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-221#post-2155481][(6.8.4) Ways of Repairing Mistakes]]". I feel you can read them (including the chapters in between of course) and understand the situation well enough without needing to read the previous chapters, because it's the first time the characters meet face-to-face since the thing you mention in the spoiler text happened.
