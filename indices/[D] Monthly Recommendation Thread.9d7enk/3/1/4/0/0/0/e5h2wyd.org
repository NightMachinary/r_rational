  I mean, that's fair, but if you stopped reading */literally months ago/*... why continue judging? Starry's current arc is dealing exactly with what upset you. It's like judging an alpha build for the 3.0 resolution.

If you only ever get reviews from people who have continued following a serial, you'll get a skewed view of how good it is. Unless they stopped reading very recently, most negative reviews would be disqualified under this criteria because the people who didn't like the work wouldn't continue to read it.

The solution would be to have the person who didn't like it catch up to the current chapter, but I think we could all agree that that would be too harsh on the reviewer.

I don't think a software analogy is apt. Software gets rewritten all the time, while stories generally aren't. Unless the author invests a lot of time into rewriting their story, which most serial writers don't, the current story will build off the parts that the person didn't like. If you were to force a video game analogy, it would be like really disliking a core mechanic of the game, like platforming in Mario games.
