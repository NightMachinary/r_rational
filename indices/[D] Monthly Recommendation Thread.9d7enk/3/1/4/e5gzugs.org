  As porn it's not very good

Agree: it's not good as porn. The updates are never guaranteed to be erotic.

  the main character is not likable at all IMO, She has a very twisted attitude towards consent and morality
#+end_quote

Disagree: The character is potentially likable, in that very few people have been in Cindy's position. But she lays out her position straight... it's pretty clear. She absolutely has a twisted mentality to consent and morality, but to be fair:

1. Her idea of consent is HEAVILY debated in the comments.
2. Charles is NOT a "good man," as has been the subject of recent chapters. He thrives off non-consensual encounters with Starry. There's a good argument that he's been molded to like that, or Starry craves it, but... at this point, it's on Charles. And as recently as two chapters ago, he's willing to let Starry get used by others.
