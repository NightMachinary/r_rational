I feel like I'm always requesting recommendations but I feel like everything I would recommend here has been discussed a ton.

So I'm struggling to get through Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. It was recommended by my therapist but I can only read a chapter every few days. Can anyone recommend something similar that isn't as grating? Preferably something focused on better communication and social skills.

Secondly, I want some good hardcore fantasy like Malazan of the fallen but not as long, if that's possible.

Thirdly, biopunk. Similar to Twig or something with lots of fridge horror.
