I think you know this from your response, but I'm not using it as a tool, just a label. The Big 5 don't work as labels because there are too many emergent categories, plus lack of broad familiarity.

Also, physics doesn't make a good analogy to social sciences. There's a replication crisis on in social science and pretty much everything is in doubt. Also, in social sciences, paradigms tend to replace older paradigms, not refine them with grater precision, as in physics.

Also also, while being compared to a crotchety old fart might be a useful rhetorical cludge, it's fallacious and I don't find it compelling. It could as easily be used in any circumstance where the new is compared to the old. Frequently, the old is, in fact, better, and the bias tends to be in favor of the new.
