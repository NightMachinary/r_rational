Very good and breezy fantasy: Steven Brust: The Jheregh books are all relatively short, and even if the series as a whole is very long, it is also very episodic - it is not one long story. (he also writes very wordy Dumas pastiches in the same world, but you can just skip those) Also interesting because it is a world where magic has been industrialized to an astounding degree.

Scott Lynch, the gentlemen bastards series: Very good, not very long. Elevator pitch : Heist novels, but fantasy.

Lois Mcmaster Bujold: Penric and Desmonda novellas. These are tiny masterpieces. Bujold is always very good, and these are her taking advantage of digital distribution channels to be good at a length the book market has very little space for (just over a hundred pages per book)
