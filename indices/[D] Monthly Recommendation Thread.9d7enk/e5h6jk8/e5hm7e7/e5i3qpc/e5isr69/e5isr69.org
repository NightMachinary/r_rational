I think it's because it's really old and does most of it naively, rather than the sort of rancid meta-informed angst that populates fanfiction these days (like bashing). Also, while I know following the stations of canon is generally bad, I've yet to see a single story other than Dreaming of Sunshine go through all of the filler, and the author is competent enough that it doesn't feel completely irrelevant, so it gets points for novelty.
