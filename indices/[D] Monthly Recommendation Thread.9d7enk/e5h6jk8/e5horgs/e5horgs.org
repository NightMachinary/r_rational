[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126]] By Alexanderwhales is quite popular on this subreddit. Im not the biggest fan of where its been going in recent chapters, but I still follow it and I definitely enjoyed the beginning.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-layer-zero-terminus.587245/]] is a great nasuverse SI; per typical fallacies, it's great writing, great idea, great research...and on hiatus, which prevents it from gaining the first slot.

The two year emperor by eaglejarl probably also qualifies here, but I think the second part of the plot seriously suffers and won't give it an unqualified thumbs up

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/eye-of-the-gorgon-fate-grand-order-si.610048/]] And [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-bottom-of-the-barrel-fate-grand-order-si.640522/]] are a pair of F/GO SIs; they're the only two good FGO SIs i've found, unfortunately.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine]] are two fairly solid Naruto SIs, but fair warning I wouldn't call either one of them even rational adjacent.

Moving a bit further afeild there is isekai / isekai tensei (to another world / reincarnated in another world) as fairly popular genres, but the main problem is that almost all isekais are complete, irredeemable garbage. I would genuinely reccomend Youjo Senki (+fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record]]), and would hesitantly reccomend Overlord just for the writing quality making up for a lot, but that's pretty much it. I havent really combed isekai that much, though, so there's almost certainly some middling to good stuff there I missed.
