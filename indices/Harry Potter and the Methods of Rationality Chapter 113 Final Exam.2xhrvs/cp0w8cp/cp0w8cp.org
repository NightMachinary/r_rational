After a moment of panic, it struck me. Carefully phrasing my words in Parseltongue, I asked a question. "What happens, Tom Riddle, when another Tom Riddle dies, enters the Horcrux network, and the dead Tom Riddle happens to be able to both control Dementors and cast an advanced form of Patronus that does not require a wand?"

I paused. "If you kill me, I win. If you don't kill me, you will eventually lose. You have been very careful to provide a bribe to me to let you live, so the threat of killing me is clearly misdirection. You know you cannot kill me without me destroying your Horcrux network, and you have provided me with a living Hermione to keep me attached to life."

"However, now I am at a strange point. It makes a great deal of sense that I should kill myself now, and use the Patronus casting to consume the life energy within the Horcrux network until there is only one Horcrux left, and then get assistance in raising myself. I could do that easily enough with a Patronus."

"Perhaps, you might do something for me to prevent me from killing myself so I can end your threat? Confund yourself to learn to care about people. Then use the Philosopher's stone to make it permanent, and finally, vow to never attempt to alter the Confunding."

EDIT ADD - I already used my response to the chapter over at Fanfiction.net for a different suggestion. If this seems plausible to someone, feel free to take it, make it yours, and post it over there if you like.
