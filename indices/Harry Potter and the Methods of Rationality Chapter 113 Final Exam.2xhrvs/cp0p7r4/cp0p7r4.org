Possible weapon against Voldemort: Obliviate. Obliviate everything.

He's taken great pains to protect himself against death, but we may be able to erase everything he is and destroy the villain without killing him.

Of course, we need to get ourselves in a position where we can both do so and still come out of this situation alive.
