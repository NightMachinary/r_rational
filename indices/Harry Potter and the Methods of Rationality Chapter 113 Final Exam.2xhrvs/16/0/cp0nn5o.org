Good idea, but...

Has he been shown to have read something about Apparition? In particular, those words? If so, that's a feasible plan, and might be attempted... but I can't recall any such incident, and thus doubt the possibility.

That said, the fact that the Death Eaters Apparated in does not imply that there is no Anti-Disapparition Jinx in effect. Even though Harry is not known to be able to Apparate, it's the kind of thing that'd be a sensible precaution for Voldemort to have put in place.

It'd be better than dying, but it'd be unwise for Harry to spend his minute trying to figure out Apparition from mere reference to the process. It's not a terrible plan, particularly since he could go straight for his Time Turner if it worked, but there are probably better ones.
