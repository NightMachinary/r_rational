As demonstrated through Partial Configuration, some magic (notable, the only form on wordless magic Harry has seen the "inside" of) functions with "consensus reality" effects. That is, by changing his mind about what reality is, Harry was able to do something new.

This demonstrates one Harry ability, and one Nature of Reality:

- Harry can change his consensus reality effects
- Consensus reality matters

Given that we also have a stack of evidence that there is a poor correspondence between even /brains/ and self, I'm thinking it's worth exploring Consensus Reality rules that, if discarded, open up possibilities.
