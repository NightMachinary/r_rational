Alright here's my best go at a plan:

tl;dr: it's partial transfiguration, stall with diplomacy through talking about dyson spheres, activate hermione, and various contingencies if the above fail.

Stall tactic 0: can begin this plan even as the very long oath-swearing was taking place

Stall tactic 1: Don't even use up all the 60 seconds; shouldn't be necessary, and don't want to make voldemort suspicious.

Stall/Diplomacy tactic 2: /there iss a threat to thiss world that will ssomeday kill every sentient being in the universe, and you and hermione will not be sspared. I wissh to tell you of it, and my planss to avert it./

Stall tactic 3: /I need to conssult with Hermione before I give dangerouss information to immortal Dark Lord./ (If Voldie is skeptical, warn him that Harry has no idea what the apocalypse is, and so caution is still necessary)

PLAN HERMIONE: Get her awake and informed as much as possible.

Stall/Diplomacy tactic 4: tell of his prophecy from firenze that he'd cause all the stars to disappear and he'd be innocent, then tell one possible explanation - how it's been his ambition to spread across the galaxy building dyson spheres

Stall tactic 5 (should be unnessary): give secrets if necessary. Dementors, muggle sciences, threat of AI, threat of bioterrorism, order of the phoenix, secrets about hogwarts.

.

While we've been stalling: partial transfiguration of any sort of channel down his leg or down Mr Grim's wand and body etc, underground, underneath every Death Eater and underneath voldemort. Tip it with a large quantity of C4. Make sure it's on a hair trigger he'd just need to release.

.

PLAN A: please let's all be buddy buddy and fight off death together.

PLAN THREAT: /Prophessy suggessts I will ssucceed. There iss no guarantee you will be around for it. Do you want to live in thiss world, or not?/ [On second thought, skip plan threat. Too risky. Go straight to Plan B.]

PLAN B: BOOM.

PLAN C: Stuporfy vs voldemort. He can't block it anyways, and a dodge might not work.

PLAN D: "Destination, Determination, Deliberation!" He's never apparated before, and it's crazy dangerous, but there's nothing saying it's outside his magical capacities. We haven't seen him read how, but the three Ds have to be the wizarding equivalent of "gas pedal to go, break pedal to stop". GTFO.

PLAN HERMIONE. She's smart, powered-up, and has had several minutes by now to adjust and plan on her own.

PLAN F: antimatter. Rocks fall, everybody dies. Hermione, Voldemort, and maybe Harry if he's lucky (as another Tom Riddle) respawn, regroup at a severe disadvantage.
