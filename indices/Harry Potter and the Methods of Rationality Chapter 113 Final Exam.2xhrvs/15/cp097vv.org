I think a big question here is "what kinds of magic, if any, are available?". Answer might be "none". Partial transfig takes too long, everything else requires motion.

That seems to leave to possibilities:

- Realizations that allow for re-access to magic
- Talking your way out of it

In other words, no /known/ magic is useful in this situation.

Does that seem reasonable? Does anyone remember a form of magic that doesn't require motion or time?
