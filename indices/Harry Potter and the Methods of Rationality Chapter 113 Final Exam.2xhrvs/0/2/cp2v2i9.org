Having thought about this, I feel like this whole problem is misdirection, EY has set us up to fail, we don't really have much we can do to solve the problem. We don't have the advantage of controlling Harry in the previous chapters so we can't set anything up to help us. He has a proper solution, he's been working on it for months, we can't recreate that in the matter of days, even with the number of minds on it. I still feel the evidence points to this being misdirection from him.

Your solution is the only one I've come up with and it requires that A, Harry has stolen Snape's wand and when under the invisibility cloak, he partially transfigured the floor to be antimatter (with a time delayed vacuum), killing him means that the vacuum spell gets destroyed and with it, the planet, which leaves voldemort an eternity on the golden plaques since the resurrection stone is destroyed on earth.

As killing Harry is akin to eternal solitude for LV, he knows Harry must be allowed to live. Harry doesn't want to do it, but precommits to the action in order to ensure LV doesn't kill him. It makes sense for Harry to have done something by this point, and this does not betray LV as it will amount to nothing if they part ways amicably.
