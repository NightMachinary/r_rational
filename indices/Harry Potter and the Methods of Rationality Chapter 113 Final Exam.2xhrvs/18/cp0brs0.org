Does anyone remember if Harry was told about the magic that protected him in canon and if that still applies to this fic?

I would also point out that any use of the Patronus to block a killing curse would likely be useless, as Voldy would simply hit him with a stunner or shoot him.

Edit: Death Eaters also tasked with a variety of actions in response to Harry trying anything.
