I'm surprised that no-one has spotted the Chekov's Gunman.

Harry is focused on Voldemort. Everyone else is focused on Harry.

/Who is focused on Hermione?/

Oh, wait, I'm sorry, let me rephrase that.

Who is making sure that the /immortal, self-healing, unicorn-and-troll-powered, horcrux-having, extremely smart, Death-Eaters-have-been-commanded-not-to-harm-or-hinder-her/ Hermione has stayed asleep through all the posturing and hissing and Crucio-screaming?

Come to think of it, I /wonder/ where Hermione's original wand might possibly be at this moment, /hint hint disguised as something expected to have an enchantment on it, hint hint/.
