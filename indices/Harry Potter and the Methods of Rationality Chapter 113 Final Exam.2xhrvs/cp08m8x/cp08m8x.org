How good is he at partial transfiguration that this point? The stone opens up some self-transfiguration options.

You can transfigure a duck without knowing how a duck works...

So transfigure a copy of your brain over top of voldemorts (and then get shot a bunch). Transfigure a copy into the ground? It couldn't have magic and would quickly die when your soul flees. Probably. I doubt that the solution is going to have something with such a high failure rate.

Hmm. Use it to kill everyone somehow? The answer "Transfigure everyone presents spinal fluid into francium" seems a bit silly. If the answer is "Use my magic to kill everyone" I'll be suprised, and anything that is fast enough to work in this situation would be pretty deus-ex-machina-ey.

EY has presumably already written this, and it has a lot of parrelels to the AI box experement. Evidence that the solution is going to be talking and not much else. Knowing that you're saying the truth should be considered and advantage (and truth is one of the assumption made in the AI box game).

"The air is filled with carbon nanotubes. Everyone here will die if you make the transiguration permanent, and they will die of transfiguration sickness if you don't. Only I have the power to save them, and I doubt you could learn the skill in time, presuming you did manage to convince me to teach you.".

Of course producing enough carbon nanotubes that people would die of transfiguration sickness if it wore off....

Still, not something I think would save you. Just buy some time.
