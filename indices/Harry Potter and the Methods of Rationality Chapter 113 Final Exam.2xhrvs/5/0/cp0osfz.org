Enervate to wake Hermione, and then count on her surviving and using the ritual instructions to revive Harry when Voldemort and the Death Eaters most likely immediately thoroughly murder him in response?

It's a gamble, there's no guarantee that Hermione will succeed in accomplishing anything before being restrained and the odds are in fact against her (not as badly as they are against Harry, but still), but I certainly don't have a better plan. It's even possible that Voldemort will hold off on murdering Harry at least while he figures out the implications for the prophecy (such as the possibility that the revived Hermione is the prophesied one instead of Harry, and murdering Harry in front of her will cause the prophecy to come true), which gives time to implement other plans as well.
