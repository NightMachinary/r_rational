If Harry hasn't shown Quirrelmort the nature of partial transfiguration yet then that is certainly a good opener. At the very least due to its complex nature it'll take time to explain, especially if he originally answers in Parseltongue which seems to have a lot of syntactic constraints.

The question is does he just use that to buy time or does the partial transfiguration itself have the potential to serve as an immediate offensive measure against 36 death eaters and QM? Maybe he could transfigure something into antimatter, but then the question is how does he escape the ensuing blast?
