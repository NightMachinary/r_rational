See, here's the thing. Why on /earth/ would he first go through all the trouble of resurrecting Hermione, upgrading her body to insane levels, and creating a horcrux if he's just going to kill him? Why explain his lore and his plans? Why even give him a chance to talk?

As much as this entire scenario is Mr. Yudkowsky's handiwork in trying to force us into a situation with so many restraints we can only collaborate to think our way out, I think too that that's the motive of Voldemort himself, to force Harry into a spot where he really has to prove himself as V's equal.
