I think Voldemort is being cautious of magical resonance which is why he doesn't try casting any spell on Harry. But he might be so cautious that he is worried about the Death Eaters' Dark Mark qualifying as magical resonance if any Death Eater touches Harry. Of course this doesn't explain away him not ordering Harry to throw away his wand or be shot.
