It seems most likely that Voldemort wishes to kill him in the next minute.

However.

Why does Harry still have his wand? Why are his things not protected by the death eaters from /accio?/

It would be trivial for Voldemort to order one of his followers to take Harry's wand and glasses, to protect this things, and perhaps even to add other magical protections.

I dislike feeling that Voldemort has made stupid mistakes.
