Easier in a trivial sense, yes. But Voldemort is being highly conservative, as is appropriate given the prophecy he heard.

Suppose there was a unexpected interruption --- Harry is just an /accio/ away from his time turner. Voldemort knows Harry has a power Voldemort isn't aware of (by the first prophecy). Voldemort knows Harry is fated to destroy the world. Why would he give him even the slightest chance?

Naturally, this is an argument for not quizzing Harry and for killing him immediately, too.
