Interesting, but untrue; Voldemort has the True Horcrux, and can himself arrange to prevent arbitrary deaths. The True Patronus may be the only thing that can reverse death, but since Harry knows that Voldemort has the True Horcrux, he cannot truthfully claim that he alone can prevent death.

The fact that Voldemort is probably unwilling to implement a universal True Horcrux based resurrection system involving sacrificial babies or something in no way diminishes the fact that he could choose to do so.
