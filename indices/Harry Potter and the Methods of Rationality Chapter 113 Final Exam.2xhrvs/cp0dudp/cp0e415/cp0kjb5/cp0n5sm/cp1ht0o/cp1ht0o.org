Agreed. He can, though it's highly likely that he /will/. Hence why I very deliberately chose the word "may". I suppose technically speaking "Mr. Genius is the only one who might pass this test" is technically untrue, but no one would call you a liar for saying it - I don't think parsletongue is that nitpicky. Harry truely does not believe voldemort will set up a universal True Horcrux system or anything of the sort, so the statement isn't a lie. EY would have to settle any debate on semantics. :)
