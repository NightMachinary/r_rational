I see two ways harry might play this out. First one is for Harry to convince Voldemort he needs or wants to learn partial transformation. The second one is to remind Voldemort that Dumbledore seemingly was present at two locations at once. Here it is key to suggest that the mirror might be involved as the facilitator of this and not a time turner.

*The Partial Transformation Way*

We would like Harry to aim for both him to explain and do a practical demonstration. If successful Harry will have bought himself some more time while he explains how partial transformation works and why it is so hard to do. Secondly by allowing Harry to show a practice Harry obtains a chance of doing magic without being killed by all of the Death Eaters surrounding him.

Now I see two things Harry could transform which could be effective. One is a ball of fusion the other a black hole. Given we do not know the exact limits of transformation this might be a stretch, yet there are a whole lot of things which points towards it being possible.

First off a fusion reaction requires a whole lot of pressure besides heat. The pressure itself can by my understanding itself ignite a fusion reaction. Now how we produce that pressure could be interesting. I don't see creating pressure from outside pressing in to the the solution. Rather manipulating gravity would probably be the best solution. Also making the field where gravity is manipulated small should make things easier power requirement wise.

Having the fusion reactions close to Voldemort would incinerate him from the heat alone or at least damage him enough to kill his body. If not the heat the radiation produced by the heat would achieve similar results.

If Harry is shielded by Voldemort he should have a chance of surviving instant death and then surviving the whole ordeal if we bet Granger wakes from being exposed to the same attack. She would not die from the attack and be able to provide Harry with some healing.

The black hole would work much like the ball of fusion as if it is created close enough to Voldemort he would be sucked in and his body would be destroyed. The same would be true for the Death Eaters. The problem with this plan is Harry would need to secure himself first which might be hard to explain.

Being able to make in practice small suns and black holes might also be enough to foreshadow how Harry could possible end the wold. Though defeating death seems like a better guess.

Now Voldemort would probably ask Harry questions to make sure of his intentions which Harry should be able to answer truthfully by being smart about it.

The whole point of the answers would be to subtly misdirect Voldemort's attention. Let us say Voldemort asks "Will you try to kill me?" just to make it as hard as possible to make a response as possible. A passable answer could be "I am not going to try and kill you with this transformation." This of course requires Harry to be able to view destroying Voldemort's body as not killing him. It would require Harry to think of Voldemort not as spirit and body unified, rather as Voldemort only being a spirit.

I will try to get back to this answer later, I have no more time to write atm :(
