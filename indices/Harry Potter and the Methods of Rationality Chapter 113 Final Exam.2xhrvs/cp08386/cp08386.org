So, Harry has his wand and absolutely nothing else, with 60 seconds before his imminent death (unless he starts sharing with Voldemort). What capabilities does he have?

- Partial transfiguration
- Command over Dementors
- Knowledge of science
- Buying time with explanations
- Patronus 2.0
- Retrospective time travel

For partial transfiguration, this takes a long time to set up, as referenced in the whole Azkaban arc. I have a hard time imagining a circumstance in which he used that 60 seconds to both stall his death AND partially transfigure something, without Voldie catching on and killing him.

There are no Dementors anywhere nearby, and I have no idea whether or not it would be possible to partially transfigure something into a Dementor.

If Harry wants to buy time to explain things, the more complicated and nonmagical the better. Explaining partial transfiguration would probably take the longest. We've already seen that Parseltongue is extremely limited in vocabulary, so to have Harry explain would probably take a very long time. Voldie could, however, just have Harry list whatever texts he used to teach himself, then kill Harry and read them himself.

As for science-y things, we've already discussed about how hard it would be to partially transfigure air into things like antimatter. As much as I'd love to see him turn the earth under his feet into antimatter specifically targeted to the area immediately underneath each Death Eater, I don't know if that's possible given the radical non-homogeneity of earth and the focus/concentration it would take to extend/make antimatter without it immediately annihilating absolutely everything nearby.

We've seen how the Patronus 2.0 can be used to restart a dead person. If Harry casts a Patronus 2.0, and Voldie tries to kill him, can Harry just have his Patronus go inside him like he did with Hermione, and keep himself alive that way? I need to think on this more.

Will continue to update this list of capabilities and ideas as I re-read, but final exams on Friday mean that I won't get to work on this as much as I want :(
