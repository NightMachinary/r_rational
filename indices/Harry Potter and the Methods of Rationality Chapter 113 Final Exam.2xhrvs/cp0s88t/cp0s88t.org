how do you do the impossible? by knowing why it's impossible, then making one or more of those parameters untrue.

- escape is impossible because we cannot travel the distance required anywhere near as quickly as our captors (note: I say "our" as we, collectively are taking the roles of voices in harry's head, like the much-used griffindor, ravenclaw, slitheren, etc.)

- negotiation is impossible because the opponent is smarter than us, and believes we are a credible existential threat

- combat is impossible because we are outmanned, outgunned, and in the case of quirrel (he'll always be quirrel to us) outskilled.

also, why are we naked? it makes no sense for us to be naked. if you're going to give us a wand, give us some pants! -shakes fist-

possible attack vectors:

- make quirrel less intelligent. a whispered confundus seems almost mandatory for any solution, as a more intelligent opponent would think of anything we could think of, and counter it. possibly purposely botched memory charm?

- make ourselves seem like a non-credible threat

- make ourselves seem like not a threat.

- incapacitate riddle, use new intelligence advantage to fight remaining deatheaters.

- gain speed advantage for escape? rocket broom again? tough to fight apparation...

I think obliviation is our best bet. let's take a moment to talk about it- it's been mentioned as possibly *the* most overpowered spell several times over the course of the series. exactly what limits does it have? could we, say, give quirrel false memories of the prophesy he heard? alter his memories enough to fundamentally change his personality? turn him against his own deatheaters?
