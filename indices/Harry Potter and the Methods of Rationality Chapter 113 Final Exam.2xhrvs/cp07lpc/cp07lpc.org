I think that Voldemort is actually intending to kill Harry. This isn't just one of his deeper schemes to let Harry escape and fake is defeat etc. I think he's intending on extracting as many secrets as he can from Harry and killing him. He's too afraid that Harry will fulfill the prophecy and destroy the world.

Harry will have to use partial transfiguration in order to escape. Maybe he can transfigure carbon nanotubes threads or something from the air and impale stab everyone in the brain or something.

Can't wait for the next chapter!
