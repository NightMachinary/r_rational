Well, what I think is really going on is that Voldemort is making a mistake: He hasn't updated his beliefs. He knows Harry needs to have his wand because he needs it to take the Vow, and he hasn't noticed yet that the justification no longer applies.

This is exactly the same problem Harry had with not telling Dumbledore about his sense of doom, and that was acknowledged and explained in the text, so it's a character trait that Tom Riddle is established as having.

If I'm right, this is a genuine mistake on Quirrel's part, which means it might be very useful in solving the puzzle even if we don't yet know how.
