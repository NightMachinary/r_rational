Well then my best guess is that Voldemort is expecting to have Harry cast a spell to demonstrate his secrets and doesn't want to spend the time on passing the wand back and forth. Or he doesn't want to chance Harry raising his hand or doing anything while slightly distracted by moving Death Eaters.

Although this is all still insanely OOC for Voldemort.

Do you mind taking a look at my hypothesis on Voldemort's Horcrux spells at [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xibdr/spoilers_ch_113_clarifying_mechanics/cp0uso2]]? Thanks!
