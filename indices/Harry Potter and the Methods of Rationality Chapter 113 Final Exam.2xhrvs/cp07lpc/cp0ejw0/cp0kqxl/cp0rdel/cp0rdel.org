I'm pretty sure it depends on the size of the object. 1 nanometer width carbon nanotubes are going to have a volume of less than 1 cubic milimeter even if the tube is 1 kilometer in length. He could make it into a bunch of nanotubes that terminate in each deatheater's head before branching out to destroy as much as possible.
