If you run a secret world government how much money you have seems rather trivial, since you can just give yourself as much money as needed to accomplish a given goal. However it's doubtful you would need to spend any money at all anyway, since you are in cahoots with nearly every extremely powerful person and can have the national governments do whatever you want.
