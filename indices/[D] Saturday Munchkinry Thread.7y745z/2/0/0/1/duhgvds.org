Not super familiar with Worm, but if it is part of your brain you should be able to copy the power to other people, correct? If so, mass producing immortality might be on the table.

You are a near perfect healer of anything that doesn't outright kill someone or removes parts of their body, provided you have a backup of this person stored. So find someone you trust not to go crazy with this power (you do /not/ want to put this power in the hands of random people), then give it to them and start making copies of this person by overwriting terminally ill, comatose or severely brain damaged people.

There is something like 250 work days in a year so, assuming a regular 40 hour work week and one rejuvenation/medical intervention needed every ten years, one copy should be able to maintain 120.000 people. At current word population that means we have to find about 60.000 people willing to become a donor body.

I don't know if we currently have enough valid candidates on the planet, especially since a large number of people that would now be considered terminally ill can be healed with this power even without having a backup in place, so you might initially have to resort some deal-with-the-devil type arrangements ("we can heal your child, but only if one of you is willing to give up their life"). Morally that's kind off a dark shade of gray, but ultimately, the benefits do dramatically outweigh the costs.
