Get Panacea to make an arm that cures cancer or something (whatever you can convince her to do) and copy that. Go around giving that to people with cancer.

Store backups of allies periodically and before big fights. If one dies, restore them via a body blank produced by some bio-tinker. This would be a game-changer for Endbringer fights, especially Behemoth.

Copying someone's Corona Pollentia/Gemma might let you give someone else their power, or remove their power. At the very least, it'd be better than [[/s][spoiler]].
