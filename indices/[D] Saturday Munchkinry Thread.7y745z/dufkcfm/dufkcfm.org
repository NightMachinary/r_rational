You gain the ability to store mental copies down to atomic level of people you touch. You may swap any feature on yourself or any human you are touching for any correlating feature you have memorized, in whatever combination you wish, meaning you can perfectly copy anyone you have touched. The part you want to replace need to be more or less intact, ie. you could swap an injured arm out with a stored copy but you couldn't regrow a lost arm. Changes takes between 1-10 minutes depending on the scope of the change.

Some interesting uses of this power includes: the ability to create copies of any single person by overwriting another person, limited immortality by overwritting your body with a younger version of yourself, possibly accessing memories of people you have touched at the risk of overwriting yourself(do we know where memories are stored?). What's some other interesting uses?

Are skills, such as martial art, stored in one particular region of the brain that you can temporarily swap out?
