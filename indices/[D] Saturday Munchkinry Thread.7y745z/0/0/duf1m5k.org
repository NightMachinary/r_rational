Well realistically the best you can hope to do with this is likely just to steal money from people that won't meaningfully affect their QOL, and also make slight attempts to improve people's lives quantum leap style. Maybe leave notes for the person when they get their body back about how to improve their life and give different explanations about what happened to them based on what their beliefs seem to be (so could be angelic possession, alternate personality, or something else).

Though in many cases the best plan to avoid affecting people's lives too much would be by avoiding much changes unless their life couldn't really get worse by thinking they had a fugue state. Then just getting really good at faking illness to avoid having to go to work for these people's jobs.

Presumably you don't die if the body you're temporarily inhabiting dies otherwise you would probably not last a decade before you end up in a body that dies while you're in it.
