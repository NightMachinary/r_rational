If you monitored when you went to sleep and figured out what your brainwaves look like when the switch is about to happen, you could use this power to impersonate specific people. Monitor yourself in a sleep study style environment and set a device so that when you are about to fall asleep it triggers a specific person to wake up. You could hijack their alarm clock, or if you're evil and don't worry about the person catching you, just kidnap them and give them adrenaline right as you fall asleep. You have to get it just right though since there will be so many people waking up at any given time. For hijacking specific people it would be best to jump at whatever time the least people are waking up but it would still be hard.

You could also tranquilize and awaken yourself multiple times to get extra tries.

I would consider storing tranquilizers in safety deposit boxes/drop sites near all major population centers where you can easily hide them. That way if you wake up somewhere or as someone you don't want to be you can exit. If you use the power to make lots of money, build a global satellite network for phones and itnernet with access to everyone and you'll almost never be stuck.

The biggest problem I see if you aren't going for specific people is the language barrier. You can mitigate this by going to sleep at a time when people in countries speaking your language are likely to be waking up, but there is a good chance someone wakes up at an odd time and you end up somewhere you don't speak the language.

Also if you had a spacecraft built and you volunteered to fly it you could use this for faster than light communication/shore leave.
