Presumably if this sort of secret world government managed to arise in the first place then you have some pretty incredible means of controlling information and keeping secrets, which may imply mind control tech or something, but since I can't be sure what specific futuristic techs you might have I'll ignore that.

So if you want to focus on AI X-risk prevention you'll want to do some of the following: Realistically though the best plan will require that you stir up enough public fear that you can justify putting into place sweeping legislation that would mandate improvements to computer security (to prevent massive botnets from being an issue) as well as heavily controlling access to any supercomputers advanced enough to implement AGI.\\
This might be achieved by deliberately staging a false flag attack wherein you cause massive infrastructure damage using narrow AI and blame it on a primitive AGI. This will create the necessary fear to not draw undo public suspicion when you implement surveillance measures (though they wouldn't really need to be more invasive than current one's already are) to keep track of electricity and information bandwidth usage so you can sniff out any unauthorized work on AGI.

Of course the biggest component to this plan would be forcing all AGI research to be as part of an international organization as part of a secretive program like the manhattan project which employs basically everyone competent.

Anyway all this is hard to predict because the thing is if an organization competent enough to control the world and hide its existence really existed the world would look nothing like it does today, unless just for the evulz the world government is trying to make it look exactly like what you would expect from a world run by a bunch of national governments filled with morons and plagued by coordination problems.
