Depends on their values, as the other person said.

Generically, I'd say toss enough in a sufficiently diversified index fund that they could live indefinitely on the interest at their preferred level of comfort and then do direct work on areas that best satisfy their preferences. ~3 million USD will get you high-5 figures/low 6-figures safe withdrawal rate less capital gains tax, which could set you up anywhere from comfy to lavish depending on where in the world you live.

If they don't believe themselves capable of doing direct work, they could still live off investments but otherwise earn to give, or just donate the lot to their preferred charities if especially altruistic.
