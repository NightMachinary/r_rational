Right, but they can't get in to see the guardian without the controller.

I went back and found it in Chapter 89:

"Previously, they had already tried to bring a temporary looper into the space of the Sovereign gate and failed. The Guardian of the Threshold later confirmed that temporary loopers are unable to access the space. However, this security measure was childishly easy to bypass through a short duration soul bond that allowed the Controller to simply â€˜pull' outsiders with them as they entered the Sovereign Gate."
