Yeah, that's how I imagine it went. Which totally explains the initial contact (and how he ended up in a contract with the primordial), but not how he was able to get back into the Gate, later, after he had wiped Zach's mind and spent restarts practicing the invasion. Getting back into the Gate would have still required Zach. Well, should have. I'm fine with it being a plot hole, or even something that hasn't been explained, yet. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't missed an explanation somewhere.
