No, don't give it a sad ending unless that's what's most appropriate to the work. A piece of serial fiction lives on much longer than its initial run and the first audience that read along with it. I get comments and reviews years after the fact by people finding stuff I've written for the first time.

If you give it a sad ending just as a matter of consequence, you're weakening the work for everyone who will read it in the future.
