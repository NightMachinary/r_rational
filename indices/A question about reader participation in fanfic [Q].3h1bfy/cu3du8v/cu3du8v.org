I generally just hide all sorts of hints that my characters will figure out /eventually/ but a perceptive audience could figure out far sooner. And then I don't say anything, and if people work it out, good for them.

The whole 'testing your readers' think worked on the final exam, but that was a rather specific case, at the end of a very long fanfiction with an already very dedicated reader base. Its not something to really throw around lightly unless you /know/ you have readers who would be able to figure it out.
