Your body would be tired, but your brain would be mostly non-tired.

The trick of cutting down the space of lottery number is interesting. If didn't describe a limit on iteration, so with a sequence of carefully layers out decisions narrowing down the number you could change it from one massive meditation to win the lottery to a bunch of little ones.

The morning trick is a good one, it gives you a quickly useable escape option. If your ten minutes delayed timeline is close enough but ten minutes earlier to the non-delayed timeline, you could even use it once a day as a 10 minute do-over.
