I would try to figure out something that would increase the chances of preventing the heat death of the universe, such as perhaps a link between negentropy and the universe's spatial expansion. If there turned out to be a way to harness the expansion of the universe to produce negentropy, possible even converting one into the other, that would solve multiple problems at once.

There may be other promising fields to link thermodynamics with, particularly ones with non time symmetrical aspects.
