Yeah, notes can really work... with anything risky, but where that risk pays off in the short term, I can take a moment to decide whether or not I /really/ want to do it before trying it anyway (then, even if I fail, I go back and learn from it...)

But the /big/ advantage that I'd have over Coil is that I'm /not/ limited to only /two/ timelines.
