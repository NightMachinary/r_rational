  Your body would be tired, but your brain would be mostly non-tired.

Hmmm. So, not something I can do every night. But still better than actually staying up all night.

  The trick of cutting down the space of lottery number is interesting. If didn't describe a limit on iteration, so with a sequence of carefully layers out decisions narrowing down the number you could change it from one massive meditation to win the lottery to a bunch of little ones.

If I work on a binary-search basis, I could probably cut 'finding the winning lottery numbers' down to about eight yes-or-no decisions per lottery number (assuming the lottery numbers don't go above 64 - nine decisions per number if they reach more than 64 but less than 128).

And if I'm planning on winning a smaller prize, i.e. /not/ the jackpot but only, say, four correct humbers, then it becomes even easier...

  If your ten minutes delayed timeline is close enough but ten minutes earlier to the non-delayed timeline, you could even use it once a day as a 10 minute do-over.

I don't see what you mean by this. I don't get to experience the new timeline, do I? I just see the results in it (but I remember only the original timeline). Or am I misunderstanding?
