If I take a good night's sleep, then retroactively decide that I stayed up all night working, then do I have the results of that work (e.g. notes, computer documents) but a non-tired brain?

Perhaps I can't use the ability to give myself-in-the-past a complete correct lottery number. But I can decide, before selecting each individual number, whether I'm going even or odd - which halves the number of possible sets of lottery numbers I might choose. If I'm choosing a list of six numbers, then pulling even-or-odd (and rewriting that decision after the fact if necessary) reduces the number of, well, numbers that I'm choosing between by a factor of 64. I'm not sure whether or not this is enough to give me an expectation of (on average) winning more than I spend, or not; but it might.

If, every morning, I spend some time deciding whether to get up /now/ or wait ten more minutes; then I can avoid most Black Swan type events by resetting to sleep in ten more minutes that morning. (It's a lot better to be late than to be in a traffic accident).

I can become a perfect spy; breaking into a location, finding out the info I need, and then retroactively deciding not to break in after all. This way, I get the required info but I don't leave behind any evidence.
