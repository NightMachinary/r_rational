  I don't see what you mean by this. I don't get to experience the new timeline, do I? I just see the results in it (but I remember only the original timeline).

You are correct, you don't experience the new timeline. But if you precommitted to keeping certain actions consistent you could set things up so that the new timeline is likely to be very similar to the old timeline, just several minutes behind (10 minutes is probably too long for this trick, you would need to set things off just a few minutes behind). Of course... someone else doing something different or butterfly effects making those few minutes of difference lead to large differences would throw things off, and you wouldn't know for sure until you actually saw how the new timeline was playing out, so it would be a bit tricky and risky. So at best, you could leverage it like Coil leverages his power in Worm if you precommited to take notes for yourself to read, with the advantage over Coil that your power is more retroactive, but disadvantage that your aren't aware of all the timelines at once.
