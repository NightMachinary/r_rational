*Parallel universe reality bending*: by visualizing a clear alternative course of action that you might have plausibly taken and exerting willpower you can overwrite reality with one in which that course of action was actually taken.

- Completely overwriting reality is the easiest and safest. Your own mental perspective is the only thing that remains of the old reality and the rest of the universe, including your physical body except your brain is exactly as it would be had you made the alternate choice you imagined making. Of course, that choice might have led in expected directions, which you have no control over.

- Older decisions are “harder” to use than more recent choices. Less plausible choices are harder to use than more plausible choices. Using the choice to buy one reasonable stock over another is easier than using a choice about buying a penny stock which is easier still than retroactively choosing a correct lottery number.

- easier means less meditation, concentration, and willpower requires. An easy usage might require a few minutes and simple visualization. The lottery number example might require several hours of continuous intense focus and willpower.

- Mixing the current reality and the alternate reality adds a lot of difficulty making an otherwise easy overwriting very hard. Something as simple as asking for a glass of tea instead of soda and physically bringing the glass over from the old reality might require tens of minutes intense focus and effort vs barely a second or two of effort for pure mental effect. With large scale events this can have weird “Mandela Effect” style side effects which would allow mundane people to remember inconsistencies.

- Events of which you aren't sure about the exact choice lead to them, but plausibly within your control can be rewritten but with added difficulty and might have unpredictable side effects in terms of consequences.

- Overwriting your own mind is possible... but the new version of you could be drastically different, enough to count as a form of death. In fact, that is how you discovered your powers: some alternate version of you tried it, leaving “you” suddenly in a different location, with helpfully written notes explaining what happened.

- your powers are slowly growing over time. Within ten years hard difficulty will become medium and easy will be trivial.

So ideas? Stock trading is obvious but other opportunities to exploit this ability?
