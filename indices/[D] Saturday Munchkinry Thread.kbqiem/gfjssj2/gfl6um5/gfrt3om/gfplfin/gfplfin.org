So the genie reworks the entire laws of the universe? In a way that is retroactively consistent with everything observed by humanity so far? I would be scared to make a wish that is too unworkable or raises the odds of false vacuum collapse or something like that.

But if I did make a wish it would be aimed at something completely physically impossible right now. Maybe FTL of some form? I would need to read up more on physics to figure out where I should suggest making the conceptual link.
