Im fishing for ideas. Im trying to write a story about *vampires,* but I want them to be as scientifically plausible as possible, while also trying to make the resultant vampire "society" rational-ish (not another group of brooding Goths).

The "HARD RULES" would be:

- the vampires must be scientifically plausible, in accordance to what we know about evolution, metabolism, and basic biology.

- the vampires must REQUIRE drinking human blood to survive, but it does not have to be their sole sustenance.

- the Vampires must be able to be biologically extremely long lived (at least that Dracula could be still alive today after nearly 600 years).

- the vampires must be at least "human passing" enough to allow casual interaction with humans, and be able to infiltrate human society without being easily detected.

THE "SOFT RULES" would be:

- would be nice if the vampires were somehow allergic to concentrated UV (sunlight yes, moonlight no)

- would be cool if there was a "scientific-ish" explanation for at least some of milder versions of vampiric powers, like superhuman strength, speed, durability or hypnotism.

- would be great if the explanation of vampirism allowed them to "turn" humans, rather than being born with vampirism.

- a nice perk would be if there was a good explanation for the various types/clans/bloodlines of vampires being different but having a common origin.

- finally, as per the name of this thread, I would wish for an explanation that munchkins the vamps as much as possible within constrains of a plausible scientific explanation. Im not much interested in hemovorous, slightly pale humans, but scary night predators who stalk the darkness for centuries.
