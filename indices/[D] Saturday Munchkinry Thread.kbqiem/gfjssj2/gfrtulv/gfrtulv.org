You could exploit 'have plausibly taken' with a random number generator set to pick from 1 to 10000, and if you roll 10000 you agree to wait shortly before doing whatever it is you wanted to do anyway. Any time you want to do something, there is now a 0.01% chance you did not do that exact thing, therefore there are substantially more plausible divergences.
