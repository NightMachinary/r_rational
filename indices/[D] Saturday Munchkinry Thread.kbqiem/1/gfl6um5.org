A genie grants you the key to a new realm of physics, engineering, and technology. This isn't quite a blank cheque, though, as you still have to comply with /most/ of our currently-known laws of physics. Examples of previously-successful wishes include:

- *Thermodynamics* which connects temperature gradients <-> work

- *Electromagnetism* magnetic flux <-> electricity

- *Photovoltaics* light <-> electricity

What do you ask for, and what do you do with it if granted?
