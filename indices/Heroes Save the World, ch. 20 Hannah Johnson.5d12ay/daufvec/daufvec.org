  Still, spending too long to think about what sort of message to send might have gotten her in trouble in some other way, either by making it more obvious that she was thinking carefully about this or by giving the opportunity for someone else to volunteer.

Wasn't the whole thing Hannah's idea in the first place? If she had thought of a better code and then simply acted as if the idea came to her a bit later no one without mind reading abilities could have been suspicious. I mean what are the chances that Simon comes up with it even though he hadn't done so until now?

Or did she just blurt it out as it came to her and the scramble to make a code, which she thought of only after saying her message-through-time plan out loud? Doesn't seem in character somehow, even though we have only seen little of it until now.
