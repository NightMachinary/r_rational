The concern wasn't that Simon would come up with a code, but that someone else might think of sending a message from the future and ruin her chance to do it now (and she wanted confirmation that she could push the CIA and trust Austin * Simon).

Hannah thought of it, and then she thought about using Simon to relay a message to herself from the future, so she's at least a little justified in being worried that somebody might think up the first part in the time that it takes her to create a better system.
