You have five years where everyone will obey you. They will follow every one of your orders as if it was an internal desire that was maxed on their 'I care about this' stat. So pretty much anything physically possible they could do, of course if you tell them to stay awake they will eventually fail and other strenous things will degrade their body.

Don't worry about orders being confused or anything like that, as soon as someone hears/finds out about your order to them they understand the order and the spirit of it and they follow that. So a hermit in the middle of nowhere might not follow your order but if you tell people to state it on the radio everyone will follow a radio order relayed via someone else and will know fake orders from yours etc.

What's the best way to maximise utility post-you? How much could you do to improve the world? What would be the best use of everyone's collective time?

Presuming that you use this ability after the 5 years are up how do you stop a counterculture developing from people's reactions? Your orders all cease working after 5 years, though if you told people to smoke they'd obviously be addicted by that point and would still have to fight against that and other habits that you could have formed.

Alternative Challenge: How do you counter this ability, with foreknowledge and without? How would you exploit the system above to disobey the orders or limit the violation of your freedom?
