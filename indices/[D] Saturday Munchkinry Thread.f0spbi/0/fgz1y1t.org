You're a druid. Your druidic powers are quite narrow:

- You can massively speed up any biological process of something you touch, though it will still take the same inputs and leave the same outputs, which will be your primary limitation. If you speed up respiration too much (for example), your subject is likely to asphyxiate.
- You can intuitively alter any epigenetic or environmental aspects of a plant or animal's growth or function when you touch it, e.g. making a flower bloom early, making a plant grow away from the light, forcing an animal into heat, etc. These alterations will persist even after you're no longer in contact with the specimen.

How do you best use your powers "for good" in world that approximates ~1600 AD Europe, assuming that they're cool with you having magic powers? Does anything change if you're in the modern day?
