Step one: Obtain potato.

Step two: Cook potato. I guess this is technically optional.

Step three: Fill your mouth with delicious potato.

Step four: Accelerate amylase activity to the max.

Step five: Spit out potato-like object.

Step six: Dissolve in water. Strain through high-grade cheesecloth to remove insoluble impurities. This step and step seven are optional.

Step seven: Boil off water, being sure to avoid caramelization. (This isn't too hard, especially if you keep the temperature near 100 Celsius.)

Step eight: Sell sugar at high prices.

Step nine: Some sort of EA stuff?

Bonus if you can train a cow to hold delicious baked potato in its mouth for long enough without swallowing. Bonus bonus if you build a complicated geometrical structure in order to touch as many cows simultaneously as is possible.
