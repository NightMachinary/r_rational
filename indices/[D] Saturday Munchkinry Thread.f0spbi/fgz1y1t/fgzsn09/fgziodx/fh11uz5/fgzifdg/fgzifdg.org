If I'm under-educated outside of the druidic arts, then I don't know anything about the economic implications of boosting farm output, but I probably know about environmental problems caused by increasing the nutrient intake rate of the plants without laying fallow or crop rotation.

"I wanted to do good for you all. I wanted nothing but happy, healthy, well-fed people all across the land. So, my first step was to join the church. Being able to demonstrate miracles, I was able to rise the ranks quickly enough. Many highwaymen, despite their moral faults, were loath to rob a religious leader. When necessary, I recruited local Knights to escort me through dangerous locales."

"For the first harvest, I made a seed bank. I had the clergymen hire couriers to all the counts and lords, to ask for seeds of their local farm varieties. I spent the year growing plants in greenhouses, and multiplying the seeds."

"For the second harvest, I sent out a wide variety of seeds to all nearby region I could reach. I travelled the lands, following the weather, visiting towns starving due to drought or erosion, and saved them. Food isn't the only issue, wood is another huge one. I kickstarted the growth of new groves and prescribed religious significance to it, hopefully allowing the trees to grow for a decade more after my passing through."

"From the third harvest onwards, I again sent out seeds, but this time I knew which seeds grew well, where. I began a plant breeding initiative. I send out detailed instructions on when to lay fields fallow, and when to switch from one crop to another. Everything was going perfectly."

"But I quickly succumbed to the perils of luxury, and grew lazy. Powerful nobles and clergymen were losing their ability to control the commoners. In my quest to achieve a greater good, I assumed goodness in the hearts of my allies, and I was blind to their plots. Propaganda campaigns were launched, and despite all the good I have done, the commoners were convinced that this good was through satanic magics, to evil ends. Instead of Druid, a new word surfaced for what I do: /"Witch"/ spoken throughout the land with all the contempt a false priest can proselytize.

"I have betrayed my fellow Druids, who raised me as a child and gifted me with these magics. I have betrayed the spirits of the land, who followed my guidance to make farmlands prosperous. I have betrayed the people, good people who just want to to what they believe is right. I have ensured that, everlasting into the future, magic will be reviled because it presents a threat to the status quo. I have failed. Forgive me..."

/This is the true and original account of the final words of the First Witch as she and her friends gathered fag for their burning. The First Witch, who brought Satan's influence upon the Christian Lands of Europe, who almost took the whole world under her sway, but was stopped by the brave actions of the Pope Eternal./
