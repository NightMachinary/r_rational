Altering epigenetics is insanely powerful, more powerful than altering genetics themselves. It's the next best thing to flat out controlling the phenotype(like plantshifting wizard) Disease genes? Silenced. Genes not optimal for the environment? Silenced.

Genes for crop traits we want? Over expressed. We typically have to multiply there genes we want in plants to get them to make big fruits, with all kinds of issues, you get to skip that. You can also indirectly do genetic engineering by messing with Gene inheritance epigenetics.
