"Keep healthy, work hard, make friends, and let's all do our bit to make the world a better place for everyone."

It will /not/ be hard to spread the above message very widely, especially once people realise that spreading the message is a great way to make the world a better place.

Of course, different people will have widely divergent ideas of exactly what 'make the world a better place' will mean. But that's okay; I'm not sure that /my/ ideas of how to make the world a better place for everyone are better than anyone else's, either. And anyone who can make a persuasive case that their recommended course of action will make the world a better place for /everyone/ will easily recruit people to their cause.

I don't know what the world would look like after five years. But I expect it would be dramatically different.

Counterculture? Well, after five years of everyone working hard for a better world, I hope that the results are good enough to persuade a significant portion of the population to keep it up (perhaps at a slightly less dedicated pace).

Countering this ability; hmmm. Without foreknowledge seems hard. With foreknowledge?

I guess I could try to teach people about how to be a Literal Genie, in the hope of making the Power backfire on its user (or to make the User so afraid of backfire that he is too scared to use the power).

Alternatively, I could try to start a social movement of extreme self-denial, that encourages only doing things that you /don't/ care about; thus trying to cause the people who hear the orders to instantly disregard them. (This will only be an extreme minority of the population; but if I can arrange for this Cult to be most of the people that the User interacts with, perhaps I can persuade him that he has no power).

Alternatively, I could try to use force to physically prevent the User from giving any orders in the next five years.
