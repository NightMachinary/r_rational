Are we on the same board? This is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], not [[/r/lolchillaxbro][r/lolchillaxbro]]. We're supposed to analyze things for rational content, and when irrational content is posted to the board we're supposed to call it out. I have no idea why PL_TOC is being so heavily downvoted, or why you're being so heavily upvoted.
