Most likely because (as my comment suggested) OP was incorrect in posting it to this subreddit and Sampatrick was defending it. Later on however he was asking someone to explain their reasoning behind calling something 'psychotic,' and they just responded with a smartass comment instead of an explanation. In my interpretation, this made people want to downvote the guy's comments there more, because he was more clearly just being an asshole instead of bringing up valid points.

Most people don't go through an entire thread to downvote every single one of a person's comments, even in a short one like this, so to me it seems more likely that people had opinions than that someone used bots.

PL_TOC still hasn't explained his position, as a side note.
