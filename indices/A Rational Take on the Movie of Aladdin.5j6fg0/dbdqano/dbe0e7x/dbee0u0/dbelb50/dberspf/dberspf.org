I dunno, the upvote pattern is really sketchy. Usually, the further down a comment tree you get, the fewer upvotes turn up, because more people read the ones close to the bottom than close to the top. Here, though, the opposite is true; if we presume the usual scenario (one person per vote) rather a lot of people thought "Please enlighten me" deserved an upvote, but significantly fewer of them thought his earlier comment, in which he had an actual point, did.

However, if you track upvotes over time, you'll notice that, right after Sampatrick's initial comment, he got a whole bunch of upvotes, and PL_TOC got a whole bunch of downvotes - and, notably, the up and downvotes were uniform, not clustered at the roots. Over time, however, Sampatrick got more and more downvotes, this time clustered at the roots as they usually are, and PL_TOC got more and more upvotes, against clustered. This is consistent with one person with a bunch of votebots deciding to mass-upvote himself right after commenting, and mass-downvote the person he disagrees with, and then the usual voting gradually voicing the opposite opinion.

(Completely hypothetically, of course, I would /never/ accuse anyone of doing this. I'm sure Sampatrick "nah dude it's called having a good time" 15 is very respectful of the rules and conventions of this subreddit and would never violate them so grossly just to disparage someone who disagreed with him on the internet.)
