And yet the votes still massively spiked right and the beginning and are now in the middle of a complete reversal. That basically /never/ happens; if the users on this subreddit actually agreed with Sampatrick or felt PL_TOC was being unfair, you'd get a gradual progression towards one extreme for each, gradually tapering off as the traffic died down.

Also, the notion that Sampatrick's original comment, which more or less boils down to "take a chill pill d00d", would get so many upvotes in such a short time, on this of all subs, seems incredibly far-fetched. Ordinarily, comments along those lines get immediately downvoted into oblivion, on the rare occasions in which they even turn up. Given that this same comment got something in the area of 10 upvotes in an extremely short time, and then even more /down/votes over the following day, this seems consistent with numbers inflated with votebots or sockpuppets at the start and then gradually succumbing to the actual views of the community.

Of course, a prediction is the best way to settle this. I predict that PL_TOC's comments will continue to be upvoted, and Sampatrick's downvoted, until people stop visiting this thread. At present, the primary tree is:

+7 (PL_TOC) I thought it was...

-1 (Sampatrick) Nah dude...

-3 (PL_TOC) There's nothing wrong...

+6 (Sampatrick) Please enlighten me

-6 (PL_TOC) Sorry. There's no...
