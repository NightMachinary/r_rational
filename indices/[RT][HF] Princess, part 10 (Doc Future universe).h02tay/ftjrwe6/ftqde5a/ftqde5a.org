For reasons I can't determine, I had an emotional block to reading the Princess. I noticed that and decided to "just try one chapter"

I've run out of lunch break, and plausible "correspondence with team" break but I haven't got to part 10. Sadness is my current state.

I forgot how much I loved the characters in this world. Even if I want to shake my head at Flicker's emotional uselessness.
