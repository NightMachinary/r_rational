I've started a 5-days-per-week parkour regimen towards the beginning of the lockdown. I'd like to keep it going, but I'm going to move to an apartment soon, and I don't think the regimen is going to be as easy to maintain once doing parkour means jogging to a public park, instead of just going out into our house's garden.
