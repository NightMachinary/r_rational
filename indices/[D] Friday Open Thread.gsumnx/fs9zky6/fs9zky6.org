Now the social distancing is almost evaporated where I live (don't worry, we have had 0 cases of community transmission for like a month. We're in a very lucky part of the world), I'm no longer going to be working from home 2.5 days a week.

I started the couch to 5k running program using the extra time I was saving by not having to commute (I normally cycle, so traded one exercise for another, more intense exercise). I went from barely being able to jog a minute to being able to jog for 25 minutes straight in about five or six weeks. It's absolutely shocking to me, the amount of progress I've made. I don't love it yet, but I like it fine, and I seem to be losing more weight than I'd expect given the relatively modest calorie expenditure (but I suppose ~300cal extra a week adds up? I think I've lost 2kg/5lb).

Protip: I invested in an expensive sports bra and it made such a difference.

I'm really worried, I guess, of going back to work... because I want to keep running. I was hoping that the semi-lockdown would stay long enough for me to get to the point where I can run 6km, which would let me commute on foot, but that's another month or so away I think.

I don't know really what I want to say here. I was talking to my psychologist about how everything seems to be coming up MagicWeasel during this pandemic, and I feel kind of bad about that. She told me not to, because it's good that I'm happy. And... heck, I'm glad I improved things. I'm glad that my local politician has been doing the right thing and lead to us being able to slowly scale back the restrictions with hopefully no continued community spread. I'm happy?

I hope you guys are too. Or as much as can be expected.
