Clearly an entirely different approach. Here, in peak social distancing time, it was actually illegal to go to work unless your place of work was classed as an 'essential service' (e.g. grocery stores, doctor's offices, and so on); though one was always allowed to work remotely, and thus virtually anyone who /could/ work remotely /did/. (As of today, most sectors are allowed to return to work but remote working is still encouraged by government).

And yeah, after-work runs is another practical solution to the when-to-run dilemma.
