After a good amount of time dealing with depression, it feels like I haven't written anything in years, and I've lost just about all the useful writing habits I might have had.

That said, over the first two days of trying to get back into the habit, I seem to have written 8,467 words. ... I'm pretty sure I'm not going to keep up that rate, since it's mostly infodumping some background I've already been thinking about, and now I have to spend time both writing and planning what to write.
