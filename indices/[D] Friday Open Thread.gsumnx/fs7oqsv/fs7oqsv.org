Almost four months ago, I was sent, after a conversation where I mentioned how much I wished there were more stories written with special focus given to intelligent characters and internal consistency, a link to this community.

I was almost happy when the quarantine was announced.

I have been enraptured with many of the stories here; I have been an avid reader of fanfiction for over fifteen years and never have I been this satisfied. Luminosity, Radiance, The Metropolitan Man, Branches on the Tree of Time, A Bluer Shade of White, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, Friendship is Optimal, and now finding myself rapidly approaching the current end of Animorphs: The Reckoning, I cannot have enough of it. I feel spoiled. It's all wonderful.

A gracious thanks to the authors of these works and this community. Soon, I hope to offer my own contribution.
