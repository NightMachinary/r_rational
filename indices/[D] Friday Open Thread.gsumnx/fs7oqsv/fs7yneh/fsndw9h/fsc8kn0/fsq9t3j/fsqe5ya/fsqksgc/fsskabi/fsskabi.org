....Ok. I can't do anything about how you interpret my comment, except to encourage you to either use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity][popular and well-accepted reasonable principles]] for doing so or interpret it in whatever way that makes you feel best. The only thing I'll add here is that I hope you don't moderate based on things I have absolutely no control over.

  You can't please everyone (case in point: you). You can however do pretty good enough for the overwhelming majority, which I think has been done. I'm not sure what the word "splendid" is supposed to mean if not that.

Ok, let me rephrase: clearly, the community can do better.

  You bring up porn a lot, and yet... gestures at the front page you'll notice that [[/r/rational]] is not full of porn. Somehow, someway, the system in place is working, with very minimal removals on our part.
#+end_quote

It's just an example. Clearly the system is not working as well as it could if it permits things that are not within the topic of the sub. [[/r/worldpolitics]] was flooded with porn, why do you think this sub is immune? Just because it's doing ok now with minimal removals doesn't mean it will continue to do so moving forward, which was the point of my initial comment.

  Maybe at some point just decide it's okay for other people to like Chili and the Chocolate Factory when you don't.
#+end_quote

I think that's perfectly fine and I like the story myself. The discussion is about moderation, not tastes in fiction.
