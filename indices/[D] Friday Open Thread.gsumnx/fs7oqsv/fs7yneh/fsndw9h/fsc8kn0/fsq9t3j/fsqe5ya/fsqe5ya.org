  Would you please stop trying to poison the well just because we don't moderate to your liking?
#+end_quote

I didn't say anything that wasn't true, what part of my comment is objectionable? I am describing what you told me. If you think your moderation tactics are poison (I didn't say that), I don't get why the solution you seem to be proposing is to stop describing them. Not describing poison doesn't get rid of it.

  and the community has done a splendid job selecting for things the community wants--even if they don't meet your own internal standards.
#+end_quote

That's a contradiction. Clearly the community hasn't done a splendid job if they don't select things a part of the community wants.

Also, this is beside the point because as I said, a community will also select for porn but that doesn't mean that all subs should allow porn. Just because a community selects something doesn't mean it's good, appropriate content for a particular sub with a particular focus. There's no point in subreddits if they're all just "ran" by users who upvote and post the exact same content.
