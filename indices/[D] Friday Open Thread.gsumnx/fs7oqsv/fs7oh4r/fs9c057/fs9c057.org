Sounds like a xianxia novel. The protagonists often "restart their cultivation" in order to gain power a new way and raise to greater heights.

Unfortunately, xianxia is one of the most aggravatingly irrational genres out there - or, at least, mainly consists of aggravatingly irrational authors. However, rational takes on the genre would be a good place to start with in looking for something like this, since it's already an established trope.
