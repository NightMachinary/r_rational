I once read a xianxia crossover fanfiction into the Narutoverse where a high leveled (not in the LitRPG sense) cultivator took their cultivation and gave it back to the world to both appease/bribe it and use it as a springboard to travel to another world which happened to be the Naruto world.

The world traveling was done so they could grow because they basically reached the level cap of their world. I recall that if cultivators took their cultivation with them something bad would happen.

They effectively become mortal and when they get to the Narutoverse they see chakra and ninjas as novel but a bad way.

Like someone messed with the bodies of the people to basically make them cripples in their eyes.

Anyhow the mc's plans in the Verse would have put them into conflict with the main cast. I think it was eating the bijuu

But other than that I don't remember much. Which is to say I don't remember the title, where it was written, how I found it, whether the mc was a chick/dude or if it was rational.

All in all giving up power in the present for rewards sounds cool and to be it sounds like the sort of thing a system could also have in the form of a gacha interface/minigame.

Thinking about it further this concept I see working in time travel works as well? Like in Reverend Insanity the mc as you put it

#+begin_quote
  the characters can beat the monsters via knowledge/experience, rather than higher damage, and the reward could still be meaningful.
#+end_quote

Though it's more applied to people than monsters. But 'prestiging' doesn't happen.

I can also point out a couple of VR novels (novels about Virtual Reality wit LitRPG elements) where the mc gets sent back to the past and then uses knowledge/experience to get ahead.

But in those cases (the VR novels) the choice to go back in time is usually unintentionally and not done with the purpose of getting a higher level cap/skills but is instead a side bonus on a quest for edgy vengeance. As a result they all sort of blend together unfortunately. Also no 'prestiging'.

In the end I recommend Reverend Insanity, a Chinese translated WN due to the mc giving up their cultivation and blowing themselves up in a bid to time travel with a less than 10% success rate.

Be forewarned though, the mc is unapologetically amoral. Though as a consolation prize no one seems to hold an idiot ball. Oh and 1687 chapters.
