Hi, I just found this sub today, and I really liked it! However, I'm still trying to understand the "tags" of posts.

[WIP] = work in progress

[FF] = fanfic

[D] = discussion

I get those, and I assume [RT] stands for "rational". But what does stuff like [RST] and [BST] mean? Am I missing something?
