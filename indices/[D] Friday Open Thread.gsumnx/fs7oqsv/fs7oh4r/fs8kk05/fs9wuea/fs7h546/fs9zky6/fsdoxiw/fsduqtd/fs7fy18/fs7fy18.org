I typed this out last night so I could make this comment as soon as the thread was posted, to give people the opportunity to bury it if nobody wants to see it, because that would be /totally/ understandable. I really wasn't particularly interested in seeing it myself.

Smack-works sent me a PM that is allegedly supposed to be about covid-19.

One of the things he said in the message is:

#+begin_quote
  Please let rationalists know about that possibility, please don't put your personal opinion about this or about rationality itself in the way of this... ('cause this possibility is too important and stakes are too high)

  (P.S.) All my bans are still in force - I can't make a post or an answer anywhere in lesswrong/HPMOR."
#+end_quote

Apparently he's been banned, so there's that at least.

The thing is, I can't figure out what it actually is that he wants me to tell all you silly rationalists (if you don't remember, he's more intelligent than all of us combined, so I guess it's not surprising that I'm not smart enough to figure it out).

All he said about covid-19 is this:

#+begin_quote
  In every thread I write about COVID (without mentioning it directly) and about old men and about my situation... [The ellipsis is part of his message, I'm not omitting anything, he just trails off.]

  If what described there is truth AND applicable to real people we have a genetic-biological + neurobiological discovery that trumps (by its importance) discoveries of evolution and genes combined, because it is both biological and cognitive discovery (well, by proving just what is in the links we make just an unheard of ground-breaking 20 Nobel Prizes neurobiological discovery, but as a LW-rationalist you will be able to deduce that genetic explanation is the most probable one)
#+end_quote

He included thirteen links to posts that he's made in other subreddits. Every single one of the posts is about the speaking patterns of fictional characters (and also bands like Linkin Park and Nirvana).

He also said to me "I can show you your speech pattern if you want."

There's nothing about covid (either directly or indirectly), nothing about old men, nothing about "his situation," nothing about his "unheard of ground-breaking 20 Nobel Prizes neurobiological discovery," nothing at all about the "possibility" that he said he wanted me to relay to "the rationalists." Just a bunch of rambling about speech patterns.

I haven't messaged him back yet, and I think I probably shouldn't.

I'm not including any of his links. His username is u slash Smack-works, if you're aware of who he is and the posts he's made then you can easily find his "speaking patterns" posts if you're curious enough to inflict that on yourself. I'm just over here like... /Why?/ How the bloody hell is "the speech patterns of fictional characters" supposed to have anything to do with covid-19? And why did he decide to single me out as the messenger of this "theory"? Has he PM'd anybody else?
