Thoughts sloshing around, whimsical fiction:

-----

"The sea of bitterness has no end; turn back to the shore."

He's telling me what they've all told me--there's no end to this, just give up.

The corners of my mouth go up, and I chuckle for him to see. As a scene from years ago seems to overlap in my mind with what my eyes report, I raise my arm and reply-- "The sea of bitterness is vast and infinite. The sea of bitterness is LIFE. A struggle without end is exactly what I'm wishing for."

​

His eyebrows lower sorrowfully, and even as he brings his staff into a ready position he speaks once more. "Put down the knife and immediately become a Buddha."

As my breath quickens, my pulse thuds in my ears. The overlap becomes stronger, the second scene before my eyes clearer with the increased memory-resonance.

Blood all around as I kneel on the floor, shaking. A different man walks toward me, smirking. Calm, complacent. In the corner of my eye, the last fragments of my attention that haven't descended into gibbering terror or despair are fixed on a small butter knife, fallen under the table.

In front of me in the present, a man with a staff running towards me. Once more, "Put down the knife and immediately become a Buddha!".

In front of me in the past, a man with a cruel smile walking towards me. "The sea of bitterness has no end; turn back to the shore." He's telling me to give up.

In my ear, or maybe in my mind's ear, in the past, a whisper--a scattered thought that I cannot yet call my own-- "He's going to kill you. PICK UP THE KNIFE!"

​

I'm terrified, as I was back then. The man in front me of me now is also quite a bit stronger than the one back then. But... the knife in my hand is also quite a bit sharper.
