  Alternately, perhaps you can persuade your employer to allow you to work from home one day a week?

even in peak pandemic social distancing, we were only allowed to work from home 50% of the time. I'm honestly surprised we were ever allowed to work from home /at all/. My industry is unfortunately impossible. Even if we pretend I was allowed to work from home, during non-pandemic times I would need to have a dedicated room in my house that I only use for working, which I don't have the space for.

And yeah, one day I woke up at 5:10, just completely randomly and couldn't go back to sleep, so I went for a run before my morning routine and going to work. I think the way to actually keep it would be to have a beeminder goal and then I'd have to do it after work sometimes like I do with my reading goals now
