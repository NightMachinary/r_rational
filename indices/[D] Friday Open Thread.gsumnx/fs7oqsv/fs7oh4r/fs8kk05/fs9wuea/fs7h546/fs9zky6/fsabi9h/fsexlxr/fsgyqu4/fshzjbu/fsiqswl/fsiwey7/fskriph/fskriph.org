Yeah, we closed our international borders in mid-march and our state borders a few weeks after that after it became clear that cases were entering our state from others. Now we have mandatory hotel quarantine for all new arrivals, and that's where all our new cases are coming from (and a live export ship from the UAE, but that is hopefully going to remain contained fingers crossed)
