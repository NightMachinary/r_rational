I'm not entirely sure what parkour is (I mean, I know it's basically jumping over shit, but the details escape me), but it seems to me that it was invented for running through cities, wasn't it?

Regardless, hopefully you're moving somewhere with a park relatively nearby, because I bet you the jog would be a great warm-up!
