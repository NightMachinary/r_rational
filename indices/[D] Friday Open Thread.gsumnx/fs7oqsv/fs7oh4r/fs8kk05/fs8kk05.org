I'm trying out a mid-year NaNoWriMo.

...

I'm two days in, and what I've written so far isn't particularly rational, though it is mainly in the direction of hard SF. I'm mainly writing it to get into the habit of writing, rather than to try for quality; I expect that what I end up with is actually going to be terrible. And I'm okay with that.

With work and some luck, after about a month, I'll have gotten enough of a routine ingrained to start focusing on quality rather than quantity.

If you're masochistic enough to want to see what I'm writing as I write, send me a private note, and I'll send you a link to the GDoc.
