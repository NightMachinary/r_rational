I think this is a really interesting idea. I've always thought that MCs stumbling into powerful or overpowered builds is absurdly lucky. You show up in a new world and single handedly outsmart everyone at the system they all Iive their lives by. It's the equivalent of a modern person sent to medieval times becoming the best swordsman in the world by luck, but even worse. Having them reset their levels/build to exploit or fix past mistakes would be much more realistic and entertaining.
