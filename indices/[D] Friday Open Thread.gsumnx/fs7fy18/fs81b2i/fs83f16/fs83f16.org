I don't remember when it was, maybe like 6 months or a year ago, and I don't remember if it was on here or on [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]], but he made a post and there was a long discussion there between him and me and somebody else on the topic of whether or not Smack-works is schizophrenic, and apparently Smack-works's native language is Russian, and the other guy spoke Russian as well, and after that other guy had a conversation with Smack-works in Russian he said that Smack-works sounded totally coherent and didn't sound crazy at all. So I think it just sounds like schizophrenia because he's not as good with English as he thinks he is.

But yes, I also think it's strange that his posts on other subreddits have gotten responses so different from the responses to the posts he made over here in this neck of the woods. Maybe it's because he didn't come out of the gate telling the people on those other subreddits that he's smarter than all of them combined and that their worldview is stupid, like he did here.
