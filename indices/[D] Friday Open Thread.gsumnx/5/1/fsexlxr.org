[[/runningdashie][]] I have it on good authority that one potential solution to the running dilemma is to do said running at around five or six in the morning, /before/ going to work.

Alternately, perhaps you can persuade your employer to allow you to work from home one day a week? Make your day a Wednesday, and you can run on weekends and in the midweek.
