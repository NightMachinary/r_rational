...congratulations!

Yeah, being isolated is good at the moment. Here, we're somewhat isolated, but we have - no, wait. Wrong word. We /had/ a bustling tourist industry, for people to visit our beaches and stuff, and apparently enough of the virus got into the country that it started spreading, and despite a very firm lockdown it /still/ hasn't stopped yet. We've got about twenty times your number of people, and our known infections (in a per-person count) are already about three times what you've just claimed - though a smidge over half of those have now recovered.
