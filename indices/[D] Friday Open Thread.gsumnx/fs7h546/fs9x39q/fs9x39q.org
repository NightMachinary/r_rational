LW has RSS feeds which only output posts which have passed certain karma bars; I believe they have 30, 50, 70, and 90. This filters out the dreck and would get you a sample of 'what LW considers good ATM', which is probably far more useful for seeing if it's to your taste than a random frontpage sample.
