Welcome! We're all a little crazy here, but don't get intimidated.

Also, if you liked The Metropolitan Man (and BotToT and ABSoW), you'll probably like Alexander Wales' other works. I recommend The Dark Wizard of Donkerk in particular.

Also, Wildbow's works (Worm, Pact, Twig, Ward, Pale), are very popular. They're more divisive though: the story is usually less focused on decision-making than most works here, the pacing is really intense and chaotic, and it gets really dark. Also, they're really long.
