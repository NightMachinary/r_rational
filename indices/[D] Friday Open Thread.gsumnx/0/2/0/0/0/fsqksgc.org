  I didn't say anything that wasn't true, what part of my comment is objectionable?
#+end_quote

The part where you made it with a clear intent to poison the well. "Here's a new dude who loves it here, I better try and make them think it's an unmoderated wasteland." I assume you did so as an attempt to scare them off, which you could then hold up as an example of our Deplorable Methods driving away Innocent Redditors.

If that was /not/ your intent, then you're here to whine where people can see you without any actual goals in mind, which is just as annoying.

  Clearly the community hasn't done a splendid job if they don't select things a part of the community wants.
#+end_quote

You can't please everyone (case in point: you). You can however do pretty good enough for the overwhelming majority, which I think has been done. I'm not sure what the word "splendid" is supposed to mean if not that.

  as I said, a community will also select for porn but that doesn't mean that all subs should allow porn
#+end_quote

You bring up porn a lot, and yet... /gestures at the front page/ you'll notice that [[/r/rational]] is not full of porn. Somehow, someway, the system in place is working, with very minimal removals on our part.

Maybe at some point just decide it's okay for other people to like Chili and the Chocolate Factory when you don't.
