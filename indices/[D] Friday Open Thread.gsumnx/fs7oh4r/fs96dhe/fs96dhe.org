I read a D&D-inspired story (in French and not particularly rational) in which a character got regularly level-drained by vampires so she could grind levels at a less steep area of the XP curve. Later she got all the drained levels back with Greater Restoration and jumped straight to epic.

(Probably doesn't work in the real game. Then again it was 3.0 so who knows.)
