Something I'd like to see in a rational fic, especially a LitRPG, is situations where characters intentionally weaken themselves for a long period in order to become stronger later on. I don't mean "my build isn't good now, but wait until I hit level 50!" cases where their power growth is exponential so it seems slow at first. Instead, I mean cases where they become weaker than they were. Where a graph of their power level over time would look more like a roller coaster than an incline, albeit one where they eventually end up higher than they started. The characters only getting more powerful can be monotonous, and this could allow them to revisit old monsters with their new knowledge. Then the characters can beat the monsters via knowledge/experience, rather than higher damage, and the reward could still be meaningful.

One idea I've thought of that would allow this in a satisfying manner would be "prestiging", where the character sacrifices some of their abilities/stats/power/level/whatever in exchange for a theoretically higher growth rate or power cap, or a rarer ability. This would also allow them to get rid of abilities that the character never/rarely uses. After all, how many characters get an ability in chapter 10, use it for 3 chapters, get a better ability in chapter 13, and never use the first one again? This would allow for a rational explanation of this behavior: they traded up. Maybe they sacrifice their high level fire skills and ice skills for a low level temperature control skill, that, once leveled up, is more versatile or faster or something. Maybe this is how hybrid skills are created in that universe?

Anyway, if there are stories with this element already, please let me know.
