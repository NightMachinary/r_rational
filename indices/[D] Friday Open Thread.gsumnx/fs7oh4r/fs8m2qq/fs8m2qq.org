For a less hard power growth, maybe reincarnation could work if you kept your memory. Start cult martyr yourself but spread idea of chosen one, over several life times work within cult to build it up and keep the idea of the chosen one consistent but dont push for a ton of power expect for the spiritual, and then when the cult is a large part of the population follow all of the things needed to be consider the chosen and get declared god-emperor by the cult then conqueror the world.
