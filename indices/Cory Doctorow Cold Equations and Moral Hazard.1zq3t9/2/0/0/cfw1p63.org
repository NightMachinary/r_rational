There are four tactics I can take as the experimenter.

First: "All right, you've sacked the city council and the safety commission and the managers at Thought Robotics who decided to cut the safety features, and you've installed solid, trustworthy people in their place. How are you dealing with the effects of their blatant negligence vis the trolley that is even now bearing down on several innocent people?"

Second: "What steps are you currently taking to ensure safety and survival for all other humans? They must be pretty stupendous to give you no opportunity to experience a situation with suboptimal safety measures."

Third: "Safety measures sufficient to prevent this situation have been proposed and analyzed. They proved too expensive to justify their cost. We put our limited funds into more efficient life-saving measures. This analysis is unchanged considering the current situation."

The final one would be to construct a thought experiment that can't be countered by better safety features -- maybe a freak landslide in an area that had never experienced them before, where you can block one path to divert the flow from a house occupied by several people to a house occupied by only one.
