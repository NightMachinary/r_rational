Hold on. We're about to stop having a /real/ discussion.

Yes, being a spiteful asshole to a philosopher who's /trying/ to conduct a thought experiment is jerkish. The problem is, real people's answers in these thought experiments are often inconsistent /not only/ because of personal irrationality but because the bisected options of the dilemmas often represent /mere fractions/ of a real person's moral system. All kinds of matters of context can play into whether a given real person's "should function" says to act utilitarian, or deontological, or virtuous, or Kantian, or even (yes) sociopathically selfish in a particular situation.

Framing effects and priming can bias us one way or the other, of course, but the issue remains that none of these "fractional" ethical codes can form a consistent /and/ complete moral system without at least partially encoding the others. The thought experiment is cleaving at the wrong joint, IMO.
