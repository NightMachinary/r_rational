Since you don't wish to argue, I'll just quickly address your points for any others reading.

1. The barrier to entry is far higher with an existing state, including not only the costs that would be required in a free market, but regulatory compliance, property taxes, and a business model that can compete with a perceived 'free' good.

2. No, it's not a fully free market, such a thing currently does not exist. That does not indicate such a thing is not possible.

3. Audits are funded by either business associations (BBB), or concerned third parties.

4. Pollution is dealt with though the mentioned liability, decreased firm size due to dis-economies of scale no longer being subsidized by the state, and private conservation groups such as the Sierra Club.

5. Police, fire, etc, are generally local maters, handled by local taxes. I only covered the federal portion, which pays for most entitlement programs and all warfare.

6. I'll examine the book when time presents itself.

7. Moral positions tend to be difficult to argue, and get simplified in discussions such as this. It can make it look black and white.
