  Do you mean that you derive some nonmoral satisfaction from helping others which you are affected by more greatly than by the separate "purer" value of helping others?

I think we're confusing definitions. I was using the Objectivist (as I understand the philosophy) definition of altruism of acting in the interest of others without any kind of regard to the interests of the self. I help others because it satisfies my morality.

My argument would be more "The government lacks the ability to implement social democracy, as it is oligarchical by design"
