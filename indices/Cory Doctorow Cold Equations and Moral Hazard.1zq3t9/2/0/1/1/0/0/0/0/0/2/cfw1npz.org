  If I give to the poor it is because I want the satisfaction of helping others, and doing so gives me that satisfaction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/20/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]["I couldn't /act/ on moral considerations if they lacked the power to move me!"]] Do you mean that you derive some nonmoral satisfaction from helping others which you are affected by more greatly than by the separate "purer" value of helping others?

  I think the altruism that actually is evil is not the giving of charity to others, but the taking of resources from one and giving to another under the guise of altruism. Government welfare, for example, is the taking of money mostly from middle class people, and giving it to poor people. Rich people are mostly unaffected by government action because they have already purchased the politicians, or can hire the correct lawyers and accountants to get around the rules.

That's an Argument By Cynicism: "the government hasn't implemented social democracy /properly/, thus social democracy is evil."
