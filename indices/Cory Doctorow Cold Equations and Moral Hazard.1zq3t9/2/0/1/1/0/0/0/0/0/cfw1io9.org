Well, it sounds like we agree on a lot. Marx' analysis of the behavior of markets is fairly sound, but in my opinion misses the confounder that is the state operating on the behalf of established market entities against upcoming market entities. This state action would tend to concentrate market power in the hands of first movers, because they aren't subjected to the competition of the new entrants to the market. This power disparity causes many of the ills of capitalism as practiced today.

Property is also problematic, as different people grant title in different ways. I tend toward a Lockeian/Rothbardian method whereby those who first claim and use a property are its rightful owners, but that is backed up with the expectation that the property will be used. If a property is left abandoned it will revert to an unowned state, allowing new owners to claim it in the same manner as it should have been originally claimed.

A quick example. Suppose a factory closes down, but the facility is not sold. After some years, squatters move in and begin using the equipment and space for their own purposes. After a few more years, the original factory owner appears and demands the removal of the squatters. I would side with the squatters, as the property had been abandoned, and the squatters have laid claim to it through work and improvement

I disagree with the Objectivist "altruism is evil" stance, but would say that few, if any people act in a purely altruistic manner. If I give to the poor it is because I want the satisfaction of helping others, and doing so gives me that satisfaction. I think the altruism that actually is evil is not the giving of charity to others, but the taking of resources from one and giving to another under the guise of altruism. Government welfare, for example, is the taking of money mostly from middle class people, and giving it to poor people. Rich people are mostly unaffected by government action because they have already purchased the politicians, or can hire the correct lawyers and accountants to get around the rules.
