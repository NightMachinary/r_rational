Jumping in to point out an inconsistency:

  I think the altruism that actually is evil is not the giving of charity to others, but the taking of resources from one and giving to another under the guise of altruism.

Sure, unless those resources were unfairly distributed in the first place, right? This of course brings the discussion into a wider one of what "fair distribution of resources" looks like, but the point is it's far less simple than equating taxes with theft: if I make millions of dollars a year in large part because of an existing infrastructure that turned my unique skills and hard work into profit, then I owe quite a lot to that infrastructure: far more than someone who merely makes a few hundred thousand, who in turn owes far more than someone who makes a few tens of thousands.

  Government welfare, for example, is the taking of money mostly from middle class people, and giving it to poor people. Rich people are mostly unaffected by government action because they have already purchased the politicians, or can hire the correct lawyers and accountants to get around the rules.

So you would support the welfare more if corruption was combated more heavily and the taxes to pay for it came more from the rich? Because I think most people who understand the fallacy of supply-side-economics would agree with you that it's better that the rich shoulder a heavier tax burden than the middle class, and that our goal therefor should be to remove corruption, not end taxation/welfare.
