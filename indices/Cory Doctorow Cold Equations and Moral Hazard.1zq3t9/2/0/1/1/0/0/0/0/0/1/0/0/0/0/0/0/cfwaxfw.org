  So these things can be provided competitively/privately.
#+end_quote

The question wasn't whether a private interest can supply them: it as whether they can be provided on a competitive basis. If you don't like one private interest's road, the tolls they set or the level of quality they keep, it's not exactly a low barrier of entry to make your own road.

And that privately constructed dam doesn't exist in a purely free-market environment: it follows regulations, it complies with government standards. The environmental impacts of the dam weren't even understood when it was built: put all such constructions in the hands of competing private interests and the resulting cascade of effects is even harder to account for.

  Actually, if I want real security for my property, the best thing I can do is remove poverty. Crime is an effect of poverty. So any organization competing for my money to prevent crime is going to have to address poverty as part of its plan. This may mean either making significant monetary contributions to alleviate poverty, or providing low cost patrols in impoverished areas.
#+end_quote

Once again, congratulations in realizing this: the vast majority of people take the "screw you, I got mine" approach and simply buy big walls and lots of guards. If that were the predominant form of security enforcement, we'd basically be reverting back to the age of fiefdoms and castles.

  Not values I share either. Yet another thing a justice provider is going to have to do to get my business is prove that they aren't favoring the wealthy over the poor. This means third party audits and a focus on a reputation for justice.
#+end_quote

Third party auditors that are funded how, exactly?

  I've been an anarchist a while now, I've seen many flaws of such a system, and adequate addressing of each for me. If you care to cite specifics, I'll be happy to address them myself for you.
#+end_quote

Ah shit, I was hoping you were just a form of libertarian. Nothing personal, but I've long since tired of arguing such matters with anarchists: there's a chance you're more logical and evidence-based in your ideology than they all were, but a very small one, and it's just not worth the time investment for me to find out : /

As shown in your posts so far, the results seem predictably the same as past experiences: you're satisfied with your ideology because you presume everyone is a virtuous, educated rational actor. They're not. So as noted, it's kind of like talking to a communist about how their theories don't quite work in the real world.

I'll give you a chance to change my mind though, as is only fair. How does your hypothetical system deal with environmental protection?

From what I've seen, this is an area libertarians consistently fail to address, and is one of the major things that eventually made me stop considering myself one.

The basic idea I have of how libertarians/anarchists deal with pollution is that, with strong private property laws, individuals or companies that damage the environment will respond to litigation, so this litigation should in theory make up for the damages the companies do and deter future incidents.

Unfortunately, ecology is such a fantastically complex system that proving simple cause-and-effect responsibility from a private interest to an environmental issue is often impossible in a realistic time-frame to halt or address the behavior. And that's assuming enough funding could be provided to even investigate the cause-and-effect of a particular natural disaster or damage of pollution, especially if those affected are too poor.

What's worse, no change in limits on retaliatory litigation could make up for permanent damages to health or ecology. In many cases, private interests simply don't have nearly enough money to make up for all the damage their actions might do, even assuming the problem can even be fixed by money, and that they're made to pay for it in the first place.

As an example, if I start a company whose actions begin poisoning a river or lake (on my property) that feeds an aquifer three towns over, but the effects of it aren't realized or traced back for decades after I've already made my money and liquidated the company, even if my middle-men get dragged to court and our army of lawyers fails to prevent a guilty verdict, all the millions we lose will not undo the damage to the children born with leukemia as a result of those chemicals.

  I've already address roads above, but I'll ask you this, if nobody is going to these "isolated towns and locations" then why would roads be needed to go there?
#+end_quote

"Few people" =/= "nobody." The value society gets from making sure the barrier of travel is as low as possible far exceeds the incredibly minor portion of its taxes that go to roads.

  On average Americans give about 5% $135.8 billion of their household income to charity, after paying an average of 17% federal, 2009 in taxes. I'd be willing to bet the charity rate increases when people are not taxed, and thus have more disposable income.
#+end_quote

In your magical scenario where people are suddenly free from the shackles of taxes, but aren't now having to pick up the slack of what those taxes used to pay for for their personal security, roads, fire stations, mail services, medical services, education, etc, etc, sure :) Too bad that's not how reality works.

  Other countries do things differently, and I don't know them as well as I know how the United States government does things, but that doesn't change the nature of government.
#+end_quote

You must recognize that this is a belief utterly lacking in massive amounts of data and alternate perspectives, as you yourself admit. May I humbly suggest you educate yourself, maybe even travel and talk with citizens of other nations, before jumping to such broad generalizations?

  It is a privileged group of people who are able to enact violence on others.
#+end_quote

Careful, your bias is showing. "Able to enact violence on others" implies no accountability or oversight or consequences. Your perspective of government is pretty skewed indeed if you're basing it entirely on all the worst case scenarios and practices, and ignoring all the cases in which centralized authority deters and prevents harm. There are a number of studies and books on this: may I recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115][The Better Angels of Our Nature?]]

  Since a large part of my morality states that it is never appropriate to initiate violence against another sentient being, I view government as immoral at its foundation, so how the violence is arranged is of little consequence to me.
#+end_quote

And this is why I said above that I've tired of debate with anarchists: when so much of your worldview is based on black and whites, there's little room for reason, let alone honest debate.
