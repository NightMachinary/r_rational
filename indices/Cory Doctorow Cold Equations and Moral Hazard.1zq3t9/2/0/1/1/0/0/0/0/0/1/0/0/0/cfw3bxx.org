All those things (infrastructure, charity, police) can be provided on a competitive basis. There's no need for the privileged group that can command payment for them. I want security from thieves, so I will pay for protection (hire security guards, insure my belongings). I want to travel places, so I will pay for roads that go to those places. I want the poor to have better chances in life, so I will contribute to charity. But because all those things are currently handled by a single entity, that entity cannot respond quickly to new market demands (like any monopoly), and provides a single point of failure for the corrupt to attack or infiltrate. Remove the monopoly and the incentives start to favor pleasing the public (customer) rather than the special interest (lobbyist).
