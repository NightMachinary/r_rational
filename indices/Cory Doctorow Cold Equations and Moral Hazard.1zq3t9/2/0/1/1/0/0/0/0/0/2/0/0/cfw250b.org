  I was using the Objectivist (as I understand the philosophy) definition of altruism of acting in the interest of others without any kind of regard to the interests of the self. I help others because it satisfies my morality.

In which case, since Objectivists are dissolving the distinction between morality and self-interest, they're making a non-statement by saying altruism is "wrong", because altruism is /definitionally impossible/ -- you /can't/ act without being moved by some concern of yours.

Mind, I'm sure the Objectivists would object (once again, no pun intended) that my tax-man's gun pointed at their head is a problematic concern for them to act on, but since they've already dissolved morality into self-interest I see no reason I shouldn't proceed to dissolve fear of superior military force into the same self-interest.

Or in other words, I question the coherency of a philosophy that collapses distinctions except when it doesn't. It appears rationalized to lead to certain policy conclusions.

  My argument would be more "The government lacks the ability to implement social democracy, as it is oligarchical by design"

Have you looked into left-anarchism, then?
