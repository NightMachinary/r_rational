Yes, being a spiteful asshole is bad, but informing the person conducting the experiment that you're aware of what is being studied alerts him that your input is less relevant to finding what the average person would do in a lifeboat/trolley situation, because if you can recognize the nature of the experiment, you likely have already considered the usual situations and determined your answer, rather than making a decision in the moment.
