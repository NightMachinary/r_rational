  Oh, resources are vastly unfairly distributed. In some ways, life is like that, in others, it was done quite on purpose. Fixing that is too large of a problem for a merely human intelligence, at least if you want it done quickly.

And where it was done on purpose is what we should be uniting on and combating. Ending gerrymandering, campaign finance reform, stricter lobbying laws... there are a number of ways the system can be reformed. If I have a brain tumor, I'm going to try to find a doctor who can cut it out, not ask someone to cut my head off.

  I don't think any system whereby one group can collect tax (take from others without their consent without penalty) can be freed of corruption. I want to eliminate the privileged group. That takes out both the taxes, and the corruption.

"Without their consent?" I'm pretty sure that by continuing to live in and benefit from infrastructure and citizenship in a country that explicitly states its tax laws, the consent is there. I've never understood the perspective that rejects the social contract: would they prefer a government agent knock on their door at the age of 18 and ask them to sign an agreement to pay taxes or forfeit citizenship? Because claiming that people don't consent to pay taxes is pretty silly when they're more than happy to reap all the benefits those taxes go to pay for, but just object to a few that they can't immediately recognize as benefiting them (less people starving on the streets = less crime and disease = less overworked hospitals and police, etc).
