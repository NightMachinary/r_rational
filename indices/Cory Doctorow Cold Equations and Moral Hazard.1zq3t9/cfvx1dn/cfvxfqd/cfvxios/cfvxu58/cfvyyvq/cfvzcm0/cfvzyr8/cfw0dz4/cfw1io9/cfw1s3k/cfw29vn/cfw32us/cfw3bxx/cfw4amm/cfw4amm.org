  All those things (infrastructure, charity, police) can be provided on a competitive basis.

I'm sorry, but there's really no evidence for your beliefs here. It's as ideologically blind as communists who think that everything would just be honkey-dory if a centralized organization controlled EVERYTHING.

  I want security from thieves, so I will pay for protection (hire security guards, insure my belongings)
#+end_quote

Consigning the poor to living in ghettos of unprotected anarchy? You might joke it's already like that, but I hope you're smart enough to recognize what a massive oversimplification that is.

Not to mention making security and protection about who has the most resources, rather than even the pretense of justice. Sorry, not values I share.

And if you're extending your idea to a private justice system, please do some research on the myriad criticisms and flaws such an idea has :) I promise you, it's there. Remember: always search the falsifying data for your hypothesis.

  I want to travel places, so I will pay for roads that go to those places.
#+end_quote

It's rather convenient for you to say this in a world where roads already connect every house and store on a continent to one-another, but let's say you just mean money to maintain the roads you use: over time, what happens when everyone does this? Roads highly traveled are maintained, roads that aren't fall to decay, and now isolated towns and locations become even harder to travel to and get resources to or from. And that's just the beginning: do some research on what a privatized highway system would actually look like to understand just how massively unwieldy the idea is in practice.

  I want the poor to have better chances in life, so I will contribute to charity.
#+end_quote

Good for you. Most people won't. Most people /don't./ You think they suddenly will if the government steps out of it? History doesn't support your belief, nor do studies of areas with less public charity. This is another idealized fantasy of libertarians: once again, relying on the goodness of mankind, while criticizing communists for making the same fallacy.

  But because all those things are currently handled by a single entity, that entity cannot respond quickly to new market demands (like any monopoly), and provides a single point of failure for the corrupt to attack or infiltrate. Remove the monopoly and the incentives start to favor pleasing the public (customer) rather than the special interest (lobbyist).

Alternatively, study other systems and governments that are far more agile and adapt to different circumstances. The idea that "America hasnt' done it yet, therefor it can't be done" is pretty amusing to people who live in other countries that have already found a better balance of socialism and capitalism :)
