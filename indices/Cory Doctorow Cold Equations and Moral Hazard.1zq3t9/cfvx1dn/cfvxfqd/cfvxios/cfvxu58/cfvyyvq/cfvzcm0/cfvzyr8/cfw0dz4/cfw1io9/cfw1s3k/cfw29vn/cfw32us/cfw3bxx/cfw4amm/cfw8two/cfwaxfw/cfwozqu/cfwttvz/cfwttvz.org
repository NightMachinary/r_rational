  The barrier to entry is far higher with an existing state, including not only the costs that would be required in a free market, but regulatory compliance, property taxes, and a business model that can compete with a perceived 'free' good.

You're still ignoring that there is literally a limited amount of roads that can be constructed, even ignoring what a huge waste of real estate it would take to construct even TWO separate, parallel roads everywhere. It is the perfect example of a system that benefits from centralization, and that you cannot realize or admit this goes back to what I meant about ideology getting in the way of reason.

  No, it's not a fully free market, such a thing currently does not exist. That does not indicate such a thing is not possible.
#+end_quote

Whether it's possible or not isn't even the question: it's whether it's a net benefit to society to sacrifice some personal freedoms for optimization of health, safety and public freedoms.

And how our values are ranked are no doubt different, but if you believe that absolutely no diminishing of personal freedoms are acceptable, no matter the harm that results or tradeoff of benefits to other values, then see "absolutist ideology."

  Audits are funded by either business associations (BBB), or concerned third parties.

So just as open and vulnerable to corruption as our current system, but without the added check of public pressure. No thanks :)

Which does not deal with it at all

  and private conservation groups such as the Sierra Club.
#+end_quote

What power do you imagine private conservation groups have over a company polluting on their own private land, exactly?

All of which, as I mentioned, fails to show an understanding of ecology and pollution, let alone address how they would be dealt with.

Seriously, look into criticisms of libertarian/anarchy responses to environmental issues: aside from things like the aforementioned road system, it's one of the biggest glaring weaknesses of the worldview, and if a thorough understanding of the issue doesn't shake you from your ideology, nothing will. I've met a handful of libertarians honest enough to admit this weakness, who lump environmental regulation in with military as one of the few acceptable things for centralized authority, and I have far more respect for them than I do most that have simple faith that "free market solves all."

  Police, fire, etc, are generally local maters, handled by local taxes. I only covered the federal portion, which pays for most entitlement programs and all warfare.
#+end_quote

"Generally" being the massive oversimplification there: without organizations like the FEMA or FBI to help deal with issues that localized groups can't, you'll see the return of things like massively organized crime syndicates. What libertarians so often forget is that these organizations didn't form out of a naked power grab for more central authority: they were formed to adapt to the shortcomings of too much localized authority.
