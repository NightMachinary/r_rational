  Sure, unless those resources were unfairly distributed in the first place, right? This of course brings the discussion into a wider one of what "fair distribution of resources" looks like, but the point is it's far less simple than equating taxes with theft: if I make millions of dollars a year in large part because of an existing infrastructure that turned my unique skills and hard work into profit, then I owe quite a lot to that infrastructure: far more than someone who merely makes a few hundred thousand, who in turn owes far more than someone who makes a few tens of thousands.

Oh, resources are vastly unfairly distributed. In some ways, life is like that, in others, it was done quite on purpose. Fixing that is too large of a problem for a merely human intelligence, at least if you want it done quickly.

  So you would support the welfare more if corruption was combated more heavily and the taxes to pay for it came more from the rich? Because I think most people who understand the fallacy of supply-side-economics would agree with you that it's better that the rich shoulder a heavier tax burden than the middle class, and that our goal therefor should be to remove corruption, not end taxation/welfare.

I don't think any system whereby one group can collect tax (take from others without their consent without penalty) can be freed of corruption. I want to eliminate the privileged group. That takes out both the taxes, and the corruption.
