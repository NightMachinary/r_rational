Ok, let's unpack.

I believe the Marxian analysis of the behavior of capitalism is basically (if sometimes only /partially/) correct, based on the evidence I can see.

Because of this, when objectivists pass from basic humanism ("people are ends-in-themselves and can exercise rational thought if they work hard at it") to forming a deontological code of socioeconomic ethics ("private property is absolute, altruism is evil"), on one level I reject their ideology on value-diversity grounds ("objectivist deontology fails to capture all my values in its ruleset"), and on another I reject it on consequentialist grounds ("actual, factual capitalism has nasty consequences"). The latter is informed by my socialist beliefs, and the former by my reading of the Objectivist ideology.
