  I'm sorry, but there's really no evidence for your beliefs here. It's as ideologically blind as communists who think that everything would just be honkey-dory if a centralized organization controlled EVERYTHING.
#+end_quote

Evidence, huh?

Infrastructure:

Roads: [[http://northernnewenglandvillages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NH-Road-Marker-First-New-Hampshire-Turnpike.jpg][The First New Hampshire Turnpike]] built by private corporations. Now part of NH route 4

Dams: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Canyon_Dam][Hells Canyon Dam]] the worlds largest privately built dam.

Charity:

There are innumerable private charitable organizations, I'll not list them here.

Police: [[https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=private+security+companies&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8][Google search results]] for private security companies. Looks like quite a few to chose from.

So these things can be provided competitively/privately.

  Consigning the poor to living in ghettos of unprotected anarchy? You might joke it's already like that, but I hope you're smart enough to recognize what a massive oversimplification that is.
#+end_quote

Actually, if I want real security for my property, the best thing I can do is remove poverty. Crime is an effect of poverty. So any organization competing for my money to prevent crime is going to have to address poverty as part of its plan. This may mean either making significant monetary contributions to alleviate poverty, or providing low cost patrols in impoverished areas.

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention making security and protection about who has the most resources, rather than even the pretense of justice. Sorry, not values I share.
#+end_quote

Not values I share either. Yet another thing a justice provider is going to have to do to get my business is prove that they aren't favoring the wealthy over the poor. This means third party audits and a focus on a reputation for justice.

#+begin_quote
  And if you're extending your idea to a private justice system, please do some research on the myriad criticisms and flaws such an idea has :) I promise you, it's there. Remember: always search the falsifying data for your hypothesis.
#+end_quote

I've been an anarchist a while now, I've seen many flaws of such a system, and adequate addressing of each for me. If you care to cite specifics, I'll be happy to address them myself for you.

#+begin_quote
  It's rather convenient for you to say this in a world where roads already connect every house and store on a continent to one-another, but let's say you just mean money to maintain the roads you use: over time, what happens when everyone does this? Roads highly traveled are maintained, roads that aren't fall to decay, and now isolated towns and locations become even harder to travel to and get resources to or from. And that's just the beginning: do some research on what a privatized highway system would actually look like to understand just how massively unwieldy the idea is in practice.
#+end_quote

I've already address roads above, but I'll ask you this, if nobody is going to these "isolated towns and locations" then why would roads be needed to go there?

#+begin_quote
  Good for you. Most people won't. Most people don't. You think they suddenly will if the government steps out of it? History doesn't support your belief, nor do studies of areas with less public charity. This is another idealized fantasy of libertarians: once again, relying on the goodness of mankind, while criticizing communists for making the same fallacy.
#+end_quote

On average [[http://philanthropy.com/article/Interactive-How-America-Gives/133709/][Americans give about 5% /$135.8 billion/]] of their household income to charity, after paying an [[http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456][average of 17% /federal, 2009/]] in taxes. I'd be willing to bet the charity rate increases when people are not taxed, and thus have more disposable income.

  Alternatively, study other systems and governments that are far more agile and adapt to different circumstances. The idea that "America hasnt' done it yet, therefor it can't be done" is pretty amusing to people who live in other countries that have already found a better balance of socialism and capitalism :)
#+end_quote

Other countries do things differently, and I don't know them as well as I know how the United States government does things, but that doesn't change the nature of government. It is a privileged group of people who are able to enact violence on others. Since a large part of my morality states that it is never appropriate to initiate violence against another sentient being, I view government as immoral at its foundation, so how the violence is arranged is of little consequence to me.
