He writes as if the cold equations themselves, and the series of events that lead to a situation that cold equations are needed are the same thing. Since the series of events that lead to the situation is bad, he says cold equations are bad too. That's an unfair attack on cold equations.

  ‘‘The Cold Equations'' is moral hazard in action. It is a story designed to excuse the ship's operators...

Nonsense. Cold equations just tell you what to do when the mistakes have been made in order to avoid further mistakes. Ship's operators should still be punished for negligence.

Secondly, it's not only mistakes that lead to situations where cold equations are needed. What can an insurance company do other than using cold equations? Steal money from mafia bosses so they can pay for everyone? No, sometimes we have to use cold equations even when we've done everything right.
