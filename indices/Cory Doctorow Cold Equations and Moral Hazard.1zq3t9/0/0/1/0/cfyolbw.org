The point is that the situation as constructed in the book is incredibly contrived and unlikely in precisely such a way as to make Ender's actions both sympathetic and excusable.

To take a more relatable example, portraying scenarios in which applying cold logic dictates that you should torture someone in order to stop a ticking bomb a la 24 is dangerous. The events of this show are salient and come quickly to mind when we think about the use of torture, but they're also describing a situation that's incredibly rare. It repeatedly sets up incredibly unlikely situations to make the inexcusable excusable. I believe that this has materially affected the torture debate in America.

The "crush anything that threatens you" is totally a theme of Ender's Game. He kills every person he fights, and though he is never the aggressor, the explicit reasoning he gives for the ferocity of his violence is that he must be certain that the enemy not be able to retaliate.
