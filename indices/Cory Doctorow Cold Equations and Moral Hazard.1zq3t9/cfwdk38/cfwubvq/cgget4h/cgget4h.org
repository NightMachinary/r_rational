Hm. I read that Ender's Game essay... and while I agree with it in the context of this discussion (railroading characters with good intentions through contrived set-ups into doing bad things does not a good story make), the conclusion seems as much of a set up as the book itself. Sure, Ender and the officers might not be as rational in their judgments as OSC would like to present, but if they believe they are, and they are honestly pursuing the greater good to the best of their ability, the end result, whatever it is, doesn't make them immoral. Though it doesn't mean they aren't dangerously insane, either.

OSC might have failed to paint a sufficiently believable universe, but the questions it raises are very interesting to ponder, so I don't share the article author's apparent dislike for Ender's Game, even if I don't think it's as much of a masterpiece as [[/r/books]] seem to believe. I don't regret having read the book. Though I do see how some impressionable teenagers might get entirely the wrong things out of it...
