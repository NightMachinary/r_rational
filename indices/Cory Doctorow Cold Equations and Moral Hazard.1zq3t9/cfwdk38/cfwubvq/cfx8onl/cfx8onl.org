If Ender was a real character, who unknowingly committed genocide, yes I would think he's innocent (whether he should be punished for that or not is a different question). If reading Ender's Game creates in the readership an attitude more likely to excuse a person who unknowingly committed genocide, I see nothing wrong with that. If readers are stupid and come to think that this means genocide is okay, or people who commit genocide shouldn't be punished, that's their fault, not the writer's fault, or a fault of cold equations. From the linked article:

  But Ender's Game clearly conveys a “crush anything that threatens you” mindset.

I never got that impression. The whole thing was a mistake. There never was a necessity for genocide. The aliens were never going to attack us. They thought there was a cold equation to deal with when there was none. Just think about the money this ridiculous enterprise had cost them. In the movie they say 50 billion dollars. So they spent 50 billion dollars for nothing. It's a total waste. At the top of it they mass murdered a sentient race. How exactly did that story managed to convey the idea that you should crush anything that threatens you?

What's wrong with Atlas Shrugged is that it is just bad philosophy and even worse writing.
