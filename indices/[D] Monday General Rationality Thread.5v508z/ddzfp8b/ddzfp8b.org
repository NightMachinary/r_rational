I recently volunteered at a CFAR workshop! It was a great experience, and I'd be happy to answer any questions people have (feel free to PM me or email me at my reddit username @ gmail.com)

Also, I'm working a [[https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/02/18/ontologies-and-operating-systems-post-cfar-1/][blog series]] on how I changed my mind after the workshop, if anyone's interested.
