Weekly Monday Update

--------------

Sorry about missing last week's. I just know you all were so sad I didn't post. Anyway, for a board game recommendation you should play Shadow Hunters. It's a really fun game where you and your friends play as a Shadow Creature, a Hunter, or a Neutral player. Each player is given a private goal where they are supposed to either kill all shadows, all hunters, or a random other objective as a Neutral. It's like Mafia, except better.

This week, my story has been torn apart, and I've rewritten the first chapter. It's approximately 50% rewritten, and I've begun writing other chapters which interest me. By going ahead and writing the chapter out of order, I can more clearly define characters before we meet them, among other things like ensure that Chekov's arsenal is prepped and functional.

Rational Writing

--------------

If you choose to write a rationalist story, try not to be /too/ hamfisted or upfront with the ai discussion or the concepts. Sprinkle them throughout your story, don't let any one chapter become overburdened by it. General rule: ensure the plot progresses for 2/3 the wordcount of any given chapter, and the rationalist discussion is 1/3 the wordcount. In fact, it's best to have a quick lesson, then have the character explore the idea a bit in their actions, and whether or not that character decides if the concept makes sense. Some of the weakest Rationalist chapters end up spending too much time discussing the rationalist section and not enough on the actual progression. If you want to raise the waterline, ensure the story itself doesn't get bogged down teaching.

The reason for this is suspension of disbelief. To keep your reader interested in your story, tricking them into learning, is to make sure the rationalist discussion does not overburden the reader.
