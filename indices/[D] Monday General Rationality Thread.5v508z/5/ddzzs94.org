[[http://www.gq.com/story/start-working-out-again-in-5-steps][This GQ article]] about fitness mirrors a lot of my thoughts on goal-oriented action and dealing with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia][akrasia]] in general. The focus on achievable steps, on methods over results, and creating circumstances that make working out an easier decision, etc, are good. This isn't a super good guide to getting in shape, but it's a good guide to use along with your plan to get in shape. Often, our enemy isn't determining the right thing to do, it's actually doing it--and practices like these help a lot.
