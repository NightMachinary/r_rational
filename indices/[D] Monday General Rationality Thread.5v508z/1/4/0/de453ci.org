  Doesn't Doctor Who fanfiction count against this point to some degree?
#+end_quote

The way I worded my original post, not necessarily. That is, I could make the argument that Doctor Who's lack of a single setting reduces the amount of fics it otherwise could have for a commensurately popular show with sci-fi themes, but at the same time, I notice that the TV show section tends to ignore that point more often than not regardless. So maybe I'm wrong on it, and it's merely that most stories /period/ stick to a single setting, so of course most large fandoms are about a story placed in a single setting.

And it would make sense that the TV show section contradicts my findings, if that's the case, because it's easier to establish setting visually than textually, and unlike in manga/anime, the setting doesn't have to be drawn.
