  then Dr. Who still has over 25% more words written than Buffy (assuming that non-romances have the same average length in each fandom, also still assuming that fanfiction.net is a representative sample).

Yes, but doctor who also has a larger fandom period. So independent of how conductive the setting it towards fanfiction, it's going to have a lot of it. I'm more concerned with, not exactly fanfics per capita, but something similar. For example, how Worm, despite being quite niche, has millions on millions of words of fanfiction, while a fandom like Eragon's is kind of dead, in relation to the total number of people who've read about it.
