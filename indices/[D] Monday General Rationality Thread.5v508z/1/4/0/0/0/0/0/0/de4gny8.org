Hmmm. Kind of 'fanfictions per fan', it sounds like.

But there's a lot more to consider here than merely how good the /original/ setting is. A well-written and popular fanfiction might in turn spawn recursive fanfictions of its own, which are by their nature also fanfics of the original setting. And then there's the matter of infrastructure - a fandom that produces its own place for its own fanfics, and celebrates them, will have more than one that does not.

None of these factors have anything to do with the original setting, yet they can make very significant differences.
