  Thaaaat's gonna be a very difficult position to defend. When I look at fanfiction.net (which I'm assuming carries a representative smaple of fanfics) I see that Dr. Who is the third-most popular TV show on the site - and the most popular when it comes to crossovers (which doesn't surprise me in the least, the TARDIS' ability to go any place, any time makes it ridiculously easy to start a crossover).

Checked versus buffy the vampire slayer, 49% of Doctor Who's fanfics have a "romance" tag, while 41% of Buffy the vampire slayer's fics have that tag. That statistic alone is pretty meaningless, especially considering the different demographics that care about them, but if I were to try and defend that statement, it would be by looking at other female-dominated fandoms about shows with significant action elements, then comparing their rates of romance fics to Doctor Who's. Then comparing the average lengths of romance fics to non-romance fics.

If I'm right, I'd expect to see that Doctor who has more romance fics than similar fandoms based around a show with a single setting, and that romance fics, on average, tend to be shorter than non-romance fics.

So at least my prediction is, in theory, testable.

But I'm not going to test that prediction because honestly, yeah-- the other explanation is probably better.
