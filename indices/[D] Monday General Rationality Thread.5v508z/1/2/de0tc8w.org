I rather liked an article I came across once, which claimed that there are ten types of fanfiction...and, in the context of your query, I would assume there could be individual reasons prompting each type for any given fandom.

- Recontextualization - storylines that were not included in the original text

- Timeline Expansion - prequels or sequels

- Refocalization - stories about characters that weren't discussed in length in the original text

- Moral Realignment - a change in the view of who is the hero and villain

- Genre Shift - changing the genres of the original text

- Crossover - placing the character of one story into the world of another

- Character Dislocation - a radical change in personality and/or history of a character

- Personalization - placing of the author / original characters inside the story

- Emotional Intensification - focusing on extremely emotional moments

- Eroticization - inserting romantic and sexual elements in the original text
