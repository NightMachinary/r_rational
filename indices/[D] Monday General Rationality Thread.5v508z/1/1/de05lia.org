Another element, although this might just be spacebattles that really pushed it heavily, is when the plotline has some extremely easy point of divergence that allows fanfic writers to easily come up with and run with a premise (often going through stations of canon in the process).

The two purest examples of this are: Familiar of Zero, where Louise summons alternate familiars, either self-inserts/OCs, or more commonly crossover characters, for a low-effort crossover fanfic. Worm, where Taylor has alternate power sets, the power sets being something along the lines of "this idea sounds cool for a power", or a pseudo-crossover where the power is lifted out of another setting. The simplicity yet potential for variability spawned a huge number of fanfics, although again, it might just be spacebattles and the format/audience it provides.

For a more moderate example, Harry raised by alternative guardians is a common formula. There is Harry raised by the Lovegoods, Harry raised by Sirius Black, Harry raised by goblins, etc. HPMOR falls into this formula at first glance with Harry raised by a scientist. This formula also allows crossovers, with Harry raised by the Adams Family, Harry raised by Tony Stark, Harry raised by Deadpool, Harry raised by a blackened denarius fallen angel, etc.

So yeah, easy premise that allows the fanfic author to run through stations of canon while putting their own crossover or OC twist on things is a popular formula that leads to heavy propagation of fanfic, however often at the expense of quality.
