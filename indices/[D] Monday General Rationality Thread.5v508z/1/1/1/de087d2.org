I actually deliberately didn't include this, because it's not a good predictor of whether there are many fics in the fandom. If enough people write in a fandom, eventually they'll figure out a good point of divergence, which due to overuse will then appear obvious. And on the flipside, regardless of how good a POD exists in a work, it won't directly inspire new fiction unless people are already writing in a fandom.

The reason easily-available POD's /look/ like they inspire fanfiction is really because of a larger phenomena-- works that keep up suspense, and have momentous events that have significant effects tend to be more popular.
