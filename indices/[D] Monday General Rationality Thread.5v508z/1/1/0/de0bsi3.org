I'd argue that, while it's clear that these 'obvious divergence' fics tend to be of low quality, the number of high-quality stories does not decrease noticeably. The /average/ story quality will fall due to the bloating of the lower tiers with low-effort 'obvious divergence' fics, but the gems will still have been written.

Another example demographic that I've seen for this is the Pokemon fandom, with an obvious divergence of Ash having a different starter. Now, even though 'Ash gets a different starter than Pikachu' has been done to death and out the other side into a shambling perpetual zombie-state, the top fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul][The Sun Soul]] weren't prevented from happening, and it is my expectation that there are few other potential high-quality fics that didn't happen solely because of the 'different starter' zombie premise.

Pokemon's case also leads me to another idea about fanfiction writing: catharsis-fics. For when the consumer of the canon work sees something /obviously/ wrong, and it bugs them, so they want to see a version of the world where that wrong thing doesn't happen, and they go write it themselves. In Pokemon, for example, Ash is an idiot in canon. Any kid who's played the games can tell you most things Ash does in battle make no sense whatsoever, and while that's likely the point, to make the average ten year old feel like they know what Ash should be doing instead, it leads to pent-up frustration over the years.

So, alongside the zombie premise of Ash's different starter, and with /heavy/ overlap with that premise, you have fics explicitly about making Ash smarter than his canon version, for the sake of him being smarter and not doing those dumb things. Popular examples include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095222/1/The-Chosen-One-s-Journey][The Chosen One's Journey]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8033836/1/COTCHO-PM-Permanent-Hiatus][Chronicles of the Chosen One: Pokemon Master]]. An uncharitable critique of these fics would say that they're just inanely repeating Ash's journey with him as a Gary Stu with no coherent story structure or plan except for making Ash look as cool and heroic as he did when you were six. More fairly, the stories /are/ unfocused and mostly repeating canon with their premise's filter applied, but they can still be an enjoyable read if you're willing to not think too much, and especially if you're fed up with canon Ash being an idiot and just want to see him succeed where it matters for once. The peculiar kind of support for these catharsis-fics is somewhat evident in how, despite their debatable quality as stories, the two linked stories hold more favourites on fanfiction.net than the two 'gems' I linked earlier, though all four are clearly at the top of the favourites heap no matter how you look at it.

In short (and I apologize for this being so long), whether or not a franchise inspires more low-quality fics than others, I expect the number of gems will remain effectively constant, and that another motive for low-quality fics is the catharsis of correcting something frustrating from canon, a concept which can easily gain enough support by similarly-frustrated people to rival the top-quality fics in popularity.
