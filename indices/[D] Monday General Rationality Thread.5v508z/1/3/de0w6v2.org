I would argue against location being a /major/ influence, but will expect it to have some positive effect. Most city locations like Konohagakure, Brockton Bay and Ankh-Morpork usually are mostly made up of different 'that place where that character lives/works'. I do admit having a character sit around next to the big lake, or on top of the hokage monument adds some flavor, but usually it's mostly window dressing.

Instead of physical location settings, I assume the strongest motivational element is the thematic setting or worldbuilding. For example I'd say the most common location in Naruto fics is up a tree, which is more a character attribute than a specific location. HP has magic, Naruto ninjutsu, Worm has superpowers; it allows writers to think about what else would be possible in this world. This might have already been implied by your post however.
