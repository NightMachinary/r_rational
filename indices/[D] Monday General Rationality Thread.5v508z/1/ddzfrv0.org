So I've been thinking about what inspires people to write fanfiction about a work. Aside from the obvious (be popular, appeal strongly to a demographic, have interesting characters, etc.) I think I've figured out two more important elements.

Namely,

- The work should have some sort of primary setting, where the characters return to continuously, as opposed to being an epic where characters journey across a number of different places.

For example, HP has hogwarts, Naruto has konoha, Twilight has Forks, +I'm pretty sure Supernatural is set in a single area+, etc.

- There should be a variety of semi-independent sub-conflicts such that the outcome of the story doesn't wholly hinge on the outcome of the conflict.

This is extremely common so I won't bother listing examples. It's really more useful as an exclusionary factor-- works that bank highly on moment-to-moment suspense and reveals are much more difficult to write fanfiction about.
