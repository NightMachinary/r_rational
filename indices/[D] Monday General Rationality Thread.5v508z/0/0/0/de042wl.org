Yeah, but practically the only lethal threats to a reasonably competent immortal would be those which are existential to humanity, which might actually make them loom larger in their assessment of threats. It also seems like an immortal timescale would make the rapid growth of machine intelligence seem a lot more dramatic and make its logical conclusion a more pressing question.

But then, I can see it either way. The War to End All Wars didn't, the Nuclear threat went off with a fizzle rather than a bang...might get a little desensitizing after a while.
