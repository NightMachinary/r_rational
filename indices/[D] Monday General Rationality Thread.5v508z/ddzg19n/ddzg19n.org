My girlfriend and I were talking last night about a few fiction tropes and their real-life implications. Immortality, especially in the context of Vampires, is interesting. Would somebody born hundreds of years ago take the risk posed by unfriendly AI seriously, or would they be too jaded by all the previous existential false alarms? I tend to think modern computer technology would be a more convincing threat to them, not least because greater interconnectedness and machine learning would be a major threat to their ability to stay hidden amongst the population at large.

Ultimately, I don't think the story of a modern Vampire would be about creeping on highschoolers or their war with the werewolves or whatever. I think it would be about the net tightening around them as technology makes the humans more and more of a threat.
