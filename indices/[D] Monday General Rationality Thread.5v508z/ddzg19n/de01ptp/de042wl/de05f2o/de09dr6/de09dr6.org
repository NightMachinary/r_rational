Which leads to some other interesting questions about immortality--most pertinently, would immortals be luddites? The stereotype is that older people are less good with technology, but if true, why so?

I think it comes down to how much being set in your ways is a neurochemical thing vs. an emergent property of experience. If a young, hip beatnik from the early '50s had their biological and neurochemical aging switched off, would they now be a young, hip millennial or would they be a cantankerous, ultraconservative octogenarian in the body of a 20 year old? How much is adaptability and neuroplasticity a property of the brain and how much is just a result of lacking experience?

If experience per se is the enemy of mental flexibility, then our vampire would likely be a Luddite--but if it's due more to the biological aging of the brain, then I'd expect them to be more tech-savvy than the general population, not less.

If you've been 26 since 1840, you've had 201 years to master and get bored with anything new that you found remotely appealing. If you've had 201 years to apply a 130 IQ and aren't independently wealthy, you've screwed up somewhere, so the allure of novelty and the leisure time to pursue it should both be abundant. I could envision a Luddite vampire even in these conditions, but I don't think it would be particularly more likely than the inverse.

Also, if we're talking a fairly standard-issue vampire, who tend to be stronger, faster and more durable than a baseline human, with 200 years of experience and a top 2.5% IQ with which to apply it, I don't think they'd be all that susceptible to non-existential threats. Hell, natural selection alone means they're either sufficiently competent to have survived that long in the face of their Achilles' heels or uncommonly lucky.

So, you've survived a few dozen close shaves with sunrise and at least 3 wannabe Van Helsings, not to mention having to flee the entire Western hemisphere for a few decades until people naturally started assuming that whatever serial killer had targeted all those accordionists /must've/ died of old age--what're you really afraid of? They've got SPF 50 sunblock now, so even UV isn't the threat it once was, and since the decline of polka's popularity people's primary reaction to the mysterious disappearance of an avid accordionist is /relief/. Really, there aren't many threats left. Social upheaval just makes it easier to fade into the background. Any pandemic that doesn't kill off 100% of humanity falls under the category of social upheaval, since vampires are generally disease proof. Even nuclear warfare isn't that scary--sure, you couldn't survive a ground-zero impact, and acute radiation poisoning might be an issue, but if you were at all susceptible to cancer you wouldn't have made it 200 years, so light fallout probably isn't that big a deal. So...the biggest threat is probably all the bloodbags getting turned into paperclips.
