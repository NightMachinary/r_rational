It really does depend on how "reasonably competent" is defined. If we're talking HPMOR-style competent you could be right. On the other hand, if we take a vampire with an IQ of say, 130 or so (+2 Standard deviations, or top 2.5%), who doesn't often make dumb mistakes...I don't think existential threats are the only thing that can threaten him.

In addition, the rapid growth of machine intelligence only seems dramatic if you have a decent amount of knowledge about it. People who don't know much about computers (which includes a lot of older people, and our immortal is very old indeed) tend to underestimate just how much progress has been made, or don't see how better video game graphics and beating professionals at Go is such a big deal in the first place.

Thus, the vampire is faced with two technological threats. One of these, the difficulty of hiding from technology, is immediate, threatens the vampire personally, and the vampire can take actions to work against.

The other, an AI-explosion that threatens the whole world, is abstract, decades in the future, requires a lot of knowledge to appreciate, and there's little to nothing the vampire can do about it. The "decades in the future" thing is probably not a big deal on an immortal timeframe, but that's the only major advantage the vampire has when it comes to treating the threat seriously.

Just about anyone would pay far more attention to the first one. People pay more attention to what's close to them and what matters to them personally.
