  If I'm right, I'd expect to see that Doctor who has more romance fics than similar fandoms based around a show with a single setting, and that romance fics, on average, tend to be shorter than non-romance fics.

Not going to be enough to counter Dr. Who's massive total-number-of-fics advantage. Even if we assume that romances have an average length of zero (and they're clearly going to be longer than that), then Dr. Who still has over 25% more words written than Buffy (assuming that non-romances have the same average length in each fandom, also still assuming that fanfiction.net is a representative sample).

I would suggest, though, that instead of a setting, a good fanfiction is very much helped by strong /characters/.
