  That is, I could make the argument that Doctor Who's lack of a single setting reduces the amount of fics it otherwise could have for a commensurately popular show with sci-fi themes,

Thaaaat's gonna be a very difficult position to defend. When I look at fanfiction.net (which I'm assuming carries a representative smaple of fanfics) I see that Dr. Who is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/tv/][third-most popular TV show on the site]] - and the most popular when it comes to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/crossovers/tv/][crossovers]] (which doesn't surprise me in the least, the TARDIS' ability to go any place, any time makes it ridiculously easy to start a crossover).

  So maybe I'm wrong on it, and it's merely that most stories /period/ stick to a single setting, so of course most large fandoms are about a story placed in a single setting.

I think this is a far more likely explanation of your findings.
