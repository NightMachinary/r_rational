1. Does giving up years make you older, or younger?
2. If it makes you older, it is exactly like "In time", except peoples age is visible in a different way.
3. If it makes you younger, than we must also have a way of prematurely aging people. The "aging" effect would have to produce something valuable, to be used in the "youthing" effect. 4.Since, from what it says you actually pay by becoming younger, that means that the "group of people" would have little to no money, and you are trying to design a ruling class that cannot pay for a loaf of bread.
4. Your idea is actually just a slightly modified universal income. To reword it in a non aging way, "Everyone basically use bitcoins, and everyone accumulates bitcoins at a constant rate, and bitcoins are destroyed instead of moving around"
5. If someone somehow got "rich" would being a millionaire kill you?
6. If we can perform instant medical procedures more easily that we can produce a loaf of bread, which would be a requirement because anti-aging medical procedures would be a side effect of someone buying bread, or a sandwhich, then we are definitely in a post scarcity world.
7. If "walking around in a store for a few seconds" is enough to pay for groceries then you would have to do the equivelent of buying a new car once or twice a week just to break even. The more I look at this, the less sense this actually makes.
