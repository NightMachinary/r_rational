This. There's a small amount of nanotech that handles the "gating" of your body's material into and out of Z-space. If you shoot the morphed body in the head, most of the tiny machines are going to be unaffected, and they'll still be able to handle pulling the matter back out of the pocket dimension and putting it back where it belongs. But if you are a few meters away from where an asteroid hits at like 30,000 mph, that tech is Not Going To Be Okay. Even nanites can be destroyed by heat equivalent to the inside of a thermonuclear explosion.

There's a hint in there about your (side note) which I won't spell out explicitly unless you ask me to.
