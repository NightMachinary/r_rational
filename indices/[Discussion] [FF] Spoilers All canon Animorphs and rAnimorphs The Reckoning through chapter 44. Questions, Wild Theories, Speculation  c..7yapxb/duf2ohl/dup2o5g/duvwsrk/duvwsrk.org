The most efficient move there would be to only teleport the nanites, and either pop the construct bodies back into z-space, or delete them from Cassie's simulated environment so she doesn't waste time stopping to check on them.

That implies that it's pretty efficient in game resources to teleport the gate of anyone in morph. With the debt incurred by moving Peter, Tom, and Ax, the opposing god should be able to move any of the thousands of morph-capable humans now running around pretty much arbitrarily, no?
