Something I just noticed, but who made the time bubble around Earth? We see from E&C that their game usually involves making tiny moves calculated to have big effects down the line. The prophecy came to the Andalites because a piece of toast was burned in a specific pattern, which precipitated all of the events thus far. The abstruse line about an alien speaking and a star exploding a little hotter for Rachel to be born is tiny for the effect of creating an entire person not included in at least one of the Gods' plans. We know that whoever teleported the kids out of the meteor strike really just changed where they should have come out of morph, and didn't stop time so much as insert a memory into people stored on a computer he has direct physical access to.

How the hell, then, does the creation of a sphere of accelerated time that encompasses an entire solar system square with any of this? That's not a small move. E or C had to cheat to even appear to be stopping time in a tiny area, much less accelerate time sufficiently to block FTL transport. By the rules of the game we have seen thus far, this shield might be big enough to straight lose the game for the player which did it by giving the other a massive amount of leeway to carry out their usual small tricks.

This suggests one or more of the following:

1. There are rules we do not know. This is already a given, but it'd have to be a pretty big rule to counteract all of our observations thus far.

2. Slowing (but not stopping) time requires near-zero effort somehow.

3. All of Earth is being simulated. This would be lame storytelling, so there'd have to be something insanely epic to go along to make up for that.

4. Visser 3's sensors are being tricked. This has the advantage of requiring a small amount of effort, but that effort would be over a sustained period. Furthermore, they would have to do something about everyone else's sensors as well.

5. Visser 3 himself is being modified by E or C to make him think there is a bubble. If that were the case he's about to find out about the deception when he never morphs again. Would also require that someone do something about the rest of the Yeerks' sensors, who can't be manipulated this way.

6. It's a joint effort by E & C. We don't know the rules, but I would suspect that the players working together is allowed just by the general texture of the gameplay we've seen. If that is the case, the tiny pathway could be one or the other defecting, or it could play into both of their plans.

7. It's the work of a /third/ actor who isn't beholden to the same rules. The only such actor we know of is the game engine, and it's very unclear whether it is allowed to take actions like this.

8. Catch-all for things I don't know or didn't imagine.

Of these, only 1, 6, and 8 seem particularly plausible. Those all have the disadvantage of raising far more questions than they answer, so they aren't very helpful.
