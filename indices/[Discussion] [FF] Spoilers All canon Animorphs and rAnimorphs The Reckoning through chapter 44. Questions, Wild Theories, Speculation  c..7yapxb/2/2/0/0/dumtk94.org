I wonder if Ellimist messing with their memories even counts as his "turn"?

He says that "events have conspired to give me unusual freedom of movement" and this could mean that when Seerow used Ellimist's computer to make the morphing tech, it gave Ellimist a huuuuge unfair--but valid--advantage.

So maybe Ellimist actually just has lots of freedom to act now within the rules of the game just by messing with his own computer?
