This /is/ the result of one of them making tiny moves calculated to have big effects down the line. A star burns a tenth of a degree hotter, one extra atom is tripped over its fusion point and emits a particle, that particle disrupts the quantum z-space interface, and ten billion years later a timewave 4-D spherical in shape and 1day:6month in intensity flows around the z-space area corresponding to earth's star's orbit.
