I share your enthusiasm! If you haven't already, there is some pretty good hypothesizing on the reddit threads for previous r!Animorphs chapters. Sometimes TK17 himself provides answers. But many of the points you just raised have not yet been answered, I think.

  I notice I am confused: When you're in morph your mind in running on the simulator, your real body is in stasis in Z-space, and the construct body is just a receiver, right? So you shouldn't need the construct to demorph, confirmed by Interlude 4. You should be able to demorph even if the construct body is unconscious, dead, or controlled by a Yeerk.

  Why couldn't Cassie just wait till after the meteor hit to emerge from Z-Space? Would the whole area be so actively on fire an hour after impact that she couldn't survive the ~3 minutes to get into morph again and wait for things to cool down?

This always confused me too. We know that you can demorph without a construct body: that's what happened when the Ellimist (or whoever) rescued the Animorphs from the meteor. The Ellimist did not want to move their morph bodies, so it moved the emulation-construct gates and they demorphed without construct bodies. We also know that you can remain conscious without being linked to your construct body, which is what I think happened when Garrett and Ax were inside Rachel's morph.

What I think is going on is that the morphing technology naturally tries to replicate the experiences of your construct body as realistically as possible. So if your construct goes unconscious or dies, your emulated mind goes unconscious for realism. However, if there is an artificial intervention that does not tamper directly with the construct, then this is averted and you can remain conscious.

I also think that Cassie was close enough to the impact zone that even if she had remained conscious, she would have demorphed into molten lava and fiery debris raining from the sky. Or perhaps whatever technology links the construct with the mind emulation was directly destroyed by the blast.

(As a side note, the one glaring continuity error that I've noticed is that when Cassie is returns to the real world from the Ellimist's vision in chapter 18, Jake and Marco are gone, even though we know the Ellimist didn't move the construct bodies. Their Hork-Bajir bodies should just be lifeless on the ground. Unless either 1. the bodies were moved after all, 2. the Ellimist interfered with Cassie's perception to show her what she expected to see even after the vision, 3. something else is going on, or 4. TK17 made a mistake.)
