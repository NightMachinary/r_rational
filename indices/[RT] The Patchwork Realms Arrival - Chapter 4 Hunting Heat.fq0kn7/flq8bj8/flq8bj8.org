Why did our resident Good Boy not eat the Snakebear?

Seems odd that the dog was hungry, they killed a monster as big as he was, and then he wandered off still hungry rather than at least trying a bite.

The creature didn't disappear. The NPC's didn't mention that it was poisonous or shoo Athos away or anything. Seems like a waste of monster meat.
