Planning to set a story there? Well, worldbuilding is fun, so:

At a tech level /slightly/ higher than our own, it would mean they would see literally everything. (Although no one individual or organization could reasonably /know/ everything without some pretty good AI to check and index it all.)

Opting out is an impossible coordination problem, because you would be outcompeted by opt-ins, they can watch you if anyone merely /near/ you is an opt-in, and its at the very least suspicious-looking if not actually illegal. You'd have to set up an entire parallel Amish economy of opt-outs, and a single detector would gain vast economic advantages even if they only used it to look up stuff on Wikipedia.

Enough people in key positions have done /something/ wrong to steer the media and government into making various common-enough things abhorrent enough transgressions to ruin your life and credibility; so that everyone has at least one thing that society would excommunicate them for if it was made public. Racist comments, perhaps, or some Unacceptable sex thing.

First-mover advantage, natural monopolies and infighting mean this will eventually be in the hands of one person. Who decides they hate, say, Germany, or Africa, or China, and have everyone else seal them in, starve them, and then nuke the place. (Any leaders they have are discredited and Evil Monsters; whatever justification you need can be engineered through quiet blackmail via the CIA or whatever, with no one individual aware they were responsible for anything but helping the CIA bust a terrorist ring.)
