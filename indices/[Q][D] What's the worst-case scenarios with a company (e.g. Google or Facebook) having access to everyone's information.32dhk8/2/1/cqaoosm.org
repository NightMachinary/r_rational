  */Snow Crash/* is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson][Neal Stephenson]]'s third novel, published in 1992. Like many of Stephenson's other novels it covers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History][history]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics][linguistics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology][anthropology]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology][archaeology]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion][religion]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics][politics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography][cryptography]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics][memetics]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy][philosophy]].

  Stephenson explained the title of the novel in his 1999 essay /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Beginning..._was_the_Command_Line][In the Beginning... was the Command Line]]/ as his term for a particular software [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_causes][failure mode]] on the early [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh][Apple Macintosh]] computer. Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh that "When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap][bitmap]], the result was something that looked vaguely like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(video)][static on a broken television]] set---a 'snow crash'â€‰". Stephenson also mentioned a book by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jaynes][Julian Jaynes]], /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind][The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]/, as one of the main influences for /Snow Crash/.

  The book presents the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language][Sumerian language]] as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware][firmware]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][programming language]] for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem][brainstem]], which is supposedly functioning as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS][BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah][Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki][Enki]] created a counter-program which he called a nam-shub that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah (a re-interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel][Tower of Babel]]).
