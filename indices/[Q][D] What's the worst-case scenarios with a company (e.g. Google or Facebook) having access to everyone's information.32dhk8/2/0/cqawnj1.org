What I really don't understand is how it keeps happening that we had anticapitalist (or at least, anti-current-form-of-financialized ultra-libertarian wannabe-anarcho-cyber-capitalism) fiction, done to the point of parody, /decades ago/, and the social tides are only now turning in favor of /maybe/ not letting large companies and governments fuck us over.

To use certain terms, I have to ask why it has taken so long for people to try using Voice to fight for their own damn civilization, when even the thought of a society built entirely on Exit is almost always dystopian-grade grimdark.
