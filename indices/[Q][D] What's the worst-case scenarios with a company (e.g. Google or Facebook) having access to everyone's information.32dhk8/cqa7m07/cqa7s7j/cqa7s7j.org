Ooh that could be fun. Does that include information such as credit cards and social security? It would force politicians to quickly come clean about EVERYTHING so it couldn't be used for blackmail later on. I think if Facebook (as a random example) played their cards right they could even keep the majority of people happy while still pressuring people in key positions.
