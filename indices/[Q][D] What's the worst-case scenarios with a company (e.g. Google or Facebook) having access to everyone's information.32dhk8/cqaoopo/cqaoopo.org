In [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash][Snow Crash]], which I just finished reading, the CIA merged with the Library of Congress to become a kind of Pay-per-View/Wikipedia where anyone could upload anything, and you can pay to find out anything for the right price.

- "how many turds were in the bowl before you flushed"
- Manuscript drafts that famous writers thought they deleted
- Blueprints of a government facility
- A politician's favorite beverage

And like E-Bay, some people make a living off of it, and the site's listings are completely public. I can imagine a future like that coming to us very soon.
