How far into it should one get before determining that it's not for them? I've given it a shot a few times, but have always dropped it after a couple chapters out of lack of connection to the plot / characters (having never read the original source material). Would you say it "picks up" at any point, or do the first chapters give a sufficient impression of the rest of the work?
