Since you compared it to Worm, would you say the story is 'bleak' or 'grimdark'? I've never gotten into worm even though the plot sounds like something I'd enjoy because it's always been described as a dark and heavy story where there is little light to be found. My attempts to read it largely confirmed this impression.

Frankly speaking I'm not in a good enough headspace right now to handle that kind of thing. 2020 isn't helping either.
