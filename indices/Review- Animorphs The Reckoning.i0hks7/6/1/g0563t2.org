Worm has lots of named character deaths, body horror, mind rape, and Umbridge-like institutional horror. The only trigger warnings it doesn't carry are for physical rape. Reckoning has elements of existential horror, but most of it is couched in the form of, "what even is a person anyway," rather than "it doesn't matter because they're all going to die and/or be brutally injured/tortured anyway."

The world of Reckoning is far more hopeful than that of Worm. There is tons more cooperation between people of different backgrounds, social class, and cognitive structure. A major theme of the work is learning how to cooperate with people with entirely alien cognition. There are no characters who go about spreading horror for the sake of horror, and though the primary villain definitely fits all useful definitions of the word evil, it's only because of a Thanos-like obsession, rather than due to enjoying the pain of others.

If you're concerned about events in the story being comparable to those in real life, I would say don't be. Though there's a superficial theme of infected vs. clean, the Yeerk infestation is an out-of-context problem, rather than a clearly avoidable tragedy. Leadership in this story tends to be competent and not corrupt, and politics is not a theme at all.

Reckoning is definitely safer to read than Worm from the perspective of current event exacerbated mental health issues.
