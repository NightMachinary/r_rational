Nice, this fic deserves deep review

1. It's good, /readable/ writing. The fundamental English spelling/grammar/syntax is all there 100%. Beyond that, the quality of the prose is actually good

Absolutely. This is perhaps the biggest mechanical flaw of HPMoR and as you say, much of fanfiction. Yet the strength of fanfiction is a venue for voices that lack fundamental cogency yet have specific qualities or developmental backgrounds that make them unique. Yudkowsy's essaying certainly reverberated through Methods even as he never quite found himself adept at prosework, and we see in Reckoning how TK17 Studios relentless analysis of Magic: The Gathering metagaming seen from his Reddit history has paid off in the depth of modeling modeling people modeling people modeling the models of the others.

  It's /Animorphs/ fanfiction, which, while possessing a cult following, is nobody's /Harry Potter/. This is unfortunate, because as outlined above, you don't really need to be familiar with the source to enjoy this, and because the /Animorphs/ universe is an excellent setting for /HPMoR's/ rational-izing.

That tension is so fascinating at the idea of taking disparate fanfics and bundling them into a "rationalist" genre. If you don't have any connection to Willy Wonka and missed GazeMaize's Chili and the Chocolate Factory then are you going to appreciate the building intertext when I brush its influences into my Banjo-Kazooie work?

But Reckoning, as you identify, seems like it would be very good presented as an introductory telling of the story in a way you could never say about Methods that's down to both the congruency with the themes of the source material and TK17's skill as a writer. Perhaps when it's all over as part of his massive readjustment project that he will absolutely never finish he can think about making sure the intro works for uninitiated readers
