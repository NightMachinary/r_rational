I disagree; none of these cosmetic gripes detracted from my reading experience. Rather I liked all of these stylistic/semiotics/typesetting choices as workarounds or implementations of in-story concepts and voices, especially given considerations like limits and uniformity of formatting across fanfiction platforms (AO3/FF).

Specific counterarguments:

1. Any nested parentheses (>2) only occur sequentially, so I don't feel like it takes any more effort to distinguish.

2. The number convention mainly applies to academic/technical writing. Prose has exceptions and only consistency really matters. I think you've made the case for why those numbers are written out. Digit-form would have a different effect (albeit easier to process).

3. I don't think a print edition is likely coming out. Anyway the caps have the desired effect, given formatting limitations. Also I read the story via EPUB/MOBI and I don't think fancy markup shows up after the conversion process.
