I do actually plan to make a print edition at least for myself, and I have vague dreams of something like "hey, such-and-such printer has all the files available, I've set it up so that if you send them $X0 they will print you up a copy." I've got seven book covers /almost/ done except that each of two excellent artists has gotten busy before being able to finish alien renders.
