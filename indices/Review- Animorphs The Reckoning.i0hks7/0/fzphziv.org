Great review, including the suggestions in the comment :)

  This is exemplary two-alien-races-fight-over-a-magical-cube-on-an-unsuspecting-Earth genre, which is bigger than you might expect. This is what Transformers could have been, if they had fought with their brains instead of their guns.

Seriously, if the whole "Slug-aliens taking over bodies + alien tech that lets you change into other animals" thing wasn't so identifiable, I would say this could very easily just be published as its own series without being slapped by a lawsuit, and should be. I loved the original Animorphs but, like HPMOR, Reckoning takes everything good about it and elevates it to a whole new level to such a degree that my anger over copyright law gets stoked every time I think about it.

That the Transformers brand has been used to greenlight half a dozen shitty movies, not to mention the FTL-starshipwreck that is the Disney Star Wars trilogy, while this fanfic will (probably) never have any, is an absurd failure mode of our society.
