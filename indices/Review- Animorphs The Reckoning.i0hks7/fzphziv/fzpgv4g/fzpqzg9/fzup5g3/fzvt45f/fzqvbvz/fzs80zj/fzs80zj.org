I would say around chapter three or four is where it hits the ground running. In one you're reeling the whole time, and two is largely a reaction to the shock of one. In three they're juuust starting to think about working proactively, and in four the plot takes off.

Fair warning, the characters are still /majorly/ inexperienced around this point in the story. They make a lot of really dumb, avoidable mistakes as they find their footing and start to comprehend the magnitude of what they're up against. Don't let that put you off; they get much much smarter.
