WARNING: MILD SPOILERS

First of all, don't get me wrong here, these are just minor quibbles, really. Some of it is subjective suggestion, but some I really think would take the quality of the whole thing up another notch.

Much like with Worm, which this work is explicitly influenced by, my main gripes with it are editing issues. This is already a very /dense/ work, which asks a reader to keep a lot in mind at all times. The editor has the difficult job of making it so that stylistic choices highlight rather than distract from the key points the text is trying to make. I AM aware that criticisms like these are meant for the final pdf/printed version of the work, as opposed to WIP updates on fanfiction.net or ao3, but I can't help but think of it as something that's eventually going to sit on my shelf one day and so bring up now. Besides, the best time to do something about the final version of the story is now, before it's actually finished.

For example, Andalites can carry out three or four simultaneous trains of thought, currently represented by varying degrees of nested parentheses. Unfortunately, humans can only tell the difference between (((three))) and ((((four)))) nested parentheses with effort, which is a precious resource that should not be wasted on counting parentheses. I think later chapters do in fact take this into account, and use other stylistic choices such as /italics/ and <angle brackets> but as italics and especially the angle brackets are already being used for other purposes, it might be better to show the different trains of thought via different fonts or text colors.

Speaking of different fonts, when making the final publishable edition, it might be worth looking into (just a suggestion, mind) making all the POVs have distinct fonts/colors. A large theme of the work is how different minds see the world in different ways. If the work was edited such that Cassie's thoughts were in Helvetica, and and Rachel's in Arial, long thought-speak conversations would be much easier to follow. Garrett's not the only one with cause to complain about long identical lines of dialogue with no easily distinguishable features.

A particularly egregious example, when it feels like the book is making it /difficult on purpose/, is with the numbers, which are often spelled out in full. For example, the Chee are given names like six-three-four-eight-one, when 63481 would do just fine and is easier to recognise. Another example, where the POV character is multiplying in their head:

#+begin_quote
  Thirty-two.

  Sixty-four.

  One-twenty-eight.

  Two-fifty-six.

  Five hundred twelve.

  One thousand twenty-four.

  Two thousand forty-eight.

  Four thousand ninety-six.

  Eight thousand one hundred ninety-two.

  Sixteen thousand three hundred eighty four.

  Thirty two thousand six hundred---seven?---seven hundred and---
#+end_quote

I get that you're trying to convey stream-of-consciousness and the effort of calculation here, /but there is a reason why the convention is to write numbers greater than 20 with digits/. For example,

#+begin_quote
  32

  64

  128

  256

  512

  1,024

  2,048

  4,096

  8,192

  16,384

  32,6- 7?- 32,7-
#+end_quote

gets the point across a lot faster and a lot more efficiently.

Later on, there are sub-chapter headings like ---34359738368--- and ---134217728---. These numbers are important and plot-relevant and should therefore be made easier to comprehend, even if it's just putting down commas (like -34,359,738,368- and 134,217,728-), or, even better, 2^{35} and 2^{27,} or, best of all- 2^{35} : 34,359,738,368 and 2^{27} : 134,217,728. The way it is currently, I couldn't even tell that they had different numbers of digits, let alone recognise when one number showed up later.

When you see long numbers like that in books, they put the reader's mind in a certain mood, the one that you get when you are reading a technical document (eg. SCP database entries). It's like a director showing an important, plot-relevant headline in small green matrix code rain letters on a blurry screen in the background, instead of a lingering, well lit closeup of a newspaper. If not highlighted properly, these things will become part of the background.

That's the general principle, but I have one final concrete suggestion on the Garrett chapters, whose CAPITAL LETTERS help highlight IMPORTANT CONCEPTS and which I think in general are a GREAT IDEA but can be IMPROVED UPON. How? I've seen the idea of highlighting important nouns and phrases once before. If- no, /when/ a finalized, cleaned up, edition of this work shows up, I would kill to have Garrett's chapters done up [[https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sAaEmq-wZGY/W0B3uO_XsmI/AAAAAAAAbZI/fnRdcnFcFsA7mjP3_I1KwWmM4kM-OL6VgCEwYBhgL/s1600/9780545227728_alt1.gif][like this]] because I don't think I'm gonna see phrases like FREAKING RIGHT THE FUCK OUT in the original Geronimo Stilton books anytime soon.
