I agree with you completely. Stylistic things are very subjective, and subjectively, I like all the things OP dislikes, especially when it comes to the /difficulty/ of this story.

I can't think of another piece of fiction that's challenged me like The Reckoning. And I know this might sound silly, but I /really enjoy/ when this story throws in an element that's so confusing it's almost incomprehensible. It's like I get to solve a puzzle before moving on with the text. Even stuff like not identifying who's talking in thought-speak, I have /fun/ figuring out who said what based on who it sounds like.

I will lavish praise upon this story until the day I die. I agree 100% with all the compliments OP gave it, and my criticisms are almost infinitesimal. I also don't want the author second-guessing himself and compromising his established, rock-solid, nearly perfect (subjectively, to me) style of storytelling because of reader criticism.
