It is still too early for me to give constructive commentary or start speculating about where this is going, but seeing how no one else has commented yet I want to at least say that this is intriguing and that I hope you wont stop writing.

Do you have an estimate on how many chapters it will take before we return to a viewpoint character for a second time?
