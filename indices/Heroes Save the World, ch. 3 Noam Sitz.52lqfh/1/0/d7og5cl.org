Thank you for commenting. It really does mean a lot to me. >:]

We'll be returning to Simon in the next update. These first few chapters are a little tricky in having to balance the need to show certain characters and events with the need to actually have some of our main characters appear more than once. This is one of the reasons why I settled on two updates a week, since it means that we get a main character at least once a week.
