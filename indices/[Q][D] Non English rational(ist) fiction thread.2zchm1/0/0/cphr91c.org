I liked /The Last Ringbearer/ (I've read the original), but I should give a warning that it has a problem somewhat similar to HPMOR: it starts off with an awesome premise "what if Mordor was actually a progressive industrialized state struggling against backwards magical reactionaries", but then kinda degrades into a spy novel with a lot less epic scope.
