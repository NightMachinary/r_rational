Yeah, I've been trying to decide whether to read them all now or try to hold out for the next one. It's eight years since the last book came out, and if it's another two years or more until the next one I might forget little things unless I read the whole thing again. I caught up with Wheel of Time a few months before the author died, so that was fun. Luckily Brandon Sanderson swept in and saved us all.
