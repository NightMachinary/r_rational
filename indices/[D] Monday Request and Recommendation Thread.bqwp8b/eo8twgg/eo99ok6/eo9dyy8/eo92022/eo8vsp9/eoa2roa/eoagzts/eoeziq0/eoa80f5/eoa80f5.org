Seriously, though, there are so incredibly many fanfictions out there it's hard to recommend some without knowing more of what she's interested in. The good thing, too, is that she's so young she's basically immune to the generic, cliched fanfic.

Best suggestion is to make liberal use of the filters available on websites and see what catches her eye. This is probably not what you were looking for and you already know all this but just in case:
