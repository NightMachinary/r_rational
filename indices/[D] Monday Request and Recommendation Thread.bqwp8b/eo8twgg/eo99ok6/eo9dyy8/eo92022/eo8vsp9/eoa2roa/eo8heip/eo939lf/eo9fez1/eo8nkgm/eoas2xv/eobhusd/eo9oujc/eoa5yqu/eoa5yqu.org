Off the top of my head...

- The Magicians, the trilogy by Lev Grossman is somewhat nihilistic and may be depressing, but very well written. Some people can't tolerate that the main protagonist is an asshole. Good writing and original ideas abound, if you don't demand a protagonist that is morally righteous.

- Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke isn't necessarily rationalist but it is about the titular characters rediscovering magic that was long thought to be lost. It's written in a highly affected style that mimics older British writers, and is probably not for everyone. The novel is slowly paced especially in the beginning. The magic isn't exactly highly systematized, either. However, the payoff is great - it has some of the most evocative and imaginative descriptions of magic that I've ever read, and really does a good job of sellingmagic learned as unique and terrible and beautiful.

- LE Modesitt's Recluce books are, once you've read his stuff a lot, eventually extremely repetitive, sort of a lesser version of the problem where David Eddings had like one story for his half-a-dozen fantasy worlds. This is less of a problem if you only read a few of his books. Modesitt's stories are logical and well thought out and fairly decently written. The (very long) series of Recluce books are organizationally divided into pairs of books that tell the story of a single character per pair, and skip around a complex world over thousands of years. Reading them in strict publication order isn't totally necessary, and the first books were weaker in the qualities you are asking about. I'd recommend reading The White Order and Colors of Chaos together (the two together tell a complete and coherent narrative of a character learning and mastering his own magic).

- Mother of Learning by Nobody103. There's been relentless discussion of it here in this subreddit, so I won't reiterate it much.
