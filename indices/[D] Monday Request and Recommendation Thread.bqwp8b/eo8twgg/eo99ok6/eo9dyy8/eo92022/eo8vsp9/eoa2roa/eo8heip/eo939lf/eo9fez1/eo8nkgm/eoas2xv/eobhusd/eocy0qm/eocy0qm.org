It's been a while since I tried Ra, I don't remember why I dropped it but what you're saying sounds familiar.

I would give [[http://solarclipper.com/about/][The Solar Clipper]] series a shot if you like sci fi -- it's somewhat of a tribute to the Horatio Hornblower series, if people made money rather than war. Definitely lighter faire.

Traditional fantasy, but still no supers. It's been a while since I've read this one so it may be that there's multiple viewpoints but I don't recall them and I usually would since I also prefer just one: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96278.Sheepfarmer_s_Daughter][Paksennarion]]

Do-over time travel. One of the originals and best, IMO. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(Grimwood_novel)][Replay]].

I'd you wanted to try a multi-protag book, it's been a while since I've seen [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] mentioned around here.

Hopefully at least one of those is new to you!
