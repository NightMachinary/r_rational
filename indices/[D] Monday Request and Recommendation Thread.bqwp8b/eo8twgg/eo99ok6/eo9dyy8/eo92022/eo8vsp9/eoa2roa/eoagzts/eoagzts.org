Just in case she's interest in things other than fanfiction, I do have other suggestions, all around the same level of maturity as HP: Brandon Mull, Artemis Fowl, Ranger's Apprentice, Songreaver's Tale, Tamora Pierce, Jane Yolen, Patricia Wrede, So You Want To Be A Wizard, Jessica Day George, Matilda, Chronicles of Narnia, Anne McCaffrey, Nix's Seven(th?) Towers series, Diana Wynn Jones

...ok, sorry, I'll stop there considering it isn't even what you were asking for and if she does want stuff outside HP-verse that list'll last her a couple of years lol
