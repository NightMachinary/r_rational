Any recommendations for traditional books, webnovels, or fanfictions where there is a strong emphasis on the protagonist learning magic would be much appreciated. Rational lit. preferred, of course, but not a requirement. Same for an interesting / well thought-out magic system.

Thanks!

ETA: Just the name(s) of the work is fine, I don't need descriptions or summaries unless you really want to add them - not that I don't appreciate it, but I feel bad that you're spending time writing a summary for something I may have already read. Granted, I suppose there are probably lurkers interested in the same things as me who may benefit from a summary...

ETA 2: Most good stories don't have too much of this sort of thing because then there's little room for plot. Some works or authors that start on the path to what I'm looking for would include: Tamora Pierce's Emelanese Universe, Nuttall's Schooled series, Name of the Wind, Lightbringer series, Farland's Runelords (sorta), Spellwright, Their's Not to Reason Why, the Warded/Painted Man...
