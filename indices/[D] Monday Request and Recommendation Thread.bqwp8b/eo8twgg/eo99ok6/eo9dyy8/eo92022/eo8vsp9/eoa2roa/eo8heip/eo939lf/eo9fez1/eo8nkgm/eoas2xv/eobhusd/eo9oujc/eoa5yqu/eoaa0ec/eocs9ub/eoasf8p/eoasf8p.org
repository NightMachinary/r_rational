I was going to recommend The Song Of The Lioness quartet, but I notice you've already mentioned Tamora Pierce, so you've probably read that and more magic-focused books. I'll still mention it to make a more generic recommendation.

I'd especially recommend it to girls aged about 12-15 as it has nice mature attitudes towards relationships and sex, and has the main character /actually have a period/ which is almost unheard of in YA fiction.
