My favorite type of ending is one that allows you to see the entire story in a new light. Dangerous Thoughts has that, and I Will Inform Them does not. I wrote chapter two as a sequel to I Will Inform Them--maybe it was better as only one chapter for that reason.

  Lots of Asimov's short stories that have a twist ending feel similar.
