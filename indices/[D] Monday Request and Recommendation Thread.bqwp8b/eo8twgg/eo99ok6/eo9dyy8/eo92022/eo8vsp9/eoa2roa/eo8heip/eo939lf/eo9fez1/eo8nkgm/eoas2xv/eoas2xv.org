Any light, breezy reads for airplanes? Alternatively, any gripping novels that will have me in the first chapter and not let me put them down?

Stuff I have already read that fits this description: The Handmaid's Tale (I remember when I first read it, I started reading it at midnight and keep reading until sunup), but I didn't have the same immersion in Oryx and Crake when I tried it, but if someone has another Atwood story they might recommend please do.

The Martian also did that for me because it was so "easy to read", even though it wasn't as engrossing/all-encompassing as THT was.
