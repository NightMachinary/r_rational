[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie][People Lie]] satisfies 2 and 3 of your conditions. It's a Naruto fic with a darker and more realistic look at the Naruto world in terms of politics, subterfuge, and of course, lies. I'm pretty sure it'd count as a rational story too (if one with a deeply flawed protagonist) but it's been a while since I read it and don't want to falsely advertise. The (seemingly) initial point of divergence is someone who wants revenge on the fox abducts and hurts naruto before he is rescued, and develops a close relationship with the head of Torture and Interrogation in the aftermath. Fic is dead, sadly, but still worth a read.
