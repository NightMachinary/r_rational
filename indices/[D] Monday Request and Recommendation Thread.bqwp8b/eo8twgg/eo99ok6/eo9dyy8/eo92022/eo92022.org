Recommended (with reservations) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bg35l3/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eli878l/][Made in Abyss]] a month ago, here to recommend another anime with far fewer reservations: [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/35839/Sora_yori_mo_Tooi_Basho][Sora yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further Than the Universe)]]. Also about a group of gutsy young children on a mission to travel to a mysterious, hostile, distant land (Antarctica), but with a much more wholesome adventure / slice-of-life feel. Has some extremely light anime weirdness (graded on a curve relative to other anime). Beautiful animation and sound design, too.

Haven't actually finished it yet, just past halfway through. But the (admittedly low sample) [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7836688/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1][IMDB scores climb]] as the series' episodes progresses, as do the [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/35839/Sora_yori_mo_Tooi_Basho/episode][myanimelist]] and [[https://anilist.co/anime/99426/Sora-yori-mo-Tooi-Basho/stats][anilist]] scores, so I'm pretty confident a strong start gets even stronger!
