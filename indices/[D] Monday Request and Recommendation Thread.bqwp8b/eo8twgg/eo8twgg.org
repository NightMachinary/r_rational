The epilogue finally came out after 10 years of *[[https://www.homestuck.com/story][Homestuck]]*, and in my opinion it redeemed the otherwise lackluster anticlimax ending by going full metatextual, so I'm finally recommending it here.

While the start is filled with dated programming jokes and slapstick (arising from originally being a text adventure with commands sent by actual fans and trying to take the story in different directions) it quickly gets its shit together and honestly becomes one of the most original and engaging stories I've ever read.

In short, it's a story about a reality-altering apocalypse-causing video game played by characters stereotyped around old internet user archetypes. Main themes are predestination (time shenanigans abound), isolation and internet social dynamics (chatlogs abound).

Warning: it's long, clocking just over one million words, 9000 art panels and many animations and minigames. You won't finish this in a week. If you're not enjoying it by /[S] WV: Ascend/, a couple hours in, you probably never will.
