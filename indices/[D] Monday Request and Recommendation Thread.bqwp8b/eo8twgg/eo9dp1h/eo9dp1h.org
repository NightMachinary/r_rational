Seconded; if you're all caught up and are looking for good fanfics I recommend:

- There are a couple of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/602557][explicitly rational Homestuck fics]]. Spoilers up to end of Act 5 or so, I haven't read these in a while.
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606][Sburb Glitch FAQ]] kicked off the Replay Value AU setting. These works diverged partway through the comic's run, but they have some thoughtful discussion and analysis of several LitRPG tropes.

I recommend these fics primarily on the basis of the quality of their writing and characterisation rather than their rationality:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2427119/chapters/5371283][Detective Pony]], a full version of Dirk's gift to Jane. Starts comedic, develops into "a tough, emotionally draining read. But it's cathartic, in all the worst ways possible." Very meta, well-structured, and stuffed with pretentious and quotable references and wordplay. Also available in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEqJ96p4CXY&list=PLQ8hhddV_CO3MPToD4TCoo4eKFqeQTk9l][audiobook]] and (soon) [[https://youtu.be/QCyK5NzagbI][puppet show]] format. Mostly independent of Homestuck proper, but you probably want to wait to meet the creator and recipient in Act 6 Act 1.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3275858][Theatre of Coolty]] is also available in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIavjRkRKT0][puppet show]] format, and has similar themes but is much shorter. /Waiting for Godot/, except it stars Dirk, Dirk, Dirk, and Dirk, sort of. Again, largely independent of Homestuck proper, but this contains spoilers up to the end of Act 7.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14692911][BONES OF BLACK MARROW]] is NSFW. Extremely NSFW. In terms of the plot-porn balance, I think the Erogamer might be similar. It's an AU, the premise can be described as kind of like /50 Shades of Grey/ crossed with /House of Leaves/, and includes CYOA elements. Once more, the main characters first appear in Act 6 Act 1.

Lastly, in case you weren't aware, [[http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/][Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]] exists outside of Homestuck panels.
