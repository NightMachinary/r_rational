I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters][He Who Fights Monsters]] and was looking for something similar. This can be in several categories:

1. Whether it be in the Rosario world

2. Whether it is with a character having to make morally questionable choices to survive

3. The MC starts slowly down a darker moral path (doesnt have to be for survival)

Also, as always, looking for more Bloodborne stories to read. I've read Fear the Old Blood, Hunter, and Bloody Tinkers.

Furthermore, hoping to get some good Power stealing fic recommendations. I read Daddy's Girl and Claim the Spoils. Something like those would be great. Doesnt have to be Worm necessarily.

Edit: Should add the disclaimer. It does not have to be rational, just something of decent quality.
