So... I'm living Every Father's Worst Nightmare. Last night, when taking my 10 year old daughter's phone away for the night, she told me she was using it to read. A bit of interrogation revealed that she had managed to find a Harry Potter fanfic.

Yaoi Harry Potter fanfic.

/Mature/ Yaoi Harry Potter fanfic.

*Cursed Child* mature Yaoi Harry Potter fanfic.

I think I earned more Dad Points by being able to explain what "OTP" meant than I lost by scorning Scorpious/Albus. And fortunately, I caught her before she got too far into the "mature" story (and the mature warning was for domestic violence, which like any normal deranged American Father bothers me less than sex).

But to get to the point, do any of you fine folks have any suggestions for stories I actually can recommend as being age appropriate? Ideally only about as "adult" themed as the Harry Potter books themselves.
