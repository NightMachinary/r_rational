I was recently disappointed with [[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]]. I felt betrayed. What began with magic being a field engineering, requiring strict technical skill, where only the most ambitious and industrious student/professor can become powerful, suddenly turned into a force that ignore them all.

To be frank, few chapters in, I really glad I decided to read it. For once I can feel smart: following up which character do what, accomplishing what, and deducing what next step they'll take to tap energy previously un-tap-able. Revelation that engineering-y magic being a conspiracy is where the novel betrayed its premise. It would be nice if the protagonist then use her acquired knowledge to beat the conspiracy. But no, magic being discipline is dead from that point. Her sister even took it in stride, relaxing in copy planet and all. On that point I wonder, why the author made us read that much text if in the end they became irrelevant?

I need recommendation that can take my mind off it. Anything will do, but I guess I should list criteria which I have no aversion of,

- Original story (not fanfic),
- Single POV character (soft criterium. Multi-POV usually shit, please don't recommend a multi-POV fiction if you're not impressed with how it's done),
- Consistent step-by-step world building (step-by-step means no exposition wall baring exceptional prose, consistent means if the story is build around untalented protagonist don't let him suddenly actually gifted several chapters in),
- Ordinary people (no supers).

Being in rational subreddit, I suppose it have to be a ratfic. Successful characters (leading protagonist and leading antagonist) should not be idiots, hard rules inviolable, exploits encouraged. Humorous optional, effective prose preferable.
