With the final episode of Game of Thrones airing yesterday, the last week or so I've watched a lot of lore and world building explanations about the world. It's not rational/ist/ fiction, but I was impressed with how large and consistently interesting the world is (and the lack of idiot balls). The continent where most of GoT takes place is basically Britain next to a lot of really big other continents. If you enjoyed GoT, have a look at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4J16GzUJ28][this]] youtube video just going over the world map. It's cool stuff. The channel has a lot of other content about GoT as well, fan theories and in world mythology that got cut from the show, etc.
