Can't really think of much fanfiction I'd actually encourage a kid to read but a few original series come to mind for a 10 year old that likes Harry Potter; the Young Wizards series by Diane Duane, the Earthsea Cycle by Ursula K Le Guin, The Dark is Rising Sequence by Susan Cooper, the His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman and the Time Quintet by Madeleine L'Engle.
