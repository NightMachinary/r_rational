I'd strongly recommend the Alexandra Quick series, which I think hits all the notes you're looking for: it's set in the same universe as Harry Potter, with a very similar feel to the magic, but set in America after the events of the original books. The writing is really fantastic, and it's no more adult themed than the Harry Potter books.
