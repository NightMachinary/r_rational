And I strongly de-rec the series. Not only is it boring, but the titular Character is a selfish, arrogant and thoroughly idiotic bitch who refuses to learn from her mistakes, no matter how disastrous the consequences. Reading the story ruined my week, since I don't particularly enjoy the feeling of righteous hatred that flares up in me every time I think about the series.

So, YMMV.
