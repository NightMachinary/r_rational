- There's the classic, which arguably spawned the "magical school" genre (though the magical school part is fairly small): /A Wizard of Earthsea/
- All of Brandon Sanderson's novels have interesting and well thought-out systems - be they magic or otherwise. Unfortunately he very much subscribes to the "if nothing exciting is happening, ninjas break in through the window" philosophy, which means that the main characters rarely spend a lot of time learning the relevant systems (and when they do, it happens offscreen). I'd personally recommend /Elantris/ and /Warbreaker/, if you want books about people figuring out the world's magic system.
- Similarly, Will Wight's novels tend to have very well thought out systems that the characters learn over time. They also tend to be a lot more exotic than Sanderson's, in my opinion.
- Wuxia and wuxia-esque novels spend a lot of time on the main characters learning stuff about their magic system and deriving insights, because that's what cultivation is. Will Wight's wuxia-inspired Cradle novels are particularly good, since they hit two of these bullet points.
- Speaking of good Wuxia novels, Tao Wong's new book /A Thousand Li/ was pretty good, and mostly focuses around the main character learning how to cultivate.
- Since apparently I'm on a theme here, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][/Forge of Destiny/]] is another great wuxia-ish (web-)novel focused around a character learning the world's magic system. It was originally a quest on Sufficient Velocity, so you can go over there to see the dice rolls.
