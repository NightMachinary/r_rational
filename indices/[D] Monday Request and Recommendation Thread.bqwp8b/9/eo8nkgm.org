I stumbled across the music video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFS2DWgijh4]] that uses footage from a show called Love, Death & Robots.

Does anyone know of rational stories that have a similar vibe aside from Twig? Not as much about the big monsters fighting in battle arenas but something that explores the societal structures in such a setting and the lives of people in them.
