Are we allowed to recommend our own [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/blasted0glass/works][works?]] I've uploaded most of my short stories to Archive of Our Own, so they are there to be read.

I don't think I have a favorite, but if I had to recommend any I'd suggest: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18686962/chapters/44317063][I Will Inform Them.]]

Feedback welcome, especially of the form "I liked this one more than I Will Inform Them, for this reason."
