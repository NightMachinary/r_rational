It's just one movie, not a show, and though I really enjoyed the original movie you don't have to watch it. The author is kind enough to have the characters reflect on all of the movie's major plotpoints when they come up.

Btw, I just read another chapter and it's even more explicitly rational now. The MCs are literally learning about logical falacies and reading How to win friends and influence people. Geez, it's like it was written just for us.
