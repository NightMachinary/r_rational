I strongly, strongly recommend the First Law trilogy. The first book is "The Blade Itself". I don't know that it's particularly rational, but the author makes an honest attempt to create real characters and real situations. A word of warning though - It's a dark tale, and I've never read violence that felt this real in any other story.
