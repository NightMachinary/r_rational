[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]'s cast mainly operates under blue/orange morality. Sylvester will lie, steal, cheat and murder - but won't touch a hair on another kid. Gordon is built and set up as a classical hero, but hides a vicious streak. Helen is... difficult to sum up, but definitely awesome, and non-human.

There are quite a few not-really-human (and some outright xeno) viewpoints strewn in, and they're all awesome, given it's by the same author as Worm.
