I've been really enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2][Let me In 2]], a fanfic continuation of the fantastic Swedish vampire movie "Let the right one in", or more specifically the less impressive American remake "Let me in" (starring ChloÃ« Grace Moretz as vampire girl).

The movie is built upon the classic 'boy meets vampire girl' premise, though with a very original take to it and a really great execution. The reason I think this fanfic might belong here is because it features a rational, cold-hearted detective who chases the main characters as they try to survive despite the vampire's need for blood. It also features:

1. Explanations of the vampire's abilities, with explicit rules and limitations
2. The MC asking obvious practical questions (why not just use blood transfusions? Etc)
3. An interest in book learning: The MC tries to learn science to become more effective
4. Reflection on past mistakes, personal biases, and the ethical consequences of their actions
5. Clear reasons and explanations for why the characters make the decisions they do

I haven't finished the story yet, but so far it's been very interesting. There are points where the main characters make painfully stupid mistakes, but they are 12 years old at start so it makes sense, and crucially the story treats them as mistakes and has the characters learn from them. Also, the story has very good fundamentals, including writing skills, having an editor, powerful character moments and so on.

If anyone else here has read it, let me know if you think it deserves its own post :)
