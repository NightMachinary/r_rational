I liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18687349][Dangerous Thoughts]] more than I will Inform Them. It feels like it has an interesting resolution at the end. Lots of Asimov's short stories that have a twist ending feel similar. (Well, maybe not "twist ending"; somewhere between "twist ending" and "punchline".)

On the other hand, I Will Inform Them doesn't feel like it has much of an ending; it left me asking the question "so what?"
