I'll second this recommendation, it's really great fun to read!

It's also one of those fics that's nice for introducing people to fandoms. It's been ages since I've watched OreGairu and I've only seen a single episode of BNHA, but the fic is still really enjoyable (and made me read a bunch of BNHA fics, some of which were even decent in turn).
