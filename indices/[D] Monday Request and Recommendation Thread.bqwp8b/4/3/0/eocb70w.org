Of course.

Hunter is the best serious one. It really captures the eldritch feel and horror of the series. Lost of mind fuckery and not quite knowing what's going on.

Bloody Tinkers is a hilarious crack fic where Taylor is a tinker that can produce all the Bloodborne equipment and items.

Fear the Old Blood has 3 chapters so I cant quite say anything about it.

All 3 are dead sadly.
