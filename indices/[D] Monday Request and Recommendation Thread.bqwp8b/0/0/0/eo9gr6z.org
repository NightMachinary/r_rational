I liked /House of Leaves/ and read through the very beginning of /BONES OF BLACK MARROW/ because of that, and yeah, while it's a bit too NSFW for my taste (I'm no puritan, it's just this particular fandom doesn't make me want to read naughty stuff), the writing is magnificent, so it's worth checking out. However, unlike HoL, it has no physical version (that I'm aware of), so reading it on the desktop is a pain in the ass because I can't flip my monitor (so I had to install third-party software), and the text is way too wide to be comfortable on mobile.

I'm also doubling the /Detective Pony/ recommendation, even though I have nothing to add to the description.

Finally, you have my gratitude for /Theatre of Coolty/. I enjoyed /Waiting for Godot/ and considering the context of the other two of your recommendations, this should be good.
