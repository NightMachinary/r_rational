Look at it from the perspective of utility to the village, especially with the context that the Hyuuga and Uchiha were the founding clans of Hidden Leaf.

The Uchiha are famed for stealing /techniques/ from their opponents, which would be an incredible boon to a newly-founded village with only two clan libraries to draw upon.

Now what the Hyuuga bring to the table is new /clans/. It would not surprise me whatsoever that one of the reasons why Hidden Leaf has a million and a half different clans is because, back before they worked on their squeaky clean image, the Hyuuga contributed to the village by capturing enemy ninja alive, keeping them prisoner via chakra blocking, and breeding a new clan out of them. Basically the same thing Cloud did in the series.

Of course, capturing ninja for interrogation purposes has a lot of utility too which is why they've kept their focus on chakra blocking to present-day, but if you ask me that's why they started doing it to begin with.
