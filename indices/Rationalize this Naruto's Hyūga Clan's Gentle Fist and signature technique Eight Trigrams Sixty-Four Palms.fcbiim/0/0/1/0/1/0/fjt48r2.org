Underrated post.

Most of the problem is that they get stuck in linear thinking and fall into the 'power creep' mold.

It's better when introducing new threats not to just crank the scale up higher, but to pose problems that are at 'right angles' to the scale the protagonist is used to, where being extraordinary in a single category is meaningless.
