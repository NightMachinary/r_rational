1. Naruto ninja are incredibly resistant to blunt trauma. Even low-level ones. Disabling chakra usage is more efficient in some situations.

2. Naruto ninja are incredibly fast. I think of the 64 Palms as a kind of ritualized, intensely practiced, sequence of strikes. Because it's so practiced and rigid, it's very fast, as most highly practiced (as opposed to improvised) techniques are.

3. range attacks need to be incredible high-level to do damage in Naruto to someone near your level. The only useful ones we see in Naruto are usually from A or S-rank ninja: Rasenshuriken, Amateratsu, Kakuza's attacks, etc. I think as a general rule with some exceptions: ranged attacks are not great.
