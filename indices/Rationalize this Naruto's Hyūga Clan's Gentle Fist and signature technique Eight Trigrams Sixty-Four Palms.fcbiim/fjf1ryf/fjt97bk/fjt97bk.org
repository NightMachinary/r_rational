  In fact in many cases I'd argue higher level ninja are faster than projectiles

Law of physics say that the speed of the ninja throwing it influences the speed of the projectiles. So higher level ones can throw ones that are also faster.

Since most battles involving projectiles don't involve running away from them in straight lines like a cartoon character, this doesn't come up much either.

Also, at this point, from centuries of usage, people should already /know/ where the primary chakra points are, and design armor to compensate for people trying to use such tricks.
