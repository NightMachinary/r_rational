1 byakugan comes at a reduced depth perception, making it less effective at precision maneuvers like hitting a target at range.

2 Byakugan requires a lot of focus, reducing your effectiveness at blocking and countering your opponents' moves, when they're not doing something rendered extremely obvious and ineffective by the Byakugan's 355 degree vision. Extra focus is also needed to keep moving your head to cover the blind cone.

1. To make up for this weakness in no. 2 the Hyuuga have developed a technique which disables a foe's ability to attack them from the outside in. Rather than trying to slip past a foe's defense as most warriors would call the efficient or effective route, the Hyuuga attack each exposed point of defense, to stop it from defending the next. They attack the fingers, to force the opponent to use their palms, then the palms and elbows to disable those as points of impact. They work on the feet and knees, head, shoulders, and work their way in slowly to set up a scenario where the opponent is utterly helpless to prevent the next strike right up until the deadly final one.
