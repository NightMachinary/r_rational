You want to make it optimal? Make it fit a true Ninja mold--be sneaky about it.

The 64-strike thing is an obfuscation of the truth. There's only 5 or 6 key points that *need* to be hit. They're not hitting an actual 64 times to do it, probably only about 12 or 16, but a majority of those are feints to hide the true nature of the technique. Anyone who has seen it believes the target will be getting hit by the full advertised number of attacks, which serves to distract them from the truth as well as demoralize them because they believe an opponent who can pull it off is /actually that fast/ and they would be fools to try and block them all.

It *feels* like 64 strikes because many of those are instant hits to pain nerves which react a split second later causing agony farther down the line.

The 'exploding backward' effect it caused both by the energy expenditure of the user and a shockwave of chakra from the target as their closed chakra lines expel the energy they had been containing. Since it's expelled in the direction of the attack, they function as tiny little rocket boosters propelling the target backward just as the kinetic force from the attacker also pushes them.

The technique isn't use to kill, but to immobilize, capture, and demoralize. Watching your ally get hit with it and turned into a helpless ragdoll is enough to make you not want to get hit, either. It's also good in negotiation purposes because you can take down their most skilled/powerful guy without killing him, which makes it easier to negotiate an end to the hostilities later as they don't have families with new blood oaths to avenge against the technique's practitioners.
