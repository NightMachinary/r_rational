Capture of enemy ninja for interrogation or stealing techniques/bloodlines is far more valuable than outright killing enemy ninja, especially for the higher-ranked/more skilled enemies. But this is rarely an option with all the ninjutsu-based strength, mobility, suicide, etc. techniques available. (It's been a while since I've read/watched the source material--do we ever see a non-genin captured outside of a temporary genjutsu or a specialized techniques like the Yamanaka's?)

Gentle Fist attacks shut down any chakra-based techniques that would allow escape.
