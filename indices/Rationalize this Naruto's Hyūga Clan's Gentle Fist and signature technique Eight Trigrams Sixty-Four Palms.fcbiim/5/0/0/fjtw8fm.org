This is a world where ninjas can use magical chakra techniques to move incredibly quickly (e.g the Body Flicker or Replacement Technique) - I'd argue that it's easily possible for a high level ninja with access to these techniques to be far faster than any projectile they could throw.

The entire point of the Gentle Fist is that it makes armour useless. They are projecting chakra into their opponents body, not physically poking them very hard. It is meant to be so devastating because it's almost impossible to actually block, severely restricting defensive options and giving the Hyuga a massive advantage in melee range. Any armour thick enough to block the Gentle Fist would most likely be heavy enough to slow the ninja down, which is a serious problem. This may be a universe were dodging is easy, but its also a universe where offence tends to trump defence - not many ninja can actually afford to take a serious hit from a rival. Failure to dodge is usually going to be a death sentence, so lowering your mobility by wearing armour isn't usually going to be worth it.
