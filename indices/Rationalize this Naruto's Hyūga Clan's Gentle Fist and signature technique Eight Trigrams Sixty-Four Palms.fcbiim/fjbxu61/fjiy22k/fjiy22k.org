  1) Ranged attacks have travel time. Gunpowder isn't a thing so you're looking at bows and arrows at best, and ninja are extremely fast

This is kinda contradicting. Why are ninjas fast? Because of chakra. What is chakra? Some kind of energy they can use to affect the world. What do you need to make things move very fast? Apply enough energy to it.

You could totally shoot bullets with chakra. Faster than any gun. Naruto explodes a tree on his first time trying to treewalk.
