Yeah, it's a common fanfic trope that Naruto is using too much chakra, and so his jutsu fail, but it's not supported by canon.

Narratively, naruto always struggles to actually use the power available to him, whether he's not stick to a tree when learning to climb, sinking into hot springs when trying to walk on water, or summoning tadpoles instead of frogs.

This also fits with his character arc. Naruto knows what kind of person he is, and doesn't really change as a person that much, so his arc is more about finding a place where it's ok to be himself, and with jutsu, he has the power to pull off amazing feats, but struggles to reach the point where he can apply it. And a lot of his biggest moments have him juxtaposing a personal realization or declaration in line with his existing character and finally bridging that gap.

And it contrasts with Sasuke, who overpowers the exercise when tree walking, changes his fighting style multiple times, and starts out with big flashy fireballs and lightning strikes, before eventually settling on Amenotejikara spam, because Sasuke doesn't really know who he is or who he wants to be, so he does what he thinks is expected of him with as much effort as possible, starting with standard Uchiha fireballs, then moving to Kakashi-esque lightning jutsu (only bigger) and Orochimaru style summoning, then switching to Itachi's more flashy jutsu of Susanoo and Ameterasu, before, at the end of his arc, moving on to his own custom jutsu and special abilities, which he uses in far more conservative and low key ways. Seriously, watch the Danzo v Sasuke fight and then watch the Naruto and Sasuke v Momoshiki fight. That's a big change in fighting style.
