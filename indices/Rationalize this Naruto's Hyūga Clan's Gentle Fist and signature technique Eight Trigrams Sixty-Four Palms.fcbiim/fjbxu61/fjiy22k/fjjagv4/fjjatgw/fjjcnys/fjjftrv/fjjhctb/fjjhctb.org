It's really easy to handwave as possible, and would be entirely believable... except that surely such a technique would make throwing kunai around extremely obsolete, so at the very least it doesn't exist.

I will concede that the Boruto machine guns show chakra guns /possible/, but they still fairly obviously require a higher tech level than Naruto had, which is the time generally referred to, because no one likes Boruto. As such, it doesn't really affect the reasoning behind the traditions of the Hyuuga clan.

The ransenshuriken is a top-tier technique that qualifies as relevant for moving extremely fast, and being usable as a melee technique. Again though, it's not really relevant to the Hyuuga.
