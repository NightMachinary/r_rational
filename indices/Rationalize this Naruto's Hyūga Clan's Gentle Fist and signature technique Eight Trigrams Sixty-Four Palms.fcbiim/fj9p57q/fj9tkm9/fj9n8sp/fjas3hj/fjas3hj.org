This one seems right to me. Also, at the risk of reminding people that NTBS exists and that I've been neglecting my duties:

  Shikamaru shook his head. “The Hyūga don't really use weapons. They have their own Gentle Fist style, which uses the Byakugan to detect their opponent's chakra points and closes them off by forcing their own chakra into their body with their fingertips.”

  “What? That's stu-” /Not/ stupid, Naruto quickly corrected himself. A technique like that might not be well-suited to single combat, but it would be invaluable in capturing enemy ninjas alive, since you never knew what secret techniques they might otherwise use to escape even without being able to move their arms and legs. Couple that with their eyes' information gathering ability and the Hyūga were the perfect clan to assist the Anbu and the Hokage in making unwanted people disappear into the night. He glanced towards Lord Hyūga Hiashi, who was sitting in a seat of honour in the front row, watching the fight with an impassionate gaze. /No wonder they're considered a noble clan, with a power like that.../

Basically, 64 Palms is only stupid if you assume it's a continuous technique that *has* to be executed in that order to deal bonus damage, or something. It makes perfect sense if you assume it's just a sequence to seal off the target's most important chakra points in order to prevent any chance of escape, and which you wouldn't normally use during single combat. In fact, given how valuable the Hyuga are, you shouldn't be committing them to combat /at all/ unless you're desperate. It'd be like sending your medic into melee.

This is also my preferred way of rationalizing strange things in canon. Instead of mocking something for being dumb, re-interpret it so that it makes sense. I also agree that the whole "use ranged attacks" idea is the kind of cleverness that wouldn't work in reality. It's not as if great eyesight makes you a great archer in real life.
