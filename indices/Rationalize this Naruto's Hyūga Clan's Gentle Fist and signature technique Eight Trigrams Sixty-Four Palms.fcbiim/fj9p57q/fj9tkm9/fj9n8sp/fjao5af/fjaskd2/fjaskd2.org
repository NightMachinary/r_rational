There is a lot of difference between say playing the knife game and precision shooting. While both may be well centered around precision there's kind a large mechanical difference between putting your fingers to a specific spot and we'll launch projecticle at someone whom your special eyes dont really help you in being able predict where they'll be or how to compensate for the fact that they can and will dodge or parry said attack. Also if anything the 8 trigrams is supposed to be not overkill but overprepared to a certain extent it's supposed to cover all bases in a way that it might not have much use against a superior opponent ala mascara but if your reactions and speed are equivalent or better than your oppponent you can win the 1v1. It's I hesitate to say like a dueling technique because of how dueling doesnt and isnt supposed to be real fighting, but the way they describe it as something only taught to the Head(s) of the household means that it was like a technique made for their Clan heads to win against other Clan heads in say the Warring Clans Era. Also the fact that it continued to not be taught meant that there were fewer opprtunities for the technique to be analyzed for weaknesses by opposing forces.
