the point is that they interrupt whatever the target tries to do. like when an esper deck kills you by hitting 10 times with their 2 power board because they have 5 counterspells in hand and yours is empty. also may have something to do with getting around bullshit "i can't be damaged" effects.

if there is an obvious direction they should take their art it would be things that interfere with others' vision, spreading around generous amounts of traps or just sneaking near people to combo them. a team where the job of the other two ninjas is to just get the hyuga close to the target would make a lot of sense.
