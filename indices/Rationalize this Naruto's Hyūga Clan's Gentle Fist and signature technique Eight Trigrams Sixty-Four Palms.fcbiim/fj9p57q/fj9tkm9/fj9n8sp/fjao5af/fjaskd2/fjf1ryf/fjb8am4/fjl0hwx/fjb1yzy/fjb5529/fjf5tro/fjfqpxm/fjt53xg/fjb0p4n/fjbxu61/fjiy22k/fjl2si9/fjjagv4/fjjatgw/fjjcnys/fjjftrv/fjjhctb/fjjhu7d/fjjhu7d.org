  they still fairly obviously require a higher tech level than Naruto had

Really only different attitude. Have you seen the tech in Naruto? They have TV and whatever. Did you read Boruto? They were like "oy, these machines are dumdum, real ninjutsu is where it's at".

Rasenshuriken yes. There are lower techniques.

Water dragon thingy: "The user manipulates water into the shape of a dragon, which they then direct at a target."

Here is a relevant jutsu. [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Rock_Gun_Technique]]

The setting is just not that consistent. ESPECIALLY with the tech level, which is all over the place. Kishimoto thought guns don't fit ninjas so they shouldn't exist. Boruto is all about going forwards with that stuff.

But given this sub, I don't think a rational story should have that kind of limit without a good reason.

And throwing kunai should be obsolete, other than that it doesn't use chakra in itself and you can use exploding tags with them.
