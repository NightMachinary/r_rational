I think the main problem with ranged attacks is how fast ninjas in Naruto are. In fact in many cases I'd argue higher level ninja are faster than projectiles. A ranged style is only good for as long as you can keep your opponent at bay and in Naruto ninja are exceptionally good at closing the distance. We see only a few long-range specialists in Naruto, and the premier one also specialises in using close-ranged weaponry (Ten-Ten). A Long-Range specialist would have to rely heavily on stealth and the element of surprise - a tall order in a world so stuffed with not only super-speed, but also massive AoE attacks that destroy cover and a bunch of pretty over-powered sensory abilities that make stealth obsolete as well. It's surprisingly hard to hide in the world of ninjas, because everybody else is also a ninja. And the element of surprise is even harder to utilise properly - even if you get off the perfect snipe there's a pretty good chance your opponent has such fast, ninja reflexes that they can dodge your shot anyway and then your cover is completely blown.

Also an easy way to rationalize the 64 palms is this; this is a world where chakra exists, and is the foundation for so many bullshit invulnerability/avoid death techniques that it can be hard to keep track. The 64 palms (when executed as a kill technique) could easily start with the Gentle Fist equivalent of 'I stab you in the heart!', with the rest of the attacks focusing on shutting of the opponent's chakra system so they can't use some kind of bullshit back-up technique to survive the usually lethal opening barrage.

But here is my main idea. There is perhaps one great Long-Range vs. Close Range battle in Naruto - Kidomaru vs. Neji. In this fight Kidomaru notes that he has to resort to long-range fighting because attempting to go hand-to-hand with a Hyuga is suicide; ninja are entirely dependant on chakra usage, so the moment the Hyuga lands one good hit they can often end the fight. So Kidomaru retreats and starts a long-range fight, only there is one major downside. As I mentioned before, sensory abilities are a direct counter to the stealth and surprise needed to make precision, long-range fighting viable in a world as high-speed as Naruto. And the Hyuga happen to have the most over-powered sensory ability on the planet - the Byakugan. The lengths Kidomaru has to go to just to land a few good hits on Neji are comical, and would be far beyond the abilities of any common ninja - the average combatant in that situation would be forced into close-range (where the Hyuga reign supreme) or would be forced to flee.

So essentially the Hyuga found themselves in one of the few settings where long-range combat is actually at a disadvantage and high-speed, close-range fighting is the norm, and then went about making themselves almost unbeatable in close-range. They essentially force their opponents into long-range (and therefore into disadvantage) and are almost impossible to surprise or snipe; they can literally see an arrow, bomb, or kunai coming from a mile away. When fighting the Hyuga it is often a dead-if-you-do-dead-if-you-don't situation. If you get into close range you die, but if you stay at range you end up against someone with abilities almost optimised for dealing with projectiles.

This whole strategy, of course, breaks down once the enemies get strong enough that they have ways to easily deal with the Hyuga ability to suppress chakra, or have projectiles over-powered enough that the defensive prowess of the Hyuga don't matter. And this of course covers most of the A-S rank bad guys in the series. The Hyuga are a finnicky, but very effective build - it hard counters 90% of their enemies, but is completely in-equipped to deal with the remaining 10%.

But in those few cases they also have plenty of time to see the danger coming and just run away.
