Oops on that first link. :D

But yea, they do a lot of impossible things. Surely they can help aiming with chakra. The dudes can control wires and all kind of items.

Yes, it's from Boruto, but that does not matter. It's the same world and we are arguing if it would be possible. If it is possible when they apply their minds to it, it is definitely possible.

This is from Naruto canon. [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Handheld_Kunai_Launcher]]

Besides, there are a shitton of ranged techniques. Naruto throws Rasenshuriken around. Pretty effective and clearly he can aim it.
