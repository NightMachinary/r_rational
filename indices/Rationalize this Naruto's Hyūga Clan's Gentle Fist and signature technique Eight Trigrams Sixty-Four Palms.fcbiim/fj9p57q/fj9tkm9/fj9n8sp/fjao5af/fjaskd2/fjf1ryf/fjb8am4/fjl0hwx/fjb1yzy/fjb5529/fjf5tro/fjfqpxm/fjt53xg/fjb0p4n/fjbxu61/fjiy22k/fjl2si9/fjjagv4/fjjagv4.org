Okay, hypothetically you could wave your hand and declare that it's possible to use chakra to power a gun - and you definitely are doing so, because chakra isn't real and whether or not you can "apply" that energy in that form is entirely down to an author's discretion - but the fact remains that such devices do not exist in the setting, and as such aren't really relevant to the question of why ranged attacks don't work in Naruto.
