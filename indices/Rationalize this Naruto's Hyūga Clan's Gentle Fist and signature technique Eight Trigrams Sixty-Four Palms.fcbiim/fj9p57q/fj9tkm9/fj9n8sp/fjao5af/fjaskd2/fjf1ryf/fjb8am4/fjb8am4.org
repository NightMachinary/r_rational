I brought this up a few other times, but my understanding is that the multi-kilometer range of Hinata was an extreme aberration and possibly an indicator that she had some kind of mutation that exchanged precision at close range in exchange for extreme range. I believe that this is backed up in canon as Hinata is the only Hyūga who demonstrated a range on her Byakugan that extends beyond close range and the range of Neji (a prodigy) was limited to a few meters.

This seems like a very simple way to explain why the Hyūga primarily focused on close-combat while also removing the ridiculous intelligence advantage that would come from access to such a ludicrously powerful spying tool.
