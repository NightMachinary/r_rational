Hyuuga don't see particularly further than ordinary people though, or with particularly better acuity.

Hyuuga advantages are

1) can see through solid objects 2) expanded field of view (and presumably better ability to process information to compensate for seeing more) 3) can see chakra

The relevance of chakra is that it's easier to spot people, so I assume that suitability for ranged combat is what you mean. But, you have to consider fights that aren't 1v1

Expanded field of view means that a hyuuga sniper is ignoring half of his field of vision (the half behind him), and a hyuuga sniper can't have walls between him and enemies (or he'd have to fire attacks through the walls) so he's ignoring his xray vision, and a hyuuga sniper is vulnerable to return fire. If a hyuuga is assassinating a single target or participating in a sniper duel, that's fine, but the Hyuuga clan developed techniques in a time of clan warfare, as in groups vs groups.

So a Hyuuga sniper launches a distance jutsu, kills one or two enemies, then gets bombarded with return fire, and the best defense he has, the rotation, is chakra demanding and locks him in place. And that defense is still better than what's available to almost any other clan.

But, if a Hyuuga gets into a large group melee, the enemy can't just bombard him without large amounts of friendly fire. On top of that, in a cluster of bodies, a Hyuuga can see far more of what's happening than a normal person, and isn't as vulnerable to getting stabbed from behind as a normal ninja.

In this chaotic melee, the 64 palms becomes far more valuable. It mission kills basically any ninja other than a jinchuuriki, leaves a prisoner for interrogation or ransom, is quick to use, difficult to defend against, has degrees of success other than perfect victory and no-sell, takes a small amount of chakra/stamina and moreover, enemies further away still have to worry about friendly fire for their fallen comrades. Its ideal for messy, long melees between large groups of opponents.

You know how in canon, Madara dances through an army? That's how I imagine every high level hyuuga in the Warring Clans Era

Moreover, despite being just as strong a clan, you'll notice that the Hyuuga never had to deal with the same level of grudges as the Uchiha, which could be for a lot of reasons, but I imagine that ransoming captured ninja rather than executing them probably made them a "less bad" ninja clan to deal with than the more battle happy clans like the Uchiha or Kaguya.

That said, I always wanted to see a Hyuuga puppeteer burying themselves and fight a battle by proxy with puppets, using the Byakugan to see through 20m of earth as chakra threads control a puppet army without putting the ninja at risk.
