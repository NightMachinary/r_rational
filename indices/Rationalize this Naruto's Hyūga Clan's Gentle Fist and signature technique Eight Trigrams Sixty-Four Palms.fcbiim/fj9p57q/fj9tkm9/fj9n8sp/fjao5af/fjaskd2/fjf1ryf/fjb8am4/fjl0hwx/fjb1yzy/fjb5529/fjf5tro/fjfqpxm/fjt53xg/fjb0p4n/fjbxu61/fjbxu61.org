1) Ranged attacks have travel time. Gunpowder isn't a thing so you're looking at bows and arrows at best, and ninja are extremely fast with extreme twitch reflexes. It doesn't matter if you can aim and hit a stationary target 10 kilometers away, you'll never hit a ninja who's aware they're in a fight. You might get an ambush attack on them... but you might not, given that detection techniques are a thing.

Getting closer obviously means less travel time but it also puts you, the dedicated ranged combatant, closer to the dedicated melee combatant. You'd have to find a sweet spot between them being close enough to not be able to dodge, and far enough not to be able to cover the distance and kill you. It's entirely believable that for any real threat in the series, no such range exists.

2) Naruto's tech level isn't advanced enough to create projectiles that can fly straight over those huge distances anyway. You can aim your bow/kunai/whatever as well as you like, imperfections in the metal/ the wind/etc. will have it go off course.

3) Stealth is supposed to be a thing in the setting, even if the manga itself didn't really go for it. Many fights will begin with the parties finding each other at a relatively short range, where the melee combatant will win.

Overall, I think that to be viable any ranged technique needs to either also work as a close-quarters technique, have a negligible travel time (so lasers, or teleporting projectiles?) or have such a large area of effect that the opponent can't dodge even if they see it coming, which is /massive./
