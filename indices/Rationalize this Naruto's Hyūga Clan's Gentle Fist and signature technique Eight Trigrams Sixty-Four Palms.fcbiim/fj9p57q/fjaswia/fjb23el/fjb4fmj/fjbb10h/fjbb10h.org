Yeah, anime logic isn't a great basis for a rational setting, but I still think a rational take on Naruto would get closer to a recognizably-canon setting if they did make ninja tough AF and then make kunai magically sharp through chakra nonsense. Taijutsu still makes sense for keeping your hands free, and Lee's unarmed specialism can be explained by his presence on a nonlethal takedown squad, while also being strong enough to kill with his fists if it came down to that.
