I don't think this is true in canon - at least, not in the manga. I can't remember a single instance of characters not bothering to block attacks because they can't be hurt by them. There's plenty of that stuff in Bleach, but in Naruto? Top tier ninjas are afraid of getting hit with kunai or shuriken, a single punch can break ribs if it's not blocked properly and an explosive tag took out Nagato's legs. I always really liked that semi-realistic feel to it.

Sure, there's parts in the anime where someone gets hurled into a rock and it shatters, and there's a part where Pain gets wacked in the head with a mountain repeatedly by the Kyubi, but I think those parts are best uh... interpreted in a less than literal sense. <_<
