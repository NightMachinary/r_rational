That's fair but if you do take it literally, then it still works. The reason they dodge other hits is because it does comparable amounts of damage. And the fact that they can /survive/ getting hit multiple times by attacks of that class or higher, prove that they are incredibly durable, even if they dodge most of them.

Like boxers can tank multiple hits from their opponent, but they still try and dodge / block each of them.
