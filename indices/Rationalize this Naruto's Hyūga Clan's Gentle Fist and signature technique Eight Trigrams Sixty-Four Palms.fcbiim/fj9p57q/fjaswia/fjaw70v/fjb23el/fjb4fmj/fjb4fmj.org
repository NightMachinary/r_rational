Garden was specifically saying that ranged attacks are useless. That doesn't mesh with what you're saying. Of course, you're right about anime logic being the problem: The reason why characters use kicks instead of knives is because if they used a lethal weapon they'd be much less likely to hit - because the fight would be over if they did. Same with a Rasengan being 99% more likely to hit the enemy if it's used as a finishing move. But if the goal is to make the Naruto world make sense, the question is how to move *away* from all of that.

And honestly, I think the only way to do that is to tone things down a bit. The moment you say that some people can move at near the speed of light, you can forget any hope of keeping things consistent. You can still have people *say* things like that about legendary ninjas, but if it's actually true, your setting is borked.
