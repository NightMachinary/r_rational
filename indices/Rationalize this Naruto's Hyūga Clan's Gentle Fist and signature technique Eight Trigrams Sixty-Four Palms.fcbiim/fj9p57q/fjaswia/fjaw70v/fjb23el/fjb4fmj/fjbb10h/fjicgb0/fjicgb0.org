There's a lack of physics understanding on most people, it just so happens that authors can also be a part of that group.. That's why when you get something like Delve people get so impressed, also balancing is a really rare skill among authors.

Instead of making things mostly balanced between opponents and victories strategic or deception based, most opt for the power creep and move somewhere else when where everyone is stronger for reasons.
