I don't think the Hyūga are particularly better suited to ranged combat, because the hard part of dealing ranged damage has almost nothing to do with seeing your opponent, and because ranged attacks in the Narutoverse are generally fairly lame, barring key exceptions the average ninja can't use.

Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms makes more sense when you take into account that Narutoverse characters are shown to be incredibly tanky (like, immune-to-hypersonic-bullets tanky), and the Hyūga's CQC abilities, while effective, don't have the high damage cap that other movesets can deal.

Then remember that ninjutsu are arbitrary. If you could design a technique that did whatever, nobody's techniques are anywhere close to optimal. Maybe the consecutive doubling thing is just how it has to work.
