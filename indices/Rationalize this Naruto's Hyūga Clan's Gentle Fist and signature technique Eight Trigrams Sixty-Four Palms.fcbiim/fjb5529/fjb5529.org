Suppose that vision or aiming techniques that see people's surfaces are common but which see their chakra innards are rare. How much marginally better is a Hyuuga's aim than anyone else half decent, vs. a Hyuuga's chakra sight over anyone else's? Specialization. Real question is just why they developed it prior to living in a village to complement them, right?
