I would be amazed if it were possible to launch a projectile on a straight path across long distances via a controlled explosion etc. with your hand, and indeed have seen no such technique. Modern handguns are accurate to around 100 feet in the hands of an experienced shooter, with machine-crafted bullets.

Your first edit isn't a real thing, that's a fanon wiki. Those images are from several other anime.

Your second edit refers to Boruto canon, which takes place in the future when the tech level has gone up.
