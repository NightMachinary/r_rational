I have unfortunately never read Homestuck; I do occasionally read things specifically for this podcast, but that seemed like a huge time commitment, and I'm already keeping up with too many serials on top of books coming out.

I know Homestuck does a lot of multimedia, and fully leverages the variety available to it, but not much more than that.
