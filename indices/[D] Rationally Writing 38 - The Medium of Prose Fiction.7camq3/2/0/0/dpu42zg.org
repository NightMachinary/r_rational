Have your read Prequel Adventure?

It's a Homestuck-inspired story with many of the same tools and conventions (second person narration, userbase commands, mix of text and images, flash minigame interludes, etc), but shorter, denser, and more focused thematically.

It uses its tools in really neat innovative ways too, much more than Homestuck does.
