Great points, thanks for bringing those up! I've always considered visual novels to be more belonging to the "comic" genre than the "prose fiction" one, but the line obviously tends to blur at things like light novels, which I'd say definitely lean more toward prose fiction and which I totally forgot about when discussing novels with pictures in them, since I never read any with the associated pictures included :)
