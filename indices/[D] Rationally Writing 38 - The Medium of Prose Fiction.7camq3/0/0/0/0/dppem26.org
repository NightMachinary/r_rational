You could always go onto a recruitment board (I believe [[https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewforum.php?f=58][Lemmasoft]] is still the most active/popular one) to try and find an artist who'd be willing to work with you.

You might run into issues if you're a writer trying to recruit artists, since "writer seeking project/partners" tends to be the most abundant sort of post, but it can be easier if you're willing to fill other roles in the project (like doing the direction/coding yourself). Also, as a writer with a bit of a pedigree and a portfolio, you'd have a leg up on most of the random writers who show up on the recruitment boards; in addition to demonstrating your abilities as a writer, being able to show that you've completed several large projects shows that you're less likely to flake, which is one of the biggest challenges of working on a multi-month project with several internet strangers. If you did post on a recruitment board, it would probably be worthwhile to link to your Goodreads page, which would help communicate that you're a person who finishes projects, plus provide a cache of ratings and reviews that speak to your credibility and capability as a writer. (Of course, prospective recruits would probably want to actually read your writing, but your Goodreads page can provide a nice way to for people to quickly verify that you're worth evaluating as a prospect. One of the things that makes it harder to join projects as a writer rather than artist is that it often takes people longer to evaluate whether a writer is someone that they might want to work with, whereas when it comes to art people can often make this evaluation within a matter of seconds.)

You could also try creating a visual novel using placeholder assets to create a sort of proof-of-concept and then look for an artist once the project had been substantially completed, which would make it a much lower-risk option for prospective artists; having a semi-complete project greatly reduces the risk of you flaking, and it also would allow them to sample your writing and see what kind of project they'd be attaching themselves to before making any kind of commitment. Some artists might find this less appealing, since a mostly-finished project wouldn't give them the chance to be as involved in the creative process (and could lead to them having less latitude when it comes to things like character designs), but if you want to have total creative control over the project, this could be the way to go.

Probably the easiest low-friction way to initiate yourself into the VN development community would be to participate in [[http://www.route59games.com/what-is-nanoreno/][NaNoRenO]], which is a NaNoWriMo-style 1-month game jam. (It starts in March, so you'd probably want to hit the recruitment board some time in February.) It's a good chance to dip your toes into the scene, since it's relatively low commitment, and the low stakes and relatively small scope of the event make it a time when people are willing to try experimental projects with people they haven't worked with before.
