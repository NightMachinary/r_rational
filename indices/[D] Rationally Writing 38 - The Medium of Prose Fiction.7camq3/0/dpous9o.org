On the topic of illustrations in prose fiction: Japanese light novels (not to be confused with manga) are prose novels that include full-page illustrations inserted every few pages or chapters. Usually, these illustrations are provided after the fact: the author writes a prose novel, and an illustrator comes in after the fact to add illustrations of key moments in the story, meaning that these images are not contextually essential to the story. In fact, when I read Japanese light novels, I tend to ignore the pictures, mostly because when I'm immersed in a text-based narrative, interrupting the reading to look at an artist's rendition of a scene is more likely to break my immersion than enhance it. (There are also people who read light novels in formats that exclude the images entirely, as is often the case with fan translations that provide only the text without including scans of the pictures as they appeared in the original Japanese printing.) This style of "illustrated YA novel" seems to mostly be a Japanese phenomenon.

On the subject of Japanese prose fiction, visual novels (which originated in Japan but started crossing over to the west during the 00's) are an interesting case. Visual novels usually take the form of software that run as an executable on a computer or game console, though there are some web-based visual novels. One of the things that's interesting about visual novels is that the player progresses through them line-by-line, allowing the creator to provide a more directed experience, e.g. cues for music changes and sound effects or visual effects can be tied to specific lines in the story. Awhile back I wrote a [[http://www.route59games.com/how-visual-novel-writing-is-different/][blog post]] about some of the more subtle ways that writing for visual novels differs from writing for other forms of prose.

On the subject of formatting complications, one genre of writing that seems to deal with this a lot is litRPG, which focuses on telling stories with a videogame-like progression. It's common for authors to use brackets to connote anything pertaining to a gaming HUD-like interface, e.g. "[15 exp gained]". Formatting can get a bit messy for many authors who like to include stat tables (sometimes showing them just when characters "level up," others providing them as updates/reminders at the end of every chapter), and one of the things that's become apparent is that many websites like fanfic.net and formats like Kindle are really bad at handling tables in a consistent way; Kindle tends to have lots of issues where tables won't "fit" correctly if readers are using a certain font size on their device, among other problems, and the Kindle product family is large and old, forcing you to support a lot of legacy hardware which doesn't handle things the same way the newer Kindles do. This has led to some authors just putting putting their tables as PNGs in the text, rather than trying to insert a properly-formatted table, though some Kindle authors shied away from this because Kindle passes bandwidth costs onto the author, and putting a bunch of PNGs into your ebook is a quick way to increase the file size of your ebook tenfold or more. (I'm not sure if Kindle still handles bandwidth costs this way, though my understanding is that Kindle Unlimited doesn't charge authors for bandwidth costs in the same way, and Kindle Unlimited has become one of the more popular channels for commercial litRPG.)
