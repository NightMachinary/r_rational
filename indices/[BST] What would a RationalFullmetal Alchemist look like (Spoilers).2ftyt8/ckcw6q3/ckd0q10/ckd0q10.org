The manga at least didn't really explore this. Other posters have implied that in the anime Truth (the character) supplies the standard for what is an equivalent exchange. I didn't get that vibe reading the manga, and certainly no one tried to set up a circle of infinite happiness to test the idea.

(Circle of infinite happiness - A likes pies twice as much as cakes, B has the reverse preference. Buy or make one pie give it to A. A exchanges it for two cakes. Give them to B, who exchanges them for four pies. Continue. You now have an exponentially increasing number of cakes/pies)
