This bit pertains to the first iteration of the series, and is mostly informational. The movie [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:_Conqueror_of_Shamballa][Conqueror of Shamballa]] that bookended the first series constructed a dual reality setup; with our reality on one side of the gate and the reality of Fullmetal Alchemist on the other side. They laid out that the entire functional premise of alchemy worked because the FMA reality was constantly drawing energy from the "souls" (of the dead, if I'm remembering correctly) in our reality. This, naturally, had all kinds of ramifications for various characters being morally horrified, etc.
