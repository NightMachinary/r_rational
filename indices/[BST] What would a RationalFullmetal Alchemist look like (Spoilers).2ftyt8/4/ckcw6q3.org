If one accepts that the value of things is subjective the notion of equivalent exchange stops making sense. I think figuring out what the limits of your system of exchange are and why people misinterpreted them as equal value could be a really interesting plot or subplot. Remember not to come up with one idea and have the hero deduce it, come up six and have the hero test each of them.

EDIT: I only watched the first show and not all of it, so if they actually explore that thoroughly you might have to ignore my advice.
