I wouldn't say 99.99%. We do see low skill alchemists pretty frequently, but their abilities seem to fall in a power law distribution (which Ed is near the top of), so it's true that most practitioners definitely aren't getting the same benefits as he is. That said it does look like a learned skill rather than an innate one, so any rational character is probably going to want to become a powerful alchemist, ie not excise their soul. Also since homunculi are created from philosopher's stones, it does appear that sentience does require souls. (At one point Envy's true form is shown, and the souls compromising his philosopher's stone are shown in some sort of hell state.)
