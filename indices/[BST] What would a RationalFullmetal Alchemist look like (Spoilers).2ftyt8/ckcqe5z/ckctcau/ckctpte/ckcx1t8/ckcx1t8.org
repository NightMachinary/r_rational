Well, it's a really complicated mess which is ultimately dependant on how Truth (the 'gate thing' you mentioned, who is the source of +magic+ 'alchemy') measures 'value' when applying the principle of Equivalent Exchange.

Keep in mind this /is/ Brotherhood talk, I'm only familiar in passing with the first Anime.

Alchemy seems to obey Conservation of Matter and Energy on the surface level of things- but Alchemy can also turn living souls into vast amounts of energy. Enough to conjure notable mass out of what seems to be thin air (Alphonse regrows his metal limbs through a Philosophers Stone at one point and the Homunculi can regenerate their entire bodies multiple times over). So either Truth is objective and Souls /really do/ contain that much energy (which begs the question: how did that energy get there in the first place?) or Truth is biased and paying back more than a soul is (meta?)physically made up of for whatever reason.

Anyway, elaborating on my original point:

If I recall correctly, the Puppet Soldiers of Brotherhood were also Homunculi, but unlike the Sin-based Homunculi produced by Father, they were only capable of acting on base instincts without thought, and had no values other than 'consume the flesh of the living'. The Sin Homunculi, on the other hand, were relatively human-like in mental structure (with less empathy, perhaps) and were definitely capable of higher-order thinking.

That's where I got the idea that merely having a Soul (even stolen) wasn't enough to be self-aware, but looking back now I see it was rather weak evidence.
