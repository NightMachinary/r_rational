Souls seem to exist in that world. They at least record a person's personality and memories and can think independently and move bodies they're attached to -- even if that body is a suit of armor.

I don't know if brain damage happens in the FMA universe. I don't know if there's any sort of afterlife in the FMA universe. Resurrection isn't available to most people in the FMA universe -- and the sin homunculi are closer to resurrectibility than normal humans.

As such, I can't see whether having a real soul would be an advantage, but I'm leaning towards "no".
