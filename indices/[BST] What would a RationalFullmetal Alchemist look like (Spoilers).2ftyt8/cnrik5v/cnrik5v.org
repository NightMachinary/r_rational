Possible explanation for why human souls are valued so much by "truth". The more complex something is, the more "processing power" it takes for it to exist in the universe. Maybe there's something like file compression involved. The law of equivalent exchange could maybe be something like (most "compressed" form of a body of matter/energy)*(the number of iterations of that form, or the amount of compression)+(transmutation circle)=>transmutation product. A soul could be the most "compressed" form of a human brain. To have a mind but no soul like a homunculus supposedly would be could mean that their brains are truly fractal, or at least each of the components of their brain would be--there would be no "most compressed" unit of matter/energy that their minds are made of. Or rather, the most compressed form of the their minds would be infinitely small, which means you could not use their minds for a philosopher's stone. And putting Greed's soul in a philosopher's stone would disprove that hypothetical fractal. On top of that, Alphonse's ability to continue living in the suit of armor could be explained by this law. Maybe the inside of his suit of armor has the soul iterations of the different parts of his mind bound to the metal by means of an ongoing alchemical reaction. Every time he needs to repair or move the metal in his suit of armor body, it converts some of his soul iterations into metal. And every time he needs to increase his intelligence (or at least the intelligence of a part of his mind), it converts the metal into soul iterations. The limit, of course, is the largest possible conversions of metal iterations to soul iterations and vice versa, which could probably be approximated to the total amount of "stuff" in the suit of armor. And not all iterations would necessarily be the same size. The ratio of armor-metal iterations to soul iterations is probably really large. It's not infinite, but it would still be a REALLY big ratio, probably.

Furthermore, this might explain how Ed would become a rationalist. He studies the mind/soul extensively after his mother's death in order to recreate hers from a single piece of her (this world's equivalent of brain tissue), and of course one of the questions he asks is "can i transmute stuff from my own mind/soul?" Of course, he probably would finds out how dangerous this is, and then he might hypothesize that he has to be completely aware of what parts of his mind/soul he's transmuting and what parts he's not, so as not to get any important parts of himself transmuted. So he makes it a personal project to make himself more self-aware and check to see if that makes it safer for him to transmute stuff from his mind. Of course, it doesn't, and he later might find out why,, how his brain is actually structured and starts delving into neuroscience. He keeps going with the self-awareness/rationalist stuff anyway because its useful, even if it doesn't help him transmute stuff from his own brain.
