As a straight up rationalist adaptation, agreed. While it's not impossible to do a rationalist fiction off less irrational stories, it certainly leaves less room for "improvement" the better the original is.

That said, a Rational!Edward could have a much bigger goal if they're also a transhumanist.

After accepting the failure of trying to revive his mother, maybe he would persist in trying to use alchemy to end death, through biological alchemy that reversed aging. He would also probably also be able to justify the use of a Philosopher's Stone that's already been made by someone else, rather than reject it for being "evil." The whole question of "what is a soul" is extremely important in a world where you can turn souls into fuel for magic.
