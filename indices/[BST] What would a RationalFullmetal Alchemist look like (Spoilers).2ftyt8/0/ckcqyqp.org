It depends on how much "do what I mean" is built into alchemy. Given what I remember of the show, there's quite a bit, but I still don't think that you'd be able to just make things that you have no knowledge of (like nanotechnology). Alchemy also seems to completely violate the laws of thermodynamics, replacing them with the law of equivalent exchange (and presumably others). It does seem like it would be much more useful in a non-combat role than a combat role, if only because people are squishy and don't handle being struck by lightning all that well. So either they're in a support role (transmuting hunks of metal into guns for example), heavy artillery (throwing fireballs, or using alchemy to launch heavy rocks), or pretty much anything else but being on the front lines.

I can't remember what it exactly takes to be an alchemist, but I think that if I were the state, I would be outfitting as many people as possible with pre-made alchemy circles that could be activated with only the bare minimum of training.

I think one of my favorite aspects of the show was that all the alchemists had their own little "knack" that they were good at exploiting - I think I would ramp that aspect up as much as possible.

Overall though, I don't think that the lore is particularly ripe for being given the rational treatment - the show does a pretty good job of being clever with the powers as they're presented.
