Combat alchemy is presented as absurdly powerful, at least as practised by some people. Judging by the Ishval scenes with Mustang and Kimbley, I would put the destructive power of at least certain alchemic techniques on par with or higher than that of nuclear weapons. (Mustang in particular is shown singlehandedly literally levelling multiple cities with apparent ease.) That's not a level of destructive capability you can get from a tank.

As for premade circles, it is stated that the knowledge of the transmutation is the primary element required. It would not be possible for an alchemist to utilise a circle they couldn't create themselves. The inability to transfer alchemic artifacts is what leads to the specialisation. You can't just have a doctor draw a circle for you and know a bit about alchemy to heal someone; you have to be an alchemist and a doctor yourself.

Another thing to consider is that the laws of physics are quite different. While we know the chemical elements are the same, chemistry obviously doesn't work the same as in our universe, and it is quite questionable whether something like nanotechnology would even be physically plausible in the FMA universe.

I don't think trying to make a universe based on an overlay of our physical laws will work very well at all really, and that an entirely new set of laws is required.
