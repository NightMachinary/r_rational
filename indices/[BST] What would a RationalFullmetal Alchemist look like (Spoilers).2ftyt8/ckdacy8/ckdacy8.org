Somewhere, someone even half-smart compiles a simple ontology involving alchemy, and immediately goes, "wait, how is *any of this* 'equivalent'?"

Everything immediately breaks when they look at it too closely. And then they are killed by Envy.

But seriously.

  could you transmute nanotechnology?
#+end_quote

Why would anyone imagine making it in the first place? This is a vaguely industrial revolution tech-level world. Why would someone imagine that there is "room at the bottom" if they don't even know about anything smaller than atoms?

#+begin_quote
  Does alchemy ignore thermodynamics or does it draw power from somewhere?
#+end_quote

The show already answers the question about thermodynamics and power draw. Sort of. That means you'd need to make up a better answer, one that doesn't involve magic. Literally magic.

  Why does Truth place such a hugh value on human 'souls'?
#+end_quote

Maybe Truth's just wrong. Or misunderstood. Or lying. Or talking down to people. This seems like an odd point to bring up.

#+begin_quote
  I'm particularly fascinated by the idea of a Rational!Brotherhood, with the potential for some truly non-human homunculi.
#+end_quote

Why would something literally called a "little man" be non-human? Made from humans...

--------------

It seems like you want a new story, using the FMA rules for something else entirely. I'd be down for that.

How about this:

Modern day setting, protagonist discovers one of Father's books on alchemy. Rules work like FMA, so rational answers need to be discovered from clues about how it appears to work. Standard expanding power fantasy and such, until alien beings with incredible powers bust in the door and start doing things that seem to violate even the new rules they've been working out for alchemy.

The new enemies (and why are they enemies?) have inhuman names, which represent mental and emotional attributes in their alien species. Think about what "Lust" would mean to a worker ant, for example. Or "Envy" to a tree. These are linked to real world issues for the aliens they are "homunculi" of, but won't be the same as for humans. And might include things that wouldn't matter as much to homosapians.

Our protagonist discovers all the names of the aliens after attempting a human transmutation to save a loved one from dying. They fail, and in the process, they also lose one of their mental faculties with bizarre consequences. This all happens because of a strange alien sitting in front of what looks a lot like a Stargate:SG1 gate. The alien claims to be god. Our protagonist forgets this, which makes things difficult when they wake up without the ability to <x>. But they now have all the names of their foes, and a close English translation of what the words mean...which they got through automatic writing while suffering brain damage. /Questionable/.

Lots of fights, lots of ontological arguments with readers, all while the protagonist has to protect themselves with alchemy and also compensate for their lost mental ability. This goes on until the protagonist figures out what powers might be possessed by the aliens coming after them and how to counter them by taking advantage of their ultra-focused and limited competencies. The protagonist eventually finds the real villain, the power source, and the reason the aliens are after them in the climactic showdown on Mars. All of which could be worked out by the reader from the start, but it was just obscured by all the fancy lights and fights.

The world as we know it does not survive this story. /Clearly/.
