So because specific attention was drawn to it this chapter, I thought I'd take a look at David's continually expanding string of numbers. After spending some time on it, I've concluded that it's too difficult for me or is some in-joke that I don't understand. It isn't a basic cipher or ASCII and isn't evenly divisible by 3 for trigrams. It doesn't grow by any pattern I can see (+4, +12, +10, +29 so far). It does seem to be added to each time rather than changed (except for a possible typo in chapter 2, where the final digit is a 9 and in later chapters the digit in the same position in the sequence is a 5).

It is, of course, somewhere in the digits of pi but since the same can be said for any sequence of numbers I don't think it's important.
