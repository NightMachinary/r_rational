Ah thanks a lot for your comments! Really appreciate it, and probably you're right about the point on the story. I was thinking of characterizing them before starting the plot but will think how to avoid it taking too long.

About the polyamory part. Its more clear in the Light Novel and a side story they released from Setsuna's POV in which she considers the idea during the spring resort but finally discards it due to the awkwardness everybody felt.

Will try to improve it based on your suggestions. Thanks a lot!
