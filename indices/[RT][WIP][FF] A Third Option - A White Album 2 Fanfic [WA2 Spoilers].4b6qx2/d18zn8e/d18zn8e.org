I don't remember Setsuna considering polyamory, but it was fairly clear to me throughout the series that it was the magic bullet solution to their problems.

You seem to be starting your fic very early into the story. I would have started from a key point of divergence, since the meat of the story would presumably be from the point where Setsuna begins to attempt to convince herself / the others to trial polyamory, and then as they give it a go.

I think there is probably a really good story to be written based on this premise though anyway, so good luck.
