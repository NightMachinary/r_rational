It definitely reads that way, at least at that time it did. And even if it's altered to indicate that Voldemort simply didn't think things through enough to think "non lethally subdue" as opposed to "kill", then this explanation still shouldn't work on Harry. And it also still rings false. You value someone's life but you get annoyed enough by their completely understandable actions to resort to murder? That story still doesn't place Voldie in a good light at all. If anything, he almost comes off worse. "Oh I'm actually quite reasonable but wasting my time or annoying me will earn you death, just the same." It also indicates a lack of foresight on Voldemort's part that an intelligent 50 something year old Dark Lord shouldn't portray. It doesn't compute to the reader and it certainly shouldn't compute to Harry. James' death is almost understandable. Almost. But Lily's is pointless and should alienate Harry to Voldemort.
