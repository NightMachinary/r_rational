One suggestion I can think of is: have Lily escalate. Have Voldemort take her not seriously, assuming she's a non issue. Have Lily throw out an AK, or a vial of dangerous potion, something to surprise Voldie. And have him retaliate, almost instinctively, and have her die that way. Something along this sort of line, maybe:

"I offered your mother leniency, you know. Simply step aside and let me have the boy and I would leave her unharmed. Stunned and obliviated of course, but unharmed. At first, she seemed willing to take my offer. She placed you in the crib and stepped away. As I walked forward and leveled my wand at your sleeping form, only the barest spark at the end of my senses revealed her intentions. I turned and only barely avoided the vial of potion she'd thrown at me, along with the follow up bone breaking hex. I admit,she'd taken me off guard, and it was not until I'd already leveled my wand at her and said the words that I realized just what I'd done. But magic like the Killing Curse cannot simply be taken back. And then she was dead."
