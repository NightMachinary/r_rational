I can't say I'm glad of your somewhat blunt criticism, but your precise complaint about the Godric's Hollow flashback does call my attention to something I could indeed make clearer. The idea wasn't that casting an AK /in itself/ was faster than casting a Stunning Spell; it's that Voldemort was somewhat exasperated by the current situation, and didn't take the time to think things through.
