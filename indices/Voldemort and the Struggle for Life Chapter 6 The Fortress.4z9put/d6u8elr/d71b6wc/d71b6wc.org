(I'm the writer.)

Your criticism is warranted: this is for all intents and purposes my first fanfic, and I admit it is far from perfect. However, I think you misunderstood some things. First and most importantlty Voldemort /isn't/ "aghast that Hagrid says he killed people", at all. He expected as much, and he can't deny that he did kill people. What he says is that it isn't necessarily a sign of being unredeemably evil, as demonstrated by the fact that Harry just killed Quirrel. At least such was my intent; it is possible that I am to blame for not making that clear enough.

As for why maledictions werent used by Trelawney's parents, who said they weren't? The story isn't over and... well, you sort of caught a bit of foreshadowing without understanding it /was/.
