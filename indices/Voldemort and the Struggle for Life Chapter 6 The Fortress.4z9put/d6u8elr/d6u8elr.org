This Voldemort isn't convincing to me at all. Sorry. He's also not very consistent. At first Voldemort seems aghast that Hagrid told Harry that he killed people, and decides that Dumbledore is meddling. But then in chapter four, he's very blase about having killed people. These don't make sense when they're put together.

If maledictions are so powerful, then why aren't they used more widely? Trelawney learned about them from her family, which means that her family members had to know. Why didn't they use maledictions, then?

I've read a lot of stories that try to situate Voldemort in a benevolent position on the spectrum, and this is one of the more contrived ones.

Also there are technical problems (e.g. missing quotation marks). Some of these could, charitably, be assumed to be because the author isn't familiar with English (I have no idea whether or not this is true, but I try to give the benefit of the doubt), but others (like spelling "Lily" as "Lilly") strike me as a sign of just not caring very much.

EDITED to expand the last paragraph.
