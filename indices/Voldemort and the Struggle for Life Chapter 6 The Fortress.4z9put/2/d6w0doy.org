I read the first four chapters and I find this tale fairly uninspired. The Voldemort reads like a Voldemort that looked up to HPMOR's Quirrelmort and aspired to be like him without having the necessary components. Voldemort's explanation of the murder of Harry's parents rang especially false. Not so much the part where he regrets killing them. But the part where he said "Oh, I suppose I could have stunned her instead of using the killing curse but I wanted the matter to be over and done with quickly." Without even questioning that stunning her would've been just as easy, not three lines earlier, he told us that he wanted to honor James and so allowed him a 5 minute duel. Those two action don't compute. You want things to be over with so quickly, you won't take the extra second to subdue her nonlethally yet you'll have a pointless, attention drawing fight out of some misplaced sense of honor? A sentiment you disparage just a few lines later when talking about Lily's sacrifice?

There's also a few two many typos for me to take this story seriously. Overall, wasn't a very good read. I wouldn't recommend it unless the author does a rehaul.
