I'm glad the author is writing this, and I don't intend to be discouraging at all. That said, I can think of a number of suggestions to improve the author's writing technique.

At the top of my list is the narrative perspective. The author seems to be using third-person omniscient, including the inner thoughts of multiple characters within a scene. If the drama is intended to be character-focused (e.g. can the protagonist trust this other character) a crucial component of that is having a restricted perspective. If the reader can see inside both characters' heads and conclude "yes, trust is warranted" then the question is answered and further exploration of the topic becomes tedious. I understand it's easy to draft an outline with an omniscient perspective to ensure people do things that make sense, but at the end of the day, this needs to turn into a drama. There are narratives that can be dramatically recounted from an omniscient perspective (e.g. many fables or morality stories) but I don't get the impression it's suitable for the sort of story the author intends to write.

Has anyone else here got any suggestions for bridging the gap between an omniscient outline and a dramatic character-focused retelling? I'd like to see what we can do to keep commentary and criticism in this community positive/constructive, and I think narrative perspective is a key issue in the development of rational-style fiction.
