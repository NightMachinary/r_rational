Full body cryopreservation that would even hypothetically allow full resuscitation is really rare, really expensive, and mostly just impractical. Most cryopreservation is just done on the head, with the eventual goal of copying the brain structure into a new brain, or uploading it.

Frankly, I think even if you /do/ go whole-body preservation, you're prolly gonna get good brain scanning tech before you get the kinda full-body-reconstruction tech that it'd take to undo all the damage anyway
