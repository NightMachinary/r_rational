/shrug/ That's a problem no matter which way you cut it. Anybody with the knowhow to undo all the damage from long-term cryopreservation (not to mention the damage from whatever ended your life in the first place, since the barbaric laws we have in place right now require you to be dead before you can be preserved) is gonna have the knowledge to mess around with yer brainmeats in whatever way they like.

In the end, you just gotta trust that the people doing this honestly care about preserving /people,/ that they'd value your honest point of view and personality, and that they'll pull through on all their agreements as best they can.
