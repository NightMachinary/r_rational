If they've got the tech to pick your brain that casually, then they've got the tech to revive you. With any hope at all, you'd get brought back well before /that/ kind of thing became a problem.

Here's what I mean about it being chancy: We've got tons of ways of preserving structure that /look/ good. But we don't know enough about neurology yet to really know for sure whether they /are/ good, whether they do preserve the structure of the brain enough or not. Further, we don't really know what the tech to read the brain is gonna look like. It could be that the chemicals used in modern vitrification processes completely make brain scanning impossible for one reason or another.

And we /won't/ know these things until the research advances, until the brain scanning tech starts to come out on at least a theoretical level. Until that point, you really are taking a chance at preserving the structure as best you can and hoping that's enough. But like I said, it's /the best chance you have./

And I think there's nothing passive about encouraging people to shop around, to always demand the best service and the best technology. /Very very few/ people have the capability to impact the field directly, so being an /active consumer/ of the field is the best you can do there. Well, and petitioning governments and helping with advertising, donating money to research institutes, and so on, but all that goes without saying.
