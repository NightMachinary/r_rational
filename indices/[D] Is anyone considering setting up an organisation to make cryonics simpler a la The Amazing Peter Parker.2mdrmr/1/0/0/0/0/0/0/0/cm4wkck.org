I don't think you need to be hyperbenevolent to want to save someone from death and to keep them whole and intact. Not being a psychopath is pretty much all you need. The trust fund that a cryo patient sets up to pay for their maintenance and eventual retrieval is hopefully enough to provide incentive for the business side of things, anyway. Just gotta wait til the tech is cheap enough that they can profit off of it. Maybe a little sooner than that if they /do/ just happen to be 'hyper' benevolent :P

It's true, the chances at cryo working at all are fuzzy at best, and probably not all that good. But it beats the pants off being dead for sure. And right now, I think it's the best that's out there. If something better pops up, if a new place comes by with a better business plan, by all means switch. But for now, a place like alcor or the cryonics institute is the best you're gonna get if you suffer a heart attack or a car crash or otherwise just up and stop living for whatever reason.

Anyway, it sounds like you're looking for something more along the lines of suspended animation rather than cryo. I haven't heard of anything like that, sadly. Even if the tech was available, I fear the politics of it would be untenable, and there'd be no reputable places to get yourself preserved. And the politics are prolly gonna be a tougher thing to fix than the tech, anyway.
