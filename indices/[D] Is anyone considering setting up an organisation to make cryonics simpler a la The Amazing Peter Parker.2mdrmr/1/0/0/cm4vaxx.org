  Full body cryopreservation that would even hypothetically allow full resuscitation is really rare, really expensive, and mostly just impractical.

Well, I guess someone had better get on fixing that, hadn't they?

  Frankly, I think even if you do go whole-body preservation, you're prolly gonna get good brain scanning tech before you get the kinda full-body-reconstruction tech that it'd take to undo all the damage anyway

In which case, why are people being advised to sign up for existing preservation? It doesn't actually sound like a very good idea.
