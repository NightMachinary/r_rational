Have you considered setting up an organization to make cryonics /work/, with rigorous trials and all that? And I don't mean "probabilistically work", where an ideal Bayesian assigns a nontrivial, much-larger-than-Solomonoff-prior objective-informational probability to the concept that the partial animal trials done so far imply a human /could/ be reanimated or, God help him/her, brain-uploaded, provided the assistance of a Friendly superintelligence...

I just mean rigorous trials showing that after killing a bunch of rats and putting them through the cryonics treatment, successful resuscitations can actually be performed.
