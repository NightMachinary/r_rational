  I don't think you need to be hyperbenevolent to want to save someone from death and to keep them whole and intact. Not being a psychopath is pretty much all you need.

Really? To prevent someone from taking a peek at the client's memories when it's late one night around the lab and they've been on the drink a bit and are looking for a laugh?

  It's true, the chances at cryo working at all are fuzzy at best, and probably not all that good. But it beats the pants off being dead for sure.

No. It /is/ being dead. Reality doesn't roll a die to determine if it works or not, it either works or not when you're "preserved". Your subjective probability does not correspond to a real randomness in the world.

  If something better pops up, if a new place comes by with a better business plan, by all means switch.

Why am I hearing a passive attitude like this from anyone in this community? If there's a problem: "you found it, you fix it."

(And yes, there is an actual reason /I'm/ not fixing this problem, which is that I have most of my professional training in computer science, biased towards the theoretical side, and none at all in medical biology, mortuary biology, or neuroscience. I've got /other things to do./)
