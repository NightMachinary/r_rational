Well, if you can destroy them immediately after being uploaded, then you can destroy them (or figure out a suitable legal action to make them regret it in some other way) after they attempt to blackmail you.

I don't think they'd really try much unless you immediately won the lottery or something. You're probably not gonna have many assets to your name after being dead for (presumably) at least a medium-amount of time. Not to mention how different economics is prolly gonna be by that point.

Beats being dead either way.
