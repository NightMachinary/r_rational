Wasn't really doing it on purpose---even with self-awareness as to how the personality shift works (pools have been pooling for a while, now), the sheer flood of rich experiences sort of took Aftran by surprise. It may have reacted differently, if it had known in advance (e.g. by "gerrymandering" those traits and keeping them contained in a smaller subset of its identity). But yeah, "farming" is a good metaphor, and that's explicitly how I was trying to make "let's cooperate" even /possible/ as a thing-Yeerks-could-think.
