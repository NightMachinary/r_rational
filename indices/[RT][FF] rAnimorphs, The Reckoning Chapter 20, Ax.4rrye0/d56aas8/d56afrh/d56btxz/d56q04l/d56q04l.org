A good amount of the animorphs series was ghostwriters...KA Applegate wrote the first few, the last few, some of the more impactful ones in the middle, and was involved with the overall plot, but a whooooole lot of 'em were written by one-off authors telling one-off stories. Most were never brought up again in spite of the story impact (oatmeal, starfish cloning) while some kept coming back in spite of how dumb they were (helmacrons, friggin SARIO RIP).

Honestly, part of the advantage [[/u/TK17Studios]] has is that he's one guy trying to tell one story, so he's free to pick and choose what he puts in, regardless of publishability or general appeal or any metric /besides/ what he thinks makes a good story. Ms Applegate had none of those freedoms.
