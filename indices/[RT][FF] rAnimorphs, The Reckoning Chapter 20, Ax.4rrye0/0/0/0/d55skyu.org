Hm. So that must mean Cassie's death is /important/, if Crayak spent whatever game points he had just for eliminating her. Presumably this pushes things towards making Jake more militant, the rest of the team not trusting Yeerkified Ax, or something. But I imagine it's going to be difficult, as a writer, to explain why Cassie's death was important since we'll never get to see the counterfactual world where it wasn't.
