I /love/ the Ellimist too, very in-keeping with "winning with the lightest possible touch" theme of canon. Only because Erik prevents violence do the two yeerks who are the key to memetically infecting the rest of the yeerks with kindness surviving. Only because Marcos dad was the type who needed a Yeerk was any sort of alliance possible. Only because Ax is isolated does the alliance generate a second Andelite-Yeerk merge capable of destroying Alloran-Esplin's hegemony. The way it was set up, it /looked/ like the Ellimist was saving them from loss, but really they've been handed a clear way to win.

I'm a bit puzzled by Cassie's death, though. I'm not sure how Cassie dying helped this outcome, and I bet he could have prevented that with some subtle manipulations without additional trouble. Do the rules of the game somehow necessitate her to choose a self-sacrificing path? Perhaps Cassie would've beat Ax to this decision and that would have ruined things.
