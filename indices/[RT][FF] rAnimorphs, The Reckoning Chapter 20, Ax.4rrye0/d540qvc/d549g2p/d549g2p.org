EVERYTHING IS SO TROUBLING AND UNFORTUNATE is how I felt when I first started imagining an Animorphs universe where everyone at least tried to think it through. Last update, I think [[/u/Salivanth][u/Salivanth]] summed up the story as "And then it got worse."

I'm really, really glad that Rachel and Cassie are passing muster; as (in some ways) the least "rational" characters, it was really important to me that I do something approaching a steelman version of each.

Yay people like Garrett! I waited a whole extra cycle to give him his first viewpoint chapter because I was nervous about including original characters in pivotal roles. He emerged from brainstorming re: "Well, Tobias can't be a hawk, now, so..." and then my thinking about how weird it was that someone as empathetic and loyal as he was didn't have /anybody/ from his earlier life to care about?
