TK forgot to mention that the oatmeal is part of the original canon. I own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Underground_(Animorphs)][the book in question]], and it was never mentioned again afterward, as best as I can tell. It also had a tendency to drive Yeerks insane, but apparently not this version.
