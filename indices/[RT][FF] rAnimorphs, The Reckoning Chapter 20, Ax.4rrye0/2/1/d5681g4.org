Changed to "in the past thousand years, there hasn't been a murder, not one." I dunno if the explanation will ever show up in text, but I think I'm going with the Dune-esque "if any pool is discovered to be a true killer (rather than an absorber or willing to nix a shard here or there), all the other pools will unite to kill it, and by kill it we mean scatter its shards in the dust, taking none of them into ourselves."
