...OATMEAL? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

EDIT: Okay, read it through. Feedback so far:

- Why thank you for the shout out. Though I'll point out it spelled Couteau*Bleu*. Do not taint my silly french pseudonym with dirty english words, please :p

- I feel the inclusion of the oatmeal trick is a bit strange. For one, it might seem to come out of absolutely nowhere to people unfamiliar with canon (or even people who skimmed that particular book). Plus, it kind of... does come from absolutely nowhere. There have been no mentions or hints so far that any alternative source of yeerk nutrition, even portable Kandronas, existed. Besides, how did they learn about the possiblity? Did one their yeerks forget his three-day deadline and go "Um, I guess it's a good thing I ate this extremely specific brand of Kellogg's this morning!". Also, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ9C1VfuWok][DRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGS]]!!!!!!!

- "Right, I remember that bit about a robot army stopping the Holocaust-"... That made me laugh :p Though it does raise a lot of questions about what the Cheys were doing during, well any major war.

- I like that moment when the yeerks hear Erek proposing to send them back to V3 and start going completely off-track. The little we've seen so far of yeerks was very constrained, we saw them take very little initiative. It's nice that they have occasions to do so now.

- "Screw the larger war!" That's right man, go rogue! Do your own thing! Create your path! Forget conventions, forget hierarchy, forget your training, do what comes to mind!

- Ax decides that his people was entirely at fault for the yeerk war, and commits major treason in what seems to be a few days. That's a bit rash, and really not something you should decide unilaterally. Marco or Rachel could probably have pointed out that, so far, they only have the yeerk version of the events, and no way to verify their claims or ask for Seerow's version.

- And Marco's dad is a voluntary controller now. It's almost as if cosmic forces had noticed Marco was about to get his father back, and said "No. You shall angst so more." Which... well, it's Animorphs. Marco's life is suffering and angst. Man, now I can't wait until V1 shows up.

- Ax berating himself for not listening in school/training is a nice nod to canon. The book that comes to mind is the one with the Sario Rip, where Ax goes <So, you see, the simultaneous firing of our weapons took us across space and time to this other location of your planet.> "How... does that make any sense?" <Well, in fact, there is a perfectly simple explanation, which is that... to be honest, I don't remember. I was mostly paying attention to a pretty girl when they covered the subject>

- I don't know if anyone in the group has thought it through, but V3 only has minor responsibility for Astran's death. Most of it was probably already dead by the time the asteroid hit, killed by the pool's explosion. The kids have the excuse of not completely knowing what they were doing, though.

- Garett's "If they all.. um... learned the power of friendship" made me chuckle.

- In an alternate universe, space-faring humans discovered the yeerks, and instead of hoarding their knowledge, they gave them access to Wikipedia. Then everything went fine. Remember to donate to Wikipedia, for the sake of human kind.

- The yeerks say there's never been a murder in their entire history. I'm not sure that makes sense. I mean, yeerk coalescions seem to live in unique circumstances, but there must have been occasions where waging war on the pool next door was a valid option? If you need resources and you can reproduce, at some point the resources become scarce and you have to find some way to allocate them. Inside one pool, that's easy, because the overmind can decide how to split resources between neurons (though there might be 'tumor' yeerks who defect anyway). But between pools, as soon as the resources become scarce, there should be coordination problems, prisoner's dilemmas, and overall times a pool decides that cheating and stealing the other pool's resources is better.

- Which brings another question... how do coalescions reproduce? I imagine that, for a single coalescion, producing more yeerk mass would a process of eating and digesting nutrients and turning them into neurons, but what about macro reproduction? Does a coalescion split in two, then use gedds or other animals as transit to transport one of the halves to another pool?

- I wonder if at some point, someone will consider calling Cassie's ghost for advice on how to handle the whole "yeerks want to be nice" thing.

- How big is the Z-space rift separating Earth from everything? Because if the yeerks can travel between stars in a few days, but need several months to go through it and even longer to go around it, it must be pretty huge.

- ... Wait a sec, what happened to Ax's earplugs?

- I hope that, in future chapters, we get to see yeerks talk with the kids about moral issues and war-related dilemmas, and explore those issues deeper than canon did. Like Yudowsky said, there's a lot more to be said about ethics than "sometimes things are complicated" and "most people are neither pure good nor pure evil", but canon Animorphs mostly stopped at that. I'd be interested if the kids bounced more ideas at the yeerks, and talked about things like prisoner dilemmas, multipolar traps, the ethics of killing innocents in a war, utilitarianism in general, etc. This stuff will be important to how the kids move forward anyway.

And I think I'm done for now. Uh, that was longer than expected.
