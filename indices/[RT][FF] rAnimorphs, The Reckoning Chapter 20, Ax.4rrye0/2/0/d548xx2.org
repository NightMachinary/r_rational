Ack ack *bleu* see, this is where I start to feel Axious, because I /remember/ being very specific about not getting that wrong, and yet.

- The oatmeal (on top of the asteroid) is part of my ongoing campaign to get the readers to feel the whole "the enemy is also smart" thing. My hope was that it /would/ startle/come out of nowhere, but that after thinking for ten seconds, readers would be like, oh, of course, /I'd/ be working on a Kandrona substitute, wouldn't I, especially once I started having access to human chemists and nutritionists, the bionutrients available on Earth are incredibly diverse ... man, these guys are doing their homework ... uh-oh."
- re: Ax committing major treason and acting unilaterally, yup. Almost like the guy was unstable or something. It's been interesting to see the range of reactions to his choice, with some finding it incredibly beautiful and positive, and others on the edge of their seats with apprehension.
- There's never been a murder in Yeerk history because it's almost always easier to just eat/subsume the other pool. And yeah, in the process, "your" own views change, but this is just How The World Works for the Yeerks, and the idea of maintaining and defending a certain set of opinions (soldier mindset) versus being open and curious and just seeing what's out there (scout mindset) is one the Yeerks would find deeply weird. If you and I are pools, and you and I are competing for resources, you and I become one and then allocate resources sensibly. It helps that Yeerk exchange between pools is the route for both sexual and memetic reproduction, making /not/ doing that extremely unappealing.
- Pools reproduce like beehives. The masses grow through the consumption of nutrients in the water (plankton, algae), and when they get too big, they send out hosts in all directions in search of a new un- or underinhabited body of water. Once they find one, a whole bunch of hosts all go there and unload at once, and a new mass forms.
- The earplugs can be turned on and off (plus one for noticing; I was falling asleep last night and was like CRAP I didn't make that explicit; oh, well, no one will think of it; CRAP what about chaosmosis and CouteauBleu).
- I think there will be more discussions of ethics, although without Cassie to pull the pendulum in one direction, it's not clear where the group will end up. I had a sentence in here that I struck, for awkwardness, where Ax basically thought, "Yep, this war is largely our fault and we definitely bear the responsibility for investigating the possibility of peace, AND ALSO we're still going to kill the fuck out of them as long as we're in open warfare, don't think I'm going soft or nothin'."
