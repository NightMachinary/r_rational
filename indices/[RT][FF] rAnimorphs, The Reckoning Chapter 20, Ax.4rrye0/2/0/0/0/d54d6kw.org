Eh, remember, in this AU Kandrona is something like a complex protein, not an energy ray. The Yeerks will obviously be able to synthesize and manufacture it eventually, but they only discovered space like four years ago and just got off their planet two years ago. It's on the list (high on the list, even), but it's not something they've managed to do yet, in part because from a Yeerk perspective, who would /want/ to stay out of the coalescion for long periods of time?

As for the earplugs---there's a line of telepathically-activated technologies that the Andalites have that are theoretically Yeerk-proof. Think about the self-destruct on the Iscafil device, which the kids could trigger even if they got infested. The part of Ax that can turn the earplugs on and off is deep, deep within his personality, tied to his motive will in a way that the Yeerks can't manipulate.

That's still a HUGE GAPING HOLE, because there are other ways to manipulate a person besides raw compulsion. But it's a HUGE GAPING HOLE the Andalites haven't found, yet, because all of their anti-infestation tech is largely untested. Again, the war is young, and thus far only Alloran's been taken---they haven't seen the sort of mind-twisting that (e.g.) Ramsay pulled on Theon, which would be sufficient to cause them to do whatever you wanted "of their own free choice."

Considering tweaks re: murder; perhaps I can 80/20 it by just saying that murder is extremely rare, hasn't happened since the Compact, all pools unite to destroy murderers, etc.
