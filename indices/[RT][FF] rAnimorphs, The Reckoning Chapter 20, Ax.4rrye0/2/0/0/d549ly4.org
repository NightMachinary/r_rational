I think that portable Kandronas would have made more sense. Or something like "What, you really thought we only had one Kandrona on earth? We have, like, ten of those in the mothership just in case one malfunctions". While reading this version, I mostly ignored the tactical implications and just went "Really? OATMEAL?", and I got the impression that all the kids except Ax did the same.

  the idea of maintaining and defending a certain set of opinions (soldier mindset) is one the Yeerks would find deeply weird
#+end_quote

I don't know. It's not like we've ever seen hive-mind alien species, so we're being as speculative as it gets, but I feel the "aggressive genes dominate and spread, passive genes disappear" dynamic would still be there, so hives would still want to defend themselves. In particular:

  If you and I are pools, and you and I are competing for resources, you and I become one and then allocate resources sensibly.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but I can choose to fuse with you in a way that is mostly me and not a lot of you, instead of dividing food/hosts/whatever equally. If I keep defecting and others keep cooperating, I do the same over and over again and cover the planet in "me", and the end result is a planet covered in defectors anyway. There is the mitigating factor that hives have an easier time checking for the other's intentions (capture the other hive's scouts and read their minds), so cooperation is easier to enforce, which means yeerks will have a greater tendency towards cooperation than other species. But there are still conflicts.

Although, whatever the context, "get eaten by another hive" is still super-different from "get erased by a friendly meteor strike to the face", so it's much more shocking to yeerks when the second one happens.

  The earplugs can be turned on and off

Mhh nope, try again :p There's no reason the engineers designing those earplugs would put an off-switch in them, especially since it would make Andalites vulnerable to torture-then-infestation if yeerks ever figure it out.
