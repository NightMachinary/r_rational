Ho. Ly. Shit.

This was stupidly well written. I enjoyed the entire thing. Yet again, you prove to do some amazing things to the Animorphs universe. I was very impressed throughout the entire chapter and I'm loving your portrayl of the aliens we've come to know from canon.

A take on Yeerk culture that makes a startling amount of sense while also being completely unexpected.

A plausibly done example of what might happen to a telepathic race in a socially isolated, high stress environment.

The Chee knowing their programming is flawed and doing their best to help the protagonist avoid the pitfalls of it. While also being constrained by it. Done really, really well.

Visser Three...wow, Visser Three. The borderline megalomaniacal actions make a startling amount of complete and utter sense. Any sane, rational being that's intimately familiar with the self sharing culture of the Yeerks should be well and truly terrified of memetic threats. Of course, now the question is just what Visser Three's end game is. An obvious side benefit is Esplin's ability to exist independently and indefinitely by being that guy that helps in the war. And now I'm curious as to why he's Visser Three and not Visser One considering he's a sort of super Yeerk.

Anyway, great work man. Really enjoyed it :)

EDIT: Also question [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]], is this the first time Ax has tasted something in human morph? I ask because his reaction seems very excessive (although that could be attributed to his fraying mental state)
