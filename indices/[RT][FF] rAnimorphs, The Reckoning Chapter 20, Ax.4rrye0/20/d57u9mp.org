Hey, I just caught up with the story and wanted to thank you. It's a wonderful retelling of a story that meant a lot to me as a child, a very fine blend of consistent and different from canon. Thanks for keeping in and enhancing cinnabonkers!Ax. Seriously, to move the story in such a way that him accepting a Yeerk into his head seems not only feasible but /wise/ without making any of the steps along the way even remotely jarring is an impressive feat.

So yeah. Your plot is great, characters are great, voice is wonderful and world building top notch.

Don't want to get you too big-headed, so here's some criticism: non-human PoVs should capitalize Human the same as Andalite or Hork-Bajir! That's all I've got for now. Don't worry, I'll probably reread and find actual criticisms, I'm completely infatuated with the story right now.
