[[/u/TK17Studios]], I continue to be impressed at the plot development in this story. I enjoy how you take what canon made into monster-of-the-week style throwaway story elements, and actually incorporate them as rational actors and elements into an overall interacting world. The result always seems to be plot twists which are at once both surprising and extremely logical.
