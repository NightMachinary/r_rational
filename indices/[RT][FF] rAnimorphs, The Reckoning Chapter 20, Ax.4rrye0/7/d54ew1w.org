So it occurs to me that back in the Aftran interlude, Aftran the pool was "farming" compassion from Aftran the Yeerk. Put the Yeerk in the kid, let it develop a sense of love, and during the coelascion strip those developed neuron threads out and distribute them elsewhere, bringing the average compassion of the entire pool up somewhat.

Until the farm burned down, so to speak.
