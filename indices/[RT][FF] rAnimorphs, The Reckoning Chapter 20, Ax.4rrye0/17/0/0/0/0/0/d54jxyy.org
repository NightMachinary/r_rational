Like I said, I understand it, from an intellectual standpoint. I can extrapolate and imagine all that, but it's not /shown/ here sufficiently powerfully to overwrite how I viewed it in canon. What we see is that Ax is having the time of his life eating bunzah, and he wants nothing more than to want to eat more, and we're caught up in the same thoughts. In the moment, it's not scary, because that's obviously what the whole universe is built for; his situation is conveyed far too well to be able to view it with any perspective, as that's exactly how he is reacting to it.

It's the aftermath that is lacking, I think. We need those same realizations that you've laid out in your comment here from ax's perspective, something more than "I'm sorry" and "I'm a fool". Something elucidating his horror at having his values completely and utterly overwritten, by what can only be labelled his own weakness, and a fear that if it happened again he'd be just as powerless. That sickening self-loathing that comes from the dual knowledge that past you betrayed present you, but if present you had the same chance it would bend over future you in a heartbeat.

No one ever regrets the high, just what they exchanged to get it.
