Yeah, but imagine how you'd feel, post-binge, to look back on the experience and realize that /you had actually believed that, in the moment./ That your value set had been wrenched so far out of alignment with anything reasonable, /that quickly,/ and /that completely./

Imagine if I rewrote your utility function with Egeustimentis to "cinnamon bun consumption maximizer," left you there for five minutes, you seriously wounded three other humans, and /then/ I snapped you back and you had to own it ... that's the sort of horror I always felt, when I saw Ax (in canon) reduced from a real person to a mindless mouth-masturbation machine.
