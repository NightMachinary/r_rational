For one, there are a /lot/ more of us than there are of them. We outnumber Andalites seven to one, and that's /after/ they became a spacefaring race and presumably spread to (at least) permanent outposts, if not full-on colony worlds. And given that pools are individuals rather than shards, there were only a few thousand "people" on the homeworld, and a pretty sharp intelligence/personhood/class distinction between larger (and therefore more powerful) pools versus smaller ones.

Humans (in my mind) have an edge in the explore-exploit dichotomy on the explore side. Any one Andalite outstrips basically any human in the abstract, but when you take into account the fact that there's extreme social pressure and pseudohiveminding going on, nobody can outdo humans as a whole when it comes to generating and testing a million different strategies at once.

That being said, I /did/ write both Yeerks and Andalites as dominating humans in a strict sense, and I /will/ stick to that. There's nothing I hate more than stories where humans defeat Skynet through plucky cleverness. If Skynet is even just 10x more intelligent, Skynet wins unless there is a /lot/ of other stuff advantaging the other side.
