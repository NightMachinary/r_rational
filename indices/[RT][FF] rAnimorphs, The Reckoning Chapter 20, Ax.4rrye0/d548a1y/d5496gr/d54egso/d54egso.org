I'd maybe draw parallels between his eating compulsion and the pressure from the shoes. His thoughts hyperfocus on one thing alone - eating - and he finds himself unable to stop. Maybe compare it to the unconsciousness fear, where when he snaps back to reality he realizes with horror that that's the second time he's been unconscious in X days.

If anything, I find the consumption scene to be too close to canon Ax. r!Ax on an eating frenzy...if we're going with the ASD theme, I'd suggest making all 4 trains of thought focus on the /food/. Ex

'glucose with a microcrystalline structure' for the icing,

'amylase in the saliva turning starch into more sweetness',

and for his shadow thoughts 'acrylamide as a carcinogen, causing long-term damage to the body'.

Or maybe have them simply focus on different aspects of the flavor 'sweet', 'chewy', 'melting', 'more', showing the readers /how far gone/ Ax gets when he's presented with food.
