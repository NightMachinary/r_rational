I may need to go back and tinker with the cinnamon bun scene. I was trying to play it as a horrifying loss of self and self-control that would be REALLY DISTRESSING TO EXPERIENCE and would only make sense if your brain had been unraveling for weeks.

But everyone found it funny (in part, I guess, because it was always played for jokes in canon).
