Amazing.

First of all, thanks for introducing me to that song, it does work well with the chapter. Second...there's something weird about your story that no other has ever done for me. It's like, every chapter is my new favorite one, each update brings a new paradigm of mindblowing awesomeness. I'm at a loss at this point, because prior experience tells me whatever you make /next/ will be even more amazing than this.

I'm really feeling for Ax here. I kind of have been the entire story, but now seeing the suffering from his perspective makes it even worse. On the other hand, I loved The Cinnabon Incident. It seemed almost out of place amidst all the drama and angst but no complaints from me.

And now, with Ax's decision I'm once again in the position of waiting anxiously for your next chapter. What will [[#s][Ax's]] be like? What will the reactions from the other Animorphs be (I can sort of guess a bit)? Anyway, great chapter, answered a lot of questions. The only thing I didn't get was, Ax seemed to think all of this explained why the Yeerk morph didn't work?
