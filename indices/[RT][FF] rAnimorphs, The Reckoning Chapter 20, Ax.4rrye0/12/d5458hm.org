By far the best chapter yet.

Random comments:

If we put humans on one end, and Yeerks on the other, Andalites fall in the middle. Humans are the most individualistic, use language to communicate, Andalites can use telepathy, Yeerks can/are mind meld.

And yet it's only when possessing humans that Yeerks learn peace and harmony. Ironic, that it takes possession a very individual creature to show them that.

I don't really understand how this explains the Yeerks morph not working.

I like Chee scenes. Man I cant wait to partially free Erik from restrictions. I really hope it happens at the end a bit. I feel pretty bad for Erik and the Chee.
