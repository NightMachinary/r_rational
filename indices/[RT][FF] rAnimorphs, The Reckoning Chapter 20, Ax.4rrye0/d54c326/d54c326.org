OHhhh my god I need a moment holy shit. Wow. DAAAAAAAAAMN.

Okay. Okay. I'm good. Phew.

- YPM. Aftran, not the individual but the /whole/ - oh that is absolutely brilliant. C/E has been pulling some serious strings here.

- Controller-Ax? Whoa, left field, but you made it work. You also foreshadowed it nicely several chapters ago with the lack of /eib/. Seems like a mix of depression and anxiety, in regards to his behavior. Even got the compulsive eating thing going on (I started laughing the minute I saw cinnamon buns).

- Peter Levy? Also a massive surprise, but the explanation of depression/alcoholism and how Essak has been helping him definitely works. You nicely foreshadowed how much a Yeerk is capable of doing behind-the-scenes to a human brain as well, when Rachel was running Illim back to the pool. Poor Illim.

- Overall I feel this revelation regarding Aftran's remaining 2 members is really really well done. Lots of hints during previous chapters where the revelations taking place in this one aren't completely 'whoa, where did that come from?' but at the same time not blindingly obvious. More 'ooooooh, now it all makes sense and the puzzle pieces fit'.

- Elfangor was right. They did (unintentionally) sacrifice a ton of Yeerks to get another Andalite host...

- I'm really interested in the Yeerks NOT being 'one size fits all'. Makes sense, too.

- Are the remaining 2 parts of Aftran going to re-establish a new pool? Will Temrash and Essak attempt to find a body of water where they can have a very small and sad coalescion?

- How much of a coalescion could you feasibly stuff into a skull? For example, could Temrash and Essak form a new Yeerk that's dedicated solely to controlling Ax? Peter would be sad, of course. In more ways than one.

- Earplugs and oatmeal insanity has already been covered. I'm hoping that the oatmeal does not cause insanity though.

- Gonna need more elaboration on why the Yeerk morph didn't work. Does that mean that they were trying to morph an /entire hivemind/? Or was it that they didn't have a proper snapshot of the whole? Which means...if they acquire both Essak and Temrash, can they feasibly morph Aftran now that she's small enough?

- With the way the pocket dimension works, how long can a Yeerk stay morphed for?

- Holy crap, imagine if someone went /nothlit/ as the Aftran hive mind...that'd put an entire pool in the debt of the Animorphs...and if anyone were to do that, Cassie would be the one. But she's dead. Welp.

- If I wasn't already convinced of Garrett having ASD in the previous chapters, this cinches it. I love how he's the one who best teaches Ax how to read human expressions, as he's had to puzzle it through his entire life.

- I love the metaphor that Ax cannot see the path during his ritual of starlight. He tries, but cannot, and ultimately must make this decision while being completely alone and in the dark.

Okay. I think that covers it. We good. AAAAGH CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT UPDATE.
