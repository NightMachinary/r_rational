Kandrona as Z-space radiation? How did I not even /think/ of that??

+1. Not sure if I'll incorporate it this late in the game, but I for sure would have if I'd had access to that brain of yours a year ago. Weird specific EM bands could work, too, but that still seems /too easy/ to produce to have caused the problems it caused in canon. Better in combo with the photosynthesis idea.
