P.S.: I have just started re-reading the story and oh my goodness all the foreshadowing!!!! I love it :)

And the scene with Aftran, the cupcake, and the knife, eye-gouging and all that.... I forgot about that. I remember being deliciously horrified when I read that, it was so /awful/ and so /perfect/ and so /logical/ all at the same time. Definitely my favourite-because-it's-so-awful scene in the entire story.
