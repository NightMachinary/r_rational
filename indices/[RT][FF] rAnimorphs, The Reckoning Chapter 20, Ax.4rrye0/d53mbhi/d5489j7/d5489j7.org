  Also I still really really really really really like long-form feedback.

I don't quite have a single coherent review but a bunch of individual thoughts...

- Love your clever reuse of bits of canon...

  - Aftran being the one to develop the Yerk peace movement, giving the peace movement a much more thought out development than canon.
  - This is the darkest interpretation of Cinnamon Buns I have seen yet. Seeing the way you show, it makes me wonder why canon treated alien super stimulus as a joke and source of tourism instead of a compulsive hedonistic indulgence.
  - The Oatmeal thing is much more logically used than in canon... the yerk pool was cautiously testing it for safety. I note that they didn't quite say they finished testing it... Also, as I am familiar with canon it seems reasonable, but for someone unfamiliar with canon Oatmeal replacing Kandrona may seem like it is coming out of left field a bit.

- Good job making Ax's mind actually seem alien. Makes it awkward to read in a few places, but overall I think the effect achieved is worth it.

- Is the reason for 3 shredders not one so that the user of the survival kit can improvise a Sario rip? Seemed like an odd detail that stuck out to me.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4cjwxu/ranimorphs_18_interlude_3/d1jqdqq][I totally called it about Visser 3]], well... at least partially called it... I actually thought that the other Council of 13 might be like Visser 3... knowing that he is unique makes him even scarier. Curious that the other Yerks never realized his level of betrayal.

- Were the Pemalites afraid of runaway AI, or are they just overly Pacifistic like in canon, or both...?

- As I said in another comment... I don't think you are giving us a happy ending yet. [[#s][possible spoilers if my guess is correct, and spoilers for canon's final epilogue]]

Edit: wrote Chee, instead of Pemalites, the creators of the chee
