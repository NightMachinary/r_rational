Gaaaahhh I had opinions and then I closed the wrong tab and now I will reconstruct them from memory.

- Rachel was always the most relatable, for me, and when your Rachel [[#s][foo]] it became clear that R!Animorphs passes my internal criteria for Animorphs fiction. Sufficiently dark, and dark in the right ways. Additionally, [[#s][foo]] a second time and I'm /insufficiently convinced/ that consciousness gets "switched on" rather than... noticed by the morpher for the first time. o.O

- Cassie struggling with her ethics in a way that doesn't involve extensively carrying an idiot ball :D This feels very true to form. When I was small and reading these, it was like... my thoughts tended much less towards recounting experience and heuristics, a lot more towards actually trying to figure out what's going on -- with ethics, with the invasion, with the group etc. You capture that well.

- I like base-7 (and how it's pervasive but not lampshaded). I like Esplin/Alloran thinking of probability in terms of light -- it feels like how I think about things.

- Garrett is strongly relatable and he is a positive addition.

- I am continuously more convinced of this as the story goes on.

- Also I have to get that tardigrade tattoo at this point.

- I predict that the autobiographical parts of this fic, whatever they may be, will oft be considered the least realistic. :P

- Speaking of, nice grocery store scene.

- EVERYTHING IS SO TROUBLING AND UNFORTUNATE
