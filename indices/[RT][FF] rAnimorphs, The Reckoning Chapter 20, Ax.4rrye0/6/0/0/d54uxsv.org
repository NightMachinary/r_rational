I just thought of some more questions:

- The Yeerk that Tobias has in DC should be from Aftran. Essak and Temrash are slightly less alone, if Tobias can retrieve it.

- With all the discussion on how Kandrona is produced, would the ability to morph a coalescion allow them to get around the oatmeal reliance by using that morph as a source of Kandrona?

- ..which leads to the next question, if tissue/limbs are removed from a morph, what happens upon demorph?
