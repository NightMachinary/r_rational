"With the way the pocket dimension works" ... if a single Yeerk somehow got the morphing power (not clear how that works if it's constantly in-and-out of a pool, being dissolved and reformulated, but pretty clear that it /would/ work in the case of someone like Esplin), it could stay morphed for a /looooooooooong/ time. It's not strictly proportional to weight, since there's a sort of baseline "activation energy" for making a pocket dimension in the first place, but think something like demorphing once every day and a half. And given the way that puts one's "natural body" in stasis, it's also a pretty solid replacement for Kandrona, since it takes many, many, many morphs for you to use up three full days in the minutes in between.

Note that, if Ax's hypothesis is correct, you wouldn't restore the Aftran mind by going nothlit as the Aftran coalescion---that mind, in its entirety, wasn't properly scanned in the first place.

Thanks for noticing re: Garrett. This is the point at which I'd stereotypically say something like, I had a best friend or a little brother who was autistic, and I wanted to put him in my story, but---nope. I just really like the character, and I'm working hard to do him right.

I was trying to come up with the Andalite word/concept/handle for "the Milky Way" for like five straight minutes before it was like OH RIGHT DUH THE GREAT PATH IN THE SKY.
