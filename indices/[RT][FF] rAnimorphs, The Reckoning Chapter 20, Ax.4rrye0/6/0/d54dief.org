The remaining two parts of Aftran could definitely form a coalescion, but there isn't enough mass for whatever HANDWAVING biological stuff needs to go on to produce Kandrona.

We know that you can stuff at least two Yeerks into a human skull, because of the resonance/self-morph stuff (when Jake's wearing his morph armor, there's Jake-artificial-yeerk controlling a brain that's also got whoever-artificial-yeerk from the acquisition process). Unknown beyond that. It's heavily implied that Esplin is "more" than other Yeerks, perhaps on the order of 3-4x a human-Controlling Yeerk, given that Temrash isn't big enough to actually Control Ax (unless he was straight-up lying).
