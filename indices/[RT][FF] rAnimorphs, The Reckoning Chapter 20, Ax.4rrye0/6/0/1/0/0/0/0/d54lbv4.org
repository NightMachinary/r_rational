Photosynthesis idea works great actually. What you could go with is that the EM/radiation of the Kandrona is necessary to synthesize the vitamin(s) needed for Yeerk health (they're vital, after all). Maybe the Yeerks call both the EM frequency/radiation and the vitamin 'Kandrona'. Makes sense, why not. Kandrona for Yeerks is as important as Vitamin C for humans, and the fugue is like scurvy turned up to 11. Hivemind needs to dedicate a select chunk of tissue for creating this Kandrona vitamin, so 2 Yeerks alone definitely cannot do this. Kandrona being a vitamin is also consistent with the way V3 is cannibalizing other Yeerks.

Yeerk tissue can alter or weaken the blood brain barrier (BBB) allowing select metabolites through. The particular oatmeal brand could have a higher amount of ginger and maple flavorings compared to its competitors (TWICE the flavor! selling point). The metabolites of the digested flavor molecules either directly function as the vitamin(s) required, or are synthesized into said vitamins. Pray that Andalite livers work the same way/similarly as human ones. In short, the Yeerks are swapping reliance on the photosynthetic portion of the hivemind (maybe it has a special name?) to reliance on the host's liver. Would lend some interesting support to this whole symbiosis deal.
