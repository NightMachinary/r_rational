  1) Show up in instant oatmeal of one kind, but not others
#+end_quote

Given Ellimist/Crayak manipulation of human invention of preservatives and/or artificial flavor and/or Maple tree evolution, it could be a complex set of molecules that only very lucky/unlucky "coincidences" managed to get into a single set of oatmeal.

  2) Plausibly make its way into the brain
#+end_quote

Human metabolism of some of the preservatives/Maple byproducts could be necessary in the first place.

  3) Not be actively toxic to an alien that's been able to eat at least some kinds of Earth flora
#+end_quote

Ellimist/Crayak manipulation of the initial conditions that led to the development of that flavor and brand of oatmeal.

  ) Not be producible by two Yeerks, but by two thousand (this could be solved by some handwaving "eh, Yeerks differentiate when they're en masse, like stem cells or gender-changing reptiles" pseudoscience)

You could reintroduce the idea that Kandrona rays are a thing. Yerk tissue can act as a z-space antennae/control node for morphing to work. Kandrona could have some weird z-space component that lets the massive pool get a special type of energy necessary for the metabolic processes that produce the complex molecule set that the Yerk's need. Or it could just be regular EM spectrum, just at narrow bands of particular frequencies and the pool mass is just doing a photosynthesis-like process. You would still need special equipment to get the right frequencies at the right energy, but it wouldn't be impossible. You could keep the idea that they need the pool mass.
