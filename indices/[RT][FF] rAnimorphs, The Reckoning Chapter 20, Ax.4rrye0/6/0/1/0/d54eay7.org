I mean, I may have just written myself into a corner as far as realism goes? It has to be a molecule that could: 1) Show up in instant oatmeal of one kind, but not others 2) Plausibly make its way into the brain 3) Not be actively toxic to an alien that's been able to eat at least some kinds of Earth flora 4) Not be producible by two Yeerks, but by two thousand (this could be solved by some handwaving "eh, Yeerks differentiate when they're en masse, like stem cells or gender-changing reptiles" pseudoscience)

... I'm content with that being part of the accepted magic of the universe, for now, but if you /do/ feel like spending some time on it and you come up with something (and if you want to ping me with questions), feel free. I'd certainly enthusiastically write it in if it's possible, but I was assuming all along that it was not.
