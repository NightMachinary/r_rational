My second comment of the day; between the Andalite ability to think in multiple strands at once, and the newly discovered possible super intelligence of the yeerk hive-mind... does anybody have an idea for how, in a post war, peaceful universe, humanity could ever hope to compete with these two species? What advantage, if any, does a human brain hold, compared to the minds of yeerks and andalites?
