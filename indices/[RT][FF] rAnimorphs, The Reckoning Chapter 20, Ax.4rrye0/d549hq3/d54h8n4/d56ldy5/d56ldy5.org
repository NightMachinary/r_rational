OK it is now clear to me that I phrased my question wrong. What I truly meant was, in this story, what is unique about the human mind? From what I've been reading, Ax, when he morphs human, only really notices the new sensory inputs and how weird having to speak with words is, while the human animoprhs, when morphing Andalite, seem to go into detail about how using an Andalite brain felt different than using a human one. Perhaps Temrash can explore this, as a yeerk going from a human controller to an Andalite one, he would perhaps have a more outside view on the nature of both minds, and could point out differences. Sorry if this is annoying, but the idea of humans as just individually scaled down versions of Andalite's doesn't sit well with the little I know of evolutionary biology. Surely our very psychology and neurology must be different, given that we came to be on different planets. Do Andalite brains even have two hemispheres? If not, how does that effect their thoughts, given that each human hemisphere function as two arguably sentient partners rather than non-sentient parts of conscious whole? Or maybe you've actually written about this in the story and I just didn't see it :) Thanks for the awesome story, hope you find the time to answer this question without spoiling any future plot points. :)
