Just something I'm trying to clarify in my head; in one of her chapters, Cassie realizes that if she morphs holding her breath, when she demorphs, her main body is still holding her breath and concludes that if her true body isn't breathing, than how are her neurons firing. This eventually leads to the realisation (at least this is what I got from the story so far) that when you morph, you essentially morph a yeerk like creature in a host, created body, and when you demorph the experiences of that yeerk like creature are reintegrated back into your body. OK, if I'm right on those fronts, then my quesiton here is this; howw does the mind relate to the brain in this situation? When Ax morphs a human, his Andalite brain isn't working anymore; he's essentially a yeerk creature in a human brain. How can he think in 7 strands of thought anymore, when the human brain doesn't have that capability? Or was Cassie just wrong?
