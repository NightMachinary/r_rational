I think he explicitly said in a Garrett chapter, or maybe I'm just assuming here, that your body paused and your mind is run on a computer in the same location as your body, with the Yeerk thing in the morphs head acting as an antennae, not the actual location of thought.

Otherwise there's no connection between morph and original body at all, and we get into even more philosophical issues...
