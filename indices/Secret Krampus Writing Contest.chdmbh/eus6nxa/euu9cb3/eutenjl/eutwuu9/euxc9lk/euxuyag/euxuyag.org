Thank you!

The prompts can vary a lot and I don't want to restrict the possibilities too much, but I'm mostly focusing on making sure that the prompts are flexible in that people can spin several different story ideas out of it instead of sounding like a commission for a specific story idea. I tried to not come off as pushy, but everyone's been appreciative of me giving feedback on their prompts when they submitted them.

The lengths have varied quite a bit, but most of them are a single sentence with several people submitting a full paragraph.

If you want, you could go with just a single word like the Biweekly Challenge, but I'd like it if people showed creativity by coming up with an interesting sentence to daydream about.
