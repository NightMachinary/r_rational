My biggest worry is getting a prompt like "write a FANDOM fanfiction where [CHANGE TO CHARACTER/PREMISE]" and not being familiar with FANDOM and then having to learn about it enough to write a compelling story.

Are all the prompts meant to be fandom-neutral?

If no, is there a way to reject your prompt if you're unfamiliar with the subject matter?

(I'd probably struggle with a premise of "Alternate history of the USA where [historical event] was different" as a non-american for similar reasons).
