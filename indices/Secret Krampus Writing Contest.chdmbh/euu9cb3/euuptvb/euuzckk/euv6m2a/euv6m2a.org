That's definitely how I'd handle such a prompt if I got it:

"Write an alternate history where the Federalist Papers were never published."

All I know about the Federalist Papers is what I learned in listening to the Hamilton soundtrack, and googling it it looks like it had something to do with the constitution.

SO, gun to my head, writing this story?

It's a story about how America would be if it stayed a British colony forever. Present Day: America is voting whether or not to become a republic (Australia had one about 20 years ago that failed), probably do something from a campaign room and talk about racism and how it's different in alternate America than current America. Drop lots of references to people drinking tea and of course British style slang.

... you know what I would be OK with this, but I think the author of the prompt might be a little disappointed. But tough titties for them for making a terrible prompt.
