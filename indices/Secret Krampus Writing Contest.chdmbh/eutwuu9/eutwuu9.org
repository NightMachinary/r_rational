  I reserve final say on whether or not a given prompt is acceptable. This is mostly to weed out any low-effort prompts, or prompts with unsuitable themes such as sexual content or harmful themes.

I agree with the rule for the prompt, since you don't know who's going to get your prompt and what they are comfortable writing about, but I hope there's no such rule for the actual story? Lots of great stories deal with sex or difficult themes.
