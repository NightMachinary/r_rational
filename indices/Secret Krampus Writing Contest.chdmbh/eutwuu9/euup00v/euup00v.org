Yeah, no matter what someone writes, if it's submitted before the deadline, the story will be accepted. I won't be rejecting any stories. Just the prompts due to the obvious issue of not knowing if someone receives something that they cannot write about.

Writers can choose to write about sex or difficult themes if they want to, but it needs to be something that they choose to do of their own volition rather than being required to do so by a given prompt.
