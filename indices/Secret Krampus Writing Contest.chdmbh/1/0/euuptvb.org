That's among some of the issues I'm screening prompts for. Prompts need to be vague to allow for writers to use their creativity to take it in any direction they want. By writing a specific fandom, it's more of a commission for a specific story rather than helping to inspire someone. If a prompt is too specific, I usually give feedback or point out the issue to help participants to improve it for the contest. I'll try to help anyone to keep from being too specific about things like geography or culture that not everyone would know about, but it hasn't been an issue yet.

If people really have an issue with their prompts, I can allow them to switch their prompts with someone else. If there's only one person who has an issue with their prompt, then I can give my prompt to them and write about theirs.
