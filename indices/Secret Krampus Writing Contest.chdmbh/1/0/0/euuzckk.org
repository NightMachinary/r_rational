Maybe I misunderstand prompts, but I always thought they were guidelines, not rules? As in, you're free to ignore parts of the prompt anyway. The prompt is meant as inspiration not a constraint.

So if the prompt is set in some world, you're still free to write a story not set in that world.

Did I interpret that incorrectly?
