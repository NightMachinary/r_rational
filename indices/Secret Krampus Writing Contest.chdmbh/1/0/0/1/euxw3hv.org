I basically agree with what [[/u/MagicWeasel][u/MagicWeasel]] just said and have no intention to police people for going 'against' the prompt. What someone chooses to write based on the prompt is up to them.

However, I am willing to give leeway to someone who honestly feels like they are struggling with a given prompt and will work something out if it comes up.
