Not A Spoiler: the Tools that he brought into Existence are not in his possession. They are in the possession of the Five Galactic Deities, one for each. This is how they became said Galactic Deities. The god of Munchkinry - who's actually the god of untruths, but he's been changing as his follower base changes - is trying to get one of the Tools off of one of the Five.

He's also sent the pseudo-Deity to Earth because no gods are allowed to interfere with Earth at the moment, due to the treaty stating that all planets outside the Five's respective territories are off-limits until they have developed FTL capabilities.
