The afterlife is as of yet unconfirmed - and if it does exist, it would not be on any of the accessible Planes.

The Heavenly Plane exists only because of people's belief of a 'home of the gods'. This 'home of the gods' is different in each belief, or even not necessarily given specific detail. Therefore, the Heavenly Plane is a nebulous, changing place. The Deities, being manifestations of collective Belief themselves, can affect their Plane by grabbing onto specific Beliefs and morphing the Plane into that form.
