The people of Earth don't know he's also the General. He simply has a lot more influence in that position than he does in any Deific capacity. He and a group of other Deities have been pushing Earth's space program along in order to ready themselves for contact with what they (the Deities) know is a very, very large universe out there.

There are Demons (collective fears of things that go bump in the night, given form by the mechanic of Belief-to-Power this universe runs on), but no scaly, winged, or otherwise recognizable monsters running around. Existence has a number of Planes - so far I've introduced three. The mortal plane, or the Void Plane; the Heavenly Plane (take a guess as to who resides there); and the Afterplane, home to the Demons, who are really people's fears. There really is nothing to fear but fear itself. And getting run over by an eighteen-wheeler. And many other things.
