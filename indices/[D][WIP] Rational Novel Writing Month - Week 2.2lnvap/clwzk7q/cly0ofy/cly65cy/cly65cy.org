They're completely made up, as opposed to being pulled from a pre-existing mythos. Mostly because 80% of the story so far has been happening on planets other than Earth - there are no mythologies I can build off there.

The Greek/Roman, Norse, etc. mythologies are a real part of the Earth's history though, as far as the existence of their pantheons. Funnily enough, the only one still 'alive' is Dionysus. He goes by Dio now. Changing fashions and all. Earth's prime Deity is also the head of their military; Earth does things very differently than most other species.
