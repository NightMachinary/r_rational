I'll have to find a way to make this clear in the text itself, but:

- He's been previously injured in a mentalist battle that leaves him with splitting headaches after every time he uses the power - bad enough that he gets put out of service for a few days.
- Removing memories is difficult, time-consuming, and requires taking a baseline of their mindscape so you know what's changed and can revert it back. It's hard to remove memories from before the first time you've been in someone's mind unless you want to spend a lot of time rooting around in there. Doing it with two people would be even worse.
- People are almost always aware that a memory has been removed - the removal process creates something of a gap that they can feel, even if they didn't notice any incongruities.
- Hirrush doesn't want people knowing that he's a mentalist, for reasons that are mostly in his past (but have to do with the reason that he recognizes the royal mentalist on sight). Better for people to think that he's just a dark wizard than to let on that there's a mentalist around.

There will be more on mentalism is Chapter 4, where some of this reasoning is gone over in a bit more detail, and Henry gets some mentalist training from his father.
