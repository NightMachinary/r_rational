Currently sitting at 20,475. It's not total crap (yet), but there's definitely a lot that I'm going to have to go back and edit. Using Scrivener has been going really well. I spent ten minutes or so trying to figure out how much plot I have left, and it feels like the novel will end at about 90K words, though there's a good chance that I'll go over. Depending on how well this weekend goes, I might be targeting a word count of 100K for the month. I am three scenes (~4K words) from completing the first major set of events, which comprise the first three chapters.

And that's about all there is to say, I guess. I'm keeping a rapidly growing TODO list for December, though last year I just resolved to keep up the pace for as long as it took to finish the story, and there's a chance that I'll do that again and "end" National Novel Writing Month midway through December.
