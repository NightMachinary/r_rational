Oh, good. You shouldn't create a system without at least one person abusing it, though that would be rather hard for a mere mortal to do.

I suppose the Deities would be self modifying and improving themselves by telling believers 'facts' and 'revelations' about themselves, thus making those things facts and revelations. Sucks to only be a mortal believer, though.
