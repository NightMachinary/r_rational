Well, I am certainly looking forward to the completion of your novel. It certainly sounds like a great concept. And one last thought-Is there an afterlife on any of the planes, or did they cancel that because of budget cuts when the population started getting above 100 billion or so?

That satisfies my curiosity nicely, and my desire to read the stuff people are putting up here continues to increase.
