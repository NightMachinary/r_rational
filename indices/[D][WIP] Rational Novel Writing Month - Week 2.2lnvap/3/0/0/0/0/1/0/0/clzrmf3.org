Well, that clears up all my questions. Hmm... Now, how to munchkin a belief powered deity system.... Ah, crap, the belief of the billions of Galactic people would override any sort of trap I could manage to make, unless convincing every human on earth that the home of the human gods is incompatible with all other gods and would kill them the instant they set foot in it would actually work.

If it had a single hope in the Afterplane of working, I would also convince them that it(human god home) is such a paradise that all gods would seriously want to go there and all the other gods are super jealous and would get in at the first chance they'd get. My Master Plan is FLAWLESS! (Yeah, that ain't working)
