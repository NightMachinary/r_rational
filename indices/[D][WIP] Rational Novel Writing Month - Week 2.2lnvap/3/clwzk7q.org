13,500 as of today. All written on my iPhone. My thumbs hurt.

Finally getting into the main plot, characters becoming more defined, pace picking up. Just had a Deity try to commit suicide by having all of his followers slaughtered in random wars. When this didn't work, he stopped Believing in himself, and now he's a semi-mortal wandering around an empty planet with his memories slowly deteriorating.

My other main character is a human, Commander of Fleet 115, James Kobal. He just accompanied Earth's prime Deity into the Heavenly Plane to try and convince one of the Galactic Deities that Earth deserves FTL technology. It's not going too well.
