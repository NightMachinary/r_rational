I've got ~6000 words so far. I've fallen behind my goals, mostly due to a couple just completely dead days, but hopefully I do well enough to catch up in the next couple days.

And, because I made a promise to myself last week to share it, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HixsAuXLHdPDT4HEfb66Ho0DK6tCfG_qNg0KD2RlCJg/edit][here is what I have so far.]] It's just a prologue and chapter 1, so my purpose is mostly generating interest in the rest of the story. Let me know if you're hooked.

Feedback and encouragement is super welcome, as receiving a few words of praise translates to writing probably hundreds more words (hurray for socially motivated monkey brains!).
