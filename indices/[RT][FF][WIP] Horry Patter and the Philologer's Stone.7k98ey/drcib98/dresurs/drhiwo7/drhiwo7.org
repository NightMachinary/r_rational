It becomes less grating after a few chapters - especially when Horry leaves the Dorbles for the last time and it stops reading like a parody of child abuse (which seems to have been the point actually, if you consider some of the descriptions) and shifts to introducing the wider wizarding world. It definitely reads better as it no longer seems to be deliberately hamming up canon, and though the names are still scrambled it reads more as a deliberate stylistic choice than a bad joke. Which considering what appears to be happening/have happened, is sort of the point.
