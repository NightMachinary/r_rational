It's pretty clear that this universe got fucked up at some point, and originial!Dumbledore is trying to save it through cryptic messages inserted into the timeline in advance. That would explain the fucked up names and how ludicrously complicated magic has become.

Actually, what if Voltebort-he-who-must-be-named /succeeded,/ only his goal was to twist the universe so everything was predetermined, rather than the opposite of that? That also works. In any case, we have what appears to be a normal Dumbledore who doesn't realize Harry=Horry attempting to manipulate things through minimal involvement for some reason.

I'm interested.
