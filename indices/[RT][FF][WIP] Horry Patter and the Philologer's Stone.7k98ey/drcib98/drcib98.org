When I was first linked this fic by an acquaintance I was skeptical, it really looked like a poorly written parody at first.

Then wizard bitcoin, library of babel-style spells, zero knowledge proof-based concept-fidelius, and other complex magical concepts were introduced and I realized this was something worth recommending. It's a mystery to me why this hasn't been posted here yet.

If you enjoyed HPMOR you'll definitely enjoy this. I get the feeling it's going to focus way more on "understanding magic" than HPMOR ultimately did, and it has a far more likable and realistically competent main character. Don't take this as a dig towards HPMOR, it's actually a massive compliment towards Horry Patter.

I think it's worth posting at this point, even with only 20k written words. Update rate seems to be once a week, with a backlog of at least 30 chapters according to the author.
