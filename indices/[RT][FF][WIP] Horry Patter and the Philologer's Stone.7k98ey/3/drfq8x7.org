Gave it a shot, and I'm glad that I did. I think the feeling I'm left with is "uncomfortable but fascinating." So much is similar to Harry Potter, but so much is tweaked, and the differences keep getting to me. I think the first chapter summed it up perfectly:

#+begin_quote
  He knows that something is broken. That his uncle is broken. That his aunt is broken. That even his cousin is broken. And most of all, he /knows/ that he himself is broken.
#+end_quote

Each of the familiar characters are just a bit off - Horry is more reclusive and depressed, Uncle Durbly is more physically abusive and terrifying, cousin Dobley and Pelilah are both kinder to Horry but clearly abused by the uncle, Alvin is older and more weary, Horbid is more aggressive (and uses magick openly), Dargo is more chill, etc.

And Chogborts is slightly off as well. Magick is off. The world is /broken./ And it left me wanting to read more about Not!Hogwarts and what has happened to everything. It's like Harry Potter took some pages from The Magicians and some disconcerting imagery from Alice in Wonderland.

... I also just came off from playing Doki Doki Literature Club, and reading this a day or two late makes me feel like one of the HP characters became self-aware and purposely screwed with the code of the universe.

Thanks for the recommendation!
