In some ways it doesn't. Every character's name being goofed up continues all the way through - except in chapter 15, where one of the original characters' names is still the same (although going by canon she shouldn't actually be in the same year as Horry, Hermany, and Romb). And, I suppose, that "Alvin" is an actual name (even if it's not an actual HP character name).

That said, after the first few chapters the differences start to become really pronounced, and by chapter 9 or so it starts to feel distinctly different. It feels very much like Harry Potter got crossbred with The Magicians and a bit of Through the Looking Glass.
