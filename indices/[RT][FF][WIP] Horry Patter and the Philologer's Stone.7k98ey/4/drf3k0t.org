Wanted to wait until finished before reading most of the comments, but beginning recording thoughts now (end of chapter 10) in no particular order so avoid forgetting them.

Chapter 9 has a 'Potter' instead of a 'Patter'. Unintentional?

(Edit, see below regarding consistency.) Marlin rule-breaking: Inherently self-fulfilling (like the HPMOR time-manipulation version), or could they be used to invalidate all the future-stories? Or would the future-stories include their usage, being on a higher level than any of Marlin's rule-breakers, and needing a different sort of rule-breaker to invalidate all the future-stories? ('Invalidation' being 'The future-story only has the future for without that extra information'. But then how would the future-story handle the representation of that part... this can be collapsed into that, if you imagine someone reading their declassified future and doing something different, what would the book say about them reading the book? Person A read 'Person A read 'Person A read [...]'''... actually, that opens up a similar issue, that of how the book represents itself being read under normal no-change-intended conditions, with the hall-of-recursion theoretically ballooning it up to endless size. Ah, it would presumably be 'copied' instead of 'read', though, since they wouldn't be able to properly read it yet.)

Spellcoin mention in the Author's Notes: One would have to keep in mind the depreciation, or rather elimination, of each Spell as it were opened and 'expired'. That's arguably something that happens already, as Bitcoin wallets are 'lost' in the form of physical destruction, data loss, death of the owner, et cetera. Trickier would be that of someone resealing a spell while distributing it in parallel, or fraudulently sealing a spell that everyone already knew. If there weren't a guarantee of never-opened-before (or at least no-other-copies-exist), there might be very little value. Hm... thinking of a mundane variety, a 'Secretcoin' could be a little amusing, verified secrets about specific people, but with similar issues of enforcement and potential parallel distribution. Perhaps if the verifiers could also indicate the original source(/subject of the secret) and level of importance, but then it would get messy and open up the seller to targeted buy-ups... separately, with current laws, if a CEO hosts a public/Internet ('open to everyone') auction of a sealed envelope with future-stock-price-relevant information in it, do insider trading laws come into play?

Reading about zero-knowledge proofs has been enjoyable!

The greater concentration of horrifyingness--such as chapter 7's bladdernorxes, and general details otherwise--is enjoyable.

'Nature only demands consistency', my earlier thoughts... this nicely (at least on the surface) seems to allow the sort of time-exploitations that HPMOR largely prevented.

Hm. By the end of the 15th chapter, I (/my reaction) can fairly-safely be described as 'perpetually disconcerted'. Curious about how things end up, and about the cryptic italisised passages at the chapter beginnings.
