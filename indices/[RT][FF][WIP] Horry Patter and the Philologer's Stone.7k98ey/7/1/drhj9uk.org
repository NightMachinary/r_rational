It's very grating in the first few chapters, but for me at least a few chapters later it became much less irritating. I'm pretty sure it's because the story had moved on from a parody of Harry's child abuse into somewhat newer territory, and it was no longer the most obvious symptom of "awful" writing (for meta reasons to the whole story it isn't, but it would be on its own and certainly felt that way) and was simply a stylistic choice.
