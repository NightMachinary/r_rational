1. Per the comments you've already gotten, this is the subreddit for /rational fiction/, not general rationality.
2. Per the sidebar, no discussion whatsoever of US politics.

I've removed this post; good luck finding somewhere else to post this. I would second [[/r/slatestarcodex]], since AKAIK, there's no general rationality subreddit.
