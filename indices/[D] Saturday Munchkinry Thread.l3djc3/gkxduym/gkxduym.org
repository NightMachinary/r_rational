Rewatching the first Narnia movie made me think of this... which is better between a real world cavalry charge and a charge of heavily armed centaurs? I can see pros and cons - the centaurs have more control over the horse part but offer a bigger target. Or should centaurs just limit themselves to fighting with bow and arrow, Mongol style?
