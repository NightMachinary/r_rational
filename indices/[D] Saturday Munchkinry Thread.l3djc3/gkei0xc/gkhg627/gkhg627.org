If you want to use the power without becoming famous for it, become a sculptor or toolmaker. You can shape molten metal into whatever shape you desire and just... let it solidify like that. And you can do this much, much faster than a conventional craftsman faffing about with vax and molds. A freefloating cloud of diamond dust should also let you do amazing things in stone, again, very quickly.
