Yay, another accountant.

The easiest answer that provides the most good is space travel, which someone else already covered.

My twist: Just carry that big ol trash ball in the pacific into space and push it towards the sun. Actually, doing that for major landfills around the globe as well would give you a “regular” job as there's thousands of tons of trash, and you're doing an incredibly “morally” good thing, which you wanted.
