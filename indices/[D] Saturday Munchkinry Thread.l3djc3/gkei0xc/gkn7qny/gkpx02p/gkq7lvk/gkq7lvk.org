Yea this is a bit of a worry I have with anything relating to TK and gambling.

There's only so far you can push your luck before someone catches on. Even if they can't prove it you would certainly still get kicked out.

Also while running a casino isn't exactly a moral endeavor to begin with, I would still personally have some qualms cheating on this if I did have TK.
