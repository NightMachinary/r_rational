any kind of personal craft or production could be made 1000% faster and more efficiently, and much more precisely.

My favourite would be TK blacksmithing: using relentless TK pressure and blows to shape metal, increase pressure to harden it, and then quench in while crushed under pressure for extremely dense steel.

Imagine a guy standing in the middle of a smithy, eyes closed, hands twitching as if orchestrating music. Hot chunks of metal flying around him in wisps of smoke and steam, reshaping as the go, and combine into a perfect suit of plate amour.
