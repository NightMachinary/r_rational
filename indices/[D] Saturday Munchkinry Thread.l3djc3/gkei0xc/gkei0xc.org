I rewatched Chronicle, one of my favorite movies last night. It's a film about three high school seniors who gain telekinesis. The powers are pretty OP as far as something that's not in an already established superpower franchise.

By the end of the film they can fairly easily lift tons, fly, create full body force field protections strong enough to crash straight through buildings unharmed. The control over the telekinesis is also granular enough to build Legos. The power works like a muscle where the boys had to train up to get to this level otherwise they'd "tear" the muscle if they went over their limit too fast resulting in a headache and nosebleed.

As I was watching I kept thinking that I would love to have these powers but I couldn't think of a way to make use of them in real life. I'm an accountant but I certainly would not be if I had the power to do what they could.

So, the munchkinry task is this: if you got these powers how would you have a normal life with them living undetected while still using the powers to their full extent in your day to day life? Bonus points for keeping everything you do legal and morally honest.
