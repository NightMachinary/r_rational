  How do you use this power to emulate other superpowers?

I like this, it's a cool twist on typical mnchkinry stuff.

--------------

Special goggles with lenses + superheating eyes -> laser eyes

heating/cooling pneumatics controlling arms in suit -> super strength

cooling down to very low temperatures -> fog/smoke creation

Super cooling feet -> walk on water

Hook up some magnets to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine][Stirling engine]] (or really, any compact heat-powered engine would do), superheat bottom, then generate a lot of electricity -> [[https://youtu.be/_fTC_Ud_k3U?t=399][electricity powers]] (much of the space in the backpack in the video is just cooling, which you could do automatically) also see [[https://youtu.be/UNisqZOAaAs?t=498][this]] for a possible result of using this technique). Similarly a technology-neutralizing effect could be mimicked via an EMP blast. Your gear could be protected via faraday cages.

Since you're in a world of superheros, and presuming there are also tinkers present, then there are certainly many advantages to having a large heat-sink and easy energy generation. Off the top of my head, if you find a way to get a whole lot of CPUs/GPUs packed onto your back in high transistor densities which would fry the components of a normal computer, then you may be able to replicate super-intelligence or contessa-like action sequence path by using a possibly computationally inefficient, but very accurate & fast (due to the transistors on your back) simple AI program (at the very simplest, a basic search algorithm or something, where all you need to do is define the puzzle properties, and let it find the optimal solution). Tinkers may not even be needed to be present for this to work.

By super heating metal balls with high melting points then throwing them at people you could mimic a hadouken.
