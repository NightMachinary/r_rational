  If using the TK powers takes as much energy as lifting something manually, it could also be a weight loss regimen that can be done while gaming, which is pretty great.

I think you just missed the obvious implication here. You don't want the world to know of your powers or take you too seriously while still making money? Telekinesis means no one will be able to press more keys or move controllers faster and likely more precisely than you. Boom, you're an e-sports world champion, as long as you keep your identity secret and somehow never play in public (but if you ask me, that can be your "shtick" and if anything boost the interest in you as a character).

I mean, arguably, it's kind of cheating, but it's also on something that's not important enough to feel like it's anything but a pretty innocuous scam. And you STILL must be pretty skilled.
