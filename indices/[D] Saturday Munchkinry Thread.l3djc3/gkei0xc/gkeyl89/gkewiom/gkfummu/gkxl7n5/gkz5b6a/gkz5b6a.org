Alas, a person's APM is very far from being the most important thing in esports. Most of the big ones - League, DOTA, Fortnite - are more about situational awareness and teamwork (obviously excepting the solo tourney in Fortnite) than how fast you can click.

(To a first approximation the hardest thing in League or DOTA is knowing or inferring where your enemies are on the map at all times, even when the only thing you know about them is where they're not.)
