Well this falls under the category of powers where the personal benefits it accrues are by mostly virtue of being famous as the only person with superpowers. Since you would pretty much automatically be one of the most famous people alive which is easily leveraged into wealth.

The one obvious thing you could do with these powers is make millions on by putting on a spacesuit and using your telekinesis to bring tons of stuff into orbit. That being said while you can make extra money from bringing things into orbit (and help to advance space industrialization) it wouldn't really make any difference to your QOL since you'd be filthy rich just from the fame anyway.
