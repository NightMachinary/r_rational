  I wonder if, given sufficient education about your own body and the trust of a medical practitioner, you could exercise yourself without actually doing exercise? Just using your telekinesis on yourself. Don't take my word on that one though, it's just idle musing.

Wait a minute. We already have opposing muscles, constraints, etc. why aren't we doing this IRL??? Basically, you just have to repeatedly tense up and relax while laying in bed? I'd try it but I'm to lazy to exercise in the first place.
