It works, but it's not very efficient. Forcing a muscle through a range of motion as you exert it tears the muscle fibers faster and more effectively than keeping the muscle static.

Yes, you could tense say your arm and hold it for a while, but the maximum you can tense your arm doesn't compare to the stress inflicted by moving a heavy weight with your arm.

Still, if you're too lazy to exercise traditionally, flexing all the muscles in your body while standing around or while in bed is certainly better than nothing.
