Some more ideas. By flash superheating your palms or the soles of your feet, you can pretty much fly like iron man. Except it would be more explosive, and probably concuss people near you.

By controlling several points of superheated skin on your palm, turning them on or off at different frequencies, you could be a rudimentary speaker. It would be very rudimentary though, like only up to 500 Hz.

By raising your skin temperature to max and down again quickly, you could be a continuous explosion. Would be hard to keep on your feet though.
