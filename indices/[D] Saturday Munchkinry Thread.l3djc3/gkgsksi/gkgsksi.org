Say you're a superhero in a world of superheroes. Your power is to regulate the temperature of your skin. You can bring your body down to -253 degrees Celcius, or all the way up to 12,000 degrees celcius (when black body radiation is giving off bluish white glow). You can make your whole body that temperature in 1 millisecond, and bring it down to normal in another millisecond. This does not affect the air around you that was superheated to that temperature though. Or the heat flash that will radiate out.

You can make a 1 cm^{2} patch of your skin that temperature, or your whole body. You can control the shape and size of it. You can also control how long it takes to reach a certain temperature, from 1 ms to as long as you wish. You also get a standard brute package. You are tougher than normal. You can survive falling off a building, but getting hit by a train will probably kill you.

How do you use this power to emulate other superpowers?
