Really enjoy the thought of this. Very Skitter esque from Worm as far as the awareness of objects in your range goes. From what was displayed in the film, it did look like each of them needed direct line of sight for just about every instance of their powers that they used. But if they did in fact have any sort of awareness of the objects in that range they would jump several magnitudes on how effective the power could be.
