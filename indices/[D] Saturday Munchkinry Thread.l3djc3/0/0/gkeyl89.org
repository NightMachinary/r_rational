Well, one thing is that having telekinesis that works on as fine a scale as described probably also means that you have an awareness of the area that you could affect. The question then is how far away your telekinesis can reach, then, because presumably you could use it as a sort of long-ranged proprioception that can reach around corners.

Wanting to remain undetected limits things a bit, but there are theoretically come jobs you could do legally and very efficiently without people noticing you have powers. The first thought that came to my mind was actually cleaning, or exterminating - you could detect hidden dirt, kill bugs from range, move objects, sweep dust, clean surfaces, and so much more with much less effort and time expended than normal. The reason I mention these jobs specifically are that you can often find an excuse to complete the jobs outside the vision of the people that hire you. ("Let me handle this sir, wasps are dangerous bastards that might attack you, and I only have the one protective suit."; "You enjoy your day out sir, your mansion will be cleaned by the time you get back." )

Little things, then. Cleaning, as mentioned. Any task that requires you to stand up can now be completed just by sitting down. I wonder if, given sufficient education about your own body and the trust of a medical practitioner, you could exercise yourself without actually doing exercise? Just using your telekinesis on yourself. Don't take my word on that one though, it's just idle musing.

You could make yourself fly, though, and I'm under the impression that doing that would be very fun.

Depending on how fine the telekinesis is, it might make artistic endeavours easier. Simply telekinetically move your ink/paint/drawing implement/digital input, and any limit on artistic ability due to technical aspects will be much lessened. This depends on exactly how it works, of course.

Any aspect of a job that's reliant on random sampling let's you apply your powers, actually. Checking bags, for example, at airport security. Even if you still have to check bags normally to keep your cover, it would be awfully convenient if you were able to telekinetically detect any contraband that actually existed, and managed to check those bags by chance.

Similarly, as a police officer, you could use your telekinetic sense to search for contraband passively as you drive, and exit your car to check with random passers by 'just to be sure'. What do you know, they have illegal substances or firearms on their person, hidden away! Could also sabotage mechanisms that could be plausibly sabotaged anyway. In the line of fire? Oh no, the guns pointed at you were jammed! Someone trying to run away, resist arrest? Seems they tripped and fell, how inconvenient for them! All by chance, of course, though you are somewhat lucky.

Safety inspector or quality control is a good job as well. Detect internal faults in machinery without the need for expensive equipment.

Perhaps being a doctor? On yourself, even if you don't do it for others. You can tell if a bone is bruised, broken, or unharmed. You could even set it, potentially, without having to stick your dirty mits in someone. When I put it like that, field medic might be more appropriate, given that people on the edge of death are less likely to notice that you didn't actually touch the needle you sewed up their wound with.

I'll leave it there - I'm sure others could also contribute
