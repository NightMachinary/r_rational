With a little practice, you could become very lucky at arcade games and eventually casino games or gambling (this can get dangerous though).

- Dominate skee ball and other skill-based arcade games so bad untill the arcade/carnival bans you
- Gently manipulate coins in coin-pusher games to get more coins or balls in pachinko machines
- Go to casinos and manipulate dice and roulette wheels so that you can win lots of money
- Attend horse races or other betting sports and use the telekinesis to boost/brake horses/cars/baseballs/whatever so that you can win at sports

Eventually, casinos might catch on you're cheating but they'll be scratching their heads as to how. Also, your TK should protect you from the people angry at your "luck"
