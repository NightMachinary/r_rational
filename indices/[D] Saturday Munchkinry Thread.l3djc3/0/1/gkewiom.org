For one thing, I would use the heck out of it in the kitchen. Imagine how much faster prepping a stir fry would be if I could chop all of the vegetables and aliums all at the same time! Imagine how much faster unloading the dishwasher would be!

It would also make parenting much easier. When the baby goes to slam her head into the floor because she's mad, just gently lift her off the ground. If the baby's bored, flip her upside down for a bit or something. Dresser drawers have been emptied of clothes and the baby is mad because she wants to keep strewing? TK-restock, bam!

If using the TK powers takes as much energy as lifting something manually, it could also be a weight loss regimen that can be done while gaming, which is pretty great.

Having the power would make it much easier to do home improvement / repair kind of stuff, too.

If we dropped the "living undetected" bit you could be the world's best trauma surgeon, but that wouldn't fly under the radar. And anyway, that sounds like way too much stress. Better to keep being a software developer and use the telekinesis for juggling upside-down babies and hearing them giggle while you play video games.
