The thing about insulating materials is that they prevent heat transfer in both directions. A low-cost environmental suit for Freezer would simply be what people wear in really cold weather, in terms of heavy coats and hats and mittens and goggles and scarves and thick socks and boots and long underwear under flannel-lined pants. That should keep out enough heat for him to be somewhat comfortable. When you step outside in winter, every place that you feel cold is where Freezer would feel hot.

Fortunately, South Dakota is a place where heavy winter clothing is commonly available, because of the Bakken oil fields having lots of outdoor workers.

In later iterations, of course, you'd want to replace mundane insulation with stronger stuff, like down-lined pants and insulated boots.
