The obvious problem here is that the only way for Freeze to accomplish his goal would require he direct an asteroid into the planet or block the sun with giant space mirrors. These are goals that would be difficult even for a major government yet for someone with only mediocre genius and everything else stacked against them it doesn't seem terribly plausible. If you want Freeze to pose any meaningful threat here you need him to actually have some resources he can draw upon: Make him better connected/wealthier, much more charismatic, a Von-Neumann level genius or some combination of the three.

The Freeze you've described doesn't really have a better shot at world domination than the average person on this subreddit. In that both Freeze and the median [[/r/rational][r/rational]] redditor are smart and probably not terribly socially skilled, but Mr Freeze also has a debilitating medical condition leaving him even worse off.
