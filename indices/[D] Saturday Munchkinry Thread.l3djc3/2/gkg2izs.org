[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kykcuq/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/gjh6jwp/][Last thread]] we talked about a supervillain munchkin along the lines of a plant power trope.

I thought about other common villain tropes, albeit my perspective is a bit centered on Worm and to some extent DC since those are my preferred sources of superhero fiction. I thought about the archetype of the, "freezer" in the vein of Mr. Freeze or the wide variety of other characters whose powers and character are centered on coldness, ice, snow, etc.

I thought about a villain!Freezer character, basically a much harder version of Mr. Freeze. Aside from munchkining Freezer himself, how would you even go about your villainous day as Freezer?:

- While going through puberty, Freezer's body underwent unusual changes, turning his skin pale as porcelain, entire body cold to the touch, decreased tolerance for warmth (weather and otherwise), but significantly increased tolerance for coldness. With these changes also came a lingering anhedonia and severe misanthropy. The latter largely caused by the fact that instead of seeking medical attention, his family and others opted to neglect and abuse him.

- Freezer's normal body temperature is 18.6째F (-7.4째C). The various systems of his body function normally at this temp, including his microbiome. His thermoregulation in terms of heat is roughly scaled to a normal person's. He'll suffer discomfort, sweating, heat stroke, and other consequences of overheating, including death. Physical exertion can contribute, but on its own is unlikely to be a problem if he's in a proper environment.

- This limitation doesn't work the same way the other way around. Freezer still has the traits of an endothermic organism, but he wouldn't even shiver at a temperature as low as -148째F (-100째C). Otherwise his body scales to the normal symptoms of hypothermia.

- The bright side is that he doesn't get infected with anything that can't withstand his body's climate. Freezer also doesn't age past 25 years old. At the same time, it's difficult for him to find food and drink that he can tolerate and various other day-to-day issues.

- Unfortunately, Freezer wasn't granted any other inherent superpowers. He's currently a penniless squatter in a meat freezer in Aberdeen, SD. In terms of more mundane talents, he'd consistently test around 140 in terms of IQ and has what many would call an obsessive desire to study STEM with the intent of gaining insight into ways that he can return the Earth to the good old days when it was almost entirely covered in glaciers. Building ice-themed weapons aren't out of the question though.

- The latter part is his ultimate goal, make the Earth one big snowball. He doesn't have any women on ice or any real compassion for his fellow people. In terms of personality he's far from charismatic and downright socially awkward at times. He can manage to put up a semi-friendly face.

Freezer runs into obstacles pretty quickly since his agenda requires him to pursue an education, but there are little to no places willing or even equipped to accommodate his condition. His condition also makes many aspects of interpersonal interaction difficult and discouraging. Plus there's the fact there's no current explanation for it and more than one connected person who'd want to vivisect him for answers.

If you want to start small, what would an environmental suit for Freezer be like without the benefit of comic book technobabble?
