This is the oddest meeting!

Sorry I haven't been very active on the trains mod, I basically don't play the game at all anymore because the rift between what it should be and what it is is really wide, and also every time I try my vehicles crash, spaz out and explode.

(Proper orbits when. :-( )

That said the quest was fun but it kind of ended in a weird place where it didn't seem like any of the plans worked out, there wasn't any planning coherence besides, the random lobster person the players made on a lark did significantly more damage than the strike team, and the players won by either fiat or luck using a method that really shouldn't have worked. It was weird.

If you do decide to run it again, could I recommend that you use a forum with an active quests section, like [[http://forum.spacebattles.com/][SB]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/][SV]] or [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com][QQ]]? That should lead to more coherence over time, hopefully.
