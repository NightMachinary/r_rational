Thank you! How do you think I should've done differently in the second half?

The ending was unexpected to me too (That 1 on a 1d1000 was hilarious). The person who inspired the character of Kat showed up for the last couple of threads.

Spidertankanon was.... well, pretty funny in that it fit pretty well with the source material. I thought about posting a fic about just that episode on a Christian board to see what they said. Patience is sometimes necessary :)

Tsion was surrendering because he was going to try a Doctor Who gambit, essentially: appear to give up and subvert his captors from the inside. In the source material, he has the ability to convert just about anyone and, in fairness, the Doctor goes against hordes of drones/zombies/etc a lot, and well, it fit.
