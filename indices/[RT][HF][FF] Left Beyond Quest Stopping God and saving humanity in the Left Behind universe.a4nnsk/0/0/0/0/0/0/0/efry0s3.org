  Speaking of forks, I went ahead and put up a simplified variant of the train mod, that can be used for funiculars. It links back to your original mod and gives you credit; let me know if you want the credits altered or the variant mod removed.

Removed? Good god no. I put that thing on Github for a reason. Link?

  BTW do you play KSP? KSP with Principia gives you really good orbital mechanics and, since the graphics are more basic, should run on anything that can run SE.
#+end_quote

Yeah what I want is the crafting/belt mechanics of Factorio, orbital/rocket mechanics of KSP, and building mechanics/graphics of SE. All of that is possible! Somebody just has to do it, basically.

  I liked the story (bit too curb stompy for me though) but I understand there was a bunch of forum drama at the time?
#+end_quote

Yeah I don't even remember that, but it seems like the sort of thing that you might want to poke the mods about first. I don't think there'll be an issue though. Though one of the most steady authors on SV recently moved their story to QQ over mod drama about the pronouns of an in-story character, so don't discount the pornboard - it does have an active non-NSFW section and seems generally more liberal, in the laissez-faire sense.
