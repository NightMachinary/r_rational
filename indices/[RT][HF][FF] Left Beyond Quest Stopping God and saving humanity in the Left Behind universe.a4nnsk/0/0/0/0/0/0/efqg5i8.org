Thanks!

The "fork bomb" thing was always a possibility, I dropped a few hints along the way (how Heaven and Hell worked, the temperature sensors going haywire and continuing to go haywire unless they were on their own subnet, the Hell-experience desktops), but I wasn't expecting people to figure it out at the very end, especially since the prevailing wisdom was doing a terrible job of self-hacking that would have resulted in the Omega freezing up and needing to be rebooted. The ending is ambiguous because the stratagem didn't QUITE work: the Alpha Centauri colonists will eventually die and face the judgement... although by then the mass dieoffs, which thanks to the Omega clones happen in twice as much time as the previous one, will be far enough spaced aparts that a new generation will, hopefully, have been born. The only problem is that everyone would need a metabolic controller from birth. I'd like to redo the last thread, in all honesty, since nobody was very awake for it, least of all me.

I left the players a choice to help either Ihuriel and the strike team, or Kat, and they went with Kat (Whichever they decided to help with the Omega's remaining processing power would survive; the other would die, either by burning up on reentry or by being crushed under rock).

Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check them out. SV looks like it would be a great place for a sequel, since it'll be space based. SpaceBattles is a bit problematic because of The Salvation War, I liked the story (bit too curb stompy for me though) but I understand there was a bunch of forum drama at the time?

I agree with you on planning coherence, I'm blaming spidertank guy. Although the spidertank caper would be a funny short story, if told from the MFer perspective.

BTW do you play KSP? KSP with Principia gives you really good orbital mechanics and, since the graphics are more basic, should run on anything that can run SE.

Speaking of forks, I went ahead and put up a simplified variant of the train mod, that can be used for funiculars. It links back to your original mod and gives you credit; let me know if you want the credits altered or the variant mod removed.
