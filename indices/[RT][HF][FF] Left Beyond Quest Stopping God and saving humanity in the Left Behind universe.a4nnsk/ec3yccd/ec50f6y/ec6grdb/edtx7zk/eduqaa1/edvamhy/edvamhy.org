There was a lot of arguing which slowed down progress, I don't think there's too much else you could have done regarding that (Well I think he finally got the hint when you told him to take over the quest).

On a meta level, pausing the quest for a few months meant that many of the original players (like Sarasti) left, and the new anons who joined didn't have a full picture of what was going on.
