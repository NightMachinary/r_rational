I left it intentionally ambiguous for as long as possible; as it is, within the LBQ timeline, if it had come up significantly, heaven and hell are basically individualized time loops in which the soul/mind is stuck in extreme bliss or extreme pain. The time loop is long just enough to cause the experiencer to go insane, and will thus vary. Hell armor was intended to make someone last indefinitely, best-case-scenario - this would force the entity running the afterlife to expend more processing cycles than are gained by absorbing that soul.

Glad you like my stuff! Feel free to reuse any of it since it's all under a creative commons license.
