Read through the entire thing from top to bottom. Whew. Really liked the first half, pre hiatus. Overall great quest and you did a fine job as a QM, ending was kinda unexpected but still played out nicely.

I must say it was rather frustrating to watch the hellmouth-spidertank r&d anon constantly trying to derail the quest with his crazy schemes of demon summoning, bubble shields, powered armor and declaring war... and also repeatedly trying to bargain with every other player to follow his half baked plans. You have incredible patience putting up with all of that.

Bonus question if you're up for it: why was tsion surrendering and what was his plan?
