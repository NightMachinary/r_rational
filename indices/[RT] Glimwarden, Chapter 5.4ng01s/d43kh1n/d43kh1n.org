I'm already annoyed by how oblivious Sanders is to social and status cues.

Nice job on conveying that, but it's a bit overdone-- you have multiple instances of Philip noticing Sanders not noticing social cues or understanding status. I'm sure that's intentional, but Sanders is going past a bit oblivious and awkward into comically oblivious.

Is it weird that I'm often struck by my similarities to Philip?

"He found it easy to agree with people, even if he didn't agree with them. It wasn't hard to find both the positive and negative in most things"

Rang very true to me.
