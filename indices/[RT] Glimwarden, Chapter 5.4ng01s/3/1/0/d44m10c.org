*tl;dr: Horses are like renting, runework engines are like buying a house.*

I haven't gone into much detail on runework yet, but a runework engine is clean, quiet, low maintenance, and runs "forever" with no need for fuel. It's a sizable initial investment, but after that you don't have upkeep costs to worry about. Because it can run all day without consuming fuel, it's better to never have one sitting idle. If you were a baker who spent an hour in the morning delivering bread, it would be an enormous waste of your resources to just park it next to your shop and have it sit idle for the other twenty-three hours of the day, when instead you could pool resources with your neighbors and share the runework cart. Typically this is structured with a long-term loan rather than an /actual/ upfront payment. (A farmer will typically own their own runework tractor, because they're using it a large portion of the day.)

A horse needs about two hectares in order to get enough food to survive, which is somewhere between four and eight times as much as a person needs (depending on the person's diet). In real-world rural areas, that's not a problem, since land is relatively cheap, but in Light's Hollow pretty much all protected land is in use. Horses need lots of equipment to be usable, plus lots of labor, plus somewhere to be stored. This is aside from dealing with all the filth they generate, which is a problem if you're using them on roads. Beyond all that, a horse is good for only a limited number of hours of labor per day.

Some of it is also explained by legislation. Horses produce something like thirty pounds of manure a day, which is a serious problem in cities if you care about sanitation at all (and that's the say nothing of the urine). Once the horse is forced out of the city center where the majority of the population works and lives, whether by fines, fees, or blanket prohibition, horses are relegated to the outskirts ... but most of what you'd want to use a horse for is to go from the outskirts to the interior.

Hopefully that all makes sense.
