You're probably aware of this already, but most places with limited land and high population (e.g. most of Europe) had many small fields rather than few big ones. That mostly changed with the Industrial Revolution where land became concentrated in fewer, wealthier farmers (before, the land was owned by a few people but they sublet most of it, in feudal systems and the like). Currently there are two main reasons for the large fields - the fact that artificial fertilisers and new strains of crops, together with easier transport and more trade, make it easy to grow only one crop in a large area, and that it makes it easier for tractors to navigate the fields. There's a real problem in the UK with a lack of hedgerows, and a lot of animal species are suffering because of it, now that field boundaries have been removed.

tl;dr modern field boundaries (especially in the US, due to the relatively high amount of land per person) aren't that good of a model for an agricultural society with very limited land.
