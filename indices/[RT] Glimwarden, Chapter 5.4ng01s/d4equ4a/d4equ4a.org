Good chapter. I enjoyed Phillip and Sanders interactions, though I'll chip my 2 cents into the pile for toning down obliviousness a bit more. We're still getting to know both of them though, so maybe it'll fade on its own anyway.

Sent a typo report through the site (gotta get that plugin for mine), but quick non-spelling typo of sorts, Sanders says he has never tried horse before two times while talking to Melanie.
