I might shrink the field sizes down somewhat. Do you have any sources I could look at for field size? I just finished reading through [[http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1156726/err152.pdf][Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming]] [PDF], but they define "farm size" in terms of acres of land operated by the farm, which says nothing about the actual fields themselves.

In Light's Hollow they /do/ have tractor analogs, and they're fairly advanced in terms of scientific understanding, including hundreds of years of intentional selective breeding, nitrogen fixing, and farming equipment (ploughs, harvesters, seeders, etc.). So they only share faint similarities with feudal systems, mostly in that the majority of the land and capital is owned by a minority of the population and there are tenant farmers who do the bulk of the actual labor.
