Eh, I've tried using the discord but I'm not a fan of the app in general, ease of messaging lends itself to shorter and less detailed individual posts compared to other things like reddit/tumblr/etc. Also everything going under a handful of channels makes finding any major discussion starting point harder than a top level reddit comment. I can understand misgivings about spoilers (and even the existense of unseen spoilers can have implications if you know it exists, 5 spoiler paragraphs on a new plot point imply it will be a big focus), but there isn't exactly a way to engage in good Delve discussion while avoiding the "numbers go up" folks.

It'd be nice it reddit had a "minimise/hide comments with any amount of spoiler text" so you cant even see post length function for smaller communities.
