Ah, that makes more sense. Two concerns about it though.

First, author's been a bit antsy about access to reading ahead. I haven't checked in a while, but if i remember right, patreon chapter discussion on the discord was locked to supporters only. Also there was a time when the chapters were getting put up on yiff party (patreon leaking site) occasionally that he specifically requested be stopped. I tend much more towards pro-piracy stuff and haven't been in his shoes, so I don't know exactly how he'll feel about the idea of a discussion thread for patreon chapters going up.

Second concern is about relevance to the sub. Sure it's a more-or-less rational work, but given the paywall that cuts off a lot of people interested in the thread. We don't know how many lurkers drop into threads on established work being posted anyway. Two solutions for that would be asking mods to set up a generic "current rational updates" weekly thread (which actually seems a really good idea to me, Practical Guide saw semi-regular chapter postings here for a while but they weren't very active and eventually stopped). Other option is just making a pure Delve subreddit and making both free and patreon update threads, but then you have the problem of generating interest, as well as attracting too many "numbers go up" types, as well as splitting the already small readerbase community if the subreddit catches on.
