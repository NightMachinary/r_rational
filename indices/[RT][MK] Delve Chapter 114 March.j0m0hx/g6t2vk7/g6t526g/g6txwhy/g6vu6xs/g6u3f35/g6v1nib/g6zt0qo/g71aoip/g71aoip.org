I imagine there are high tier class abilities to bypass armour for the purpose of healing, things Amelia couldn't access because she only gets skills not class abilities, so she had to use the stopgap of just ripping the armour off. Amelia's class lends itself to this dynamic of being able to be almost anything she needs, but running into additional hurdles like this that pure classes can bypass.
