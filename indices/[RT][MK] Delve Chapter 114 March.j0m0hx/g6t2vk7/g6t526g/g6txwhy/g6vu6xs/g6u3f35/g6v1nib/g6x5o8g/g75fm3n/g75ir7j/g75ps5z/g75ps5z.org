I knew I worded that badly. Let me try again, I suggest we start posting threads for the patreon chapters so we have can have our cake and conversation. In that post there would be a pinned comment to link to the free chapter's thread, so the freebies can have their conversations when their chapter comes up. This will benefit them too because now they will have 2 months worth of comments they can interact with (which will include the entire Delve audience, not just the freebies). Since there will be an 8 chapter discrepancy at the start, until the threads for the freebies catch up to where the first patreon threads started, we'll have double posts, so that eventually, every chapter will have a thread. And every thread will have a link to the patreon, so SS will benefit, I think. But also, every thread will have a link to the royal road when it eventually goes up there, too.
