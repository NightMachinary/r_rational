For some reason it's funny to see Rain worried about mind reading. I really doubt he knows the finer points of uranium refinement and all the required processing to make nuclear weapons. Besides that, is there really dangerous information he could possibly have that wouldn't inevitably be figured out from the other information he plans to introduce anyway?

It's wild how useful that ring is. I forgot why Tallheart made him it; I wonder if he'll ever get a better one.
