"What i'm telling you is that if a magic filter worked like i suggested, it'd be fine for me because it at least isn't completely breaking things.

In the same way, if a magic filter worked the way you suggested, it'd make more sense than a magic filter working the way you suggested Plus makes coffee. Because it breaks less things."

What the heck is your argument here, how are things breaking less in your idea, what the heck dose coffee have to do with isotopes? You are really hard to understand and you are suffering from the Dunning Kruger effect because you think isotopes have the same chemical properties, but they don't have the same properties many enchment processes use the differences to filter, it's not the 40s anymore centrifuges are not the only process.
