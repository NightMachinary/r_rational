I doubt any of us are unaware of the difference between isotopes and chemicals. It's not a complicated topic.

What's more difficult to understand is why you think this difference is relevant here? Because real filters operate on chemistry? These are magical filters that obviously do not operate on the same mechanics. They are explained as becoming permeable to some materials but not others.

I can see that you are trying to paint my statement as silly, but it really just looks like you're clumsily plugging the relevant words into the form of an argument you've seen before. And honestly, we don't have a reason to assume it's impossible to have some kind of teleportation-based filtration system that teleports only certain materials.

Perhaps I was not clear in what I was trying to say here, because you clearly didn't understand. If magical isotope-separation IS possible, and Rain assumes it ISN'T, then he might be less careful with nuclear secrets and accidentally give his enemies nukes. If Rain behaves as though it IS possible, or at least that it MIGHT BE possible, the he will be more careful than is necessary with nuclear secrets. This doesn't have negative consequences except that it might be a bit inconvenient.

  What's really silly is assuming new properties which haven't been demonstrated.

You seem to have a fundamental inability to understand the difference between "assuming something is possible" and "refusing to assume something is impossible."

You are making an assumption that a certain thing is impossible by assuming that a fictional magic system is limited in its ability to separate materials by atomic weight (for some reason). I am not assuming it's possible, I'm just not ruling it out.
