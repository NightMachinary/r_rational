  I could really do with people who know how fundamentally different isotopes and chemicals are.

I think the problem is that you're literally the only person I've seen who thinks that Tallheart's filters work on a "chemical" basis and not an "intent" one.

If they work like Purify, they work on what he /thinks/ it should separate. And if it works like that, then it should be able to separate materials based on any sufficiently imaginable characteristic.

EDIT: Also, because it needs saying

  Could Tallheart build a filter for U235?

It's right there in the chapter. /Rain/ believes that it might work like that. Argue with it all you want, but you need to take it up with the author, not just the people who've read the actual chapter.
