We know for a fact that magic can tell the difference between 'filth' and dirt that's where it 'should be' because of how Purity works. It's silly to assume there are arbitrary limitations on magical filtration that would prevent separation of isotopes.

More importantly, it would be silly for /Rain/ to assume isotope-filtration is impossible given the magnitude of the consequences if he is wrong and the knowledge gets out.
