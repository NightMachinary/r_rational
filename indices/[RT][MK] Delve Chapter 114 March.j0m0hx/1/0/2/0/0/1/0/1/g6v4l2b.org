There is already magic that works on intent in this world. (Purify)

You are the one assuming it isn't possible for reasons that have no evidence to back it up.

"Filters, no matter how magic they are, would do absolutely nothing to seperate 2 isotopes and he would very much need to know the reactions needed to do it the actual way."

"Filters works because different chemicals have different chemical properties. Isotopes have none."

What is your evidence that the magic filters work like chemical reaction filters?

If they work by chemical reactions there would be chemicals being spent, like something bonding with tin and not iron. Where is the stuff that tin is bonding to? Show us the evidence.

Also not all filters work by chemical reactions, they can work by particle size, or mass (like how U235 has a different mass then U238) also you wouldn't want to drink heavy water, because it has different chemical properties then regular water, so you are wrong about isotopes not effecting chemistry.

"Just don't assume it is possible until proven so, like the initial comment i answered to."

Then why is it ok for you to assumes things you hypocrite? No excuses. Uranium can be enriched useing lasers because the different isotopes have different properties in interacting with light.
