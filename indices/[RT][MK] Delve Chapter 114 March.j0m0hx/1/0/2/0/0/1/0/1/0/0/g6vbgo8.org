"The story's text ?"

Where. You are obviously dodging the question.

"I said chemical properties, so not necessarily reactions.

As for "Where is the stuff that tin is bonding to?" well i dunno, the filter maybe ? Tallheart needing to change his filters seems to indicate it."

No because he was able to get pure tin, so it wasn't bonded to anything.

"I'm aware and it is an exception. If i say humans have 10 fingers, are you going to screech that a tiny tiny tiny percentage has more/less and thus that i'm wrong or do you understand that the very vast majority has 10 ?"

It isn't an exception, many enrichment processes uses the different chemistry between isotopes filter.

"Which is a physical property. There's a reason i said chemical property.

Please read before replying the next time :/"

That is irelavent you still haven't shown me any evidence that the magic filters work by chemical processes. I wonder why....
