I'm just telling you that this whole "not following chemistry except for this one principle of it" is a rule you've made up all by yourself. It's not in the canon material.

And as for the "it's magic," the inverse of that is "it's science" which is an equally bad argument because it can be used to invalidate literally anything in a setting with magic.
