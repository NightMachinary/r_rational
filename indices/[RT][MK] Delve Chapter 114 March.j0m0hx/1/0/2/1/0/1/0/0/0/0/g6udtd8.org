  How can i keep saying something that i said for the first time ?

I mean...

    would do absolutely nothing to seperate 2 isotopes

    Filters works because different chemicals have different chemical properties.

Both are basically the same argument, just worded differently. You've decided on a point where the filters start following the laws of physics we know, but the issue is that that point is not backed by the canon material.

As for Tallheart's filters, I really don't know what to tell you. He can filter out rock which is incredibly vague for a "chemical," so I don't understand what would be so fundamentally different about separating "strange metal" from "strange metal that is slightly heavier." The fact that he hasn't mentioned isotopes doesn't mean much, so you're taking absence of evidence as a confirmation that such a thing is impossible.

If you're curious why I'm ignoring your fifth point, I do that because I have no interest in expanding upon a snide potshot which will just lead to a quote stack tangent that goes fifteen comments deep and achieves exactly nothing.
