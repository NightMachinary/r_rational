That speech of his reminded me of a question regarding healers. I know Amelia had to tear off Carten and I think Rain's armor to be able to heal them when they went Delving together. How would a specialized healer get past the armor of their own party members when they get injured. Do you think there's specialized skills that can somehow bypass armor? Getting past your ally's defenses sounds especially important for the ranged heals Rain mentioned. If there is, sounds like a great way to fight in PvP if it can be used offensively, especially at range.
