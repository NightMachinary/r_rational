> Filters works because different chemicals have different chemical properties.

Umm... this is definitely not a universal property of filters. For example, I have a filter in my email, that puts messages with certain words in the title to a certain folder. There are no chemical properties involved. There is no reason to believe that the properties of a magical filter are any more closely related to a chemical filter, than they are to a programmatic one. The word "filter" only implies the capability to let something through and not something else.

If I had a machine that lets only one isotope through by, say a magnetic and electric field, it would be entirely fair to call it an isotope filter. And I think such a machine could also separate iron from ore. So how do you know that's not the principle inside Tallheart's filter? (Personally, I think programming metaphors are more fruitful, though.)
