In a world where they don't understand zero, there's no imaginable way they have the mathematical capabilites to create a nuclear bomb. A dirty bomb, sure, maybe.

But who is to say they even have uranium in this world? And are we to believe teenager Rain somehow knows how to make a nuclear bomb? Do they even have gunpowder in this world? How would they manage to create not only the explosives needed to create a critical mass of uranium, but the proper shape, quantity, enclosure, etc. Not to mention the electronics necessary in a world with no fucking electricity.
