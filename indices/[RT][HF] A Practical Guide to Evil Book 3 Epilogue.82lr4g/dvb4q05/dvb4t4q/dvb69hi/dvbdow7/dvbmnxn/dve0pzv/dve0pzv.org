Hand waving is a metaphor referring to the Jedi mind trick in star wars. Obi-Wan waving his hand says "these are not the droids you're looking for" and the stormtroopers take that at face value and go about their day, even though those, uh, kinda /were/ the droids they were looking for.

Thus, in a world where it would only take one driven Warlock or Ranger who decides to invent computers on a whim, the author waves his hand and says "the gnomes would destroy everyone if that happened" and we take that at face value and accept it, since really we just want a token effort to explain why everything's stuck at medieval levels of tech and not space-age.
