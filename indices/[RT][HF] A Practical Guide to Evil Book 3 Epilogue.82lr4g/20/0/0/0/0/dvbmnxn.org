I agree with you. Only I'm unsure about calling it hand waving.

English is not my first language, so I may be wrong, but the way I understood that phrase (from wiki):

"a plot device (e.g., a scientific discovery, a political development, or rules governing the behavior of a fictional creature) that is left unexplained or sloppily explained because it is convenient to the story, with the implication that the writer is aware of the logical weakness but hopes the audience will not notice"

Does that fit?
