I had doubts this story could maintain its high standard at three chapters a week, especially when the quality dipped last time this happened, but if anything the ending of Book 3, from the Killian chapter onwards, has been nothing but outstanding.

One of the things I miss most about HPMOR is just how great the Crowning Moments of Awesome were and this story is the closest I've found at recreating such moments, and this book had those moments feel more earnt and more satisfying than even the previous two. A well developed build up that really paid off.
