Such a good epilogue.

The fight between Black and Malicia was great and is not over yet, Black swore we was going to purge the Wasteland and i dont think he will back down.

Cat was ascended to Mab as the Queen of Air and Darkness, is that a Name Name? The coronation and fae delegation had me truly laughing as an overload of awesome. It belongs as one of the moments of awesome in the series, also Akua was turned into clothing.

The crusade is officially comming and Cat is speaking with the mastermind behind it. ^{^{^{^{^(I}}}} ^{^{^{^{love}}}} ^{^{^{^{u}}}} ^{^{^{^{Thief)}}}}

Did the Hierarch bureaucracyed the Bard into leaving his story forever? also he has the hability to work as a augur-lite, but he does not believe in his own powers because he is crazy.

So many things happening, will the author take a break?
