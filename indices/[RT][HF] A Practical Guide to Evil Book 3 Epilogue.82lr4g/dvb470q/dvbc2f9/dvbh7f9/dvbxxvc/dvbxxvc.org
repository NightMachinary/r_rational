to Quote Anaraxes "I know you, old thing. You are the sound of the lash, the deal in the dark. You are the servant of stillness. I deny all you peddle." which apart from being a very badass statement, is also really interesting

He calls her Servant of Stillness, i guess this refers to motion, rather than sound. As in the Bard keeps the game going, but not ever actually changing. She does have an agenda, but currently the agenda seems to be "killing the calamities" who are breaking the game. At any cost, be that sacrificing a few heroes, allying with a Tyrant, the calamities must die, the game must go on.

Hierarch (I'm just gonna call him that) pisses her off cause he isn't picking a side, which is inexplicably even more game breaking than what the calamities are doing, plus also really fucking bizarre.
