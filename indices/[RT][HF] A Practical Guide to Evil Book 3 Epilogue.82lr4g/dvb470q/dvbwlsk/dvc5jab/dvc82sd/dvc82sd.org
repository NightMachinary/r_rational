The reason I think it's hero bait is because it's A. macabre as fuck and B. a villain's signature garment. A cloak like that exists to flutter dramatically to the ground, probably from the top of the Tower, after Cat is obliterated by holy light or some shit. Or maybe to be hoisted as a flag of victory over her dread regime.
