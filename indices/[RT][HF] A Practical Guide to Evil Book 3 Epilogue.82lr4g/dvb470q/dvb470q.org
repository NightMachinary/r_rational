Oh heck yes. So much shit hitting so many fans I don't know where to squeegee first.

1. Alaya and Amadeus had quite the reunion. For most of the story they've been able to move and assume that despite the other's mistakes, they were both on the same side. No more, and it's great.

2. The coronation was great, but nothing really stuck out to me until the Wild Hunt showed up. Don't think that's Cat's name, even if it'd be cool. Anyone else think putting Akua's soul into an article of clothing Cat wears daily might be a dumb idea? I think it's a dumb idea.

3. I really hope Cordelia manages to achieve some of her goals, I really like her character.

4. Nice to see Anaxares taking some action. Even nicer to see the Bard actually being thrown for a loop. Her statements about deals and the way she talks about the gods above /and/ below have some super interesting implications. Maybe she's not as Heroic as we thought... Although I have to say I still don't like the Tyrant as a character.

5. Dead king getting ready to START SOME SHIT LET'S GET PUMPED FOR BOOK 4
