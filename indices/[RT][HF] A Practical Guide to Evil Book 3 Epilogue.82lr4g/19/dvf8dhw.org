Something that I don't think anyone else has noticed: in order to defeat a villain, you need a trial, a pivot, and a monster.

I'm pretty sure that with the way things are getting set up now, Black is going to be Cat's monster. If one of the heroes that joins up with the Crusade is going to try to off her, they're going to need to kill or recruit Black first to get the narrative weight to pull it off - and I'm pretty sure Black's not going to defect to join the other side, so that just leaves killing him.
