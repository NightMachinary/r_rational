Hm, fair point. What about something simple like “Queen”. Not “Black Queen”, not “Dead Queen”, not “Winter Queen” but just “Queen”. Something less than the others as it has no qualifiers, but also more than the others as she is free to do what she wishes without the weight of previous stories on her shoulders. It would also play in nicely with how she appears to be a successor to Malicia instead of Black (As she outright rejected Black, and she seems fated to take the Tower at some point)
