Tyrant seems too “Evil” for Cat as it doesn't really mesh well with the theme her current team has of having names with ambiguous morality (I.e. Adjutant, Thief, Hierophant, Archer). While it definitely fits with her themes and her story, there's also the tiny issue of there already being a Tyrant, and I doubt he's going to die any time soon.

Also, the note about Chancellor makes me almost thinks that Cat's equivalent will be something like “Advisor”. Something Neutral.

Hmm, what if she starts off as Queen (I mean, Book 3 is literally her climbing through the ranks going from Countess to Duchess to Vice-Queen and now Queen) but eventually become “Empress”. Not “Dread Empress”, but just “Empress” thereby making it clear that she's broken standard story conventions.
