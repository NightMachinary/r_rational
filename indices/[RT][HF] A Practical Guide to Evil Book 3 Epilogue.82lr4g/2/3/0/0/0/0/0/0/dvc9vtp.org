  there's also the tiny issue of there already being a Tyrant, and I doubt he's going to die any time soon.

IIRC, Malicia is also Tyrant. They share an aspect, at the least (Rule). I don't think we've gotten confirmation that all Names can't have multiple bearers.

  Hmm, what if she starts off as Queen (I mean, Book 3 is literally her climbing through the ranks going from Countess to Duchess to Vice-Queen and now Queen) but eventually become “Empress”. Not “Dread Empress”, but just “Empress” thereby making it clear that she's broken standard story conventions.

That looks to be what's happening, unless EE pulls another 'foreshadow something, then derail it'.
