I'm leaning toward Tyrant, or a completely unexpected name, at this point. What Cat has done in the name of Callow's safety, and the 'Governess is Chancellor in all but Name' bit both fit the former, and Cat's inherited disdain for the narrative makes the latter always a possibility.

I hope we see Cat's new Name before the end of B4; I can't take the suspense anymore lol
