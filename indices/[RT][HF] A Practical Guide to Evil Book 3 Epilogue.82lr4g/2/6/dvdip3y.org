"Great Game". Probably wishful thinking on my part but did that come from Riftwar (Empire of Tsuranuanni)?

I think that the Hierach is going to be instrumental in breaking the narrative cycle, which is exemplified by the bard (who seems to be a body jumping consciousness of some ineffable sort). I don't see the series ending with the world order intact, unless the author wants to get really depressing (think dark souls 3 if it only had the firelinking ending).
