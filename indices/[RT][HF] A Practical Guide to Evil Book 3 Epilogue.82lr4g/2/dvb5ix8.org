I rarely comment on threads like these but I felt this chapter was to important not to give my insights so here we go...

1. The conversation between Black and Malicia was interesting in a couple ways, first was how deeply Malicia cared for black, she was willing to forgive him quite easily, on top of that I think a lot of people overestimated how strong/smart Malicia is, that's not to say I think shes dumb but I don't think shes as amazing as everyone thought. Finally black's final quote was very interesting when he talked about the world Cat was going to make, it seemed like he was giving it considerable thought. Oh and I forgot, it seems warlock isn't as loyal as we thought he was considering he wasn't going to back Black on his decision with the soul weapon thingy.

2. The coronation wasn't all that exciting until the end which was very unexpected when the Prince of Nightfall showed up, i'm a little disappointed because we still don't know what the meaning behind Cat giving him the crowns from kings thing was about, or what the consequences would have been. Though I think this is something that no one foresaw, and on top of that we know that the prince of Nightfall was incredibly powerful but he now recognizes Cat as queen and Cat believed she could take him in a fight, that shows that Cat getting to the upper echelons of power levels, I wouldn't say shes on ranger's level yet but shes getting their. The main problem with her power up is that she is at a HUGE disadvantage when facing bard, who knows the stories like the back of her hand so the power is both a blessing an a curse it would seem.

3. We all knew a crusade was going to happen, it's been foreshadowed since the first book, this includes heroes being involved in it so their wasn't much surprise in this part of the Epilogue. I'm not all that surprised Catherine is talking to Procer, she wants to stop her country from being ravaged by another war, but what these negotiations bring about will be interesting to see. I would have been more surprised if it was bard who went to talk to Procer instead though tbh.

4. The people the Hierarch saw in order I think were Malicia, which is even more interesting considering that she showed a moment of weakness an cried, this even furthers my own personal opinion that Malicia really isn't all the scary of an opponent in my eyes, at least from what we know of her. The knight and champion were the white knights squad joining up with other heroes who were old to partake in the upcoming crusade. The Girl on the throne is Cat. I believe the fields of hell would be the Dead Kingdom, I could be wrong though which is interesting because it shows that the dead king might be entering the great game soon, and if that happens then this is escalating even more than I thought it was going to. Knives bared with black and green would be goblins or maybe the drow of the everdark, I don't think we've seen one yet so who knows. Green Eyed man is obviously black. Then the augur and Hierarch saw one another. It's also interesting to note that it would seem the Hierarch can look at anyone, anywhere including the tower would she be warded to kingdom fucking come, but their has to be some kind of catch or condition to this ability I would assume. That part was intersting but was even more interesting is that the Bard can make names and it would appear she is as old as we previously thought. Also interesting to note that bard made a mistake in making the Name Hierarch and I wonder why. Also we knew that bard sometimes interacted with the gods occasionally, but the fact that she knows that the gods above and below are worried about the Hierarch really is cementing her as one of if not the main antagonists in my eyes. She's like the grand string puller of them all, though it would seem Kairos is moving on par with her. When I first saw Kairos I thought, "oh a villain thats gonna be really evil but not all that smart", but what we got is someone who seems to know more about this game than anyone else with the exception of Bard.

5. I wonder what the stone is and what the dead king is going to do with it. It would seem my suspicions above were correct and that the dead king is now moving his pieces onto the board which is probably going to shake everyone up except maybe Kairos, I have a feeling he's anticipated this in some fashion, or maybe Malicia might have something to do with it since it may have something to do with Triumphant. I don't really have much thoughts on what the stone could do except something to do with Malicia honestly, actually maybe that's why she was crying, she was calling on the dead king as a last resort or something, hmm...

Extra thoughts on the series: I wonder how this is gonna be wrapped up in 2 books, I feel like their is so much left to explore besides the crusades, dead king, and kairos. We still have much to learn about the everdark, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and other countries/continents that are much larger then the one we currently know about.
