+RE 2, I think you're confusing the Prince of Nightfall with the King of Winter, (now of the combined Fae) who was the one Cat swore to.+

Edited. I'm wrong

  I believe the fields of hell would be the Dead Kingdom,

It referenced seemingly human people farming who had lived there for generations and not seen the sun. Dead king seems to exclusively have undead subjects, so I interpret it as possibily Triumphant's kingdom in the Hells. (Maybe the abandoned Legionaries would meet up with them?)

  Extra thoughts on the series: I wonder how this is gonna be wrapped up in 2 books, I feel like their is so much left to explore besides the crusades, dead king, and kairos. We still have much to learn about the everdark, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and other countries/continents that are much larger then the one we currently know about.

Wrapping up this story doesn't necessariy mean wrapping up the setting as a whole. In a similar way to how Wildbow ended Taylor's story in Worm but brought bac teh world for Ward
