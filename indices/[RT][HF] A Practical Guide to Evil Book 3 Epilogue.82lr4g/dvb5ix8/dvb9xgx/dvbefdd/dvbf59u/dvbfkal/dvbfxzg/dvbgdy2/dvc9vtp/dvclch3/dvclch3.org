  IIRC, Malicia is also Tyrant. They share an aspect, at the least (Rule). I don't think we've gotten confirmation that all Names can't have multiple bearers.

Not sure where, but I'm pretty sure at one point it's explicitly stated that Alaya came into the Name of Dread Empress. I mean, Dread Emperor/Empress makes sense as Praes has a lot of narrative weight in the grand scheme of things. Along with that, I'm pretty sure Tyrant is exclusive to Helike as whenever Helike is mentioned, Tyrants are mentioned soon after and it's clear that Tyrants are closely associated with Helike.

Also, I'm pretty sure Names can't have multiple bearers as in the first book Cat and a few other Claimants for the Name of Squire have to duke it out to prove that they have “claim” over the name. However, we do know that Aspects aren't exclusives to Names and can be shared. Cat has *Learn* at the same time Range does for example, so it's likely that the “Ruler” Names (I.e. Tyrant, Dread Empress, Good King) can have *Rule* as a Aspect.

  That looks to be what's happening, unless EE pulls another 'foreshadow something, then derail it'.

This seems highly likely and I'm honestly expecting shit to hit the fan so hard that Cat ends up going in a wildly different direction. Who knows, maybe the Dead King will be destroyed and Cat can take his Name, but I find that unlikely
