  Oh and I forgot, it seems warlock isn't as loyal as we thought he was considering he wasn't going to back Black on his decision with the soul weapon thingy.

Well, those are two of his oldest friends arguing over a matter he holds in disdain.

  The main problem with her power up is that she is at a HUGE disadvantage when facing bard, who knows the stories like the back of her hand so the power is both a blessing an a curse it would seem.

Given the nature of her current power and how much Catherine swears, I hope her new Name would be something along the lines of "Cursed" (except a ruler one and not transitional), and one of her Aspects would be Swear that would allow her to put limitations on before going into her fae form (with a handicap of, say, only three oaths at a time).

  Also we knew that bard sometimes interacted with the gods occasionally, but the fact that she knows that the gods above and below are worried about the Hierarch really is cementing her as one of if not the main antagonists in my eyes.

I think by not really human she might mean the beings with more agency like the angelic choirs, Dead King and the nonhuman nations, or maybe the ones she really hates, like Malicia.

Also, may I gush for a second about how bloody awesome was Anaxares in exiling Bard out of existence? Her fault, obviously, for ignoring the favor he did for her, then tempting him, then threatening him despite not being allowed to directly involve herself in the story, but still.

  I don't really have much thoughts on what the stone could do except something to do with Malicia honestly, actually maybe that's why she was crying, she was calling on the dead king as a last resort or something, hmm...

Yeah, most likely. Remember how Triumphant was said to rule /all of Calernia/, save for Golden Bloom, which was out of Creation at the moment? No way she took over the Kingdom of the Dead and nobody mentioned it in the story yet as her greatest achievment; she must have had some treaty with Trismegistus.
