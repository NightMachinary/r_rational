  The coronation was great, but nothing really stuck out to me until the Wild Hunt showed up.

There's a few sentences that might mean something in the long run, though most of it is probably red herrings. This is definitely a chapter that we'll have to revisit halfway through book 4 to find it reads very differently.

#+begin_quote
  The Governess-General, he knew, was nearly as influential as the queen in some parts. If not more. Chancellor in all but Name, men whispered.
#+end_quote

Note the capital N. The Name of Chancellor has only ever been used in this serie to describe the right-hand of the Dread Emperor/Empress. The crown of Callow isn't the one people expect to see on Catherine's head by the end of it all.

#+begin_quote
  The Grandmaster was one of the few of his people high enough in rank to understand what was being built, though. A war machine unlike any he had ever seen. Callow was being put on war footing long before the first blade left the sheath.
#+end_quote

We get confirmation that Cat is preparing for the greatest war of them all. She's reforging the Knightly Orders and raising her own Legions. With the later revelation that she's discussing with Procer, this could go a million ways.

#+begin_quote
  That governors no longer paid taxes directly to the Tower or even the short-lived Ruling Council had thrown the old system into disarray
#+end_quote

Not sure how relevant that will be, but Callow has basically broken with the Tower and taken independance. Malicia doesn't seem to consider this a breach of the new contract though.

#+begin_quote
  A saying was born of it that had Grandmaster Talbot shivering every time he heard the words: crowned by dread and cloaked by woe.
#+end_quote

Setting aside the choice of words referring to the Fifteenth and the Woe, Catherine is widely perceived as a decidedly Evil woman. She is being crowned Queen of Callow (a historically Good nation) by the House of Light, while wearing the full regalia of a Villain. Apparently, the people are largely okay with it, if not wholeheartedly approving. This has the taste of a Pivot.
