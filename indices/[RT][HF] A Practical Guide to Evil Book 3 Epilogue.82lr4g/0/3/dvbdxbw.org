  1. The coronation was great, but nothing really stuck out to me until the Wild Hunt showed up. Don't think that's Cat's name, even if it'd be cool. Anyone else think putting Akua's soul into an article of clothing Cat wears daily might be a dumb idea? I think it's a dumb idea.

I agree this would be bad idea, and I think the rumors about Akua's soul are distraction and Cat did something different with her soul.
