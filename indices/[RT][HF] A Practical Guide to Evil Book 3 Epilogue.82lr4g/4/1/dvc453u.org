I also dont like the development of Malicia. While she was originaly portraited as kind of intelligent villian trying to break free of narative, I feel that with gambit with flying fortress she kind kind of screwed it all up. Super weapon destroyed, crusade imminent, closest assest antagonized and desperate measures on the way. It going to go downhill from here.
