  It is flawed. The Wasteland has made a religion out of mutilating itself. We speak of it with pride. Gods, iron sharpens iron? We have grown so enamoured with bleeding our own we have sayings about it. Centuries ago, field sacrifices were a way to fend off starvation. Now they are a staple of our way of life, so deeply ingrained we cling to them given alternative. Alaya, we consistently blunder so badly we need to rely on demons to stay off destruction. We would rather irreparably damage the fabric of Creation than admit we can be wrong. There is nothing holy about our culture, it needs to be ripped out root and stem as matter of bare survival

Sometimes I love this story.

I think that Black is planning to betray Malicia. He says "It's strangely invigorating. To have every plan you ever made ripped apart." I think he's come to terms with the fact that Malicia isn't going to deviate from the pattern of "Defect, defect, defect, OH SHIT EVERYONE IS PISSED AT ME NOW", and that he has to make new plans centered more around Catherine.

I'm actually really pissed at Malicia myself. She's acting almost narcissistically here. "Black, because of what you did I have to face actual consequences when I decide to be complicit in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people! And how dare you undermine the plans I very obviously made behind your back because I knew you wouldn't approve of them? It's almost like lying about sensitive matters to my most important lieutenants is a bad idea!"

Otherwise, the much hypes crusade is on its way. I'm still unclear on the logistics of it, since, as pointed out by the generals, Catherine can teleport armies anywhere she wants, out of any ambush and into enemy capitals, which means she's basically invincible against non-named, and White Knight only takes them so far.
