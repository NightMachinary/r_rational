My bets on the futur:

-Malicia completely lost it, and thinks her situation is salvageable. She is still playing words games when they are far beyond that. It's not salvageable at all (lost too much of her army, no more Black Knight, no more Calamities), and she will do the "old evil gambit" aka doing a shitty thing which will backfire (maybe the Dead King, maybe something else)

-Black will kill Malicia, Cat becomes Empress, and Black becomes Cat's new Black Knight.

-Hanno will judge Cat, and the Heavens will find her non-guilty. He becomes Cat's White Knight.

Starting from there, the Pattern will more or less break, with Bard being the final incarnation of the famous:

  “When heroes and villains come knocking in the name of fate,” I spoke, tone calm and measured. “When they try to drag us back to where we were by force with a Choir behind them or the host of some howling Hell -- I'll kill them all. Every last one of them.”

And we can also add the fact the last declaration of Hierarch is very close to Cat's declaration above, so he will probably ally with Cat at some point, they share the same views (Unlike Kairos).

  “You are mad,” the Bard said. “And putting a knife to your own throat. They will take you apart.”

  “If the Heavens seek to impose their will, they will be made to stand before a tribunal of the People,” the Hierarch serenely said.

  “Your own fucking Gods will bleed you like a pig,” the Wandering Bard hissed.

  “Then they, too, will be hanged,” Anaxares noted. “As honorary citizens of the Republic, they are subject to its laws.”
