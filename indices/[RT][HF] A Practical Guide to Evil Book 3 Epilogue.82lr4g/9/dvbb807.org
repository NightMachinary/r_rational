Also, some might have forgotten, but the Queen of Arcadia had granted free passage to Cat /and everyone under her command/. So Larat just got free passage to whatever point of Arcadia he needs for his personal goals, and Cat got unlimited amount of gates trough it.

The true question is, just how flexible that power is? The opening of gates was shown to have at least some limitations related to the ownership of the place they lead to, so she can't just pop up in Forever King's throne room and stab him in the back, but how much power does the Court of Arcadia hold over the parts that elves occupy? How do the inherent domains of the elves interact with Arcadia and the fae domains, other than being able to negate one creational law at a time?
