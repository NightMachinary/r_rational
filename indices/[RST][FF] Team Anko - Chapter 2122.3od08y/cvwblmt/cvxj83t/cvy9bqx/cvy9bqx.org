  Kurama has stated that if Naruto dies, he (Kurama) dies too, and is trapped in Hell for 100 years. Of course, Kurama isn't exactly a trustworthy source....

Of course, if Naruto dying had a positive effect on Kurama, he'd probably already have forced him to go ham on Konoha when they were child abusing him, secure in the knowledge that he'd get killed by ANBU or similar. Child-Naruto would have been much more open to manipulation. Wouldn't have been that hard. Or any number of other ways he could have allowed or forced Naruto to die.

So it's probably at least as bad as suggested, though it certainly could be worse.
