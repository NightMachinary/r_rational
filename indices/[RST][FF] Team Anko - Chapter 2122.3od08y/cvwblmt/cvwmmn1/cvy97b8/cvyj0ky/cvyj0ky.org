What scenario are you envisioning where Naruto has to pull that kind of gambit for the Kyuubi to provide chakra? Have you read this story? Naruto thinks he's on friendly terms with the Kyuubi, and the Kyuubi is perfectly willing to give him chakra to ingratiate himself with his host. That's exactly why he's dangerous, because Naruto thinks they can have a partnership on equal footing, while the Kyuubi is an eldritch beast of massive knowledge, intelligence, and power.
