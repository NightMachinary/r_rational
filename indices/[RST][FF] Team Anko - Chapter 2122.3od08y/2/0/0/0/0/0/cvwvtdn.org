The team agreed awhile ago that Naruto should carry around four canteens on his back that Shino would fill with kikai, so that they had some extra punch when it was needed, as well as a bunch of kikai pre-loaded with chakra in case one of the others needed a refill. They were pulled out during the battle against the Sound kids a few chapters ago.
