What seems to be a group

Guess it was too much to hope Orochimaru didn't know about Shino's spying attempts :D Surprised Kurama hasn't started feeding him chakra from the moment he sensed the drain, but I suppose they're not really /friends/ as of this time. Still would have expected it for continued-life reasons, but could be if Naruto dies Kurama goes free from his prison rather than dying alongside his jailor.
