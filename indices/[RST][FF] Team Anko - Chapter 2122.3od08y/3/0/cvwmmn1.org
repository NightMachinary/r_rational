They will never be friends.

  if Naruto dies Kurama goes free from his prison rather than dying

I doubt that is the case.

If the Kyuubi gave Naruto chakra whenever he needed it, there would be very little incentive for Naruto to meditate and expose himself to the Kyuubi's manipulations. Naruto is not in any immediate danger of dying, or the Kyuubi /would/ save his life with his chakra, which means there is room for the Kyuubi to use this opportunity to build more rapport with Naruto.
