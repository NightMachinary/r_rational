I don't really like the shorter and shorter chapters, but I enjoyed how everyone is raising the stakes with every turn.

-Orochimaru seems to be brute-forcing his way into gaining team Anko's trust. Physically forceful and taunting Naruto, playing Hinata's traumas, teasing Shino's repressed emotions and all done overtly, with complete disregard for decency. It might work...

- ...if we hadn't seen how ruthless and cold team Anko could be when they believe that they are dealing with enemies. Is Naruto really such a 'hero' that he would put his teammates at risk to save the bad guy's minions? Or is he drawing the 'heroic idiot' card and trying to play along with Orochimaru's plans? Or is Orochimaru aware of this and trying to trap the team into their act by elevating and aggravating the consequences, like with Hinata's defection?

-Why doesn't Naruto create an army of clones and just stomp out of the place? He explicitly says that he can make several thousand clones a second and maintain that rate for several tens of minutes. I'm not sure that Orochimaru has the resources to stop a 100k strong army of ninjas running away as fast as they can in the next 10 minutes.

-How far away can Shino maintain control of his swarm? If it's several hundred meters, he can maintain the oil-infused bugs as a sword of Damocles over the Sound village while team Anko makes its escape. He already has an igniter: the blazing fires he can just ram his bugs into. Heck, why hasn't the swarm burst into flames already?

-Can Orochimaru move very fast underground! If not, Shino just has to concentrate his bugs around Orochimaru and plant an explosive tag nearby. Orochimaru moves, he'll have to dive underground to evade the firestorm. The rest of the swarm disperses to avoid killing team Anko as well.
