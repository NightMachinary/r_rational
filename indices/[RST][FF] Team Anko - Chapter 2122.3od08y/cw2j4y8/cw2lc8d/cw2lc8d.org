  I don't really like the shorter and shorter chapters, but I enjoyed how everyone is raising the stakes with every turn.
#+end_quote

These two chapters together were about the length of a standard chapter. I wanted a chapter break on the image of the giant swarm, but that left it very short, hence the second chapter.

  Is Naruto really such a 'hero' that he would put his teammates at risk to save the bad guy's minions?
#+end_quote

To save enemy ninja, no. To save civilian women and kids who happen to live in a foreign village, yes. He's also pretty confident that the fire isn't a threat with Kurama helping, and equally confident that Kurama will help.

  Why doesn't Naruto create an army of clones and just stomp out of the place? He explicitly says that he can make several thousand clones a second
#+end_quote

His limit is actually just under a thousand. The passage you're referring to, he was having the experience of being tired for the first time in his life, and was trying to find an appropriate simile -- what he came up with was "well, when I create my max number of clones I have a brief moment of tiredness from low chakra, and then my chakra refills and it goes away, so this is what it would feel like to be at that low chakra state for a long period of time".

The way I've defined it, Naruto's chakra reserves are ridiculously large, but his regeneration is immense -- orders of magnitude faster than the average ninja's. It's the primary reason he doesn't get physically tired. (Although he does still get sleepy.)

  How far away can Shino maintain control of his swarm? If it's several hundred meters, he can maintain the oil-infused bugs as a sword of Damocles over the Sound village while team Anko makes its escape.
#+end_quote

He can pass orders through a chain of kikai, so with a swarm this size he can control them from miles away. Orochimaru has no problem with him leaving, but has made it clear that he will kill all of them rather than let Naruto leave before the fire is out.

What they could have proposed was "you want Naruto for his chakra, but you're willing to let us go afterwards. I'll leave the swarm, which has enough chakra for your needs, and we'll leave now." Unfortunately, Naruto had already headed off to be heroic before Shino thought of it, and Orochimaru might not have gone for it anyway. Kikai have a lifespan of a few hours and Orochimaru wouldn't be able to control them once Naruto left, so they aren't as good for his needs.

  Heck, why hasn't the swarm burst into flames already?
#+end_quote

They aren't close enough to the fire.
