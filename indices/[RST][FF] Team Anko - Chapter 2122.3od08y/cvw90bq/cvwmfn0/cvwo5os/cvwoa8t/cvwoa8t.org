I don't think Naruto cares, period. He's not feeling it, it benefits the team, and if it's used against him in a prank, it's a good prank. I don't see any conceivable way that Naruto would actually care unless it ended up being used to harm the people he cares about. Do we even know that Naruto didn't know about this? This was to sustain part of their mission in the first place.
