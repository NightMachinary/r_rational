I helps to have watched the first season. While doing the dishes or something. You don't need to study it or anything, and that vague level of knowledge is all you really need. Read the wiki to add to that as needed (though it really isn't).

Or watch just the Chunin Exam arc, to get an idea of the setting and timing of events, plus the season two [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDIVq8UMLM][Lee fight]] to get a feeling for the action pacing. That's the best part in the entire series anyway.
