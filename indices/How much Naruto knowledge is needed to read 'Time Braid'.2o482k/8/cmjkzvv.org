I've recently read time braid with zero knowledge of naruto and enjoyed it. Most details are easy to infer from the story but a few are a bit confusing, especially the names for general types of jitsu. Honestly, I'd recommend watching the naruto spoof series fandub (aka naruto abriged), just to get some background.
