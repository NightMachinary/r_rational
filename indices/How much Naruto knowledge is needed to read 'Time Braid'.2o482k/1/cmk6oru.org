I agree with everyone else -- you don't need much. The following should cover most of it:

- Chakra: magic energy. Every living thing has it
- Jutsu: a magic spell
- Handseal: magic gestures you use to cast jutsu
- Ninjutsu: "magic" techniques like creating matter and energy (fireballs, etc)
- Taijutsu: martial arts
- Fuinjutsu: seals. Writing that does magic -- for example, a storage seal is like a bag of holding: it lets you put stuff into extradimensional storage and pull it out later.
- Genjutsu: illusions
- Naruto is the jinchuriki of the Kyubi. The Kyubi is the most powerful of nine extremely powerful demons called the Tailed Beasts. (The Kyubi is the Nine Tailed Beast, others have eight, seven, etc) A jinchuriki is a person who has one of the Tailed Beasts sealed inside them.
- Naruto has immense chakra reserves to start with, and can draw on the Kyubi's power in a real jam. He also has extremely fast regeneration (heals a bad beating in a day or two); it's probably due to the Kyubi's power, but it might be a bloodline.
- Bloodlines are genetic powers -- for example, the Hyuuga are famous for their Byakugan power, which gives them 360 degree vision, ability to see chakra, etc.
- The Kyubi attacked Konoha (the village) twelve years ago. Naruto's father sealed it into baby Naruto, then both Mom and Dad died. The villagers all know about the Kyubi and hate Naruto for it.

That'll probably cover it.

EDIT: Forgot something:

- genin. Apprentice ninja
- chunin: Journeyman ninja
- jonin: Master ninja
- Hokage: Ruler of the village, very powerful ninja. The current one (Sandaime, "Third Hokage") is one of the very few people who likes Naruto. The Yondaime ("Fourth Hokage") was Naruto's father. Sarutobi, the current Hokage was the third Hokage, then Minato (the Yondaime) replaced him, then Sarutobi had to take the job back again because there was no one else to do it. That makes him both Third and Fifth, but he's never referred to as Fifth.
