Going to hijack the top comment to thank everyone who replied. I'm halfway through now, I prepared by reading a plot synopsis of the Chunin Exam arc so I knew what was 'supposed' to happen in the original exam, and looked up the different types of jutsu when someone here told me it might get confusing otherwise. Other than that I just occasionally googled stuff that I needed to know.

You guys were right, I have gotten the feeling of missing references a bit, but it's still a great fic regardless.
