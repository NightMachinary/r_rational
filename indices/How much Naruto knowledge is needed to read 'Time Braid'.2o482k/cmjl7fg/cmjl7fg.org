Personally, I had never read any Naruto before reading the story and got along alright. I did look up a lot of the characters as they came up, because I wanted to visualize them properly, and the story (pretty naturally for fanfiction) didn't spend much space on character descriptions. I also read some of the backstories and power descriptions for those I looked up, which probably helped as well.

Basically, if you're cool with occasionally Googling characters and things you don't get, you'll be fine. But don't feel like you actually have to consume the source canon first.
