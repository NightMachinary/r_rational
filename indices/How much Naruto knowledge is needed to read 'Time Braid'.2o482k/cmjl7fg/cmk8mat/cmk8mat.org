  the story (pretty naturally for fanfiction) didn't spend much space on character descriptions

This is one of the things that really irks me about fanfic. Descriptions aren't just so people can visualize the character, they're so that you can tell us something about the character and who they are. That's in addition to the fact that some people (as evidenced by this thread) read fanfic without having a good grasp of the source material.
