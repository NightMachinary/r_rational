It needs to be specific material things you can see. A particular Bible and a particular printout of the Lesswrong Sequences could be name-swapped, but not all Bibles with the Sequences as a whole. Likewise the Economy as a whole lacks a physical material existence to be seen and swapped with.

Still swapping a prized family Bible that someone used frequently with the Sequences printout would probably work for the purposes of brainwashing them into a Rationalist. They wouldn't forget parts of the Bible they already memorized from other editions of the Bible, but unless they memorized the entire Bible they would rationalize the Sequences as parts of the Bible they missed or overlooked or forgot about.

The Moon would work... if you swapped it with a location, everyone would be convinced that location had no atmosphere and was unreachable without spaceships. Big Locations work kind of weird... if you swapped a house or a neighborhood people would believe that the Moon's properties applied to it, but if you swapped the Moon with an entire city, people might be able to rationalize how individual subportions/buildings/neighborhoods/streets have breathable air despite the city of Moon as whole being a barren airless isolated environment.
