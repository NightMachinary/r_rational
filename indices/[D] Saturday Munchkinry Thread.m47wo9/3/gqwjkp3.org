You can touch an inanimate object smaller than 2 cubic meters and send it backwards or forwards in time, arriving in the same location it is currently in at a time of your choice. If you send it backwards in time, only the immediate effects propagate forwards- for example, if you send an anvil back in time and crush someone one their way to deliver a check, they will be dead in the future, but the check will still have been deposited, and the bank workers will still remember them being there. This also means you cannot use this to win the lottery, as past you will not act on any information you send. You can move an object an unlimited amount of time into the future, but only between 3 minutes and 36 hours into the past.
