Meant to post this on Sat but got too busy, hoping it gets some interest. If not there's always next week. The scenario is ripped from Stephen King's /Under The Dome/, which I highly recommend as a pseudo-rational and very good novel. Minor spoilers follow, but scenario #3 is fully made up and does not constitute one.

A 50km radius sphere, centered on a small town in rural Maine, becomes encapsulated by a transparent dome of force. The dome is impermeable to anything larger than a water molecule, and is 1% as permeable to smaller particles as normal air. Light travels normally through the dome, and sound is a bit muffled but perfectly audible. The dome is a fully immovable object--there is no amount of force that can damage, deform, or otherwise alter its perfectly spherical shape. It has as much friction as standard window glass.

A few scenarios for munchkinry:

1. You are the mayor of the small town trapped inside the dome. Unlike the tyrannical character who ends up in charge in the novel, you are an upstanding and rational civil servant with the best interests of your constituents at heart. With no indication that the dome will ever come down, how do you go about shepherding resources and realigning the town's society and economy to last for as long as possible cut off from all outside resources? (Hint: you'll want to seriously cut down on any kind of particulate emissions, since they can't escape and will accumulate.) Also consider how you would set up a dome-washing process, as otherwise dust, dirt and smoke will adhere to the inside surface and eventually blot out the sun.

2. You are the CEO of an advanced technology R&D corporation with deep ties to world governments and commensurately deep pockets, as well as a team of the world's best scientists and engineers at your disposal. How do you exploit the physics-defying nature of the dome to advance Earth science? Bonus points for doing this in a way that preserves (or, better, helps) the poor residents of Domesville.

3. You are an aspiring supervillain whose latest scheme went better than you could possibly have imagined. You now have the ability to create one invulnerable 50km sphere at a time, given six months of complex calculations and one goat sacrifice. How do you use your newfound power to achieve world domination, with the understanding that if you become Public Enemy #1 as soon as anyone finds out you're responsible for the dome? Domes you create are anchored to the Earth's frame of reference, and their rules apply to you the same as any other matter.
