  You are the mayor of the small town trapped inside the dome

First would be gathering the representatives of each household in one building to set up some rules and prevent panic. The only people exempt from this eetign are emergency services (especially firefighters, even amateur ones, since a fire under the dome means doom).

1. First of all, we assume strict water rationing and recycling / filtering, as best we can. Even though the dome allows rain in and ground water out, most of it is not drinkable.

2. Strict fire control: use of open fires will be limited to communal kitchens, and any use of fire outside of it must be first reported and consulted with t he Emergency Services.

3. Rationing of food. All foods not currently in people's households are reclaimed and rationed by the Town Council, and the citizens are also encouraged to go on a minimal diet and share with their neoghbours.

4. Immediately put work and resources into turning all available land into farmland, plus hydroponics, aquaponics, and vertical gardening. Every seed of every edible plant is re-seeded. The Town Square becomes an agricultural R&D and a market to share info and resources.

5. We collect all the ammo and explosives we have, and try to blow up a hole in the dome. It fails, but accomplishes two objectives: make people realize that the dome is for real and will remain here for foreseeable future, and also it wastes all the ammo making future riots far less bloody.

6. Have my best nerds work on generation or own power, and recycling/fixing everything we own, since trade with the outside is impossible.

7. Order a construction of a hot air balloon. The ballooners will use pressure washers to clean the dome, so it wont become grimy and opaque.
