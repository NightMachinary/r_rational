You could hack stuff very easy, since you could just exploit already closed security problems.

Encryption from way back is now easy to crack. (So hack into databases/servers. Extract encrypted data. Store it safely. Decrypt it in the future.)

You could get to crimes before they happen and film them.

Or just look up someones deleted Facebook page.

Then when you come back, blackmail someone with that information.

Or sell the information to historians. Maybe write fake letters/documents. And hide them were it is plausible but nobody finds them.

That said, if I were the recruit, as soon as I am back in time, I would only do the stuff that gives me money. You shouldn't let your employees do the whole work and show them how much money they made you.

I like the idea, that time loopers just write letters/sms with instructions. So they don't need to do all the things over and over again. Instead they need only write a few letters and can enjoy their lottery money.

Would it be possible, if you stash stuff somewhere (time capsle) and get it a day before you travel back in time? Cause you could have the mystery, how do they smuggle stuff through security.
