Saving a loved one from a tragic accident in the recent past.

With something like a car accident the timing of things has to be exactly correct. Something as simple as creating a pothole and throwing off the roadwork schedule might work to save the person. Or more targeted changes like calling them right before they get on the road and delaying their trip by a minute.
