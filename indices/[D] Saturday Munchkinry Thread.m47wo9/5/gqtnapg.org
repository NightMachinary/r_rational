Given the ability to travel back in time, you have the ability to make small changes. What is the smallest change you can make that wouldn't have a long noticeable effect until you return?

This was going to be a part of a story I was attempting to write, but I've hit writer's block. I want an incentive to have a normal person join a dangerous job, and not cause a disturbance in the past. The idea is that any changes you make if they are big enough butterfly effect away the person making them, but something small doesn't mess up time enough. The job would be stealing information from the past (so it doesn't change too much).

I don't have hard limits on the time travel, other than I'm thinking of within the lifetime of the individual time traveling. The idea originally seemed novel, but after thinking about it, it seems more like some bastard child of Terminator 2 and Timecop...

Edit: the incentive I was looking for is for the recruits. I was thinking something like depositing money into a savings account they wouldn't know about until they return, thus giving them the principle, plus interest, but that is both more messy than I wanted and not interesting enough.
