You could steal from other thieves (or make a duplicate to further minimise problems). If someone is already breaking into a place or system anyway, you gaining that information won't change the public/police perception of what occurred, and whoever originally committed the crime will be prioritising escape and/or hiding from established forcea, rather than a sudden time traveller appearing. And even if you get noticed somehow in your own theft, the original thief/s is still going to be the one on the hook to everyone else and need to prioritise hiding still, rather than prioritising tracking you down.

Oh, and depending on the type and methods of theft, maybe you just follow in their footsteps instead. Investigations will look for one theft, rather than two sequential independent thefts, because how would two thefts even happen without your advantage of literal foreknowledge?

Edit:

Also, stealing from a thief who gets caught before they could use/sell the information originally just means people affected are wary and cautious, since you won't use the information until your own time anyway, and they wouldn't trust the "a guy I never saw before took it from me" defense of the thief.
