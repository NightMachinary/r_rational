A "cleaning products" domain is very well suited for chemical attacks. The traditional, don't-try-this-at-home, example is mixing bleach with an acidic cleaning product to form chlorine gas, but the domain of cleaning can also include industrial-strength products which can be extremely caustic or acidic, particularly when combined properly. For example, think about the chemicals that are poured into commercial pools or the stuff that's used in industrial applications to clean machinery--it can get extremely nasty to the point where you need to wear an ABC grade hazmat suit to handle the stuff.

Even better, if the gas formed by mixing cleaning products still counts as "in the domain", applying telekinesis to it would be an extremely effective attack against anything that needs to breathe and is also well suited for assassination (and to prevent killing yourself in a gas attack obviously). Specifically, you can whip up an odorless gas that's so deadly that only people who've been trained to recognize hypoxia, have quick reflexes, and have an o2 mask within arm's reach would survive.
