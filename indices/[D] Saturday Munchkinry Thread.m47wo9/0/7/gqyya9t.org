Different point from the cleaning-specific munchkining, but the notes on transformation speed and consumption rate on transformation versus while transformed means you could have more efficient power usage by improving your speed here. Grab something long and sharp or with a weight on the end and transform when you swing, put some distance between the two of you, and then untransform until approached or until your next attack if the enemy needs to approach you (or is a mindless monster). The chemicals other people mentioned will have their damage ramp up over time, so attacking, then jumping backwards and untransforming while your enemy writhes in pain could work.

Probably want to work out how outfit transformation rules work, since being able to hide it all across transformations under a large trenchcoat would help with being stealthy, or at least not immediately recognised when you attack.

You mention conjuration gets harder with proximity to another magical girl being greater than to yourself, could you still pull your am back while holding a knife, coat or modify the blade, then lunge forward to stab? The knife is just a simple example, here rather than only application of tempprarily keeping something close to you before launching or moving it somehow.

Also, I assume conjured items last past the detransformation? This would be important to know where hazmat suits and not wasting power staying transformed is concerned.

Oh, and you mention transforming/detransforming/transforming returning you to functional health, can others use it to "scrub" off any chemicals? Can you use it yourself to make excess flesh/blood/ even limbs, since your shtick is chemicals anyway being able to have some additional resources on hand couldn't hurt? Even outside of that being your thing, faking severe injuries with a puddle of blood you quickly replace via transformation could work to turn the tables on someone.

Edit: oh, does detransforming and retransforming restore stamina and how rested you feel? Being able to find space in a fight for less than a second to be back to top shape seems abusable.
