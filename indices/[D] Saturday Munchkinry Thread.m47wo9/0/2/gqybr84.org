As others have pointed out you're functionally the chemical weapon domain, but people don't realize how far this can go. Household chemicals are cute, but they don't hold a candle to industrial hygiene and cleaners. Probably the nastiest cleaners for us would be those used for oil. They use chemicals that are nightmarishly toxic even aside from their real function: to break down the highly resistant organic sludges left over from everything. You're made of much less resistant organics than the things those cleaners eat through.

Depending on the powers definition of "widely used" these could also be very cheap. Is it widely used by person popularity, by tons a year, or by societal impact?

Another area for exploitation is your immunity to contaminants, with a bit of "manual" work you can also be the bioweapon magical girl.

Conjuration in proximity to other magic girls has an easy work around also: just carry your chemicals. Put "safer" ones in whatever works, and get ampules of the more dangerous ones. Bad accidents wouldn't be dangerous to you, and you can probably mitigate them with your power.

Also you can survive off of rotten/diseased/poisonous food and water. And act as a limited intake black hole for water.
