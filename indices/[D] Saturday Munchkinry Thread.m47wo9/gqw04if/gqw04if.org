You are a magical girl. You have a pool of power which you can draw from to evoke various effects. This pool has no maximum amount, but does not replenish on its own; the only way to gain more power is by killing another magical girl and absorbing theirs or by defeating scary monsters.

The main powers of a magical girl are transformation, conjuration, manipulation, and enhancement. All of these are limited by the girl's domain, which is some class of manmade things. The domain also modifies the base power costs of various effects, making some more or less efficient. Your domain is *cleaning supplies.*

*Transformation*:

- All magical girls have the ability to transform, replacing their body with a facsimile, and detransform, reversing the process. Transformation costs only a token amount of power, and detransformation is costless. Staying transformed imposes an ongoing power cost; an hour transformed would cost a moderate amount of power. The transformed body appears similar to the original apart from its costume and sometimes minor cosmetic differences such as strange eyes or hair. All powers are more potent and efficient in this form. A transformed body performs slightly beyond the peak of what is humanly possible in most respects, apart from strength, which is massively enhanced. It is not much more durable than a peak human body, but it is much more robust, like a Hollywood zombie. This form does not retain damage or alteration between transformations; a magical girl who loses an arm, detransforms, and then transforms will be good as new.

- Detransformation is instantaneous, while transformation initially takes a few seconds, though the time can be reduced with practice. You are able to transform in half a second, and your costume is a maid outfit with perpetually sudsy hems.

- Like all powers, transformation and detransformation can be invoked at will, but this will can be involuntary. Magical girls who experience sufficient pain or shock will reflexively detransform. This reflex can be trained out to an extent with practice. You can grit your teeth and maintain your form through anything less painful than dismemberment.

*Conjuration*:

- All magical girls have the ability to conjure items from their domain. Power cost scales with distance, mass, volume, and material displaced; displacing anything denser than air is very costly. Cost also grows exponentially with a new conjuration's proximity to another magical girl relative to its proximity to yourself. There is a moderate ongoing cost to maintaining conjurations as well which is based on only mass and volume. Dismissing conjurations is costless.

- You can conjure all sorts of cleanings supplies: brooms, trash picks, dustpans, cleaning agents of all kinds, and so on. Magical girls differ in the strictness of their domains; unfortunately, you can only create things which actually exist or have existed. You could attempt to game this by making novel cleaning supplies yourself, but your magic is unlikely to recognize their legitimacy unless you manage to get them widely used (even though it is perfectly happy to let you conjure replicas of singleton items that were created without your influence.)

*Manipulation*:

- All magical girls can manipulate items within their domain in various ways, most commonly telekinetically. You can exert forces on cleaning supplies. Power cost seems to scale with magnitude of acceleration in addition to magnitude of force, such that you can have brooms sweep at low cost but accelerating a tiny mass to ballistic velocities would be a great expenditure.

*Enhancement*:

- All magical girls have some ability to enhance certain properties of items within their domain. You have a vague ability to eliminate contaminants and germs from cleaning supplies. You could use this to mop up blood and continuously delete the blood soaked up by the mop, for example. This has a very low power cost.

*Special*:

- Most magical girls have one or more specific abilities in addition to the standard ones. You and your clothes are perfectly clean at all times. Your body passively and involuntarily repels contaminants, and you never have to use the bathroom.

How do you use these powers, particularly in combat? (You can use them for other things, but assume that you are trying to keep them secret from non magi.)
