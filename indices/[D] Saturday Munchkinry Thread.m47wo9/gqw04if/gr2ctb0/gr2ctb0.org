For more mundane use, I'd probably start an incredibe maid service. I'm the best maid basically ever, and as long as I am not too quick I can finish faster than anyone without drawing suspicion. Furthermore, while I don't really know enough about this type of stuff, don't people messing around with bacteria and viruses and other similar stuff need incredibly sterilized environments? I'd be good for that as well.

Speaking of sterilization, could I clean wounds well? That'd be helpful for when I or others become injured. I could conjure a broom and use it as a splint or crutch in emergency situations.

Since I can manipulate cleaning supplies, and chemical agents have been mentioned, I could do some pretty nasty stuff via attacking with some of the stronger stuff, especially if I manage to get/have incredibly fine control over the supplies. Less quantity means less power expended, and with fine control I can do more with less so.
