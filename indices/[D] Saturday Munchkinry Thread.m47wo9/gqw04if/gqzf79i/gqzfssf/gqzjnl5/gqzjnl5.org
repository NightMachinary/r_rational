Whoops, sorry, I must have overlooked the sentence about manmade things. Most of the ideas I suggested don't work in that case. But if water mixed with other things can count as manmade, then tap water might still count, since it's usually fluoridated and chlorinated. Also, you can still use abrasive blasting with manmade materials like glass beads and metal shot. I doubt that an abrasive blaster would work better than a gun, but it would be easier to obtain, and you could conjure ammo as needed.
