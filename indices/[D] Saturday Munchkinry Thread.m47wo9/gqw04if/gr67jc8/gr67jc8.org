Sorry I'm late. I have some ideas, and I'll try not to rehash what the others have said.

  Cost also grows exponentially with a new conjuration's proximity to another magical girl relative to its proximity to yourself.

Important goal: conjure things here, get them over there.

  Dismissing conjurations is costless.

Ahah: this is going to be very useful. Suppose I conjure spill absorber powder and use it to blot a stain, then dismiss the absorber. Does the liquid it has absorbed go away with it?

If yes, then a stream of oven cleaner (lye) becomes a disintegration ray--the dilution of its potency is negated by dismissing that which has already reacted. Like pressure washing, but the pressure washer fluid disappears and takes whatever it is touching with it. Actually, I'll literally shoot it out of a pressure washer. Might void the warranty on my conjured item.

If no, then mixing chlorine bleach and ammonia becomes a devastating triple punch. First I get chloramines--toxic gas. After they are inhaled I can dismiss the bleach. That leaves my opponent's lungs full of amino radicals, which explode. Then I dismiss the amino radicals (through the ammonia), and all the explosion products explode again.

Any can of spray cleaner becomes a weak grenade. I'll dismiss the can that contains the cleaner, and the contents are splashed everywhere. Conjuring other materials within a can could also make it explode. For example, I could carry a canister of propane and conjure lye in it to make it go boom.

There is another way I can dismiss things to great effect: vinegar and baking soda in a trash bag. It will inflate to some volume. Then I dismiss the contents and the implosion will be a deadly thunderclap.

How about this: I use hollow mop handles as gun barrels. Ideally, I conjure one made of steel or aluminum with a plastic cap at one end. I use baking soda and vinegar to fill it with gas, then conjure a lye pellet embedded in abrasive glass polish at the open end. I dismiss the gas, the blob and pellet shoot out through the plastic cap like a bullet. Hopefully my opponents misjudge the deadliness of the mops I send swiffering across the battlefield.

Other than that...

I could set things on fire. Smoke is a contaminant; it will hinder my strong but otherwise mostly human opponents but leave me alone. In a pinch I could set dumpsters on fire and let the toxic gas diffuse. If my own summoned chlorine gas (bleach+acid) counts as a contaminant, even better. It's critical I keep opponents from getting too close--so I should walk in a cloud of chlorine gas.

Elephant's toothpaste is a mixture of soap, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium iodide. The last is a catalyst, so although it isn't a cleaning agent I can carry it around. I add additional cleaning agents for different foams; in particular, a large quantity of isopropyl alcohol or nail polish remover could make it a good way to cover the battlefield in fire. Maybe I get my mops to help spread it, if direct telekinesis isn't enough. I try to summon the peroxide in the gas tanks of parked cars, which will rupture and allow the foam to escape for 'free' fuel.

Speaking of free things in the city, why not rip open fire hydrants to get water for soap. Sudsing up the battlefield not only makes the terrain amenable to my powers, but it gives me a cover for more deadly substances. If the foam matches my outfit's suds, all the better: I can hide in it.

I coat windows in cleaner and break them, to try and move the glass with telekinesis.

Anyone who tries to physically attack me will find a metal broom handle or trash can lid in the way. Projectiles are a bigger problem--but I'm a magical girl, so a few punctures might be bearable. I summon paper towels to stuff in wounds, and plastic bags to tie things shut. Clouds of (light) sponges give me a second to dodge; plumes of heated air make aiming a challenge. A smokescreen of floating sponges might be worth it.

I hold most of these tricks in reserve. Hunting monsters for power is (probably) easier, and certainly more moral. Surfactants spread to cover still water. If I can lure the monster into a lake, I can coat them in soapy poison and keep track of them through a cloud of toxic smoke, while I implode lawn bags to disorient them and shoot them from every direction with my mop guns.

For a day job, I work at a drive-through car wash. That is a place where everyone is too impatient to notice my powers, and where many cleaning agents are on hand should I need them in a hurry. Foaming engine degreaser is a nice mix of flammable, toxic, corrosive, explosive, and inconspicuous at a car wash.
