The powers care about whether whether the product was in any way created for the sake of gaming the powers. In ambiguous situations they err on the side of stinginess. They have some abstract sense of "legitness;" they would be unlikely to accept a singleton firearm broom created even without your influence if for example that broom's purpose was primarily as a concealed firearm and it wasn't used much for cleaning. They are fickle and don't follow any simple algorithm. You can think of them as a low superintelligence with an alien passion for cleaning supplies.
