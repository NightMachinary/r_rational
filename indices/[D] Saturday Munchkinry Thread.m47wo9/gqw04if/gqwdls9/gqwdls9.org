I'm not sure how scary the scary monsters are, but my first thought is that while on a surface level you may appear to be Magical Girl Cleaning Supplies, in reality you could be considered as Magical Girl Chemical Weaponry. To give an example, think of how many human-hostile chemicals are used in laboratories to clean equipment. Even with more mundane supplies (though take this with a grain of salt, given my lack of explicit knowledge) you could cause some pretty nasty chemical reactions to occur. Especially given one notable hole in the limits on conjuration - what stops me summoning something really quite dangerous /juuuuust/ above someone's skin? Or, alternatively, once the rival magical girl begins their monologue, from summoning just a little bit of something poisonous inside their open mouth?

There's also something to consider regarding what counts as 'influence' when it comes to replicas of singleton cleaning items. Could I ask a friend to ask a friend to ask a friend to clean up their house using a broom that also works a firearm? What if the last person in the chain had no idea why the previous friend wanted it? Would that still be influence? Because if you game the system to summon almost anything, that could be big.

I don't know how I would research this, but I would be legitimately surprised if some combination of cleaning equipment couldn't combine explosively.

I'm also thinking of radiation, since that's occasionally used to sterilise medical equipment and such. Perhaps you could conjure the radiation itself? Seems potentially useful for ambush, especially since each individually chunk of radiation conjured wouldn't need to be maintained for very long.

You could conjure 'ropes' of steel wool, perhaps, to tangle and restrain foes. Even if someone could have the strength to break through, they might get bogged down by it. Similar to dangerous chemicals, you could also just conjure it very close to sensitive areas like the eyes and face. Enhance the scrubbing ability of the wool and oof, ouch, owie.

Speaking of enhancement, a great deal of cleaning equipment works by killing unwanted organisms. Bug spray or rat poison might be considered an aspect of this, if your power is feeling generous. What if you were to enhance the toxicity of these substances? That could be very effective at causing... accidents.

Oh, and clothes perfectly clean at all times? Sounds like they'd make decent bandages. If not for you, then for other people. Cleaning wounds is a form of cleaning, so that's also enhanced.

Alcohol is a pretty common cleaning supply. It's also present in a lot of drinks. Would be a shame if an enemy magical girl didn't know their limits when you 'enhance' the cleaning powers of the alcohol in their drink.

Last thing I can think of that might be useful for combat at the moment (and this is a stretch) is that some cleaning supplies might have been... made out of humans. Or monsters, if a company gets on that! So while I understand that there's probably a hidden limit here, is there anything stopping you from manipulating the relevant human parts?

Hope this helped!
