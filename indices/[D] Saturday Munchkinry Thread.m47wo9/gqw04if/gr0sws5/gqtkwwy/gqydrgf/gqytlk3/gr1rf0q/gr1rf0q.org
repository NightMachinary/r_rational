The economy very much has a physical material existence: I just need to look at a good and cash at the moment they are being exchanged and they are very much a part of the economy. It's ever shifting and non-continuous, and I cant look at every part of it at the same time, but that is true for most object. Your example objects are just subsets of atoms where I can see some and not others, and mine are also subset of atoms where you can see some and not others.
