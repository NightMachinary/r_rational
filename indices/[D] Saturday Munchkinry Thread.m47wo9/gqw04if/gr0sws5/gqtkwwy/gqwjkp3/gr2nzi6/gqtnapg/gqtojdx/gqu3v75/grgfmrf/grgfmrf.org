One option (to gain wealth) is to purchase something that is freely available at one point in history, but then later becomes a rare collector's item. Like a copy of the first /Superman/ comic ever printed. (Of course, /not/ a copy known to survive until the present).

Or pick up samples of now-extinct animals. If you can go back far enough, a couple of dodo or passenger pigeon eggs might be easy enough to take out of the past... the lack of those specific eggs won't make it any /more/ extinct in the past.
