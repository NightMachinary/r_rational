If you could train your strength indefinitely at what point would modern training equipment not be sufficient to train your strength?.

Further than that, what point would even custom-built equipment start hitting material limits and thus cap out the training.

Could unconventional equipment be made to circumvent some of the material limits, for example using pulleys, pneumatics, etc to make equipment to train? If so what sort of limits would those have at the very high end?

Keep in mind this super-strength provides no special telekinetic field so any training equipment needs to bear the forces upon it as is.
