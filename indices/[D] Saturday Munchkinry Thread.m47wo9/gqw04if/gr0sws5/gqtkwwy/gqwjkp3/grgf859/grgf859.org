Hmmm. Talking about winning the lottery... let's say I go to buy a ticket. I ask the ticket seller to select the numbers on my piece of paper. Then, after the draw, I send a piece of paper to the past with the winning numbers on it. /My/ actions do not change as a result of information sent from Future Me... I presume that doesn't work?

Hmmmmm.

If I'm on a moving train, and I send an object - say, a mirror - back in time ten minutes, does it end up on the train or does it fall to the train tracks where the train is now (but wasn't ten minutes ago)?

Let's say I am running a computer program that calculates X, unless I hit the Enter key, in which case it instead calculates Y. Both calculations are extremely intensive, taking half an hour each. If I see the result of X, write it down, then send a small weight to fall on the Enter key half an hour ago, will I see the result of calculation Y on the screen instantly?
