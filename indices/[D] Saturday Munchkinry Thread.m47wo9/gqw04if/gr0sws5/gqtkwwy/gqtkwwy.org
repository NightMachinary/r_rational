A SCP inspired munchkinry... (inspired by [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo][TABOO]]).

You can swap the names of “things” (people, places, and things) in your line of sight. Once the name is swapped, then for information processing purposes, the conceptual identifiers of those things are swapped. Identifying sub-portions of the swapped things still work, but looking at the the things as a whole results in the swapped identification.

- For a simple example I name a Red Delicious Apple “Apple_1” and the soft blue pillow I use in my bed as “scruiser's pillow”. I then swap their names. People would now see the pillow as Red Delicious Apple and the apple as a soft blue pillow. Breaking things down or looking at sub parts can penetrate the swapping effect, for instance looking at a tiny portion of the apple people could correctly identify it as red or feeling they shape of the apple in the dark they could identify it as apple shaped, but seeing too much information and they will go back to seeing the apple as a pillow.

Other quirks:

- Users of this power can overcome the effect with enough analysis, introspective thought, experimentation, or by seeing the process as it happens.

- Users of this power can quickly name things that lack Proper noun names with a few minutes concentration (for instance naming a pillow or an apple). Non-users need to regularly use that name both in their head and out loud for a few hours to a few days to make it count as a name.

- Renaming things can partially or completely undo this power's effects. A non-user of this power could repeatedly refer to the blue pillow as the inedible-apple until that sticks as a name, and this name would have more correct conceptual identifiers (soft, blue, non-edible) with maybe one or two incorrect ones stuck on it (thinking of the pillow as apple-shaped even when it isn't).

- people tend to rationalize the inconsistencies... if you swapped a person's name with a tree's name other people might reason that the tree is a person standing very still and that the person is mobile and sapient tree while the person with a tree name might rationalize that they are a tree that recently gained sentience and human motor skills, and with repeated renamings might eventually recognize that they are actually person shaped and sized.

- You can spread this power to other people by swapping their names and letting them struggle with an epistemic breakdown. If the manage not to go completely insane or accidentally kill themselves or get killed they develop the name swapping power after a few weeks (typically renaming themselves in the process).

Munchkin Challenges:

A Fey Creature operating under the names of “a clever scholar” and Dr. Japers is loose in the world.

- What things can this Being of Faerie do to maximize harm and/or maximize the chance of breaking the secrecy of magic? What things might this Fey Being do to make money and keep a low profile?

- Conversely how might you catch the Clever Fey Scholar as member of a magic secrecy preserving organization with the full might of the US government behind you (but little magic yourself).

- how might you use this power as a person who has just gained it and become aware of said Fey Entity and a sketchy secret organization?
