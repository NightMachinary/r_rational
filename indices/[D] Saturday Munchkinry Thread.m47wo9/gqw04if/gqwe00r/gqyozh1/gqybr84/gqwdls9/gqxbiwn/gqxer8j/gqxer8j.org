  I think you missed this: "Cost also grows exponentially with a new conjuration's proximity to another magical girl relative to its proximity to yourself."

Ah. I feel a little dumb now :D. Scratch any tactics that rely explicitly on that, then.

  No, this is exactly what I was saying is not possible. In what world is getting someone to do something not influence just because they don't know the reason why? The powers are very intelligent.

I probably should have gone into greater detail on this one, but the argument to make here is that it's very difficult to not have an influence on the world, butterfly effect style. The example I gave was bad for showcasing this since it was deliberate action, but there's a bunch of edge cases here. What if the magical girl accidentally and unknowingly inspired some onlooker to create a new cleaning product? What if someone was inspired by the aftereffects of a combat she was involved in without even realising it was the cause of a magical girl? What if she had an interaction with someone that resulted in them creating a cleaning product they wouldn't have made, even if that interaction had nothing to do with it, and simply influenced the events by random chance?

To take this and condense it a little, does this aspect of the powers care about the intent of the magical girl, the intent of the person creating the product, how a layperson would look at the situation, or something else entirely?
