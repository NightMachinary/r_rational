  Especially given one notable hole in the limits on conjuration - what stops me summoning something really quite dangerous juuuuust above someone's skin? Or, alternatively, once the rival magical girl begins their monologue, from summoning just a little bit of something poisonous inside their open mouth?

I think you missed this: "Cost also grows exponentially with a new conjuration's proximity to another magical girl relative to its proximity to yourself."

  There's also something to consider regarding what counts as 'influence' when it comes to replicas of singleton cleaning items. Could I ask a friend to ask a friend to ask a friend to clean up their house using a broom that also works a firearm? What if the last person in the chain had no idea why the previous friend wanted it? Would that still be influence? Because if you game the system to summon almost anything, that could be big.

No, this is exactly what I was saying is not possible. In what world is getting someone to do something not influence just because they don't know the reason why? The powers are very intelligent.
