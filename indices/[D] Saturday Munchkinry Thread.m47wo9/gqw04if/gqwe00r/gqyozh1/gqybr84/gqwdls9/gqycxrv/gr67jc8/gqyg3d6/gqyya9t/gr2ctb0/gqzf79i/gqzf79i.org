Does ordinary water count as cleaning supplies? Someone already mentioned pressure cleaners. I would like to further add that the ability to manipulate existing water is quite versatile - depending on how far you can stretch the definition of "cleaning supplies", you might be able to get the entire powerset of a waterbender. The clean water that comes out of a tap should definitely count as cleaning supplies, because that is its primary purpose. Historically, people bathed and washed their clothes in rivers and lakes, so bodies of freshwater might count too. Also, wet ice blasting and steam cleaning exist, meaning that you can manipulate water in different states of matter.

And why stop at *water*? Self-cleaning ovens use heat, or *fire*, to clean things. Compressed air cans clean away dust with *air*. Sandblasting uses sand, glass beads, and other forms of *earth* to clean surfaces. +Be the Avatar, master of all four elements.+
