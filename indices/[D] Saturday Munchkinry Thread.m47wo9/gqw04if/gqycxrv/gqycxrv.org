If you had the completely unrestricted ability to create /any/ substance that has ever been made, from carbon nanotubes to iridium alloys to white phosphorus to botulinum toxin, probably the most reliable go-to for general purpose ludicrous overkill in direct combat would probably be Chlorine trifluoride. It's already been used in several ratfics, my favorite appearance being Dungeon Keeper Ami, where it taught gods what it's like to feel very small and very terrified.

This chemical is actually produced and used regularly IRL, for one single application: to /clean/ chemical vapour deposition chambers.
