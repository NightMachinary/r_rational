For point 2, its arguably small potatoes, but setting up some sort of contest using your clout as an R&D corporation for "give us ideas for how to crack the dome and win $X money if it works" (circulated among media streams low in general dumbassery), or a more professionally-orientated version of "present us a reasonably planned but only theoretical way to crack the dome and win $X money if it works," or the corporate "show us a functional version of whatever destructive tool your organisation has come up with an we'll help with transport/organisation/personnel costs and win $X money/funding/contract if you succeed" (while gathering as much information as possible even if they take a straight pay out). If you have money available, nothing says you have to be the one to solve the problem yourself. Even if every path fails, its an easy way to get your name out there with good press in coverage surrounding a bizarre occurrence. (Edit: Oh, you said best scientists/engineers available. Regardless, the best by the standards of the current world of possibilities that you have on payroll at the start, and the best at dealing with something completely new and novel are likely two different groups, so the more minds you can get on board the merrier).

For point 2, you might want to clarify the nature of the calculations. Like if the 6 months has to be constant and the result used immediately (otherwise you just stack up calculations to drop a bunch of spheres at once). Regardless, world domination seems like you take action on days with religious significance, so as soon as anyone gets an idea who you are, all you have to do is scream there's some sort of deity on your side and you've at least got some level of a base of diehard supporters backing you up. Or if you think you can get a few off before getting caught, crippling a bunch of powerhouse countries/organisations and declaring allegiance to whatever is left keeps you hopefully useful and alive, much more easily if you can stick a door into a sphere and suddenly you have a nuke-proof city. I don't know if these calculations or skills are transferable though, which would dramatically lower your value, unless you can convince people you could also discover other tools too (in which case its a matter of using the spheres to get funding to research tools better suited to world domination instead).
