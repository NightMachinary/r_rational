  Now personally, I don't think there really needs to be a standard, because we're just not that large of a subreddit. ... Instituting rules increases overheads and reduces participation rates.

We have rules in order to (a) keep on topic, that being rational fiction, and (b) keep the quality of the sub up to ensure it's fun. We're small enough that (b) is basically not a problem yet; staying on-topic is enough - so we have characteristics of rational fiction in the sidebar, but no concrete rules. If soft power isn't enough we might think about more rule, but we just don't need them at the moment.

So post links about rational fiction wherever, and we'll deal with problems as they appear. But if anyone's unsure about the link - you can make it a self post!
