That post is perfect in my opinion. It really is amazing when you look up the chain and you find almost everything is owned by just a handfull of companies at the top. A(lmost a)ll TV and Music industries at the top are owned by a dozen companies, which are represented by just 2 lobbies (MPAA, RIAA). Similar things exist with food companies too.
