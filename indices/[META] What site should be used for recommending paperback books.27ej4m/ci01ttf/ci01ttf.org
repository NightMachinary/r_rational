I'm only really familiar with Amazon, so:

*Pros*

- You can buy the book right away
- Verified reviews so that you can ensure the person making the review actually at least owns the book (see the rather famous case of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10394348-doors-of-stone][Doors of Stone]] on Goodreads having 800 ratings and 150 reviews despite not even having a release date yet)
- Usually has a preview of the first couple of pages so that you can see whether the writing style or content interests you (above and beyond the recommendation you get here).

*Cons*

- Region specific issues
- May not have the best price
- Amazon has an incentive to try to get you buying bad books
- Shill reviews (but you get those everywhere online that has reviews, and at least Amazon has some economic muscle to use as threat in particularly egregious or widespread cases)
- Amazon has a referral program that I don't know too much about that gives an incentive to excessive posting (probably not a problem with our size given how low the rewards would be though)

Now personally, I don't think there really needs to be a standard, because we're just not that large of a subreddit. By the general theory of online participation rates, a thousand subscribers means we have maybe in the dozens of people who will ever submit anything to this subreddit. Instituting rules increases overheads and reduces participation rates.

As a mutually agreed upon (as opposed to strict policy) standard, I would choose Amazon, since that's where I always go to see whether a book is really worth buying.
