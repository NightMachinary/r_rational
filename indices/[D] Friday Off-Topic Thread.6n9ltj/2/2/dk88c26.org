I think it's a pretty good idea to have some judicial body like this. The question is how to define their powers, and how to choose the people.

I think the U.S. Supreme court has a fairly narrow mandate in terms of what people have to pretend its powers are, but our government interprets that mandate about as broadly as possible. I'd rather the mandate were broader and the interpretation narrower, because I think the current game of finding consitutional justification for things you already wanted produces some unsatisfactory edge cases. But I don't think we can get from here to there.

Currently our method of choosing the people is more a mess than usual, because of reasons you can kiiind of round off to "republicans being willing to sacrifice principles for short-term gain." But I think that overall it's actually an okay method.
