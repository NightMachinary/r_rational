Making the judiciary more susceptible to democratic influence isn't necessarily the solution. John Oliver did a piece on elected judges where he revealed that they will pander to voting blocs by promising to rule the way they want to rather than according to the law, which usually results in tougher sentencing. Holding judges more accountable to voters means making them more vulnerable to populism.

Additionally, the majority of judges on the Supreme Court nearly always vote in line with the party that appointed them and that's how we got into the predicament we're in today. Nearly every ruling on civil rights is 5-4 with either all the Republicans together or one siding with the Democrats. That's not how the interpretation of the laws and ideals of our county is supposed to work.
