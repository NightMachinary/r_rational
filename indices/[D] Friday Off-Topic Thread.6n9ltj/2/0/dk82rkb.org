I kind of hate it.

D&D equivalent, it's a bunch of rules lawyers arguing RAI vs. RAW, except they're perfectly willing to switch sides if it gets them what they want, the game designers have been dead for hundreds of years, and half of what they argue hinges on either extremely esoteric past arguments or what are effectively house rules that grew out of a single errant clause.

That's without getting into anything too political.
