I would love to replace the Constitution too, but there is one huge reason I don't think we should. It isn't that so many people who hold religious reverence for the document will be upset or that the system the Constitution established will work to preserve its continued operation, but that it's currently the one thing all Americans can at least pretend to agree on. I'm terrified that we may already be on the path towards civil war and to challenge the one point of consensus that is the Constitution must be upheld in some form would push us even further down that road.
