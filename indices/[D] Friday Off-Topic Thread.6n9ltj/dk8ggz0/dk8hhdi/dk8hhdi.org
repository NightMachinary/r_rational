I'm fine with authors writing about the things that most appeal to them, even if that results in them continuing to write about the same or similar things, so long as execution is on point and there are enough variants to keep me interested and there's still some depth to the collection of works as a whole.

Direct author tracts or moral messages I'm less fine with; my preference is for the author to present a complex picture that I can make my own mind up about. Now, that complex and nuanced picture can be colored and shaded by the author's own worldview, and in part I /like/ that, but if the author spends a handful of pages directly explaining /X/, where /X/ is some pet issue for them, my eyes tend to glaze over. This is probably, in part, a case of "show, don't tell", which many author's tracts violate severely.
