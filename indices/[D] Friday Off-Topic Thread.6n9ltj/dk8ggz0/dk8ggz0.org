By looking at old story fragments I've started and abandoned, I've come to the conclusion that basically anything I write will have some level of transhumanism due to its [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal][Author Appeal]]. My first impulse is to shrug and say "oh well", but on second thought that might not be productive due to the low general appeal of transhumanism, even if it has niche appeal. Speaking from your own personal experiences, is it more offputting when an author makes it blatantly clear why exactly they're writing their fic early, or where the author tries to sneak it in, but you still realize it halfway through the work because the author just can't resist going on author tracts about whatever?
