Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

--------------

Work continues onward.  I've made fairly substantial progress with the organization of the XGEF framework, and I'm on the cusp of getting modded modules loaded and associated with their respective systems.  Exciting times.

I don't have any game mechanic discussions ready for today (but I'd be happy to answer questions if anyone has any), and I'm unlikely to get much work done on it this weekend, as today (or technically last night) marks the beginning of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbDSEpIZat8][GMTK Game Jam]] which I and a few of us from this subreddit are entering.  It begins Friday at 6PM local time (in my case central) and will run until 6PM local time on Sunday.  I don't know what the theme is yet (although by now it's been announced for those who are starting in earlier time zones), but we've got our setup primed and ready.  

If at all possible, I'm going to be steering the design of the game we make into a concept that makes sense to explore for Renegade, but it's quite possible that this won't be doable.  In that case this will simply be a fun diversion--but if it's not, it'll be a nice chance to try and flesh out some of the ideas that we've been arguing about for months now.

If you'd like to be part of the design discussion or help playtest once we get to that point, [[https://discord.gg/u4KgdE3][feel free to join us in the #gmtk-jam channel]] on the subreddit Discord server.  In particular if you're an artist looking to sacrifice your weekend to help make a 48-hour game look a little less pathetic, please let me know--we've got several programmers but no one to make pretty pictures. It won't be the end of the world if we don't have any dedicated artists, but it would be nice to have a game that isn't a /complete/ offense to everyone with eyes.

I'll be sure to post our result next week so you can all point and laugh, so be sure to work on some nice, derisive guffaws in the meantime.  I only accept the best of ridicule.
