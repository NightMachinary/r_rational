My cool-idea fave is "HPMOR but with no villain, and more grad students."

Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is frustrated at a lack of progress towards fundamental laws of magic. After some plotting, he manages to break the statute of secrecy, inform several muggle scientists of the existence of magic, and smuggle three or four (seems a good number for character interaction) physicists into Hogsmeade. Then, Arthur Weasley finds out. He thinks this is terrific fun and wants to help.
