I had a fun mental image of a city-scale Orion drive ship being found decelerating into a straight up Star Empire.

So, I'm trying to come up with a fictional tech base which has several coinciding qualities:

1: Resemble in aesthetic and capability pulp/golden-age sf (gleaming rocketships taking off from spaceports full of steely-eyed men with rayguns on their hips.)

2: No active circuits, therefore no radio transmitters or electronic computers.

3: Low enough emissions in general that they can have an interstellar civilization without the flashy megastructures that would imply with known technology.

4: FTL travel, not signalling, to reduce the travel time within said interstellar civilization sufficiently to allow feudalism to have persisted, while not being able to reach our sun.

For parsimony's sake, I'd like this all to rely on the smallest possible amount of nonsense. This is where I need input. They need a few capabilities, I think:

1: extremely dense power storage

2: energy weapons

3: reactionless drives

4: artificial gravity/inertial dampeners

5: interstellar drive

3 and 4 can easily be the same device, an acceleration-vector-applier. Perhaps 2 is just a messy applier, and 1 is a stored force? My plan for 5 is that it only works to jump between the barycenters of binary star systems.

It would also be nice if the FTL doesn't destroy causality too much.
