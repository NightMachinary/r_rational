There's a lot of room between "lifetime appointment by the President" and "locally elected judges do terrible things" to move around in here. I believe that democratically selected officials is a good thing, and this kind of argument that democracy leads to populism and bad outcomes might sound intuitive but is basically wrong empirically. Down with George III, imo!

One way we might democratize the Supreme Court would be for Justices to have 18-year terms, and every 2 years one of them terms out and must be replaced. A Supreme Court Justice who terms out can never again serve on the Supreme Court. This means that each President picks 2 Justices per term. Think about what happened with Garland and the trickery the Senate pulled because we have such long undemocratic processes for selecting Justices. Think about how much better a more Democratic system that I just thought up off the top of my head would be. Easy.
