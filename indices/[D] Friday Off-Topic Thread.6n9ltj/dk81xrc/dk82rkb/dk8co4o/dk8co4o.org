I would agree, except the only reason I have for disliking the court is that it doesn't rule the way I want it to. I don't care what the constitution says anymore, I just believe that decisions of this kind should made based on utilitarian humanist consequentialism. I /hate/ that nearly all the judges vote in accordance with the political party that appointed them, but I wouldn't stop being mad at them for believing the law should permit behavior that I consider immoral. I know I can't be objective, so I don't know what changes to suggest.
