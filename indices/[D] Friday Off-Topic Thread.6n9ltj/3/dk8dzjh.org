Do you have any ideas for stories you'd like to pitch here, or just think is cool? Here's one of mine:

- It was not so long between the time that artificial chakra generation was developed and the entire political landscape of the elemental nations was overthrown. The zaibatsus (mega corporations) quickly surpassed the elemental nations in power, and subsumed them so completely as to take over their names.

  In the post-nation-state megacities of the future, amidst the towering skyscrapers and away from the neon blue glow of chakra streetlights, tight-nit clans of spies and saboteurs known as ninja fight each other at the behest of the elemental zaibatsus to whom they owe grudging allegiance. However, the status quo might soon be changing once again, as ninja puppets indistinguishable from humans have started to be sold by the upstart Rain Corporation.\\

It's not something I'm working on, but it's taking up some head real-estate.
