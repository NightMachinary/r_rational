  Chaos Gods -- formed from agglomerated emotion or belief that wasn't going anywhere else, and agreed with itself (so to speak) coherently enough to form a "great choir" (as a daemon once called the Chaos Gods from its own point of view). Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh all make sense as their own archetypes, but with the slight problem that they're too narrow to encompass all major emotions.

I think they are all encompassing but they are not meant to be pure representations of human emotions. They are meant to encompass the primary motivations for human activity based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types][Bartle's 4 types of players]].

Slaanesh - Achiever, always seeker greater pleasure

Tzeentch - Explorer, always seeking something new

Nurgle - Socializer, always wanting new friends

Khorne - Killer, always wanting enemies to fight
