Non-vague non-insanity that's still more-or-less themselves, though I would like to see them as part of a wider pantheon. Sorta the way I'm thinking of it is:

- Chaos Gods -- formed from agglomerated emotion or belief that wasn't going anywhere else, and agreed with itself (so to speak) coherently enough to form a "great choir" (as a daemon once called the Chaos Gods from its own point of view). Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh all make sense /as their own archetypes/, but with the slight problem that they're too narrow to encompass all major emotions.

- Ordered Gods/Pantheon Gods -- the Warp entities corresponding to actual religious deities with defined personalities and roles, such as the Eldar pantheon, the God-Emperor (possibly separate from the real Emperor), the Abrahamic God, the Greek gods, etc.

- Daemons/Angyls -- Warp entities with a defining core emotion or experience, but without enough mass or power accumulated to qualify as a god.

- Small Daemons/Angyls -- /exactly/ what Pratchett described in /Small Gods/. Tiny little single-celled voices on the tides of the Warp, trying desperately to become anything at all with a real self or form.

The line between daemonhood and godhood would work roughly as it does in 40K. Daemons can be summoned into the Materium through a relatively small breach, but behave more like animals or persons when you summon them. Gods require a galaxy-sized breach in the fabric of reality to fully come through, but have enough power to mass-cast spells/miracles whenever they fix their attention on one point in realspace.

The difference between daemon and angyl is the same between Chaos Gods and Order Gods: daemons just sort of /happened/, while angyls fit themselves to a specific stream of emotion and belief coming from specific mortals. Neither one is /necessarily/ good or evil in alignment: you could make the God-Emperor Lawful evil, but exchange it for Tzeentch being Chaotic Good.

The major upshot of this for the setting and for main characters is: sorcery works by drawing power from the Warp. This requires careful control and stoking of the sorcerer's emotions, but also bothering to learn about what kinds of Warp entities you can channel power /from/. You, the sorcerer, might try to /choose/ a "good" source to channel from, but when you cast spells, you're still going to get /all/ the aspects of the being you're drawing on. Every love spell will come with a slight risk of Aphrodite driving the subjects into wild orgies; every spell for rot and disease will come with a chance that Nurgle's compassion grants the victims immortality.some of Nurgle's compassion.

The idea is to have a magic system in which everything carries personal and situational import, the potential for awesome power, /and/ the potential for serious danger all wrapped up together. No white or black magicks with morally reliable effects, just the wild magic of raw nature and emotion.
