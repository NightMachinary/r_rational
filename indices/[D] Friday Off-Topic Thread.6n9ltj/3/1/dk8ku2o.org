I have quite a few on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4098737][my FanFiction.net profile]]. Some are more fleshed-out than others, but all are free for anyone's use.

  Avatar: Murder the Hypotenuse

  #+begin_quote
    At the Crossroads of Destiny, Katara sees Azula preparing to zap Aang. Desperate, she flings a shield of water across the room--but this only results in a transference of the electrocution from Aang to Katara. (Mineral-rich cave water? Spiritual interference? Handwave it however you wish.) Aang, still in the detached Avatar State, kills nearly all the Dai Li agents and deals severe injuries to Azula and to Zuko. As the Avatar State fades, Aang is overcome with horror at the destruction he's wrought, and (since he lacks memory of his Avatar-State actions) assumes that he's the one who killed Katara; however, Iroh arrives on the scene and says that it was Azula who did it. Aang is caught in a dilemma--kill the incapacitated Azula in a sorrowful rage, or maintain his principles?--but dozens more Dai Li agents are arriving, and Iroh exhorts Aang to escape up the waterfall, since Aang can't get back into the Avatar State and defend himself with his current feelings. Aang escapes, carrying Katara's corpse, and the Gaang leaves on Appa's back. The Dai Li take Iroh and Zuko back into custody, and send Azula to the royal physician's offices.

    Sokka's feelings are split between "furious" and "numbed". He presses Aang desperately for the details of Katara's death, but all Aang can say was that she was killed by lightning--and, though he relays Iroh's assertion that Azula's the one who killed Katara, he can't deny that, after he left the Avatar State, he saw lightning scars all over the cavern, and some of them must have been made by him while he was in the Avatar State, and one of them may have hit Katara. Sokka can't bear to remain in the same party with a person who might be his sister's killer, and is dropped off with Hakoda's guerillas at the first opportunity; Aang doesn't stick around to give Hakoda the bad news. The Gaang now consists only of Aang, Toph, Appa, and Momo.

  Naruto: A Ninja's Mind Is Her Castle

  #+begin_quote
    Kurenai stumbles across an obscure meditation technique--the old rhetorical trick of using a "memory palace" to improve your memory, enhanced with chakra to become a full-fledged genjutsu cast on the self. It used to be used by infiltrators who couldn't risk committing their findings to writing, but gradually fell out of favor with the rise of sealing-scrolls' popularity. She thinks it might help her students in developing a rudimentary defense against genjutsu and in organizing their thoughts in general. Kiba doesn't like the idea too much, but Shino finds the compartmentalization interesting and useful.

    Hinata, however, takes to it like a fish to water--indeed, she's too good at it. It doesn't take her long to realize that, whenever she's out of the Hyuuga compound, she can temporarily lock away her memories of her father's brutal training and scornful disdain, and feel like a free person for once in her life. The rest of her team is quick to note the meteoric rise in her confidence.

  Naruto: Balloonacy (placeholder title)

  #+begin_quote
    One day in Academy (two years before graduation?), Sasuke is feeling particularly angry. When Sakura asks him for a date, he snaps: "Do you know what I hate? I hate weak ninja--and you are a weak ninja. I've seen you, flailing worthlessly in sparring--panting with exhaustion after making three simple Clones--whispering with the others about hair and diets instead of practicing shurikenjutsu. Don't even talk to me until you can see my level from the bottom of the ravine that you're stuck in... weakling."

    Sakura is the only person who hears this one-in-a-million outburst. She resolves to train up her taijutsu and shurikenjutsu, as instructed--but she's at a loss in the area of chakra. Research at the library turns up a yellowed scroll containing the Harmonious Flow Technique--a simple precursor of the Mystical Palm, meant only to transfer chakra from the medical ninja to the patient (e.g., to remedy a case of chakra exhaustion). Sakura hypothesizes that forcing extra chakra into a person with a full reserve will stretch the maximum capacity of that reserve over time. To that end, she promises to go on some dates with Naruto after he learns Harmonious Flow (and the average-level chakra control necessary to use it) and helps her to train in taijutsu and shurikenjutsu.
