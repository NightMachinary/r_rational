I was holding ISIS as an example of a group that /isn't/ nihilistic or relativist. That was my point; even in developing countries or horrible parts of the world a lot of the extremists are selling a positive vision, they want to /create/ something, whether it was the triumph of the proletariat in the past or the rise of a Caliphate/whatever today, even if that vision is horrible.

If ISIS has had any success in motivating the sorts of people who agree with them it's precisely because they're putting forward an objective, positive (as opposed to just knowing what you /don't/ like) project.

Meanwhile a lot of what we're seeing in the political sparring today is the negative vision (everything sucks)or, at least, a positive vision marked with attacks on any pillar or institution that can challenge what's being sold.
