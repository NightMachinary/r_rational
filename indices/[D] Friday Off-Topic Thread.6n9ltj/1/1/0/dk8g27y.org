I should probably read some more Young Wizards, but after being hugely disappointed in /Wizards at War/ I'm worried I won't like /A Wizard of Mars/. I found a lot of the books to be just okay even when they did fuel my hopeful outlook on life, but /A Wizard Alone/ may be one of my favorite books ever. Nita's struggle against depression resonated with me as an adult and that autistic kid (in the updated New Millenium edition) was exactly who I was when I was a child.

The only other story that's left me feeling that much raw hope for my life and the world in general is /Madoka Magika/. I'm definitely in the mental state where I could use another story like that, but its appeal was so subjective to my spiritual beliefs that I don't know where to look for something that would also give me that. I'm definitely rambling by this point about how I wish I just knew whether I would enjoy something before starting it.
