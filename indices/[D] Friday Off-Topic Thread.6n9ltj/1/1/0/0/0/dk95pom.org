Nope. It's on my list but I'm still new to the mecha genre so I'm worried I won't /get/ it. I watched Madoka without any prior experience with the magical girl genre so I spent the whole series confused about how to react to genre conventions I didn't recognize being upended, but adored the ending so much it made me retroactively understand and love the rest of the show.
