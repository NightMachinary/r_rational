For about 5 years now, I've been getting the majority of my news from daily email newsletters like [[https://www.dailychatter.com/][Daily Chatter]]. They've been great at helping me keep up with what's going on in the world, including events that aren't getting as much attention as they should. For the past couple weeks though, I haven't been reading them. They just didn't seem to be worth the few minutes they took to read anymore compared to everything else I could do.

I've been relying more on weekly podcasts to keep up with the news, but even then I put off listening to them because I don't feel like it was time well spent. I know more about what's going on in the world, but I don't gain any advantage from that and frequently feel more depressed as a result. My goals and the methods I'm using to achieve them remain the same, I just keep getting reminded of how little progress on them is being made.

However, I still think politics is something I should pay attention and attempt to apply rationality to so I don't actually stop following it even if it might improve my mood. So I force myself to confront the ideologues I oppose in the hope I can do something to help defeat them, only to accomplish nothing because they cannot be dissuaded from their position. Mental gymnastics isn't even the appropriate term anymore.

It's one thing for someone to believe that the end justifies the means since at least it recognizes the existence of a moral high ground and expresses an intention to optimize values. These people don't even believe they're doing that anymore. They actively reject the idea that there is a moral high ground to reach for, everyone is corrupt so there's no reason for /us/ to try and be better than /them/.

They have no vision they're trying to build and no end goal they seek to accomplish, they believe they are fighting for survival against /the other/ and will anything to disadvantage /them/ no matter how petty, arbitrary, hollow, or illusionary that victory may be because admitting defeat is worse. I don't think this is a clash of ideologies or tribes anymore, I'm fighting against a culture of nihilism.

I once thought this culture was only spreading through terrorists and extremists in developing countries, but I was wrong. It's right here in the West among the uneducated, evangelical, casually racist, and impoverished libertarians (can't think of a better way to describe people who see government action as the source of their economic woes and say "the free market will provide" in response to any criticism).
