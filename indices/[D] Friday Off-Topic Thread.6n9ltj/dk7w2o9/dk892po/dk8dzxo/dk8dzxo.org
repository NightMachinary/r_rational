I find it hard to see ISIS as an example of the end justifies the means mentality when they're explicit mission statement is to oppress or kill anyone who isn't a violently oppressive Muslim. In no way do I believe they represent Muslims or Islam in any fashion, nor do I believe they or any other terrorist organization are an existential threat to civilized society, but as far as I'm concerned they might as well be Nazis.

Everything else you said, however, I agree with. The concept of objective truth is breaking down across the developed world and I don't know how to fight that. I draw strength from my hope so they're trying to destroy that so I can't stop them. They have kept going long after abandoning hope, all they have left is their hatred of people and ideals that do not conform to their preconceptions.
