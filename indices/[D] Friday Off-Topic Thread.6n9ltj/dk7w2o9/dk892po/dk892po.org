  They actively reject the idea that there is a moral high ground to reach for, everyone is corrupt so there's no reason for us to try and be better than them...I once thought this culture was only spreading through terrorists and extremists in developing countries, but I was wrong.

A lot of extremists out in the big bad world have a /positive/ project, no matter how horrific it seems (see ISIS).

I've heard it argued that this sort of nihilistic, negative project is one of the selling points of a nation that isn't one of those sort of broken/developing nations: Russia. You cannot really claim to be the shining beacon of the world or be the ascendant power driving the international system and good norms so you instead try to drag down competitors who are actually good at that sort of -if you want to be cynical- propaganda (guess who). So the message just becomes that truth is relative, we may be lying but they're lying too, and they're just as bad as us so who cares about all the things they're trying to sell as important? Truth is inconvenient since you can be on the wrong side of it, so why bother.

This seems to also be spreading in the US and I think part of the point /is/ to tire you out. To throw enough non-sequiturs, tu quoques and just a ton of flak and confusion at you that you throw up your hands and say "Washington sucks, everyone is a liar, blah blah" so you can have an excuse to go with whatever parochial concern suits your immediate impulses more than trying to form a positive vision that's vulnerable to truth.

It's pretty dangerous and with the internet both allowing us to select our own echo chambers while making us no less partisan there's a huge problem.
