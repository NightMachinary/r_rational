I would add that while the rest of those come from privilege, this kind of nihilism that motivates action stems from a perception that they are being denied what they're entitled to. I completely agree that human civilization is doing better than at any point in history, but I think this political movement is an existential threat to civilization. Climate change policy is just one example of how these people are willing to drag the rest of us down with them.

I would have hope for things to get better, but where progressives haven't faced opposition it has failed to demonstrate effectiveness. The world is stubbornly refusing to get better when the majority of people agree on what should change and that is incredibly disheartening. I don't care if that attitude exposes a sense of privilege in myself, the belief that people deserve better than what they have is intrinsic to progressivism.
