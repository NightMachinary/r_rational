Just don't call it transhumanism. Lots of fantasy and scifi works have had characters with superhuman powers or immortality -- let alone mythology. Calling fairly ordinary speculative-fiction tropes "transhumanism" just ties them down to a few cliques of people who thought together from the 1980s-2010s.
