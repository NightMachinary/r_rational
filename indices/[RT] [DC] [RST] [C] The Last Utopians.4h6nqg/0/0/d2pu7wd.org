The story's intended to be a mythologized version of the dawn of the scientific method and a deconstruction of feudalism---conventional fantasy in my view has a tendency to romanticize a period that I don't think deserves to be romanticized. Stories like The Hobbit tend to carry a subtext that industrial civilization ruined some agrarian idyll, and this is essentially a "take that" to that perspective. The characters are deliberately archetypes used for a didactic purpose and the writing is strongly influenced by Ayn Rand with some influence from Eliezer; I can see why that'd be polarizing. "Utopians" is referring to the worldview held by Ada, i.e. that creating a positive society on earth is possible; "last" is being used in the sense of "previous". As a member of a relatively privileged caste, Ada is largely insulated from the full consequences of feudalism---Anak is intended to show the bottom rung of the system.
