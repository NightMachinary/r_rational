Eh. It's less that I disagree with it and more that it is too on the nose and preachy without bringing anything new to the table.

Nonconforming Girl = Smart savior scientist & Priest = Irredeemable Insane Guy. Oh, and there's a random irrelevant slave added to show just how shitty The System is and nothing much else.

Well, at least the writing itself was decent and flowed well, even if I didn't like the plot.
