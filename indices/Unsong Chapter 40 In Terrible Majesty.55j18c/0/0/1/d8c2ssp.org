If it's a heptagram of dragons, it's a herptagram. But even so, it's a heptagon/herptagon because you get -gons when you've got only points, and -grams when you get to add all your fancy lines.

Also: I assumed that stuff like making something so odd that it couldn't be in more than two places and then using the Vanishing Name wouldn't work because it's so obvious /everyone/ (with the Name) would have immediately tried it, and then Unsong would have sold Vanishing tickets, which would definitely help out with the whole "yeah, tech like airplanes sometimes doesn't work because Uriel can only fix things at a god-/like/ rate" thing. Plus, we haven't seen Singers with a massive escape system with nodes all over the place in safehouses.
