As other commenters have pointed out, there may be some placebomantic components, i.e. "Universe, it'd be pretty lame if our emergency escape method we spent time setting up sent us into danger instead" though of course backfiring escape methods is a fairly common story concept, so it could still backfire.

At the time of my first post, I had imagined some sort of function that weighted proximity and similarity, do the closest similar thing would get the teleport, but I admit I had no evidence, and the Jane and Angel teleport is pretty strong evidence against.

In conclusion, more information needed!
