Let's say you encode two different Names into a Klipotified sentence, e.g. the first letter of each word is one Name, and the last letter of every third word is another Name. Which Name takes effect? Do both? Does it depend on which name you are thinking of at the time? If it does, which feels natural, maybe you could use it to turn a klipah into a killpah, where the more obvious Name is dangerous to the utterer, to prevent a bad guy from figuring out what you're saying. If more than one can be used at a time, I wonder if they could be combined to form complex spells. You'd work out interactions and interleave the names.
