Hmmm, how can you enforce similarity through scry scanning? Would a reconstruction of Thaumiel teleport you to some other Thaumiel? That is a real thing we must consider. Is there something we know about Thaumiel that is unique to Thaumiel, and has nothing similar to be reconstructed?

Nothing comes to mind.
