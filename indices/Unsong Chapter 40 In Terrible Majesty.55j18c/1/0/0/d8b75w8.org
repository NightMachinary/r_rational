1. Stuff happens and the plot progresses, with like actual plot revelations and plot points happening and so forth. The status quo is changed as Aaron and Jane both find out new things and change their present circumstances, and a new character is introduced who may be a crucial part of the story (depending if she really is his computer as claimed). A lot of Unsong chapters have nothing happen to progress the overall plot, and while they can be interesting digressions I really like it when things actually happen.

2. I really like the plot structure of a lead-in with random talmudic musings about vampires, leading the reader to think "oh another random Kabbalah chapter" - as a lead in to "vampire-like creatures attack!". It felt like a neat reversal and subversion of reader expectations.

3. The clever wordplay, references, puns, and so forth are integrated into actions and plot advancement in an interesting way, as opposed to it being the subject of digressions that are expected to be interesting in and of themselves.
