If your base possesses bulwarks against enemy invasion, and you create a new entrance, that entrance is probably booby-trapped against enemies. Given that the heptragam is presumably one of only means of ingress into the Cometspawn's base, it is safe to assume that the area is well-guarded against the sudden appearance of The Other King.
