The webcomic Order of the Stick has [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0512.html][a great example]] of Dancing Lights used as a communication system (although not with a long-distance relay).

Edit: These are excellent suggestions in general. Especially the cantrips: Mending is great for repairing lightweight items (up to 1 pound), and Prestigitation makes good hygiene much easier (clean anything without using up soap or water).

However, I don't think Alarm really works as a way to monitor locations for enemy troops. It activates anytime a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area without speaking the password. In other words, the spell doesn't differentiate between a stray rabbit, a harmless traveler, and an enemy army. If the Alarm is set outdoors on a public bridge, you will get a high proportion of false positives.
