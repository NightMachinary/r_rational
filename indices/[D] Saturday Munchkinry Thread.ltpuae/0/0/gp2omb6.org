Don't risk your soldiers on the front lines, instead use them to revolutionise your intelligence and communication.

Cantrips:

- Dancing lights: devise a semaphore system and use this for long-distance communication with a relay of casters
- Mending: keep all the equipment in good condition
- Prestidigitation: clean everything to improve hygiene and flavor the rations to improve morale

Scouts:

- Alarm: monitor all the key junctions and bridges for enemy troops, the caster just has to stay within 1 mile to receive the alert
- Mount: horses are expensive and need to be treated carefully. Horses created by magic are entirely disposable and need no feed, removing the logistical burden and allowing your casters to ride them to death

Spies:

- Charm person: politely ask captured enemy officers or uncooperative local civilians for intelligence
- Disguise self: this includes clothing and armour, so impersonate enemy officers or messengers to gather information and sow havoc with conflicting orders
