Thinking along similar lines:

The cantrip Message is good for short range secure communication during scouting (110 ft. range).

Ray of frost might be worth it for being able to chill provisions to preserve them and it can double as a weapon if absolutely needed (1d3 is a decent chunk of damage relative to a commoner).

Floating disk lasts 1-2 hours and can carry 100-200 lbs (depending on how good the soldier is). That isn't enough time or weight for long range logistics, but short range uses might exist...
