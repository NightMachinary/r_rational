In video gaming, there is a common method of "cheating" that does not involve hacking into the game code or exploiting bugs: one simply creates a program to play the game, pressing buttons and tilting control sticks at the exact preprogrammed times. Done well, this allows one to "play" the video game with superhuman "skill", since pressing buttons at the correct timings becomes simply a matter of determining what the correct timings are. Many speed runs of video games are done using exactly this trick.

You have the power to do this with your own body. Your mindscape contains a simple text editor, where you can write in (preprogram) a sequence of steps and timings for moving specific muscles of your body by specific amounts at specific times, and you can execute the sequence whenever you want.

Some limitations apply:

- Only muscles you can move voluntarily can be controlled this way. So you can't use this power to stop your own heart muscles.
- Your muscles can only be moved in ways that you could move them. So you can't use this power to increase your flexibility.
- Your muscle movements are only precise up to the millisecond and millimeter.
- The preprogrammed instructions cannot make your muscles cannot exert more power than you could normally exert with them. So you can't use this power to gain superhuman strength.

In general, your power only gives you superhuman precision in timing and movement.

Other than setting superhumanly-skilled speed runs on video games, what can you use this power for?
