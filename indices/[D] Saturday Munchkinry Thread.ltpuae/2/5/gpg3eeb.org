In addition to what everyone else have said; probably at least 10% or so of humans already have this superpower IRL, possibly more like 40% if you relax the requirements, it's called "dexterity" and the only downside is it takes a few years of practice for each "batch" of scripts. In fact, this variant of the superpower is FAR superior to the one you describe, since it's highly programmable, able to adapt to slight changes of context, can have analog parameters, automatically breaks down and reorganizes sub-sequences, and a bunch of other QoL features.

The only reason you don't see this used in impressive ways every day is that the filter bubble most people on this reddit are in considers it low status and are unwilling to pay the opportunity cost to dedicate those years.

Having that downside removed is a common trope: Uber from worm, the skill downloads in The Matrix, that one girl in heroes, are just the first ones that come to mind.
