Like another person said, conditional scripts or very small and particular scripts would help mitigate the adjustments needed to adapt to real world conditions.

This reminds me a lot of the Iron Nerve in the Sufficient Velocity Quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked For Death]]. (Set in Naruto, where MC has bloodline ability that can remember and repeat movements perfectly.)

- Ninja Warrior: you can build a copy of the course in your backyard and create scripts for each obstacle, and smaller scripts for each step of each obstacle.
- Reload a gun: as long as you bring the gun to a particular starting point each time, the movement of the gun itself should be really fast.
- Roll dice to get the desired result most of the time: it'd take a bit of adjustment for unknown dice and unknown table surfaces, but with some trial and error you could probably roll exactly the number you want. (This is done in Marked for Death.)
- Card tricks: you could reliably do cool card tricks.
- Basketball: create a script for the common places to shoot a basket and you'd have pretty good accuracy.
- Free-throws: literally never miss.
- Field-goals: adjust your script for the distance from the endzone and you're good. You might also have to adjust for wind.
- Claw games/arcade games: go to an arcade and it's easy prizes.
- Fighting: A single script to win a fight might be hard, but short and simple scripts for common movements would be fine. For example, raising your left leg or right leg to block a low kick can be left to a script just fine. Same for things like kipping up, or jabbing to create distance.
