I think this power is more limited than you realize. In video games, the world is absolutely predictable and precise so a preset input sequence works perfectly. IRL, your body needs to constantly make micro adjustments to compensate for dynamic real world conditions: slight variance in friction and air resistance need to be corrected for. A preplanned script would either need to allow for conditional programming or else the first tiny bit of extra friction or tiny bit of extra air resistance might throw the whole script off. With a robust scripting language which can utilize sensory input and conscious mental commands this could work, otherwise it will only be good for brief instances under precisely calibrated external conditions.
