Using this by yourself? Useless. The time it would take to write and debug the scripts would vastly exceed the time it would take to just practice the movement without a script.

If you can take sensory inputs, as well as present an interface to provide inputs to the script, and other people can use this ability, then you might actually have something worthwhile. That would get you a situation similar to The Matrix, where you could just download a script to learn to fly a helicopter, without personally having flown a helicopter even once before.
