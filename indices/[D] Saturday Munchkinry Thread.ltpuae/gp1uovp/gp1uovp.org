Another DnD optimization:

You are in a low powered and low magic late medieval (just as professional non-feudal armies and early gunpowder weapons are developing) D&D setting (a 6th level spell caster with 3rd level spells is as rare as between 1 in a hundred and 1 in a thousand people, and higher level get exponentially rarer). You are a high ranking general who has a Wizard ally who has developed a highly efficient curriculum. By screening for the smartest 90th percentile soldiers with simple standardized testing, and using a curriculum that trades off on long term overall understanding for optimized speed of learning, they can learn 4 level 0 cantrips and 2 level 1 spells in only 3 months.

Under non combat conditions, a trained Wizard-soldier can repeatedly use cantrips indefinitely using a trick to recapture the magical energy, but can only use up to 4 cantrips in combat conditions as they cannot recapture the magic energy. The Wizard-soldier can also cast 3 level 1 spells per day. As with D&D wizards, the Wizard-soldier needs 8 hours sleep to fully restore their magical energy (less sleep means proportionally less magic), but thanks to your Ally Wizard's optimizations, they only need a single water proofed sheet to study for their “spell book” and can prepare their spells each morning in only 30 minutes. Caster level varies between 1 and 2 depending on the soldier.

You have two apprentices of this Wizard to help in training as well, so you can pick 3 different sets of training curriculum to train subset of your smartest soldiers. What 12 cantrips and 6 level 1 spells divided into 3 subsets of soldiers do you have 1 tenth of your army learn?
