*Im toying with an idea for a munchkin/rational Alt History version of WW2, focusing on Poland specifically.*

It starts as it did in original timeline, on September 1, 1939. The immediate difference is however:

Whenever a Polish soldier dies (any member of the Polish armed forces) their strength, speed, dexterity, durability and theoretical knowledge and skills (not personal knowledge or intelligence though) is given to the nearest Polish soldier, atop of their own.

(for example, if there were two Polish soldiers who could benchpress 60 kg, and one dies, the other can now benchpress 120 kg).

Im working through the possible long term and exponential consequences of that "national" superpower. At what point does the number of "Super Poles" is enough to overwhelm the technological advantage of the Nazis, and the number advantage of the Soviets? At what point will they be able to go on an offensive? What would be the most optimal tactical and strategic use for a soldier who is Double (or Triple, or Quandruple) as strong and fast as normal human?

Assuming the Polish government and military cadres are rational and bloodlusted to win, how can they munchkin this power to maximum utility?

Other than this one sci-fi change, full realism applies. In all rounds Poland is bloodlusted, and led by rational-ish munchkin/optimiser politicians and generals.

*R1:* Poland has to defend itself, and repel both Nazis and the Soviets off its boarders successfully.

*R2:* Poland has to go on an offensive: forcing both the Nazis and the Soviets to surrender.

*R3:* Poland has to win WW2 single-handedly, as a mercenary force fighting instead of the Western Allies on all fronts.

R4: Poland has to conquer the entire world through military force or forcing submission.
