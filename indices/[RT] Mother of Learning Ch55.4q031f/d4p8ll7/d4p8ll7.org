Typos, mistakes, nitpicking:

- Who knows what kind of critical secrets it knows, and it doesn't appear as if *it* cares to share anything on its own initiative
- how long do *we* have to leave this place?
- Approximately 30 years in line*a*r time.
- If I knew +I+ all this
- left +to+ towards Cirin's train station
- Zach would remark how surprised he was at *the* way Kirielle treated him
- Frankly, if Zorian was in Xvim's place and a student came to him with a story about being a time traveler and then +*\br*+ another student was also a time traveler, he'd react the same way too. Thus, the very next day after Zorian's talk with Xvim, he returned to the man's office with Zach in tow.

Also, some thoughts:

- they could start collecting a list of questions for an attempt to brute-force some additional information from the guardian. At the very least, they could start asking things like “Does the Controller have an ability to [...]?”
- I think RR may not be a villain, even if his interests were seemingly in conflict with Zorian and Zach's so far.
- Now would be a good time for Zorian to re-activate his Silverlake quest, yes?
- the explanation for the time loop's length limit coincided nicely with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4pvgxp/d_taxonomy_of_teleportation_models_things_of/d4o6uga][a recent discussion here on /r/rat.]]
