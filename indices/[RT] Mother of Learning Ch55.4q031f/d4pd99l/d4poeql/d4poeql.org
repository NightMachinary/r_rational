:D If you look at Kirielle and see only an annoying brat, then I pity you. She brings a light all of her own into the story. Probably the reason Zorian brought her, after all he's had to deal with lately. She annoys him, but she also trusts him, looks up to him, and will even defend him. I think he needs someone like that around.
