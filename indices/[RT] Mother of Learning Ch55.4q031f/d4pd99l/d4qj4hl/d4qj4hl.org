I disagree that it is out of character for Zorian to "take a break" after such a huge setback...

"The conclusion he settled on was that he needed some time to calm down and come to terms with what happened. Think up a new way forward. He would probably end up just wandering around the country for a restart or two. Or maybe a dozen restarts."

This was just after the end of Arc One. It is a bit different this time because he knows exactly how many loops are left before the time loop self-destructs, but Zorian also knew at the end of Arc One that the time loop was degrading due to the Matriarchs message. Zorian seems to be only prone to "sticking his nose to the grindstone" only after he has developed a good plan forward.
