It is extremely out of character for Zorian to go on break for two restarts, in this situation. Everything we know about Zorian, would have him doubling down in his efforts. Yes, he's a far cry from the Zorian at the start of the story, but his work ethic is still his most defining characteristic. He doesn't waste time wallowing in despair, he puts his nose to grindstone in order to find the solution to his problems.

I mean seriously, Zorian procrastinating before made sense; he'd been looping for multiple years and thought the loop ending would result in everything continuing as normal. But the AI just got done giving him the ultimatum: win in 4 years or you and everything you know dies. It isn't rational for him to do this and it isn't like him to do it.

On a more personal note, I dislike seeing Kirielle this much. She primarily exists so that Zorian can mature as a person, and though he still has a ways to go, he's most of the way there. So what we're left with is an annoying brat who -- by the rules of the story -- cannot grow up.
