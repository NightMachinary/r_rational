You've been thinking Daimen might have mind mage powers too? I imagine they'd be much weaker than Zorian's, enough to give him a little bit of an edge over others without the negative side effects Zorian was always getting hit with. And even with that, Daimen would still have to be extremely competent, both to use mental abilities to any useful degree and skillful enough at normal magic to have impressed almost all his instructors. Of course, that means Zorian would have an even better reason to hate him as well, since in that case Daimen should have been able to tell that Zorian's empathic powers were the cause of a lot of Zorian's problems, and Daimen never did anything at all to help him.

I do think this chapter has made Daimen as RR a bit more unlikely, but since the possible candidate pool is still so shallow, I haven't completely eliminated him. But Daimen shouldn't have any grudge against Cyoria, and RR does seem to have spent too much effort helping the Ibasans for it just to have been a distraction for Zach.

I'd like to know if they can grant the temporary marker to the same people multiple times, or if both Zorian and Zach could stagger temporary markers on the same person to keep them around longer than 6 months. It would make a lot of stuff a lot easier for them.
