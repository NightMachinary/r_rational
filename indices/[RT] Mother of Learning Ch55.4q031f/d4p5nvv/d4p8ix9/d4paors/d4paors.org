You have /no/ idea.

The problem with DtRR was... well... lack of proper in-universe evidence. Damien is undoubtedly the biggest gun on the wall and personally I'm inclined to believe he will appear in some fashion.

Before the inner workings and restrictions of the loop were revealed, it was possible to assume that Daimen activated the loop using some awesome magical ruins of Ikosian awesomeness and that activation also pulled Zach in. Now we have evidence that only one person can be the initial controller. As Daimen has no reason to bring Zach in the loop, he can't be the controller. If Zach is the controller, it is not possible for Daimen to be brought in the loop. I mean it's technically possible, but it would require Zach seeking out Daimen (and remember, he is in some jungle, pretty far away from civilization and Cyoria) in the first 5 years of looping and then telling him about the loop and then Daimen mindraping Zach.
