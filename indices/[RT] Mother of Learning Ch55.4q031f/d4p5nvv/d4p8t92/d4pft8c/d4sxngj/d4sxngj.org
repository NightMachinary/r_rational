Hopefully Zach can master gate spells or teleport spells to speed up their progress. He has enough mana to travel very quickly. With transformation spells they can move pretty fast to new locations. At 200mph (top bird speed) it would take just about 10 days to travel anywhere in the world, and magic may speed that up.
