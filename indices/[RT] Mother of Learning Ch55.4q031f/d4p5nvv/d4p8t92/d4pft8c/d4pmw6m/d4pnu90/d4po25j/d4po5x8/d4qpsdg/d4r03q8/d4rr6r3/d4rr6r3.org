Actually, I put a bit more thought into it while pulling weeds. If island-teleporting across the ocean is at all possible, there's probably an established route.

It is impractical for an individual to manually travel to islands with nothing of interest, just to familiarize themselves with the location for a few hours. But either governments or private trading enterprises would heavily invest in having at least a few mages who could make the trip across continents in a day or two instead of waiting however long it takes by airship. While it's true an individual mage can't transport much in the way of personnel or material goods, using a method like Zorian does for Kael's notebooks, they can transport a massive amount of information, plus, there might be times where moving a couple people across the ocean very quickly is all that a business or government needs. Initially, they would only need to have a few mages who can complete the route, because at that point it would only take those mages a week or so to each train another couple mages on the route.

So if such a route exists, Zach and Zorian would just have to pay/bribe a mage who knows the Miasina route the equivalent of a few thousand dollars to teach it to them as well.
