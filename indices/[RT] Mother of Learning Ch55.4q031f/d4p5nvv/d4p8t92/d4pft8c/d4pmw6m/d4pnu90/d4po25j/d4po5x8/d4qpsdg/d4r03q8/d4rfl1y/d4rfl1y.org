I'd half-forgotten about that requirement. I think that the ocean is too great a distance to cover with normal teleportation even if they do manage to reach the other continent. And I doubt any normal service would have pitstops at random islands so that mages could learn the place well enough to teleport to, if such islands even existed in the first place. I think I'll probably give up on that possibility.
