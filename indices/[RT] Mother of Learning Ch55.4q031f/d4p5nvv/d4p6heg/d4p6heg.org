Divine Command Theory, look it up. Whatever Zorian deems moral a god may deem not.

I think it is heavily implied that the Gate is a divine creation. Let's break it up:

- Insane complexity. For example the Guardian is a pretty nice AI.
- Insane power levels. Recreate a world 1000 times over, with potential to sustain those worlds for prolonged time (remember, the 1-month limit was said to be set up only for moral reasons)
- Intricate knowledge of souls. I mean, does anyone besides gods have the capacity to create a copy of soul? I doubt that, because necromancers would be fundamentally different with such ability. Create a soulwell, populate it with copies of 1 soul -> profit. But no one does that (obv: they can't)
- The Maker is implied to be an immortal. The guardian suggested that the Maker could have marked Zach, but the Gate's activations are once in 400 years. If the Maker is anything less than immortal, he is guaranteed to be dead. The Maker and his 'agents' sounds suspiciously like a god and his subordinate angels.
- Excessive wastefulness. Creating 1000 simulations for /just one person but not for yourself/, that's insane if you think about it. But it's exactly the kind of move that Zorian would describe as "Gods being dicks. Again."
- Zach is a picturesque champion. He is just the kind of person that screams 'I am the Chosen One' and lo and behold, he is chosen.

The first two alone strongly imply divine origin.
