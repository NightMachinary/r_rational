I disagree re: industrialisation.

The world of MoL is still a giant collection of walled communities. Knowledge is hoarded and hidden, only rarely being shared fully. The academy is shown as a very recent thing. Their society just isn't set up well for knowledge sharing.

Most of the advantage of the loop is the looper being able to trick, steal or buy spell knowledge from other people a thousand times over.

Even the teachers only share their best knowledge with students who've become their apprentice.

Their entire society is structured so as to reinforce those restrictions. Despite duplication of books being quick and easy such libraries are rate and those that exist have multiple levels of access with the lions share of powerful magic kept from the majority and the government bans even knowing about many branches of magic.

It's also implied that these kinds of restrictions are somewhat justified. A few dozen nutters with access to the right knowledge can summon one of the elder gods from the dungeon dimensions and potentially destroy entire countries.

If knowledge was shared as freely as it is in our world then, yes, there would be a massive magical industrial revolution (or possibly the end of the world as every cultist can suddenly find the instructions for destroying cities)
