I missed the part about the gate being moved to its current location, you are right this means that there has to be some sort of external power supply. There are also more meta level arguments against the gods being essentially human - such as the author stating that D&D was a huge inspiration.

Still, my thinking is that there are a lot of potential cheat codes built into the world of MoL. In fact, you are outlining one possibility in your own post.

As for potential breakthroughs not bleeding into their respective fields, didn't the Ikosian empire cease to exist before the story started? If this part of the story is realistic in any way, then that happened at the end of a long cultural decline. And who knows what came before that?

One thing that always bugs me about fantasy stories with functional magic is that it makes things too easy. Look at how fast the industrialization took off in reality. Magic would have made that /simpler/ (and more volatile). Who knows how often some things have been invented and forgotten over the years? Now add in some characters who are effectively immortal and you get a very volatile mixture - I'm reasonably sure that there are plenty of important events in the backstory that we (and the characters) know nothing about...

I'm not saying that this is my preferred theory or anything like that. I just wanted to say that we don't have enough actual knowledge about things that are /strictly/ impossible to rule out all alternatives.
