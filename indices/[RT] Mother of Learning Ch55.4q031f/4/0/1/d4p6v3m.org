Archmage is being superior than regular experts in /multiple/ fields.

Yes, Zorian can write the book on Mind-Magic, but he's still a journeyman in golem-making, potioneering, wards and barely an expert in shaping.

I was also kinda hoping he would learn soul-magic and shifting, but we may get that after he kills the Grey Hunter.
