Worse. Cat Shifters are just untrustworthy thieves according to the public. Mind Mages can straight up Master you. An unshielded person can never know if a Mind Mage has screwed with their mind and changed their priorities. A shielded person has mere seconds to react to a mental attack, and if they fail then the Mind Mage can do whatever they want then make them believe that no-one attacked them to begin with, and that they are still well defended.

The potential for abuse is massive. I can see why society decided to make it taboo.
