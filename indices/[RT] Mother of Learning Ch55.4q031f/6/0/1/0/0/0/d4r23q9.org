I too look forward the worldbuilding documents, they should be awesome.

Mana is useful because it's turned by your soul to be easy to use. It doesn't really matter where you put it, it's not going to be very useful unless your soul turns it to personal mana. You can just carry around crystallized mana for spells and such which don't need personal mana.
