Yea, the biggest cost seems to be for sanity and morality reasons. * One doesn't need to take enough of said stimulants to die, just enough that it could potentially cause death if used on a permanent basis - which won't be the case as his physical body is consistently reset. Perfect memory, intuitive pattern solving, accelerated thoughts, luck(?) or any such mental upgrades would definitely be worth it. (heck, physical ones too) * The point of reading / finding forbidden texts is that no teacher would ever teach it to a new first circle mage, regardless of how talented they seem. (or they were deemed too dangerous to be in circulation / were banned for bureaucratic reasons) * Soul sight is one of the rituals one would obviously tackle first. Most innate skills seem not to require much mana to use anyways. (such as how much easier it is for him to knock out his opponents with his innate mind magic than with a structured spell) * When? I can't remember a single non-aranea instance where he stole knowledge to improve his magical ability. (but I could also be mistaken, I'm not sure)

EDIT: Am I formatting this wrong? I can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work?
