Oh shoot, we only have 52 resets left before we potentially cease from existence or no longer have access to the abusing mechanics of the loop... better take a two loop break. Really? You have a one-in-a-kind non-renewable resource and you decide to basically waste some of it. (granted, they won't be doing /nothing/ for those loops, but still) In fact, there are many things they could have done before the revelations of this loop.

- Down potions that drastically increase physical and mental abilities at the cost of permanent harm to your body to the extent of death if done for longer than a month. (and since your body is always reset...)
- Forbidden research on topics that you'll probably never be allowed to pursue in real life, breaking into the higher levels of the library and memorizing all the tomes. Even if he is sentenced to death / expelled from the school for reaching the highest level libraries, it would be worth it. (especially since Zorian can remember things permanently if he puts his mind to it)
- Rituals that give you permanent abilities at the cost of the death of those with said abilities. This one is a little morally iffy, following the same logic as the Maker, but if one decides to do it, one can basically collect all the special bloodlines of all the major houses. Zorian already has the advantage of having started with one, empathy, but imagine collecting many such abilities. (soul sight? instinctive use of fire? natural accelerated regeneration? natural resistance to magic? darksight? blindsight? innate understanding of vibrations in the earth? innate understanding of wind currents? more soul-brain space (since the mind seems to be stored in the soul)? the possibilities are basically endless)
- Mind stealing knowledge. All of it.
- Black boxes and time accelerated training. Especially given how easy it was to find. Just hop in with as much food as possible close to the end of the loop and stay in there until the end / starvation-suicide.

...and these are just things that could have been done /before/ this chapter. After the revalations of this chapter...

- Mini-marker anyone you can convince to help you out and train train train.
- Find the keys and figure out how to speedrun acquire them and use them to restart the looping mechanic on the /actual/ alignment.
- Make use of Zach's brute force to mind-read everyone, since you are no longer worried about being found by RR.
- Upgrade mind to Cyoria Matriarch level of OP-ness, master as much magic as you can and prepare for your endgame. (prepare for every teacher / mentor's favorites such that you can secure tutelage in the actual timeline)
