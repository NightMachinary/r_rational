  restart the looping mechanic on the actual alignment.

I suspect that you can't do that. Originally I was thinking of the alignment as /powering/ the loop, and being further away meant less power, which might have meant that you could retry with more power at the peak.

But that's not actually what the Guardian said. It said that activating the loop early "made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly".

So it sounds to me like the significance of the planar alignment is to make dimensional magic cheaper, thus allowing you to get far more iterations from the same amount of power. Presumably that power was collected during the intervening 400 years. However it is obtained, I'm pretty sure it's all being consumed in the current loop (unfortunately in a wasteful fashion due to the early start).

I'm pretty sure RR has done this. From chapter 26, "Red Robe's strength was utterly superhuman and completely out of proportion with his size and build."
