Xvim is kind of an ass, but his interactions with others are fun to read.

Like nobody103 wrote, shaping skills are a good indicator of general magical skill. The test isn't unfair because Zach's innate disadvantage due to larger mana reserves, it's unfair because Xvim will always increase the difficulty to determine the actual limitations of any mage's skill. He's shown that he has a variety of ways to do this, so even a mage with a lower natural mana capacity and higher innate shaping skills wouldn't be able to satisfy his testing. He'd just throw in more distractions, or ask them to perform a different shaping skill until he found one they weren't competent in. If he could somehow test himself in the same way, he'd probably still be unable to meet his own demands. Actually, that might be the sort of thing he does for fun.

It's not like the unwarned marble to the forehead thing was Zach-only, he's done it at least a few times to Zorian as well, it's just that Zorian knows it's coming now.
