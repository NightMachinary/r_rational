Huh, that's surprising. Xvim strikes me as the ultra rational type who wouldn't fall into the trap of linear thinking, i.e. judging an unfamiliar mage in one dimension. Not to say he isn't biased like many teachers for a particular standard of assessment, but with the wide range in mage specializations and abilities, are bad shaping skills necessarily an indicator of incompetence? I mean Zach is good enough as a brute-force-type mage to go (presumably) solo against foes like Oganj (after a few failures).
