  but with the wide range in mage specializations and abilities, are bad shaping skills necessarily an indicator of incompetence?

For the most part, yes. Discounting innate magical abilities for a moment, one's shaping ability determines how big and sophisticated your magic can get. Having huge mana reserves means nothing if you can't control them well enough. That's why Zach got as good at shaping as he did - he had to in order to cast higher ranked combat spells.

  I mean Zach is good enough as a brute-force-type mage

Zach is also very good at shaping. Xvim knows he has to be if he's as good as he claims. And he also knows Zach was terrible at shaping only a few months ago, and what kind of growth in that area could be considered reasonable. Seeing Zach's shaping skills tells him a lot, or at least Xvim feels so.
