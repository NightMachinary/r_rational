  Zach is also very good at shaping. Xvim knows he has to be if he's as good as he claims. And he also knows Zach was terrible at shaping only a few months ago, and what kind of growth in that area could be considered reasonable. Seeing Zach's shaping skills tells him a lot, or at least Xvim feels so.

I feel like there's either a contradiction here or Xvim is laboring under a misunderstanding of Zach's mana reserves.

Basically Zach is really good at shaping or else he wouldn't be where he is, but Xvim expects a standard of perfection that Zach can't achieve, given the impediment of his mana reserves.

Is Xvim's test suffering from content-validity bias? (where the test is "easier" for some students)
