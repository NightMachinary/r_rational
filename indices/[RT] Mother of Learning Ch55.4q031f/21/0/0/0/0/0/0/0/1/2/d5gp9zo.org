But why would he - or anyone who has read about Xvim - expect that Xvim would actually set a fair test?! Seriously, folks, remember Zorian's quest to become so perfect that Xvim couldn't criticise him? It can't be done! He will always criticise! Ultimately the quest ended only because Zorian became so good that Xvim knew something radically abnormal was happening, plus he recognised his own skills, and thus he became aware of the loop. It wasn't that Zorian achieved the necessary standard of perfection.

Xvim's standard of perfection is like the level that Rational!Voldemort plays at: /one level higher than you/.
