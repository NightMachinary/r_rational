I think he's trying to say that if someone has a base mana of 10 and someone else 20. The one with the base 20 would have a harder time aquiring shaping skills equivalent to the person with the base 10 since a higher base means a harder time improving your shaping abilities.

So the point would be that Xvim should first check the base of someone mana before judging their shaping skills to see how good they are relative to that.
