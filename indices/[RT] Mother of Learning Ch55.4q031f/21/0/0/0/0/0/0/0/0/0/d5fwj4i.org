There is being competent, and there is honing something to near-perfection. Zach knows enough of the exercise to get bye - once he achieved that, he moved on to more interesting things. As virtually anyone would in his shoes. So while his shaping skills are quite good, he has not honed any of them to the level Zorian has.

And Zach didn't think he was in a combat situation. He was completely blindsided by Xvim's actions, and thus lost concentration. If he was expecting the marble, he would not have lost concentration, despite not being quite as proficient in the exercise as Zorian and Xvim are.
