Xvim /always/ expects a higher standard of perfection from students than they're able to achieve. He wants to push them to the limit, both to see where they stand and to encourage them to improve.

And nothing that Xvim criticized Zach was impossible for him to achieve. Just because Zach's shaping skills are good enough for what he wants them for doesn't mean they're honed to perfection. Zach feels Xvim's demands are just pointless perfectionism with no real-world application, though. And could very well be correct about that, but good luck convincing Xvim.

Having read up on content-validity bias a little, I'm not really sure how it applies to this situation. Xvim isn't judging Zach according to some static criteria - his test is specifically tailored to Zach and deliberately designed to be hard. He continually adjusted the test to be harder as Zach demonstrated better and better shaping skills, and intentionally homed in on what he perceived to be the boy's weaknesses. It's unfair by design.

And no, this is not a good way to teach/test people, but it's how Xvim does things. There is a reason why virtually all students avoid him.
