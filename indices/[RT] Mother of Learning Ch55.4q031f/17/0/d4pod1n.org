We know what brought Zorian in: a soul meld by Quatach-Ichl, interrupted by the Guardian when it detected soul damage. Zorian's marker has the same privileges as Zach's, it just broke too much to detect that it was misplaced.

If they get the Key, then they get admin privileges and can tell the Guardian to do whatever they want, so there's no risk of copies being erased.
