Which definitely came back to bite Zach in this chapter, since he burnt through 20+ restarts to accomplish that. At least a year and half of time. He only really killed Oganj because it sounded like an awesome thing to do. And as far as bragging rights go, it wasn't that great, because the accomplishment disappeared after that loop. Sure, Zach can tell people that he soloed the Mage Dragon Oganj, but besides RR and Zorian, no one actually remembers that it ever happened.

So while yes, I do think Zach could solo a grey hunter, it's probably not worth the risk of the grey hunter getting a lucky bite on him.

We may never know what Silverlake wants a grey hunter egg for.
