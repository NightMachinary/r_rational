I've thought about it overnight and I agree that a simulacrum is unlikely given the last 2 chapters, mostly because it would be anti-climatic. Zach exits the gate and assumes the body which his simulacrum had just recently possessed, end of story? Nah.

However, I think that Zach telling everyone about the loop would definitely have taken place after he was already found and mindwhiped by RR. Why? Because the alternative is that the maker/agent sent Zach in completely unprepared. Additionally, why would RR stop at selective amnesia? Why not instill some form of control on him as well, mindfuck him so that he's never a problem again? This guy is smart; he wouldn't leave the only remaining threat a viable one.

So whatever imperative Zach was sent in with is no longer there, which completely changes his motivations. Speculating on that is moot, for now.
