Here is my prediction: Kael and Xvim will get those fancy 6-month trial period markers. I imagine Kael's research will speed up immensely if he won't need to rememorise all his findings at the start of the month, and having an actual archmage on their side who believes their story from the start of the loop would be really useful.

Also, I still stand by my idea that Zorian will get a Gray Hunter familiar, possibly by giving that marker to an egg and soulbinding to it. Worst case scenario, he will do it during that final month, after they leave the timeloop.
