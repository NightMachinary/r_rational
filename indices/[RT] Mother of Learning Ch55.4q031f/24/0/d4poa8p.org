Armor might stop marbles, but that is /very/ far from Xvim's full repertoire. OK, you can keep shaping while struck by marbles; now detect them while blindfolded. Now sort them by magnitude of mana emissions. Now fuse them together. Now repeatedly raise your reactive armor again while I dispel it - oh dear, you didn't manage it fast enough to stop the next marble hitting you in the forehead. Start over.
