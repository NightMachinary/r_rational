  Down potions that drastically increase physical and mental abilities at the cost of permanent harm to your body to the extent of death if done for longer than a month. (and since your body is always reset...)

  "On the other hand, when you're literally messing with your body chemistry and using alteration on your flesh, you're usually doing something totally irreversible," Lukav continued. "Human body is a complex thing, and I don't think anyone really understands enough about it to meaningfully improve it. Most potions that aim to enhance the real body with some exotic concoction are basically stimulant drugs with addictive properties or cause hard-to-cure damage if used often.

Stimulants aren't hugely helpful to them. Plus dying horribly is taxing to their mental sanity and the recovery would take time.

#+begin_quote
  Forbidden research on topics that you'll probably never be allowed to pursue in real life, breaking into the higher levels of the library and memorizing all the tomes. Even if he is sentenced to death / expelled from the school for reaching the highest level libraries, it would be worth it. (especially since Zorian can remember things permanently if he puts his mind to it)
#+end_quote

Reading is a slow and a long way to get knowledge. Much easier to rely on mages like Xvim who have read said forbidden texts and know what works and what doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  Rituals that give you permanent abilities at the cost of the death of those with said abilities. This one is a little morally iffy, following the same logic as the Maker, but if one decides to do it, one can basically collect all the special bloodlines of all the major houses. Zorian already has the advantage of having started with one, empathy, but imagine collecting many such abilities. (soul sight? instinctive use of fire? natural accelerated regeneration? natural resistance to magic? darksight? blindsight? innate understanding of vibrations in the earth? innate understanding of wind currents? more soul-brain space (since the mind seems to be stored in the soul)? the possibilities are basically endless)
#+end_quote

Since both of them lack soul sight doing soul magic and soul research without that seems dangerous- it could permamently damage their souls or waste many loops in recovery. Plus for Zorian, he already has little magic, he can't afford to waste much more supporting an innate magical ability.

#+begin_quote
  Mind stealing knowledge. All of it.
#+end_quote

It does help, and Zorian is doing it.

#+begin_quote
  Black boxes and time accelerated training. Especially given how easy it was to find. Just hop in with as much food as possible close to the end of the loop and stay in there until the end / starvation-suicide.
#+end_quote

If it still works, would help a lot.
