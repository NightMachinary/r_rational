Thanks for the detailed response, I literally just came here after finding and reading through that webpage. Yea, he does a good job at covering all the 'easy' options. The reasonings just aren't fully explained in the story. I can't wait for when he releases his worldbuilding documents though.

Here's an interesting thought, special / innate abilities seem to be tied to a caster's life force instead of their regular mana reserves. Would it be possible to get use a mana boost ritual and shunt all that extra power, which your soul can't handle, directly into an special ability / innate power (potentially sacrificial) ritual? The extra, unstable, mana would thus be put directly into your lifeforce to sustain the ability instead? Just a thought, I'll probably should just ask on the Patreon page later instead.
