Looks like time for me to link my newly produced author words doc.

  mind-altering concoctions (lower your inhibitions without suffering loss of coordination from being drunk, things like that; general intelligence boost don't exist in MoL-verse)
#+end_quote

Practically, there are no potions to grant general intelligence boosts, so no perfect memory, accelerated thoughts. There's no luck mechanics known either.

Being suicidal with drug use, like irl, doesn't actually guarantee good results, and lots of things don't work.

#+begin_quote
  The point of reading forbidden texts it that no teacher in their right mind would ever teach them to a new first circle mage, regardless of how talented the y seem
#+end_quote

Depends on the mage. Easier to find a morally flexible mage than to find a forbidden text often.

#+begin_quote
  Soul sight is one of the rituals one would tackle first, most innate skills seem to not require much mana anyways. (and if this is really a concern, I'm sure there are rituals to increase his total mana pool.

  Enhancement rituals often have large drawbacks, especially if done incorrectly... and they are easy to do incorrectly. No, using the time loop to save scum doesn't make that irrelevant - Zorian hates dying, especially in a horrible, painful fashion. Also, many of them esentially turn the mage into a magical creature, and thus force them to spent their mana to maintain their enhancements. Hardly something a mana-conscious mage would be crazy about. Finally, most of those enhancements wouldn't carry over to other restarts, and require lengthy and dangerous procedures to apply, making them relatively unappealing to Zorian.

Enhancement rituals cost mana, they don't bring it. You can increase mana but-

  Well he certainly wasn't pressed for time at the moment, Zorian had to admit. "I suppose that makes sense," he said. "I guess the reason why mana reserves plateau after a while is that there is only so much power a soul can safely handle. Increasing the cap artificially after that point messes up the mage's shaping skills with no hope of ever regaining them. No wonder everyone recommends against doing it -- no matter how benign the enhancement process, the result is still more power and less control over it.
#+end_quote

Then they can't shape any more, and the loss is permanent.

#+begin_quote
  "Indeed. What about alchemical solutions? Is there a potion that increases your mana regeneration, gives you a momentary mana boost or something like that?"

  "I doubt it. I think we would have all heard about such a potion if it was at all available. But it's possible, I suppose, especially if it has some serious drawbacks that curtails its use. You should probably ask Lukav about that -- if anyone knows how to answer that question definitively, it's him," Kael said. He squirmed uncomfortably. "And since we're on the topic of Lukav, I have a bit of a... personal request."
#+end_quote

No known mana boosting potions either.

Soul sight would be useful, but there are probably some downsides, and ethical concerns.

#+begin_quote
  When? I can't remember a single non-aranea instance where he stole knowledge to improve his magical ability.
#+end_quote

Notably, mind reading has a tendency to cause death, and he's only recently got it up to a safe level, but he used it to find potion stores from the invaders, work out how their magical amulets work, work out how to control magical creatures from the necromancer, worked out how his warding scheme worked, he got the library pass with surface scans.

Although thinking about it, he should be interrogating the Ibasian mages more for secret knowledge. They're bound to have some fun spells. Now he knows how to stop Sudomir he should be doing him. His knowledge would likely be immensely valuable. That would also be entirely within his morality. Working out how his anti alchemy wards work say would be very useful, or how to make that dragon troll transformation potion.
