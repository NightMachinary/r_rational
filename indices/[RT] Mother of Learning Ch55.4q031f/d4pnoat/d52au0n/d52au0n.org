The 'break' might sound more profligate than it actually is. And I suspect normal human beings burn out rather quickly when subjected to high stress situations ad infinitum.

Nepene covers most of the contradictions, but I think most min-maxers (from the safety of being a reader) fail to take into account the constant barrage of competing priorities Zorian has been forced to act under. He's already been quite efficient with his time if Xvim is any judge. Now that he's relatively free of immediate objectives and the looming threat of RR, he can "stop holding back."

  Make use of Zach's brute force to mind-read everyone, since you are no longer worried about being found by RR.

He was already doing this. But if you mean /everyone/, that doesn't seem to justify the waste of time if he doesn't have a specific purpose for the victim.
