I feel it should be mentioned that as we know nothing about the gods they could in fact be "mortals in a higher plane running a simulation" at the very least this logical conundrum seems to hint that they are not omniscient at least though this diverges into what it means to be a "god" in universe.

Plus there is also the possibility of other non gods with high power that the author has not revealed though it is unlikely at this point in the story it can't be ruled out especially with an existing entity like the dragon below and her primordials.
