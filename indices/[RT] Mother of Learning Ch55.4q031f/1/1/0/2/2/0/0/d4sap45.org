I figure Damien's role as an oft discussed Chekov's gun is to eventually help them find the key parts. After all, he's for all intents and purposes Indiana Jones, and we now even have Zach saying "hey your family isn't all that bad" pushing Zorian in a familyish direction.

Him being RR wouldn't fit with that scenario.
