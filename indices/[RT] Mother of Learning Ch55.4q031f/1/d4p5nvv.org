Xvim is awesome, as usual. That little scene made all the suffering he caused to Zorian /worth it/. Start over, Zach.

I absolutely didn't expect one month length of the loop to be for moral reasons. Usually being capable of doing feats like the Gate are depicted above morality. it's also a possible clue that the system wasn't designed by gods, since gods were, according to Zorian "total dicks".

So, now it's Dragon Ball. Search for parts of the Key scattered through the world, increasing your power level in the process, +and have your wish granted when you gather them all+. Daimen probably has at least one of them. Time limit of 4 years seems challenging, but doable.
