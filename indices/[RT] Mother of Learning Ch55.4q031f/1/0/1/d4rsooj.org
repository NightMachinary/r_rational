Zack being both a prince and the controller for an unrelated reason (chosen one) is less likely than him being the controller because he is a prince(connections, wealth, politics).

Also, the spirit-serpent said the gate was unused for a long time. I think it unlikely that a god would have a device for his chosen, that is usable every 400 years, and then forget to pick a chosen every 400 years.

Why would a god with a chosen even have a gate? As long as you are spending attention on choosing him in the first place, just put him in a loop and give him a soul-switch to end the looping while you install the other ones.

I think the controller at least gets chosen my mortals.

The original maker of the loop may be a god, but that is far from certain. Powerful, certainly, but is that necessarily what makes one a god? For all we know "gets power from prayer" could be a criterion. "lives outside the simulation" could be a criterion. No matter how much power one gains in a MMORPG one is not more powerful than the guy who can unplug the server.
