Occam's razor suggests this conclusion strongly based on the evidence we are given. However, in the context of a story I'm always skeptical of this sort of reasoning. If the author of the story chooses to emphasize certain facts and to /repeat/ them several times it is usually becauase he wants you to reach a certain conclusion. The author is a clever arguer. :)

Let's pick this apart, are the first two points really indicative that the gate is something no human in the story could ever achive?

The first - Zorian managed to build a pretty nice robot/golem with ... what? A few years of training? If you had someone train this skill for a ridiculous amount of time you could probably build something like the Guardian. Heck, in the real world you can build a chat bot with the same kind of interactivity. If anything, this would be easier in the world of MoL (mind magic, anyone?).

The second? There is this thing about the gate only activating every 400 years, and ideally only during a specific time where it is easiest to do so. Maybe the time in between is required for recharging? Remember, the thing is located pretty deep in the Hole which provides more power than everyone in the city could possibly use. The gate may need more power than that, but it's also better located and can keep charging for 400 years.

The other points are similar. In the world of MoL, if you had enough time (and we are talking about some agency which built something that looks like a time loop...) building something like the gate starts to look a lot more possible... as for obtaining enough time? Necromancers can apparently make themselves immortal, and if you can make a pocket universe you can have essentially arbitrary temporal distortion. Given these facts it's very difficult to rule out the possibility that the gods are really just human mages who successfully cheated the system.
