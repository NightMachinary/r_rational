The time may be needed for recharging to a certain degree, but mainly it's just using amplification effect for the dimensionalism magic. You can activate the gate at any time, but you would get significantly lower amount of restarts, if any at all. One month offset has cut down this number by an order of magnitude.

But the Gate /was not/ designed with the Hole in mind. It was functioning on another continent and was moved to the Hole /only/ because Tesen 'donated' it to the crown. It just was moved to a pre-existing top secret governmental facility. It was there for no more than just 15 years. Before that it was residing in Noveda coffers for centuries.

The problem with human cheaters theory is that there are no other signs of cheating. The gate is a breakthrough in dimensionalism, soul magic, mind magic and so on. Yet there are no signs of those breakthroughs bleeding into respective fields. Like I said, if the Gate was made by a necromancer, it would not waste millions of souls erasing them in each restart. It would collect them into a soul well and harvest mana for the necromancer to use. To put it another way, if the maker was not a god before the Gate's creation, he would certainly become one with such power.
