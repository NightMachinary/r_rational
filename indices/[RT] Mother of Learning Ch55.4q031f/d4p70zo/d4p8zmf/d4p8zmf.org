That's a cool idea for a MoL fanfic, but from the way the Guardian framed his answer it looked like activating a loop required accumulation of certain power beforehand, for a long period of time.

On another hand, this timeloop seems to be unique in more ways than one: 1. multiple marked people inside, 2. still working after a Controller exited it, 3. activated earlier than supposed, 4. coincides with a summoning of a Primordial (which at least is coded into the loop as an early-reset trigger).
