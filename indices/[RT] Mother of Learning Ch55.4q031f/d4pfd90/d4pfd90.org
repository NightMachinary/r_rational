There must be a reason that so much effort was expended to give a person an entire world as a playground. A quest, upon exiting the loop. To find out the quest, I think we should question what we know about Red Robe, the most informed person shown thus far.

RR probably found out about the loop and mindfucked Zach for all he knew. RR couldn't do the truly smart thing and turn Zach into a vegetable without risking the integrity of the loop, so he erased as much as he could, which is why Zach doesn't know anything he should about the time loop.

If we reexamine what we know of Red Robe's actions, the fact that he is fully aware of the gate's mechanics means spending time helping the invasion must serve a purpose when he exits the loop. If that's true, then it makes narrative sense that this quest is somehow about the invasion, more specifically, the release of the primordial, as it too is tied to the planar convergence. Add to that the fact that while RR helping the invasion is the first interaction the reader has with him, its actually the last thing he does in the loop before he gtfo due to fear of additional time travellers. He was so scared of this despite the high likelihood that feeding the invaders information and gradually improving it is an obvious tell that he was a time traveller to any other sufficiently intelligent person and especially to Zach (which raises the question: how didn't Zach notice that even with his foreknowledge they were always one step ahead of him? Was he being continually mindfucked with?).

Assuming the quest is related to the primordial, to me there are three possibilities:

1. The quest is either unknown or irrelevant to RR, and he is intending to help the invasion for his own reasons once he exits the gate.

2. The quest is to stop the primordial. It seems a bit too straightforward, but it would make sense given what we know so far. Less straightforward is that RR was aiding the invasion in order to infiltrate it completely, and he intends to quickly and completely dismantle it once he leaves the loop. It's a bit of a reach, but perhaps in order to supplant Zach as the loop's sole beneficiary then RR would also have take up its associated quest, or risk the wrath of the Maker.

3. The quest is, in fact, to ensure the release of the primordial, and RR is intending to do just that. This could make sense as a quest given to Zach's if we consider his backstory, which gives him ample reason to hate the establishment, but doesn't really fit Zach's temperament, which is why I think it strengthens the likelyhood of my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4d88fl/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_51_out_of_control/d1omer4?context=3][earlier theory]].

The last is the most out there, but also my favourite.
