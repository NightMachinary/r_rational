No matter how much I am amused by the rebellious simulacrum idea I'd have to say that the easiest explanation is probably the best.

The distinction between the Maker and the Controller suggests that the Maker doesn't need the Sovereign Gate for himself. Other than gods and godlike mythological figures I don't see anyone who would hand out tickets to SG.

Which brings me to the reason why Zach is the controller. The gods simply may be thinking in narratives too much. Zach is the chosen one because it makes up a cool story for him to be the chosen one. I don't believe he was tasked with assisting the release of the primordial. This goes against his character. Stopping the primordial OTOH is the perfect thing for Zach to do: the noble good-spitited heir yadda yadda wronged by his caretaker, performs a great feat and restores order in the kingdom, huzzah (Yes, I think gods amuse themselves by writing shitty fanfiction and making it a reality). Stopping a primordial is also something gods would want since they imprisoned it in the first place.

The next unexplained fact is that the Gate was activated under sub-optimal conditions. 1 month prior to the alignment cuts down its charge substantially. Perhaps the invasion simply forced the Maker's hand. Remember, divination works in the original world, therefore a primordial escape could have been predicted and SG activated as a countermeasure.

How does RR get into the loop? Well, we probably have the answer: /"[Zach] really meant it when you said you went to just about everyone with the [time travel] story."/ Zach told the wrong person, and with the amount of cranium rats and even cultist double agents lurking in the city this ended up badly. The specifics of the encounter could vary but if we keep it simple we get something like this: Year 5 or so of looping, Zach tells a cultist about the time loop and the impending invasion. The cultist pretends to believe him and maybe somehow manages to convince Zach to give him the temporary mark despite the boy's moral objections. For example he could lie and pretend to be terminally ill. "It doesn't matter if I die in the loop, I'll die in the real world in 2 months anyway. With this mark we can beat the invasion, though. Come on, pal, trust me." The cultist then has 6 months to prepare his betrayal. He drugs Zach and uses mind magic to pull the information from the boy's mind (we know he can do this), and then erases Zach's knowledge about the loop. He can't get rid of him entirely though because Zach's soul is the only real one in the loop, ejecting him would shut down SG entirely.

Red Robe doesn't have the Zach's marker, he uses a modified guest marker and therefore was unable to use the tracking ritual. This explains how Zorian is still alive. Presumably RR attacked Zach to use his marker as an input for the search but he failed. RR being lower tier cultist would explain his mediocre magic, would explain the way the Lich treated him, would explain his dedication to the invaders.

  how didn't Zach notice that even with his foreknowledge they were always one step ahead of him?

He did not notice they were 1 step ahead of him because they were 10 steps ahead. Zach's strategy of choice was direct "1 on 1 me scrub" with the Lich. He would be unable to win this fight even against the original non-buffed version of the invasion.
