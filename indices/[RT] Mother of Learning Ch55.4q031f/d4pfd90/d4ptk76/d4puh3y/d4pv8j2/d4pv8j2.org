I'm approaching this excluding the obviously impossible options.

RR can't be the initial controller because he just won't bring Zach in the loop. You can't expect him to tolerate Zach prematurely resetting hundreds of restarts.

They can't both be initial controllers because it is explicitly stated so.

That leaves the only option of RR being the passenger.

Yes, Zach was indeed sent unprepared because SG /is the preparation/. It's the perfect training ground. Plus he was probably instructed how to use the marker and all that briefly before entering the gate. So not completely unprepared.

As for Zach's motivations, Zorian had interacted with Zach before the loop and his character is consistent. He always was extroverted, friendly and optimistic. Another thing is that Zach mentioned that he had this feeling that he had to stop the invasion. Whether this is a mindfuck placed by RR or a remnant of his initial convictions that RR failed to completely erase is a question, but I think it's the latter.
