  Yes, Zach was indeed sent unprepared because SG is the preparation. It's the perfect training ground. Plus he was probably instructed how to use the marker and all that briefly before entering the gate. So not completely unprepared.

There's a break in the causal link in that case. If Zach was aware that he was going into a time loop and was taught how to operate it, he wouldn't be going around telling everyone about the time loop.

It seems more likely that a mind mage close to Zach (besides Tesen, who seems unlikely; maybe a teacher) noticed something and extracted everything.
