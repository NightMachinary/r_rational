Could Red Robe be one of the Creator's agents? It would explain his excessive knowledge of the intrinsics of the loop and his relation to Zach.\\
So instead of teaching him everything he just marks him and makes him take him along somehow before he deletes any memories of himself in Zach's mind and gives him that impossible quest of stopping the invasion.

Also, I'm thinking the Agents are human, part of some kind of cult like that of the Primordial. Gives you that whole Gods vs Primordials theme, too.
