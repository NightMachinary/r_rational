The moral element of the iteration length makes me think that the Maker is some kind of human, or at least was at one point, rather than a god. When I imagine someone thinking that much about the moral implications of time loops, I can only think of a well-meaning philosophical type. How much do we know about the nature of the gods in this universe? Were they cruel or benevolent?

Also, that final scene was everything that we could have ever hoped a Zach and Xvim meeting would be. Bravo, nobody103.
