Does it not bothers anyone that zorian might be a broken lesser marker that zach accidentally placed? Thats means that zorian might have a good chance of being wipe even if they managed to find all five keys and get out. Zorian marker is not complete. However theres one loophole in this time loop, which is memory transfer. Proven by the matriarch that memories and soul are link. if zach indeed left the time loop, maybe zorian could piggyback the same way the matriarch did.

"Some more variation of that question confirmed that the guardian had no idea when red robe left. /The Controller left, but didn't actually leave, and the guardian was hopelessly confused about the whole thing/" - Isn't this like a massive clue as to red robe identity?

It is stated throughout the questioning that there could only be one controller and yet red robe exist and was able to exit from the the time loop. This might be the biggest clue yet for the Dark Zach (Red-Robe) Theory. Whats more was that the Time loop iteration have a major deficit, perhaps the soul damage caused by the lich took dam long time to heal and for zach and Dark Zach might had recovered earlier than zach and zorian to learn the abilities of the time loop.

Meanwhile still itching for the world-building post. I super excited for it! God i love the world in the story!!
