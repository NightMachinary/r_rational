After rereading, I think you're right. The Guardian said that the marker can be placed by the Key, or by the Maker, or its agents. So the Key doesn't simply designate its holder as the Maker. It just allows them to "gain sufficient authorization to reopen the gate."

Perhaps the ability to un-bar the gate with the Key is a failsafe. We know that the Maker wisely included a lot of contingencies in the Guardian's design. Maybe the Key is meant for unforeseen contingencies, so that with enough effort, the Controller can still get out if something went wrong.

Given that the whole point of barring the Gate was to prevent smuggling of copies, I wonder whether the Guardian puts extra scrutiny on a Controller who is un-barring it. Eg checking whether their exit requires replacement of an original...that could become another challenge.
