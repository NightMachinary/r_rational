Yeah, my thought as well, but it's not very encouraging that their bodies were apparently in no condition to return after talking to the Guardian for less than an hour. If they want to use a black room there, they'll have to come up with a much better cover story than their current disguise they use to get in. I assume that any attempt to develop a black room on their own require too much in terms of time or resources to be practical, but I could be wrong.

It's good that the soul marker can help them find the pieces of the Key, but the four years thing still seems like it'll make things difficult, I don't think they'll be able to figure out who RR is while still inside the loop.
