True, but it would make it easier to sneak in/fight their way out or bargain their way into one if they're working together.

In regards to convincing authorities to let them use it, they are the Noveda heir and Daimen Kazinski's younger brother and their magical skills are suitably impressive. They could even offer to cover some of the operational costs.

Plus, if they go in together, they can both reap the benefits of an extra month of training. But I think Zach would get bored out of his mind and Zorian would get so annoyed with him that one of them would hit the reset switch. Optimal training scenario? Send Xvim in there with them, with a vast supply of marbles. Alternatively, Zorian and Xvim only.
