Actually, I think they can be shut down from the outside.

Implies that they can /now/ be shut down early, whether that means from the outside or inside, I'm not entirely sure. Either way, they'd still have to deal with people before entering and after leaving, and normally there's probably a years-long waiting list to reserve the usage of a black room, with a great deal of bureaucratic red tape. Basically, think of it as going to space on a government's official space shuttle, with less intensive physical training and tests. If they're going to forge their way into the usage of black room, they'd have to be pretty thorough. If they pull strings through official channels to use the rooms as themselves, that might actually be easier. If after spending a day/month inside the black room, there's a number of well armed guards waiting for them outside, things could get tricky, unless they decided to do a reset from there. Plus Zach and Zorian might not be able to stand each other for a whole month.
