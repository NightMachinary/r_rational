Can they figure RR at all?

If we assume RR is the passenger (Zach being the passenger is rather unlikely) then after RR exits the loop, his template is reset to the non-modified state. The person that became Red Robe is still in the loop, with his looping memory erased. He is not even missing, he is just a regular citizen. There is no physical evidence left in the simulation.

The only clue can be hidden inside Zach's mind. Huh, funny that Zach asked not to mess with his mind right in this chapter. I wonder if this is a coincide... BAH! I CALL FORESHADOWING!
