The loop isn't designed to keep going after the controller leaves, so I don't see why they'd include a mechanism to transplant any souls into the loop on gate-use.

Most likely possibilities are him getting a new soul each reboot or he's like the spiders.

It's pretty much undefined behavior thou, which could make things interesting.
