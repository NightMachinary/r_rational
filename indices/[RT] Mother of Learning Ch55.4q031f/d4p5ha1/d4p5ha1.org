So... An average restart lasted slightly longer than 11 days. Talk about wastefulness!

On the other hand, Zach's concern that he is not the original controller seems not really likely. I find it hard to believe that RR!controller would tolerate Zach!passenger if he resets /hundreds/ of restarts prematurely. RR tolerated Zach's recklessness with restarts because he had no other option. He had to mindwipe Zach's knowledge about the time loop.

The temporary marker could be the mechanism how Red Robe got into the loop. He had 6 months to prepare how to screw Zach over and elevate his marker somehow.
