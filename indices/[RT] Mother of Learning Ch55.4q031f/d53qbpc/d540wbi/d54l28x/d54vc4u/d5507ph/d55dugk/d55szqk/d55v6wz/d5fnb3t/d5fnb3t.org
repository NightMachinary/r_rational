Rereading our conversation, I realize I never explicitly stated the specific issue I had (sorry!):

Why Zach failed at the very first/basic shaping exercise (lifting the pen while avoiding the marble), the same one that Zorian failed on at the beginning, if he's competent enough in shaping.

Is concentration while shaping a different parameter for judging shaping competence? I don't see how Zach can be easily distracted by a marble when it implicates a weakness while in combat.
