Yes, but even before that, it seemed Zach was /so bad/ at shaping because he failed on the most basic exercise Xvim gave Zorian. I consequently assumed that higher mana reserves made Zach's shaping horrible, but it turned out not to be the case.

So regardless of whether Xvim has an omniscient sense of a mage's innate mana reserves, it felt weird that Zach would fail so early.
