By content-validity bias, I meant that some students have an inherent advantage over others, i.e. higher mana reserves preclude perfect shaping abilities, whereas mages with low mana reserves can eventually reach perfection (if they have the patience and/or talent).

The distinction I'm trying to make is: a test that's unfair because it always tests the student at one level above their current capability (failing because of current lack of ability) is different than a test that's unfair because it's impossible for the student to succeed past a certain point (failure because of innate limitation).

I feel like there's a chance we're both misunderstanding each other though. It just confused me because Zach basically failed at the very first item in Xvim's escalating test battery of hell.
