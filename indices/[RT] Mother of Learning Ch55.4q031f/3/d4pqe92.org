A bit of trivia.

In accordance to the Guardian's words, there's 967 past iterations and 52 future ones. For the sake of neatness, I will presume it didn't count the current one. That makes 1020 iterations in total, which equals to exactly 85 Earthly years.

Now, Shutur-Tarana, possibly the first time traveler, supposedly spent eleven lifetimes looping.^{ch.33} If we assume that 85 years is 'a lifetime', planar alignment amplifies dimensional magic by a factor of eleven, at minimum. No wonder Quatach-Ichl deemed it a great time to summon an eldritch abomination from beyond.

I wonder, does anyone else have any plans for the occasion? It'll be a great shame if such an event would benefit only a bunch of terrorists.
