Here's a plan:

1. Be a lich.

2. Make a pocket dimension.(Smaller than a world I would assume)

3. Evacuate everyone in the world into it. (put them in a well of souls for compact storage & not needing food)

4. Detach the new pocket before the loop ends.

5. Take your sweet time while you figure out how to connect to other dimensions.

6. Spelljammer!

Who says we need to leave by the front door to leave?
