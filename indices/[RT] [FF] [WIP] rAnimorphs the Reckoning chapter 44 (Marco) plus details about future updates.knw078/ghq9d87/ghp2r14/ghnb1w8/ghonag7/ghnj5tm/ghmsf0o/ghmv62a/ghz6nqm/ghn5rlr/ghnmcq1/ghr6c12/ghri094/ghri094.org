In terms of what separates Rachel from the others, the main thing I can think of is that she was in a hypersight moment with Erek and the rest of the Chee. As to why that would make them /more/ willing and able to hand weapons to her than Tobias ????

Checking chapters with Chee stuff to see if I missed anything. Nothing directly relevant to this but...

  â€œYes. It had been the Howlers' first move, as it turned out---they'd seeded the atmosphere with a plague that took weeks to incubate.

  The refresh cycle sweeps past once more, and we yield to it like grass beneath a mower's blade, handing ourselves to the Chee two-forward and receiving ourselves back a moment later.

I've missed this until now. The refresh cycle goes through the Chee one at a time and presumably wipes them, and the Chee are bypassing that by +passing a copy of themselves two ahead then taking themselves back once the cycle has passed them+ bipassing. Are the refresh cycle and censor two different things? And why would the Chee need to be wiped that often? And who makes friends and also sets them up to have their memories wiped frequently?
