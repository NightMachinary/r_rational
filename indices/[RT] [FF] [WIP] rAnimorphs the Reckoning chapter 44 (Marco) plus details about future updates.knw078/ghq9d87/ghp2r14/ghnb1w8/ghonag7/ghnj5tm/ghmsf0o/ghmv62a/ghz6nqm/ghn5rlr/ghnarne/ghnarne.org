Upvoted, but I've had this concern raised before, and I disagree.

Five years from now, COVID-19 will be part of the fabric of history in /exactly/ the same fashion as 9/11; people would have objected (in 2002) to a 9/11 mention but today take it completely in stride, and indeed today would consider it weird if a vaguely-present-or-near-future story did /not/ have 9/11 sort of baked into its past.

I get that this is a cost I'll be paying in the moment (I am not dismissing your loss of immersion), but I strongly believe it's the right cost to pay, and that this will be the better way to go in the long run, esp. since the fic has been roughly pinned down to the late 2020's by a few little bits of data here and there (a day of the week given a specific date, Mattis referred to as the former Secretary of Defense, etc). This universe's Marco lived through it as a small child, and was hearing about it all throughout elementary and middle school; it's absolutely "the sort of thing he would think of when trying to put a weight on a large number of deaths."
