I think you should remove the mention of COVID-19 and keep the timeline vaguely specified. It takes away from the story by how COVID was never mentioned before, and still has unforeseeable consequences in the real world, so it might diverge from in-universe.

The timeline can not be before 2020, and it can not be during 2020 or 2021, so it must be much later - but then if it plays out differently in real life you just have a weird alternative timeline trivia thing for no useful reason.

The line just felt jarring and broke my immersion completely.
