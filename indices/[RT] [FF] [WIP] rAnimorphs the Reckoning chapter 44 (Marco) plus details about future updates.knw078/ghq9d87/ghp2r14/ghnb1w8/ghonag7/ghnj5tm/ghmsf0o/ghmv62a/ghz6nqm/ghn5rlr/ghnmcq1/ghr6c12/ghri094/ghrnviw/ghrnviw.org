Can't go through to find citations now but my general sense from the story is that the Chee are probably exploiting the heck out of everything they see fit to munchkin in their programming. Cf the Rachel thing and the cycle thing you mention and the bit where Erek dances around what one of the Chee did to commit violence against the Howlers, as far as stuff I can think of without rereading the story.
