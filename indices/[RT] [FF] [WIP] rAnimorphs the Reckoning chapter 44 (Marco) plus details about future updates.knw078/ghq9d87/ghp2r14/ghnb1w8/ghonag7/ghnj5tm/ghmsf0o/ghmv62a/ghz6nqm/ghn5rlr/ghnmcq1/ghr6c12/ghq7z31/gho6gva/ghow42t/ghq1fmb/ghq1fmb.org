I interpret it as seeing someone else morph back. Even then, they wouldn't necessarily wait two hours for it to happen unless they know more about the morphing tech than they'd get just from that. I dunno though, maybe a few of them were just patient.

  It sounds not so clever to morph an acquired one.

Do you have a specific worry here, or just general paranoia? (Which is well-justified, of course.)

Seems like it could also be really useful. In canon it was basically an instant win against them. I'm not sure TK would make things that easy, but even just being able to read their collective memory would be good, and I think you could do that without giving the host any sensory or other input that would be useful to them. Maybe feed them false info? And of course a howler body would be great in a fight, though that's not necessarily the animorphs' most pressing concern these days.
