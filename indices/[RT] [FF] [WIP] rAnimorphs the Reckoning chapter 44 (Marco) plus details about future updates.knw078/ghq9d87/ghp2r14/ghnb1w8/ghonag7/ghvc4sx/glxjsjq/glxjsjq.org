I dunno, I mean it's one thing to be like "the power of love overwhelmed them," but of all creatures that might be maximally distractible by hedonistic pleasure seeking through kissing instead of killing, it kind of makes sense for them.

Of course the real (horrifying) outcome is likely to just be that they start mixing killing /and/ kissing, but yeah.
