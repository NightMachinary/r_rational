I got the impression that Marco Prime was going to do a noble sacrifice and die in the blast on my first read, but on a second run through it's a bit more ambiguous. It says the bomb will destroy everything in the stadium, and ‘wreck' a half-mile radius. Is the goose fast enough to get to a point where the explosion will ‘only' kill and not vaporise the bird body? In any other work of fiction, I'd say this is a textbook heroic sacrifice, but if there's a character that would mercy kill a stadium with a mini nuke and try to outrun the blast, it's r!Marco, who is not in the habit of needless sacrifice, especially when this Marco is also 25% of Visser 1. On the other hand, the narration doesn't give hints that he's trying to survive, which is why I missed it the first time, and he might not have thought out the possibility of survival, seeing as it didn't occur to the other 2 that died this chapter.
