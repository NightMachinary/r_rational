/I had thought-speak./

/I held the image of the alien invaders in my mind---the cracked skin, the pinched torso, the unearthly howl---/

/‹EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE---›/

I'm really glad this happened even though it didn't work, and serves them right.

/Jake looked up as I entered the bridge, and I swear I actually stumbled./

/He looked---/

/Old./

/Weathered.  Cold.  Like---like Stonehenge, or dinosaur bones, or something---old enough that all the soft parts had eroded away, and what was left would last for ten thousand years./

Spoiler for Animorphs canon that is possibly relevant to The Reckoning's next chapters:

I have a bit more appreciation now for Crayak's fear and rage toward Jake for being able to tap into the howlers' collective memory and already being too calloused to really be affected by it, while his own capacity for love causes significant shift in them. And he doesn't just give them a desire to kiss either, since Edriss is arguably the most loathsome mortal character in the series and she loves being in love. Sorry if I'm digressing too much, I just found the description of the howlers' rampage and the Marclones' frustration impactful.
