Morphing tech is a relatively new invention, remember.

According to r!Animorphs canon, when the meteor hit in Ventura, the "gate" that brings Cassie's original body back from the pocket dimension (the nanotechnology that swims around in the Animorphs' bloodstreams) was fully destroyed. Like, if you shoot the morph body, the nanotechnology is still fine. But if you /vaporize/ the body, the nanotechnology is gone, too.
