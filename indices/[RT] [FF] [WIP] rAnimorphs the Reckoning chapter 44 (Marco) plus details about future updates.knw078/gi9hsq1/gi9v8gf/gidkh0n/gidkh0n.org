Ouch at the caveat, fair though.

The good news, survival wise, is that I know what genre this is. This is Dragon Ball Z; Feeza's army is invading a new planet, and I am one of the nameless background characters that gets blown up to show how evil the villains are. I think I'd know the only goal I can pursue here is run and hide. Hopefully story!me and Marco set up some hidey holes as a fallback. If not find a cave. Right now what I would really want is a place that's too small for humans to actually enter. Air flow would be an issue, but if I take the other people into a morph with me, we could hide in places the invaders might not even bother to look.

I've actually been thinking about story!me's survival chances a bit, though much of that is somewhat tainted by the fact IRL!me has read the story. I can't forget facts I already know and then figure out how I would react with that lesser knowledge; at least not easily. One mistake I think I'd make early one is wanting to be more active at night, darkness is after all good for hiding and even though I'll notice the aliens all leave during the day I'd probably assume they were still watching from orbit or something.

One thing I noticed though, fully stepping back into the reader role. This whole story, with it's chess match between the gods and their simulated worlds. In a way it makes things like expected value a much more intuitive thing. There are some worlds where story!me lives and some where he dies, and the gods simulations mean that many of these worlds are real to a degree. Only one is instantiated based on the moves that the players make, and those moves are probably independent of an action story!me might choose to make (well there was that chapter where Ellimist does things like altering wind speed to send someone back for their coat, but most people don't get even that level of interest). Instead of saying things like, "I'll do this and then the result will be that and I get to live." One would have to think in terms of general strategies. If I behave in certain ways then the share of worlds where I survive will increase or decrease. The goal then is to find the strategy that would increase the survival chances the most and then the only thing to do is hope the gods pick one of those worlds as the one to actually happen.
