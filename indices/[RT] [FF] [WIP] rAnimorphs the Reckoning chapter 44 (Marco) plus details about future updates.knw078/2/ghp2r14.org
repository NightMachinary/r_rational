"/Hmm, the smooth, dangerous ships pouring across the bridge, it almost feels like/-"

Thousand-yard stare, flashback to the Rachel chapter

".../it would be really, really bad if these were Howlers/."

Grisly, shocking, nightmarish. This is the most horrifying chapter I've read - probably of anything - in memory.

Incredibly compelling stuff, as always. Couldn't tear myself away, as always. Great way to ring in the new year.

Completely did not even consider that the Howler icon V3 downloaded from the big sky computer came complete with, like, brains and guts and stuff. Here I assumed it was just a hollow 3D model like you'd see in a video game - just a statue of a Howler. Hmm, knowing now that the model was a little more detailed, I wonder why the Visser didn't already have notes on Howler strengths and weaknesses - not even in like an "oh yeah I remember now, the anuses are behind the knees" type of way. I guess he just never thought he'd encounter one in battle, so it didn't hook his curiosity beyond the obvious 5G brain stuff.

Also, MAN was that ever satisfying to read. Like, unholy amounts of terrifying, seeing how vast and powerful the Visser has become, but so much fun to experience. It really, really captured what (I assume) it would actually be like to have 200k instances of yourself, and grand, sweeping control over all of them. Is there anything left that can and would take him out besides a quantum virus or the literal Care Bears convincing him to be friends with everyone?

I'm so pumped that we might actually, really, for realziez be in the actual for-real home stretch now.

P.S. I've been toying with the idea of doing a sort of "Annotated r!Animorphs" - like, a chapter-by-chapter document with little footnotes and highlights and things, like a spoilery guide for people going back through, drawing specific attention to puzzles that got solved later or spelling out things that only got implied in the text. I feel like it would help me personally to keep the trillion threads organized in my head, and could be useful as a refresher or reference material or whatever. Definitely not for first-time readers. Obviously it would take some time to produce and could use other eyes for input as well. Would anyone be interested in this?
