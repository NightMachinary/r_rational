In general, any place where the global response to the Yeerk invasion is being talked about is a potential candidate. The pandemic would still be fresh in the minds of many, so people would be quick to compare the varied and disparate geopolitical responses to the invasion as being like covid all over again, but also way worse because the enemy actually /is/ a sentient and silent invader this time around.

As for specific spots, one place could be in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/19139185][Reddit interlude right after the bug fighter crash]]. Some users there comment on things they should buy/loot from the store, and it would be an easy place for someone to snark about or otherwise compare things to the runs on grocery stores during the start of global lockdowns. "Don't forget to buy up all the toilet paper!"

Any place where the Ventura death toll is being compared in terms of 9/11's or world wars is a sensible spot too.
