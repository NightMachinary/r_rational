So I've been scouring the fic for clues about what time of year it is, and everything seems indicate that this chapter takes place pretty close to Halloween/day of the dead.

(Than's warning in chapter 30, timestamped by Esplin's chapter immediately prior and Marco's claim a few chapters later that late June was a few weeks away, along the fact that the pool ship was blown up on the 7th of October.)

That's a nice touch if true, but with that in mind, Thule air force base in Greenland is just about the worst possible place to headquarter the human resistance during a Howler invasion. [[https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/greenland/thule-air-base][Time and Date]]'s sunlight chart tells us that the sun sets on October 30th in Thule, and doesn't rise again until February 10th. They have 24 hours of night. If I were President Tyagi, I'd relocate to the South pole. No doubt they already have significant infrastructure in place left over from building the true ark.
