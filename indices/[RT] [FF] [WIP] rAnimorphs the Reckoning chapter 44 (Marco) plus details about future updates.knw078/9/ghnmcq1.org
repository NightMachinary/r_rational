Helllll yes, it's back! Now taking bets as to whether this fic will actually finish before 2022! (Just kidding, we love you TK17... but yeah)

Love the worldwide Marco POVs - makes everything very epic.

The beast from the off-world excursion has finally made its reappearance - and it's not enough!

The howlers are terrifying villains, and I love how the Animorphs are being forced into a scenario in which they have the option of teaming up with Visser 3 (probably still a terrible idea, though). Also love how Visser 3 is getting a chance to go all-out with his fighting. He's burning through all his tricks, which may even the playing field for later on and give the Animorphs a decent shot at taking him out (especially when Tobias shows up again from wherever he is with the Puppyship. Hopefully he's watching the Mars base and seeing how V3 makes the quantum virus so he can replicate it somehow).

Okay, so given that Cassie is listed as one of the future chapters, I suspect she might have survived the Ventura explosion. It would have taken out her morph body, leaving her awake in the morph emulation, where she could demorph after a delay. I suspected this a long time ago, in fact, but I wasn't sure whether this was plausible (she might have been rendered unconscious in the morph emulation and died as the Z-space machinery collapsed, or might have been forced to demorph into an ongoing fireball where she would have died in her body). It still might not be plausible - maybe the chapter is a Cassie clone from somewhere, or something else.

Oh yeah, and I never commented on the last chapter because I was busy, but that was great too! Still don't know what's up with Rachel or the whole time-travel thing.

Very excited for the ending!

Happy New Years everyone!
