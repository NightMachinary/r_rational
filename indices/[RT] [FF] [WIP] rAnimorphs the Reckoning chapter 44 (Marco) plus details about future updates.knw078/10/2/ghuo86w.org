  why the Chee can't model Rachel?
#+end_quote

I wonder if we're overthinking this. The two bits of evidence for this are that they call her "the female" instead of her name in the first interlude, and that they give her the weapons despite Erek seeing her kill V3's remote body at the high school. (And I guess indirectly the fact that she's "not suppose to be there".) Both can be explained by Erek deliberately thinking a violent thought right after the hypersight event, so the Censor would wipe his mind before information about Rachel could be shared with the group.

Are there other examples of the Chee not understanding Rachel besides those two?
