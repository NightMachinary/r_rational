I would say that I do also expect that it would be very hard to exploit a lot of their programming, since we don't see them e.g. commit violence very often, but to stick with violence as the example, we have at least one example of a Chee seeming to do it (during the Howler attack on the Pemalites.) Basically I would expect that even if the Pemalites are significantly better programmers than we are, a computer bug which is relevant once in a million years is going to be noticed by sentient robots who have million year life spans and can engage in the sort of analysis we see them do in four seconds.

I may be wrong and maybe the Pemalites were more nuanced in how they chose to design the Chee. The story isn't over yet and I may be misremembering some bits.
