I love where you are going with this line of thinking, but on the other hand if you're going for posterity, no one says "one month of spanish flu" right? They say "the spanish flu" and the total dead.

It makes sense to say "one month of covid" to us right now, but pandemics after they are over are viewed as discrete events, with a kill count. (Granted, your average readership might not be /that/ far in the future that covid will be like the spanish flu)
