I think you have the idea right, but not the motive.

For some reason, the Howlers regard this group of people as valuable. We don't know why, and Marco doesn't know why, but if something is valuable to an enemy, there may be tactical benefit in denying it to them.

They may be holding these people for ransom, or for interrogation, or to preserve a breeding population, or maybe just for sport. Rescue would obviously be the preferable option, but if that's not possible (and it doesn't currently seem to be), then Marco's action is his only way of denying the Howlers whatever benefit they're planning to get from the people.

If it turns out they were hosting a peace accord between Howlers and humans in that stadium, then I'm sure that Marco will feel horrible about that decision. That, or anything similarly benign, seems like a low-probability guess, though.
