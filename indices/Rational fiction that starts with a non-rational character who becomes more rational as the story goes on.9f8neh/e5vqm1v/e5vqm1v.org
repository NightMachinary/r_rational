The closest I have seen is "Everbody loves large chests." It's a story about a mimic that slowly gains sapience. I'm not sure if it fully qualifies as a rational story, though it does feel fairly rational adjacent.

Note: It starts out with a lot of erotic stuff, but that generally falls away in the later chapters. I think it was originally intended to be a one off smut story that gained a life of its own, which is all sorts of meta.
