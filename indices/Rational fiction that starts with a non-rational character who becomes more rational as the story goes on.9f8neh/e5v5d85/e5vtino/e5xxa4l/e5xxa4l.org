It's fairly tame if you ask; me lime not lemon (I might have those two mixed up whichever used to be the fanfiction for softcore/R), some extreme power exchange elements, which is often a hard stop for people, but at least one very well reasoned rational argument for poly between working professionals that I honestly admire and need to spend the time capital to make a rent paying part of my psyche.

TLDR: there are godlike character re-enacting bulfinch's mythology, but they do a better job of being good people than Zeus and Hera, also there are some power exchange elements people find squicky, but make sense for the characters; I personally want to implement something in here into my psyche, its more mature and rational than what I was raised with (an old protestant upbringing, 1st career military, 2nd carrer software male) , but It's counter to my inculcation and hard.
