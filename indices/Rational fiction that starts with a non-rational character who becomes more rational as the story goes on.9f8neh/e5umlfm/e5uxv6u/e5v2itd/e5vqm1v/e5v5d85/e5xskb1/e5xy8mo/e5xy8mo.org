um. . . Doesnt harry go from talking the talk to /trying/ to walk the walk against a sufficiently prepared antagonist, who as a /Diabolis ex machina/ forces him to *really honestly try to walk the walk*, but win's anyways because of creative use of a technological/magical advantage that's basically a 4-5 sigma event even being on his tech tree?

The "solution" was a fair cop for a solvable mystery, but we could argue for months about if it was a realistic solution to various outside context problems, as well as who the actual actors are in the conflict considering the presence of oracles and long dead actors.

TLDR: I think I didn't spoil anything: If you haven't read HPMOR I'm either: arguing or being a pendant, about who is rational in HPMOR: go read it, then come back to this discussion. If you do so, please "@" me because otherwise I'll never see it: it's a long book, but worth it.
