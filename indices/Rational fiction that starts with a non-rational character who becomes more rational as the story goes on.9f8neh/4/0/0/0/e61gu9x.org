Eh. Time loop is not a new innovation. MoL has a whole new world, a whole new magic system, completely different characters, races, creatures... It's definitely not just reskinned narutofic. :D But intelligent use of time loop obviously contains training to get strong if you have such time.

MoL is written way better and it's not porn.

I read Time Braid ages ago, but I've now been reading a bit again because of this thread. I don't really like it too much anymore. I do love time loops in general, though.
