If you don't mind some erotic stuff, including some non-con and brainwashing, then I'd reccomend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid]]

A naruto fic in which Sakura suddenly finds herself in a time-loop right before the forest of death chunin exam. She starts off as pretty close to show Sakura, depending on naruto and sasuke, blah blah blah, but that quickly doesn't work anymore for her and she grows from there. I don't know if she gets more /rational/ per say, as she starts off smart even in the show, but she /Acts/ more rationally as time goes on.
