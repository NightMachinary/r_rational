So I ended up finishing this in a rush in order to meet the opening of the challenge. I'd appreciate criticism of the story as it stands, and whether people think it is worthwhile extending it.

The ending would probably still be the same, it would just be a bit more of a journey to get there. Alternatively, the ending could be more positive, with the current ending narrowly averted.
