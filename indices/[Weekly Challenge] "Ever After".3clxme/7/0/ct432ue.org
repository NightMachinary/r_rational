Right. Some corrections to use of English, I haven't tried to touch the story content:

- "they come with three ships" should probably be "they came with three ships" - past tense rather than present
- RDA should be "Research Development Administration" - one S in Research and one P in Development.
- "worked on the bridge" -> "was working on the bridge"
- Equally "checks" -> "was checking"
- "ceases" -> "ceased"
- "some random value" -> "a random value"
- "antenna listens" -> "antenna listened" or "antenna was listening" - in fact, it might be a good idea to go back through and check the tense of all of the verbs, as otherwise listing them all here will swamp other advice.
- Speech in English text encloses each sentence in double quotes "like so" rather than enclosing the entire conversation in one set and separating lines with -. Attributing sentences to the speaker often helps, even with just a "said Wade". More helpfully, you could use the attribution to tell us something like Wade's rank.
- "are bigger" -> "is bigger" - "the probability" is a singular phrase so we use the singular form of "to be".
- "So you record it?" -> "So you're recording it?"
- "tick fluid" -> "thick fluid"
- "Classical question" -> "Classic question"
- "I try to summary what you have said" -> "I'll try to summarise what you've said" (possibly "what you've told me")
- "lighted a hologram" -> "lit a hologram" (or possibly "turned on a hologram")
- "How do they have completely industrialized Pandora in two decades?" -> "How have they completely industrialized Pandora in two decades?"
- "SETI had never detected anything" -> "SETI never detected anything"
- "Do you have heard of" -> "Have you heard of"
- "Whatever the conclusion will be" -> "Whatever the conclusion was" - this looks like it should be future tense, but past tense is more correct
