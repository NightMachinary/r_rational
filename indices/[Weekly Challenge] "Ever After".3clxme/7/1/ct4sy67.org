#+begin_quote
  Speech in English text encloses each sentence in double quotes "like so" rather than enclosing the entire conversation in one set and separating lines with -
#+end_quote

Riffing off something that [[/u/fortycakes]] said in his comment, here's some rules about punctuating dialogue in English.

- Double quotes around the spoken part.
- There is always punctuation inside the closing quote.
- If you are going to have a dialogue tag (e.g. 'said Bob', or 'Bob said') after the dialogue, one of these is immediately inside the close quote: ? ! ,

All of these are correct:

- "Tom always loved you."
- "Tom always loved you," Bob said.
- "Tom always loved you," said Bob.
- "Tom always loved you!" said Bob.
- "Tom always loved you?" said Bob.

This one is NOT correct:

- "Tom always loved you." said Bob.
