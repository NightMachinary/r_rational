Thanks so much for the feedback! To answer your question, my inspiration for this was was two main things. The first is the conversations I've had with people who have very strong opinions on absurdly complicated political issues that they haven't even given much real thought to. The second was just that I thought it would be funny to portray a rational version of certain fantasy tropes, especially the heroic power fantasy ones. Oh and the evil orc bit was almost completely lifted off /The Sword of Good/.

I definitely agree with you on the intro; rereading it, it feels very disjointed from the rest. It definitely needs a rewriting in a way that ties into the epilogue. See, this was /supposed/ to be a sample from her memoirs, but next to nothing in the writing actually suggests/evokes that. Which I think explains some about why the epilogue, particularly the fourth wall breaking moment, feels so off. I think the story would benefit hugely from an intro rewrite.

I fixed the spelling and "it's/its" is the bane of my existence, thanks for pointing that out! And I completely forgot about the royal/imperial distinction, thanks again!

I didn't even realize it was my cake day, that's cool! And yeah, your comment was super helpful! When I get the time, I'll rewrite the intro completely and make some changes to the epilogue. If she survives the intro rewrite, the intro character might get merged with the epilogue character to make characterization easier/better.
