I like the idea. It reminds me a lot of /The Sword Of Good/ - taking a D&D murder-hobo protagonist and dropping them into a world where actions have consequences and the NPCs are people too. Was that your inspiration?

The main scene was excellent. The new emperor was funny and memorable, and the narrator makes a fine straight-man to emphasise his wacky blockheadedness. The old emperor is also a cool character. I think the introduction and the epilogue could have been folded into this scene more neatly; [[/u/alexanderwales]] has talked about the importance of beginning and ending on a strong point, and here your middle is easily the best part. All the best characterisation and humour is between Carillion, Ferion, and the narrator - the two other speakers aren't interesting enough, there's no sparks flying between them and any other characters.

The way the narration uses informal language makes a nice contrast between the way the narrator talks in his head and the affected style he uses out loud. I think you've overdone this a bit - "Sigh." is not a sentence, and breaking the fourth wall by saying "my dear reader" should only be done for comedy purposes. I think the dramatic moment where the main character decides to become the Cold Traitor (whatever that means) really suffers from this, because he doesn't come across as serious or angry - just bored and jokey.

And there's a couple of mistakes and stylistic quirks that distract from the story. "Plyable" should be "pliable". If you correct "kingdom" to "empire", you should also change "royal" to "imperial" throughout. Magical essence is usually spelled "mana", not "manna". The first "its" needs an apostrophe. Minor things like that.

Hope this was helpful to you. Happy 4th Reddit anniversary!
