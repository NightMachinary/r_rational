Ehh, it is much better that way. It actually absolutely sucks. It has done a lot of good, having spawned so much relevant fanfics and stories.. But so much bad too, as many of those copied it way too closely. I absolutely hate "observe", for example.

What is really funny is that I just watched a Korean movie "Resurrection of little match girl" which had some kind of a gamer system and a pro gaming scene was an element there. And it is from two decades ago... And it was not a small one. It was made for four years and it qas the most expensive Korean movie that far. Copied some Matrix stuff too, like the bullet dodging scene. :D It did not explain literally any of the system, though. There just were stats running in the screen every now and then when he leveled up and stuff.
