Great as usual, and I love that Ram still isn't backing down and taking it, even though he's now with the people supposedly 'on his side.' One note:

#+begin_quote
  Shimrun paused his story, looking at Ram. “I'm sorry, I don't understand. What mistake?”
#+end_quote

This section reads a little bit like Shimrun is the one who doesn't understand, which confused me for a moment. Might flow better if Ram speaks first, then Shimrun pauses on a separate line?
