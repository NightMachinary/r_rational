I agree, but that's not exactly what I meant. I meant that in the confines of this story, Rey doesn't feel as a character with an independent agency as much as an obedient listener for +Snokes+ Snoke^{1} to monologue at. She should be actively suspicious of Snoke and his theory, it should be reflected in her thoughts, she should try to pick holes in his theory by shooting back pointed questions at him, etc. There should be more doubt in her thoughts, and less genuine reaction at Snoke's surface-level statements.

I feel that Rey is too quick to stop seeing the unrepentant mass murderer^{2} as an enemy who is potentially trying to manipulate her, and start seeing him as a conversation partner.

*tl;dr:* Narrative/characterization problem, not plot problem.

^{1. Wait, is the Sith Lord's name actually "Snoke"? Oops.}

^{2. He /is/ a mass murderer, right? I'm not actually sure, I didn't see /The Force Awakens/.}
