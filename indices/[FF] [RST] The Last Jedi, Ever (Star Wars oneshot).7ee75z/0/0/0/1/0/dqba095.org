I like your idea.

Yes, invoking [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html][epistemic learned helplessness]] is the correct choice... in some situations. Namely, in situations where you can't test the other's argument against reality at all, or where the enemy's relative intelligence is much higher than yours. Neither is the case with Snoke: he isn't literally superintelligent, and he is unlikely to mindhack a paranoid Rey into believing whatever he says before she cross-checks it with other Jedi/specialists. Additionally, she /did/ beat him, so he probably can't utter any killer-sentences at her, lest he would have done it already (unless that's what he wants her to think, but if we're assuming that, we may as well assume he is superintelligent and unbeatable).

Of course, the story's Rey /wasn't/ being properly paranoid, judging by her thoughts, which is what I complained about.
