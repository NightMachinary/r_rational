Hm. Now I have a mental image of the wills/desires/ambitions/goals of the previous dead, even if not able to 'manifest' themselves (maybe even those who can can only do that for a short time after death?), as left behind driving events, like 'Fate' in Erfworld; here, maybe the huge numbers of Light-Side Jedi who cared so much about the entire galaxy go into keeping most things happy (and without much future shock...), whereas all the ambitions-for-the-Sith feelings make the last Sith at any given time effectively unkillable.

The 'conservation of ninjutsu' concept comes to mind as a competing hypothesis (for how one Sith could so-consistently survive), but probably doesn't hold up to observed trends (in battle prowess). One Sith of two isn't particularly stronger than any given Jedi, but killing the /last/ Sith--or the last Jedi, for that matter--is something which never happened until... hmm. I don't actually know why a Master and Apprentice achieving a double-knockout never happened before. I don't know much about the extended canon, was there a canonical third/fourth Sith to survive after the movies' all died?

(That would make that rule about only-two make much more sense. That said, tricks can still overcome personal power, though trickery ability can still be viewed as a form of power, though then you get rock-paper-scissors cycling...)

It's fun to imagine people stumbling across old Sith holocrons (or similar) being affected by death Sith people's ambitions that their life's work (recorded in such holocrons) be used gloriously by future Sith.
