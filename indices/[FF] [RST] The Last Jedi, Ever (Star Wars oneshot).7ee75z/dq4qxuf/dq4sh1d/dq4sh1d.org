  I feel that Rey was way too fast in starting to listen to Snokes, who, as she herself noted, is a capable liar and manipulator who is probably also evil and/or insane. She doesn't at all antagonize him even when he starts asking her random questions, doesn't act suspicious when he presents her with this suspiciously convenient theory. That's the story's main flaw, in my opinion.

In defense of Rey in this story, a problem doesn't become less of a problem just because you dislike the source of information. Snoke does point of valid concerns with the state of the galaxy, and it is sensible to look into those. That does not necessarily mean agreeing with his conclusion. It is quite possible that after looking into matters more closely Rey does decide that the Force is good and should be left as it is.

Because, yes, it is a suspicious theory, but I don't see Rey accepting it. I see Rey accepting that there are things that need to be explained by a theory, and that what Snoke presented is currently the best theory she has. Which would still mean going off to poke holes in the theory and trying to find a better theory. Because science.

Also, Snoke is totally still alive. "Oh, leave me to die without watching, surely I am beyond help at this point! Woe is me!" Yeeeeaaahhh... no.
