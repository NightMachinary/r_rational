That's a good point, but then it leads to the question why Snoke didn't mention the holotron before their fight.

Still, I think we agree that Rey trusted the words of Snoke "Dark McDarkson" to easily. I could say maybe she's intentionally being written as over-confident, but then she's not really a rationalist protag then. Also

This doesn't necessarily stop your argument, but I think she's literally supposed to be the last Jedi alive here. The author might be able to tell me whether I'm wrong here? Still, I'm sure other force-sensitives or the writings of past Force users could be used to cross-check.

Never heard of the term "epistemic learned helplessness" before (I'm more a casual lurker of the rationalist community than a part of the community myself, per se). Pretty cool article.
