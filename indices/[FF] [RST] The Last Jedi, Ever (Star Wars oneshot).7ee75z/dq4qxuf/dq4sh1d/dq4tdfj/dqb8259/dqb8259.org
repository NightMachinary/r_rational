I mean, arguably, when you're talking to a master of evil who is a known liar and seducer of hearts, the rational thing is to /cut off his head before he speaks/, because when talking to a charismatic conman, his words are just as dangerous a weapon as his Force lightning.

A way to fix this would be to have Rey be chasing him down, and he can call out his speech while she's following him, so she's forced to listen. Then the speech can end with her cornering him, and having already heard so much, she lets him finish.
