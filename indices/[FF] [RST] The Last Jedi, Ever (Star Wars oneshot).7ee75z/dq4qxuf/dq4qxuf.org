Interesting. /Star Wars/' Force is has potential for so many horror-inducing explanations, isn't it? [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5848177][Relevant]].

  Without the Force, their worst instincts would not guide their destiny. People would not stay in the same ruts of thought they always have, too scared to take the leap to save themselves. Simply remove that pressure, and the galaxy is saved from itself.

... and then is promptly devoured by CC-R2O2 the random droid, who gets bootstrapped into godhood in the first several seconds of the Force's nonexistence. Wait, no. Maybe it's actually going to be several god-droids scattered across the galaxy, who'll start an eternal war between ourselves (alright, not eternal, a few megayears). That would be fun.

The bottom line is, every improvement is a change, but not every change is an improvement; when it comes to humans, /the overwhelming majority/ of changes aren't improvements. The Force locked the galaxy in a local maximum of utility, so to say, and its removal would've potentially allowed the sentients' civilizations to move in the direction of a global maximum in the long-term, but was Snokes confident/did he try to ensure that they wouldn't fall down into a global minimum instead? Forget the problem of ASIs' utility functions; if not for the Force, who is going to stop idiots from ramming their spacecrafts into planets at relativistic speeds in acts of war? Who is going to stop corporations from taking over the universe and replacing nearhumanbaselines with obedient droids? Who is going to be preventing [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Moloch]]'s absolute victory? Who would stop omnicides caused by military research, who would contain grey goo outbreaks? Lord Snokes, you're lost in the sea of grand ambitions, in delusions of grandeur; you're a master of the Dark Side, but you fail to look into humanity's darkness^{1}. The Force is an agent of /good/. It doesn't stop us from winning, it prevents us from killing ourselves! It is responsible for the suffering and deaths of trillions, yes, but */we're still alive solely because of it!/*

/^{Okay, okay, I'll stop it.}/

... Yes, definitely a very interesting idea.

Regarding the critique, [[/u/EthanCC][u/EthanCC]]^{2}, I feel that Rey was way too fast in starting to listen to Snokes, who, as she herself noted, is a capable liar and manipulator who is probably also evil and/or insane. She doesn't at all antagonize him even when he starts asking her random questions, doesn't act suspicious when he presents her with this suspiciously convenient theory. That's the story's main flaw, in my opinion.

*Edit:* Someone in the thread mentioned that one "Darth Traya" had similar views. I went to the wiki to check, and, well, [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Traya#Teachings][turns out]] she is basically a ratific protagonist already.
