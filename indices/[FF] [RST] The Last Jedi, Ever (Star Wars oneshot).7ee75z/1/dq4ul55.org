Minor plural/singular correction: 'massacred the colonist' -> 'massacred the colonists'

Incidentally, if I were in that position, I would be /incredibly suspicious/ of a request to die alone. Even if circumstances gave me no choice--though actually, /especially/ if potentially-manipulatable circumstances gave me no choice--and even if I saw a body afterwards, the concept sets off loud warning bells. Particularly, with that level of galaxy-wide consideration--going against the Force's mind-suppression itself--to actually want that 'dignity' over the sincerity otherwise shown prompts... doubt.

Or, to rephrase it semi-humourously:

"I've just killed lots of people! This was a demonstration, even though various people have done various things just like it many times before! However, because you've come here, I have the opportunity to pass my life's work on to you! Take this holocron. It will train you, prepare you according to my plans and predictions, turning you into a willing tool to carry out the actions I want to see in the galaxy. Now, I will soon die. Please go somewhere else and leave me alone, while I... uh... /don't/ fake my own death with another secret Force or technological technique, watching from one of my many secret lairs as a nefarious puppetmaster. No, honest, I'm really going to die. Well, no, not while you're /watching/ I can't! Look the other way, shoo!"
