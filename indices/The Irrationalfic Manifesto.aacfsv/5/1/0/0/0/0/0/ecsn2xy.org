But in this case I'm specifically harkening back to EY's definition of the term (since he invented it, I'd say it has precedence):

#+begin_quote
  step one towards a more intelligent Thorin is just to have Thorin behave like there is a person inside him figuring out the best thing to do, like you or I would in his shoes, as opposed to an H-Zombie who throws down the key in order to provide Bilbo with a Dramatic Moment.

Basically his concept of Level 1 Intelligent doesn't imply anything about the character's IQ, it just means /they're acting like people/. Smart people, stupid people, whatever, but they are the protagonists of their own story and act in consequence rather than doing things that only serve the purposes of the grander plot, and of the actual main character.
