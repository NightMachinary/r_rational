I never felt like a character acting stupid is intrinsically "non rational". I /try/ to write rational fic, but if a character is an idiot, they're going to do idiotic things. It's consistent. The problem is an otherwise smart character suddenly falling prey to debilitating stupidity when the plot demands it; not the stupidity, but the /inconsistency/. Mind, that's just a problem with bad writing in general. While the rationalfic community tends to put a lot of stress on intelligence and character thought processes, just giving characters a consistent set of abilities, motivations and flaws should be something /every/ half-decent writer does.
