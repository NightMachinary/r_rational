  Also I know many people who don't really commit to things much because that way they don't ever fail, I see that in myself a fair bit, I don't think what you're calling out specifically is that ridiculous/obvious?

It's a bit sad though, wasted potential and all that.. Specially when failure is 90%+ of the time inconsequential over the long run. Your ego, self image, world view (or whatever you attribute this to) should be configured to help you move forward, not hold you back.
