Sure. And Ozy agrees with that judgement of /the existing movie/, and then they give a way in which the movie could be changed, to build Thorin back up again into a person who would do that, in such a way that the reader would believe it. Probably not in a movie, which are usually terrible at showing a character's inner motivations, but in a text. Or here's a different one: Maybe Thorin has had continual doubts about the authenticity of the map; it's a little convenient, isn't it, this ancient map with the near-riddle (that, as HPJEV would point out, doesn't actually distinguish very well between people who should and shouldn't have access) that just anyone could come across? When the last light fails, Thorin sees his secret doubt confirmed; he has fallen for a scam, he is an idiot and a fool and what's worse, all his friends know it and he's driven them all across the known world for a year just so he can reveal it... A temper tantrum is not unbelievable, if justified this way; a character with this sort of motivation is not acting intelligently, that's true, but they don't have /something missing/. This is a thing that could actually happen, even to someone with the determination to paper over their doubts and get to the Lonely Mountain.
