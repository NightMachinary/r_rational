Why is anyone acting like this is a new idea? This is stuff that writers worked out centuries ago. We don't need some new theory about "level 1 irrational characters". We already have language for this. We certainly don't need a "manifesto" arguing that characters should have flaws. That's something that any fiction writer worth a damn will already tell you.
