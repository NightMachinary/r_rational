Over time I've come to realize that a lot of things that fall under the umbrella of "rational fiction" tend to just be things that adhere to tropes and conventions that appeal to a particular audience. This is how most genres tend to operate: vampires used to fall into the domain of "horror" stories that tried to frighten the reader; now, you're more likely to find them in "paranormal" or "urban fantasy" stories that may make no attempt to frighten the reader (apart from the usual worrisome dramatic stakes that accompany any story). I don't think that's necessarily a problem; I think that genres work best when they are descriptive, not prescriptive, and the most useful descriptions tend to be those that allow you to neatly sort things into buckets of, "If I like X, I will probably also like X2 and X3." I think a significant portion of the readership on [[/r/rational]] is there because they liked HPMOR or Mother of Learning and want to find other stories that scratch the same itch. (It's also for this reason that I'm hesitant to define the sub's intent in a way that would exclude something like Unsong, because while Unsong isn't exactly a rational story, it most definitely falls under the banner of "stories that would appeal to people who enjoyed HPMOR.")

Awhile back the Rationally Writing duo made an appearance on the [[http://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/2018/07/63-rational-fiction/][Bayesian Conspiracy podcast]], and one of the things that came up was the fact that a big part of the appeal of rational fiction is that there's a certain segment of people that want to read stories about characters that are like them. This coincidentally overlaps with a [[http://kineticliterature.com/intelligent-characters-and-the-brains-vs-brawn-fallacy/][post I just made about the "brains vs brawn fallacy"]] and how certain stories about "intelligent" characters are more about appealing to a certain aesthetic ideal than actually demonstrating intelligence:

  ...the audience for written fiction mainly consists of people who enjoy and spend time reading books [...]

  I suspect that a major reason why “kid goes to wizard school” is so popular as a trope of fantasy that is that it's essentially created a genre where studying and reading books makes you more capable of dealing with violent conflict. In general, bookish and studious people rarely intersect with violence, and when they do they tend to find their skills poorly matched for dealing with violent conflict, but a wizard school setting allows for a logically consistent story about a character who is a brainy academic who also solves their conflicts with with superior force. [...]

  The issue with a character who solves their problem just by studying is that when they acquire that skill and then apply it to solve a problem, they're not really demonstrating intelligence, they're demonstrating expertise. The wizard's power appears to be the triumph of brain over brawn, but this is true only in the most superficial sense of what is meant by “brains.” A wizard who defeats his enemies by throwing fireballs at them is not really showcasing his intelligence, even if his method for learning to throw fireballs involved reading a lot of books.

There are a lot of times when it feels like the kind of works that appeal to the "rational fiction" community do so more by appealing to the aesthetic ideal of intelligence (someone who is an academic who gets their powers from studying) more than someone who actually tries to solve problems rationally.

There's also a question of how much "rational fiction" as a term should be descriptive of a story's logic, rather than the presence of certain character traits. I find most of Jane Austen's work to be tremendously "rational" in the sense of having characters whose behavior is internally consistent with the setting and the social context in which they exist; Austen is great precisely because she clearly understood the social dynamics of the setting she lived in (and wrote about). Everything that happens in her books feels like a logical consequence of everything that preceded it, and her stories make me laugh in the way that I can only laugh at something because it's so incredibly true to life. But I'm fairly certain that most people would resist a definition of "rational fiction" that includes the work of Jane Austen because her stories are about manners and romance, and people don't generally come to a place like [[/r/rational]] to read stories about people who are dealing with problems that are defined mainly in terms of how the protagonist deals with social pressure and trying to understand their own emotions. That's not something I necessarily see as a problem: as I said before, I think that genres work best as descriptive (not prescriptive) labels. But I think it does become necessary at a certain point to be intellectually honest about the fact that when talk about "rational fiction" we may be talking about fiction that may or may not be entirely rational, and that there's plenty of fiction that is rational while not falling under that banner.

I think this is the main point of what this manifesto describes as "irrational fiction," stories that are internally consistent with their logic while featuring characters who behave in ways that we consider "irrational" because they'd rather engage in self-deception that makes them feel happy rather than, like, accumulating resources or increasing their power level. (I think one the main reasons there seems to be so much overlap between the audiences for "rational fiction" and LitRPG is that "increasing my power level" is sort of the perfect distillation of the "romantic ideal" of rationality, and LitRPG's defining quality is that it expresses "power level" as a simple integer value that can be easily tracked.)
