I agree, a lot of rationalfic does this, although I think it makes sense to have labels for the subgenres within rationalfic.

there's also a lot of rationalfic that just focuses on having an OP rational protag. Personally, I prefer the rationalfic that explores flaws and teaches rationality as a result. (Being totally rational is a high bar, so a character can be very rational by most standards and still have interesting irrational flaws to explore.)
