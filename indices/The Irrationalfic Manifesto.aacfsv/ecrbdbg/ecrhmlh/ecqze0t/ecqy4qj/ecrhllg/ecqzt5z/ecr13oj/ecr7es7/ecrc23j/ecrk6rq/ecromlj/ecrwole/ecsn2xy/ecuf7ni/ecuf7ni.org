Well, and is Insecure!Thorin figuring out the best thing to do? Supposing that he was in fact a fool who had fallen for a scam, would throwing a tantrum be his best policy? Obviously not. This version of Thorin is not acting by author fiat so as to give Bilbo a Dramatic Moment, and he is also not acting rationally, the two options that the sage Yudkowsky is contrasting. He is acting in accordance with being a person, but not an optimising one.
