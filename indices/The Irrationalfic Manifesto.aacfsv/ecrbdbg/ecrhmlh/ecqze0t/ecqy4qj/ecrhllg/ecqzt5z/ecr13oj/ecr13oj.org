It's not being argued that the behaviour is not *stupid* on net. It's just that every behaviour has *some* driving goal behind it, and if you present the character as overvaluing that goal, you can build 'irrational' characters that are still consistent and easy to emphasise with.

Also I know many people who don't really commit to things much because that way they don't ever fail, I see that in myself a fair bit, I don't think what you're calling out specifically is that ridiculous/obvious?
