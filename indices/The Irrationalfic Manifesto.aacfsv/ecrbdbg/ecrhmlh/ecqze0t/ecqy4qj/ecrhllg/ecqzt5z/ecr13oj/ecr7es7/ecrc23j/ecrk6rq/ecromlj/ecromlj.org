Ok, but if the movie had built THAT Thorin (which wouldn't be faithful to the /book's/ Thorin, but that's another matter), it would still be a Level 1 Intelligent character. Which doesn't make the story irrational, quite the opposite.

Perhaps, here's how I would put it: the story is /rational/ as long as characters have that sort of consistent internal motives, regardless of whether they are actually smart or not. /Rationalist/ fiction tends to explore specifically what happens when we apply this logic to extremely smart characters (like Harry James Potter Evans-Verres or Lex Luthor). What Ozy advocates for isn't /irrational/ fiction, but rather... err... /irrationalist/ fiction, I guess, in which the rational framework (level 1 intelligent characters) is used not to explore the effects of rationality and intelligence, but those of irrationality and stupidity.
