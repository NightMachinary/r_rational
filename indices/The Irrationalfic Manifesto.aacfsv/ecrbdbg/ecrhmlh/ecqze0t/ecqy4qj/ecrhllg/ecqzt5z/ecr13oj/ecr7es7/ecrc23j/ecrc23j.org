Yes, but the argument EY made about Thorin went beyond that. His point - which may as well be subjective, of course, it's not a hard science - is that Thorin is too proud and sunk too much into his search for the Mountain to just /throw away the friggin' key/. It's not that it's an irrational behaviour in general. It's a behaviour that doesn't make any sense /for Thorin/, given his past and the person we've known him to be. Almost no one except for a hardcore chaotic character would just decide to toss away years and years of effort in a single moment of rage because of a small roadblock at the last step of the way. "Thorin is impatient" doesn't cut it: if Thorin was impatient /about this/, he wouldn't have ever managed to get to the Misty Mountains to begin with. That's what EY complains about, and I agree with him. It's not that Thorin is an irrational person, it's that Thorin /is not a person/, full stop. He embodies a trope, in that scene, used in a completely nonsensical way.
