  irrationalfic is making the flaw the primary subject of fiction
#+end_quote

So, like a million other stories that already exist? Plenty of fiction already focuses on the headspaces and behaviours of flawed, irrational characters. Plenty of fiction already shows characters suffering the consequences of their flaws. Ancient Greek Tragedy is built on the idea of the main character being destroyed by their own personal failings. That's one of the oldest narrative structures in history, being well over two millenia old.

"Irrationalfic" is not doing anything new. It's just re-inventing the wheel.
