This is actually one of the things I love about The Reckoning. Each of the Animorphs acts rationally and irrationally depending on the situation just like real human beings do. And while they read as particularly bright children, you never quite lose the sense that they're about as short-sighted and emotionally driven as you'd expect teenagers to be.
