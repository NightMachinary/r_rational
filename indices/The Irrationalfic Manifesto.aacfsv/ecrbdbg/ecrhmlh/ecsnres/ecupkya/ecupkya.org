Maybe we should have a separate term for stories which "make sense": where there aren't plot holes, where characters act is if they're people with coherent personalities and motivations rather than acting in contrived ways to create drama, where the world doesn't have inexplicable unplucked low-hanging fruit waiting for the protagonist, and so on. Perhaps "coherent fiction".

Lots of fiction is coherent (including Jane Austin, I suspect, though I haven't read many of her novels). And many readers prefer coherent fiction (which is why "aren't you just describing /good/ fiction" is a common refrain).

Rational fiction is a subset of coherent fiction, which rewards gears-seeking.
