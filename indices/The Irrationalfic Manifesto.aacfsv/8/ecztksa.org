I'm too late to this post (despite still being at #14 in the subreddit) to get off the bottom of the comments, but: for all that the common refrain for newcomers about rational!fic is "just good writing, plus some focus on intelligence/problem solving", this irrational!fic idea is even moreso "just good writing". I appreciate the initial point that "there are more solutions to the idiot ball problem than making the character not make dumb choices", which is definitely a lesson some rational[ist]!fic writers (and especially readers) should learn, but this is really really just "write characters that are people, not plot devices". It's certainly not /bad/ writing advice, and likely packaged in a way palatable to RT writers, but it's by no means novel to say that characters should have realistic flaws that inform their character and decisions, and also have some redeeming virtues as well, aka "be people".
