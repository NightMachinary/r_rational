Weird that they'd have those for themselves, but write "she" whenever they're talking about a non-specific character. It's like, they're clearly aware of how pronouns can bother people, but don't take any steps of their own to assuage the mild annoyance a reader might feel. Not exactly a crime, just a bit weird.
