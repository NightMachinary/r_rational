I think hpmor was an irrational fic by this definition!

Harry and Voldemort were arrogant and refused to delegate, while Hermione and McGonagall were stuck in what they were Supposed to Do, etc. Dumbledore was the only character that wasn't obviously irrational (other than putting too much certainty in an afterlife, but, come on, he lives in a universe which is magic)
