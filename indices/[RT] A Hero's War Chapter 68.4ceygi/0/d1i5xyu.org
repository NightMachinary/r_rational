Dunno if you're new to the sub, long time lurker or author of the story.

However if you wanna contribute and suggest stories I'd recommend doing a small write up on what the linked story is about, why it pulled you in, what makes it fit this sub and whatever else you fancy. Just some advice.

That said, the story looks interesting. Will give it a try. I am a sucker for hero summoned to another world type stories though
