[[http://unsongbook.com/][UNSONG]] (web serial): An Apollo mission crashes into the first celestial sphere, Kabbalah works, and a quasi-omnipotent archangel on a spectrum tries to fix the consequences of baby goats being boiled in their mother's milk. Nothing is ever a coincidence, and there is a good reason for that. Plus whale jokes.

[[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][Order of the Stick]] (web comic): Starts out as short jokes on D&D mechanics/lore, but then a great underlying story emerge (and there are still a fair amount of jokes).

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse][The Bobiverse series]] (novels): Not really a "humor work", but I laughed a good bunch of time at the Bobs' jests. I'm not sure how this community would rank it on a rationality scale, but I enjoyed it.
