Let's talk about XianXia.

A few months ago I found out about [[/r/ProgressionFantasy]] and have read a lot of the recommendations there. This is a genre where there is a system in place that enables the protagonist to get progressively stronger. An example that most here would be familiar with is Mother of Learning (the system here being magic + time loop).

Through there I also found out about XianXia, the chinese take on the concept with chinese medieval kung fu superhero mages.

Unfortunately, most of the books recommended on the subreddit written originally in english are incomplete. There are some that I can recommend though. The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle][Cradle]] has served as a good introduction to the genre for me. Not really that rational, nor that irrational. 7 books are out.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/12311119706248305/Paragon-of-Destruction][Paragon of Destruction]]. I really enjoyed that one, even though it started a bit slow. However, even though the characters aren't irrational per se, a shitload of coincidences, mostly in favor of the MC, seem to happen every arc. This did put me off a little, but I have a feeling it's a staple of the genre.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/reader/][Forge of Destiny]]. A quest. Good writing, avoids the overpowered protagonist trope unlike probably anything else in the genre.

Aaaand that's pretty much it. Other recommendations I've found are mostly 1-2 books long or 100 or so chapters in RoyalRoad.

So I started trying to read some translated chinese XianXia. I was fully prepared for the irational tropes like stupidly arrogant enemies and ridiculous coincidences. What I wasn't prepared for was the quality of the translations...

For example! For some reason, most translations end nearly every sentence with an exclamation mark! This doesn't seem like such a big deal at first! But it completely ruins the flow! Even in exposition dumps. Example sentences: "Warriors who had started cultivating the Knight breathing technique and thus improved their physique, but had not been able to ignite their internal life energy yet, were commonly known as preparatory Knights!

George's physique could be considered at the peak standard even amongst these preparatory Knights!"

I've tried reading Coiling Dragon and I Shall Seal the Heavens with no success. I am currently trying Warlock of the Magus World, which has been recommended in this subreddit before, but it is extremely painful. For me. If anyone knows any english language originals in this genre, or a translation that is not torture, please deliver me from this torment.
