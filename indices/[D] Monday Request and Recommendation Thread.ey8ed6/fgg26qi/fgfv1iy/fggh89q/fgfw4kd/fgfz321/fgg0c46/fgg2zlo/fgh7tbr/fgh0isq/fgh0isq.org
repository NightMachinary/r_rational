I second the Paragon of Destruction recommendation. It's the best written Chinese novel translation I've read in a long. I could forget it was a translation at some points because the writing wasn't completely awful at times. The main character doesn't always make the most rational choices, but that is more of a character flaw than a condemnation of the story. At several times I started to roll my eyes expecting a clich√© xianxia moment, but then found myself pleasantly surprised at having my expectations subverted.
