Forty Milleniums of Cultivation is sort of this, actually. The protagonist is of course a very strong, very lucky Xianxia protagonist, but across the 1700 chapters currently out I'd say the majority of it is at least in part about how classic Xianxia morality just doesn't work as well as a civilised society.

It does take a few hundred chapters for it to be the focus, but I do think if you're planning on putting the time in to read any Xianxia anyway, Fort Milleniums should be the one you pick. It actually is a deconstruction, in the sense of "this is how things would actually look if we took these premises of the genre", modulo the classical OP protagonist*.

*Which I can usually forgive in Xianxia anyway, since whoever makes it to the top of the rat race is going to do so through bullshit luck etc. regardless, because of the numbers involved.
