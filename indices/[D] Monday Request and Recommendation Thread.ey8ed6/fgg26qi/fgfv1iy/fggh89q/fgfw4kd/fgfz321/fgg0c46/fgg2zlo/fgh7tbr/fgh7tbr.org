English language XianXia is inherently shit. If the work is translated, then the author is most typically just an average XianXia fan, who at best makes an effort to just literally translate everything put down, and at worse straight up machine-translated everything. And that's coming from what are often amateur web-novels with already low standards of writing.

And 'western' Xianxia are typically even more amateurish copies of the above, poorly translated chinese ones. Plus, due to the cultural gap between westerners and china, Xianxia typically features offbeat morality. And I don't mean that in the literary, "this character was created to be interesting and flawed" way, but in the "this character was created to be wishfulfilment for people you strongly disagree with" way.

Plus, the inherent setting caveats of Xiania (cultivation makes you stronger, people who are strong tread on those weaker, power diffefentials are super high) tend to increase the level of trashy wish fulfiment to a level I've normally seen restricted to romance fanfiction and harem isekai.

That's not to say there aren't good english language xianxia works. The parody math xianxia, the arrogant young master one, thousand milleniums of cultivation (I've never read this one, but it comes highly recommended on this subreddit) and probably other ones that I've never been made aware of becauae I despise the genre and don't look for works in it. But typically, these "good" works are set apart by:

- being a deliberate parody or subversion of Xianxia tropes. Especially when done affectionately, by authors who are much kinder than me towards the genre, but still aware of its shortcomings.\\
- being written in english or having abnormally high quality translations.\\
- transcending xianxia as a genre, and becoming less "eastern fantasty" and more "eastern inspired fantasy." There's plenty of decent fantasy books out there that steal shamelessly from xianxia and wuxia, in terms of magic, aesthetics and even themes. But because they don't allow themselves to be constraned to being by-the-book xianxia, they get to keep the good stuff, without the bad stuff.

Incidentally, most, if not all, of the above rant applies to Light-novel-alikes (particularly isekais), Wuxia, and loosely to LitRPGs .
