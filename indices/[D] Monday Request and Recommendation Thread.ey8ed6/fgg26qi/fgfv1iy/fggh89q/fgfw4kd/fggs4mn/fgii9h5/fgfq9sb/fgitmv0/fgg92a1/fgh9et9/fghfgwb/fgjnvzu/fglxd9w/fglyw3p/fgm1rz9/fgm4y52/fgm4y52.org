I thought about it a bit and the bulk of the book still isn't concerned with what you're looking for, probably.

How concerned with expansion do they have to be to qualify? Like I mentioned the culture books, would you say that the manner in which they expand to be similar to what you're looking for? Almost all of the books aren't looking "inwards" within the culture itself, but instead mostly take place on the frontiers where culture agents are trying to make headway in expanding the reach and influence of the culture, but I'm not sure if you were looking for a model of expansion that looked different to this. For example, perhaps a more barren universe to expand in so expansion is less about diplomacy and conflict with other civs and more about the technical challenges, or something?
