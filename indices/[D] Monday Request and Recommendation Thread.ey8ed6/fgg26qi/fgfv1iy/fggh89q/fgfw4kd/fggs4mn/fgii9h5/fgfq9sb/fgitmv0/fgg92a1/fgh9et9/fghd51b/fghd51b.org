I need to make more time for these, they are right up my alley. I was reading one where the last heir of the byzantine empire was healthier and their collapse doesn't happen.

I only stopped because of the format it was written in, the kind where you can't close the tab ever or you lose where you were. Those really annoy me, I use several machines, I want to be able to pause it on one and pick up on another but on some sites it's really inconvenient to do so.
