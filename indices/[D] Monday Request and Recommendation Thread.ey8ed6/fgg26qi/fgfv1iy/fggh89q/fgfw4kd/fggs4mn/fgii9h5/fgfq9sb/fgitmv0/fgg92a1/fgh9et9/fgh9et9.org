I would like to recommend not just a work, or a series of works, but a niche genre: Timelines.

Mostly popular on AlternateHistory forum, with some crossposting to SB/SV, authors write a timeline of a nation or world, typically going year by year as sort of an extended worldbuilding exercise that also happens to have interesting characters or vignettes sprinkled about. They're not for everyone, but if you're a grand strategy fanatic like me, they fit a very particular niche that no other form of literature is able to satisfy. As much information and fascinating worldbuilding as a large alternate history (or future history, or fantasy history) series, but condensed into a far smaller format by cutting out unimportant crap like romance subplots and (typically, but not always) main characters.

Here are a few good currently ongoing ones:
