  The problem is that most people don't consider endless expansion a win, as such, or very interesting.

Yeah, I can buy that for some races, or even for most races, but not for /all/ races. And if someone will do it while you would hesitate, then chances are that their utility function is incompatible with yours, so you have to do it yourself (to do it "better", to enforce some life-protecting rules, etc.). I think that such scenarios would be rich in this type of questions.
