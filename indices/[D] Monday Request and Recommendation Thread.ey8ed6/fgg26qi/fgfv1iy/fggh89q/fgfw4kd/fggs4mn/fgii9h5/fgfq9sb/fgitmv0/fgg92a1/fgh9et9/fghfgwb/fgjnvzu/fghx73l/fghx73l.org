You should read Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series. They are very high quality books primarily about identity, whether personal or species. The expansion of the species is a running theme / side-plot, though mostly in the context of the Fermi Paradox.

The problem is that most people don't consider endless expansion a win, as such, or very interesting.
