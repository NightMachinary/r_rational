I am interested in base, town, kingdom, empire building if yall have any recs.

Stuff I have liked:

P.S Power -> Builder: I really enjoyed the usage of runes to start a magitek revolution everything else though was a mess. (If you can fight through the protagonists idiocy and the repeating plot. Edit: I couldnt stomach a second read through if that helps anyone)

Luke Chimienko (Sp) -> Ascend Online: Its gamelit, but good fun in the town expansion portions.

Harry Potter Fanfic -> Discordant Note: A little heavy on the sex side of things for me, but you get to see an empire rise North of the wall

Twelve Steps to Omnipotence: Fun read about an insert attempting to gain omnipotence in the Marvel Universe

Jack L Knapp -> Near Earth Objects Series: Guy builds a direct elec to propulsion device. Graduates from company to country. Great fun to see everything slowly but surely build up across 3 generations of a family.

Bobiverse: Von Neuman probe does what its name suggests

Release that witch: This is in the same vein as what I enjoy, but it just dragged for me.

Daniel Black Series: Building his arcology was really the only enjoyment in that series. Could easily have done with the harem and boderline erotica.
