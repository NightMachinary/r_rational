The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/182059-nightlord][Nightlord]] series is very enjoyable---that is to say, I liked it. The main character builds a kingdom with the help of his pet mountain which gets power by converting matter to energy. Interesting stuff goes on, especially with portals, but I wouldn't consider it rational. It had rational-ish parts, especially in the later books, but he pointlessly delays and takes stupid risks he doesn't have to.
