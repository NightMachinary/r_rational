Since he didn't answer, I'll give it a try.

It's revealed that the DM specifically made Amaryllis to match Juniper's conception of ideal feminine beauty, and that he then left clues to that effect. For example, they find out that the names of Amaryllis and Juniper's first crushes are anagrams of each other.

This and other issues that come to light raise serious practical and philosophical questions about the nature of their reality, some examples of which are: to what extent their lives were manipulated by the DM, how much "free will" they can possibly have in a contest with such an arbitrarily powerful being, should they give in their manipulated attraction to each other and try to be together despite it being something imposed on them, and of course, why the fuck a seemingly omnipotent being is going to such lengths to not only mess with them, but to make it clear to them that they are being messed with.
