I wouldn't say that the Bobiverse is "irrational", but I agree that it doesn't check all the boxes. On the plus side, the characters are true to themselves and the story is internally coherent. But there are close-call situations that conveniently get resolved on a fluke of chance, and you definitely won't get the calculated cool-headed planning that is common in this genre. The Bobs just don't care enough, and some of the humor is built on that.
