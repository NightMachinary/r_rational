It depends on how exactly the US is paying up. The whole thing is weird because talks of the bid swap back and forth between dollar and yen. The final bid was US $10 trillion which is said to turn into Â¥1 quadrillion, and that's true /at current exchange rate/. But the exchanger rate wouldn't stay static! I'm not sure there even /are/ one quadrillion yens in the entire world. Even if there are, convincing all their owners to part with them would cost far, far more than $10tr. So that doesn't make sense.

More reasonably, if we assume that (without any country printing new money) the US just gathers up $10 trillion from its reserves (/somehow/), spends it all on yens, and hands out however many yens this ends up being, things works out pretty well for all Japanese. Most yens are held by Japanese people. The US is buying them all with dollars at a ludicrously favourable exchange rate. Within three days (yes, to make this even crazier, this all has to happen in three days /somehow/) every Japanese who had at least /some/ yens is now very dollar-rich. Yostuba account holders are yen-rich as well.

If Japan were to then close its borders, you're right that it would just result in inflation. But it's not, it's going to keep importing goods. You're /actually/ more wealthy, you don't just have bigger numbers in your bank account, because you can go trade your brand new dollars for an American car, or a German car from a German who wants dollars. Not at current dollar value, because the dollar just got a lot weaker, there's some inefficiencies due to surprise spending (those cars were headed for New York and redirecting them last-minute costs extra fuel), and there's /some/ inflation. But it's still a windfall.

The Yostuba account holders are even better off, because the yen will remain extremely high for a while longer. Every bank in the world sold its yen reserves to the US and is looking to replenish them. Some of their wealth will also trickle down to the rest of the Japanese economy (they'll buy cars, get tired of them, and sell them for cheap).

Of course that's a fantasy world. In the real world, you can't "/somehow/" move this much money and expect it to remain economics rather than politics. Money is a shared dream; you make too much noise and people wake up. Governments can decide that this transfer is null and void, or that yen is no longer legal tender, or that the US national currency is now the New Dollar.
