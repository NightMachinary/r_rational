I am sorry, but there's no way to save yourself from the poor writing; it's inherent to the genre. I Shall Seal the Heavens is probably the best example of a decent quality 'normal' XianXia with a competent translator you can find, so all I can say is you need to search harder for things written differently that also have interesting plots.

I can't really think of anything that will be good or not without committing time to do grammar checks, but maybe you could try some of the parodies? /Ascending, Do Not Disturb/ is slower paced and might not have all those writing problems, but it's also something of a fluffy romance as opposed to how most of the genre is action.

/Cultivation Chat Group/ might work for you as well, but again it's a parody and you might not get everything without having struggled through at least one or two /real/ XianXia novels. Also, most of it is sealed behind the walls of +Mordor+ Qidian (they run Webnovel), and I cannot in good conscience recommend supporting them in any way or sailing the seven seas to get around them.
