Of the translated xianxias, Forty Milleniums of Cultivation is the only one I can recommend, mainly because it dodges most of the irrational tropes and does things like worldbuild functioning cultivation society and keeping the protagonist prosocial instead of the typical amoral xianxia protagonist who only really cares about power.

The translation is rough, but gets significantly better as the story advances and more professional translators picked it up.
