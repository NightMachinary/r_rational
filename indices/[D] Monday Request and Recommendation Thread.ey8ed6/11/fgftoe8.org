Just finished Mother of Learning and I'm craving for something similar, be it web serial or novel. What I liked in particular about MOL was the general character growth of the MC, as well as the slow, logical power creep (especially for mind magic). The progression from the techniques the MC uses in the final chapters to the initial ones are so damn satisfying because not once did I think that any abilities he showed came out of nowhere or were unearned.

I tried the first 30~ or so chapters of Worth the Candle and it wasn't really for me, the self-insert MC plus the rpg aspects weren't really to my liking. Some other similar works I've enjoyed are the Arcane Acension series, Cradle, anything by Sanderson, & The Beginning After the End. Any recommendations are appreciated!
