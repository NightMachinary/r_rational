*SLIGHT SPOILERS POSSIBLY* Maybe I didn't read far enough for him to be fleshed out more, but he didn't have a whole lot going for him character wise in the early parts of the book. Outside of his anger/sadness about Arthur dying he seemed pretty blase, he never got nervous or afraid in the wildest situations and always somehow knew the best course of action. Plus the whole Amaryllis/Fenn thing seemed pretty self insert-ish. Amaryllis' first introduction seemed exactly the type of thing an author looking to self insert would write lol.
