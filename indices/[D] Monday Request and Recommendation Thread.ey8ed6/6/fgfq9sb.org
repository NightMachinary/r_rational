Are there any stories or fanfics where a rational or common sense decision/response completely blindsides someone else's plan? Examples:

With This Ring, a Young Justice SI where the main character sneaks into a country and discovers the supervillain dictator is secretly trading with an alien empire for technology. She expects that no one will do anything as the Justice League has no jurisdiction there, and in the canon storyline nothing happens, but in a common-sense decision, the main character goes to the UN and shares how dangerous the alien empire is, how the dictator is potentially threatening the world which incentives the world to remove her from power, and as a bonus reveals other potential alien threats to watch out for. Which includes the main enemies of a future season.
