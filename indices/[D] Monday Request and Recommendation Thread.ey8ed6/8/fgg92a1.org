I'm looking for superhero web series. What are the good ones?

One's I've read include:

[[http://inmydaydreams.com/][Legion of Nothing]] A super hero story about the grandchildren of golden age super heroes taking up their forbearers' mantels. It's been running for a while now, has a good cast and some nice development. It features a gadgeteer hero, who builds tech. On the down side, the writing can be a little dry at times (fairly unemotional which is strange since it's first person). It is ongoing.

[[https://the-last-skull.blogspot.com/2010/06/beginning-1.html][The Last Skrull]]. It has a good story, full characters and, get this, a beginning, middle and end (!!!). Despite that, I feel there is just something lacking that stops it being truly great. The story stars a 'Sue Daysdale' who follows in her mothers footsteps as the superhero/vigilante the Skrull.

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20090620070916/http://www.starharbornights.net/content/view/38/20/#story][Star Harbor Nights]]. It is also about superheroes but no long updates. The original site is now gone but can be viewed on the Internet Archive. I remember reading and being rather engaged years ago. It has some interest ideas, like the darkawn (sp?) gene, which turns you into an exception normal if you have one copy, and a crazy super genius if you have two. It has two main plots. One focuses on a new street level vigilante type hero, who is just getting started in a east coast port city (this was written before Worm, so it's not a reference). The other follows a more high powered flight telekinetic, telepathic type as she goes about superhero LA.

[[https://tieshaunn.wordpress.com/table-of-contents-2/the-blazing-stars/table-of-contents/][Brennus]]. One of the first generation of superhero stories spun off from Worm's comments section. Writing is not fantastic (the early novel has some very clumsy exposition) and it is very derivative of Worm but I enjoyed it when I read it. Follows another kid tech hero, though this time with a Mysterious Past (tm).

And finally we have [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] and it's squeal [[https://www.parahumans.net/][Ward]]. Super famous around these parts, may have kick started the modern web serial boom. Well written, misery heavy and engaging.
