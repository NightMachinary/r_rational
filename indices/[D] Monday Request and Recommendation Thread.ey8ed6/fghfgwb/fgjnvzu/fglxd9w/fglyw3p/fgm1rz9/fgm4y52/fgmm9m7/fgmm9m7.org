  How concerned with expansion do they have to be to qualify?
#+end_quote

I want some agent (be it protagonist, antagonist or other) to make a real attempt at trying to maximize the volume of space-time they have control over (be it defensively or aggressively). They may succeed or fail, but at least they try.

  perhaps a more barren universe to expand in
#+end_quote

Yeah, I presumed some form of "space-faring race barren-ness". The universe is quite old and, if it were to be crowded right now, it would have still been mostly-barren at some point in the past, at which point a race (or individuals from a race) that wanted to expand would have been free to do so.

I see a crowded universe /Ã  la/ Star Trek only possible in some special contexts, such as:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst][gamma-ray bursts]] (or something to the same effect) used to be quite common, and they stopped rather abruptly;

- we are in-between two massive gamma-ray-burst-like events, life flourished after the last one, and is about to be wiped out again;

- very early in the life of the universe, some race expanded very rapidly to maximize the volume of space-time they have control over, but instead of colonizing it they play zookeeper with other races, preventing them from expanding as such;

- due to the anthropic bias, we live in some local neighbourhood of Star-Trek-like crowded space that has been, to this day, spared by "expanding races" much worst than the Borg;

- etc.

Note my explicit use of "space-faring" in the above: intelligent life could very well be common, except that a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][great filter]] occurs at some late technological level.
