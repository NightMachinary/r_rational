You'd expect for there to be some coverage of people who oppose any expanding civilisation in a book where such a thing is occurring right, just because it's not necessarily the case that any given setting is going to have inhabitants that are homogenous in ideology, and also just from a narrative standpoint it can be interesting to cover conflict between an expanding culture and those that oppose them for whatever reason.

If you want the Egan book where the title more closely refers to what you want, then I'd have to highlight Diaspora.
