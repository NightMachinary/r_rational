Of Egan I only read Schild's Ladder which, although interesting on its own, isn't what I'm looking for here: many of them are contempt with running away from the 0.5 c expanding bubble (temporarily settling on some planet, running away some distance when the bubble gets near, then settling again for some time), while the rest try to destroy/stop the bubble. What they're not doing is trying to expand as fast as they can to secure their future, especially after seeing one example of a bubble of destruction expanding at some fraction of c, whose mechanics they don't understand, so the next such bubble could very well expand at a higher fraction of c. Moreover, the book's theme (and title) revolve much more about what is the self and how one may preserve it in a changing environment, not expansion.

I read synopses of the other recommended Egan books and planned to read them later, but concluded that they also weren't what I was looking for. But thanks to your comment I'll give it another try sooner than later.
