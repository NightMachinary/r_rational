That's a little unfair, the Bobiverse leaned on tropes a little but executed the tropes it did utilized perfectly fine.

I would agree that it was fairly banal in how far it was willing to go with it's central premise, an Upload has a far more broad utility than simply copying itself and making improvements to the technology it started with.

A fully rational Bob would have been duplicating at every instance where resources to do so were available, the first system he encountered turned into nothing more than a replication facility. Every other problem could then have been solved through sheer numbers alone.

(I do have to say though, that would have made for a slightly less interesting story unless up against a similar entity at an analogous point of development. The Others almost filled this slot, but they were also limited due to culture.)
