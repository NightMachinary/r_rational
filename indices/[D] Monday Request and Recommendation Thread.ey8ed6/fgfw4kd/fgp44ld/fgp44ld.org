Xianxia makes me want to write a deconstruction so hard - the entire genre belongs to those fantasy worlds clearly built by a malicious demiurge. - The path to power lies through isolation from human ties and violent acquisition of limited resources. The entire structure of enlightenment is set up to make monsters of those who thread upon it, and then kill them. All of them. Conflict is so insanely ubiquitous, that the fact that the practitioners are technically long lived is meaningless. They spend most of their time meditating (and a xiania protag meditating is safe from their self-destructive path, temporarily. They also are not really living), then exit seclusion and promptly have an orgy of violence, presumably more than anything else to try to make up for a long period of lacking stimulus.
