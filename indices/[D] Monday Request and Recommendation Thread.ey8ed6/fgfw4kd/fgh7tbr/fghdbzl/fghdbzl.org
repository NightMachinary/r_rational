  The parody math xianxia

Which one is this?

#+begin_quote
  the arrogant young master one
#+end_quote

I'm guessing you mean [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][this one]]? It's kind of a Xianxia / LitRPG crossover tho.

#+begin_quote
  thousand milleniums of cultivation
#+end_quote

I think you mean [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]] - it's kinda easy to get that mixed up because there's a (very small) WH40k influence (I think the author intended to do more of it but really it just boils down to chainswords and some demonic stuff)
