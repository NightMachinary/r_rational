I would say it's more of a 'don't think that just because shinigami can be charming and human-like in their behavior, they also have human morality'. ryuuk has always been a fan favorite, to the point when people sometimes forget that he literally /doesn't care/ about life and death, and is driven almost solely by his need to avoid boredom. zoomer!kira has just outlived his purpose, quite literally.
