The moral is that power comes at a cost, no matter how you use it. Same thing applies to getting the shinigami eyes. Saying that dealing with a shinigami doesn't end favorably is wrong depending on how you look at it because we have seen that both times it happened humanity as a whole was better off. You pay with your life for the privilege of using the note.
