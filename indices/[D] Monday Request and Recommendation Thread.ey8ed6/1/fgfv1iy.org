[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjbSCEhmjJA][The Bizarre World of Fake Martial Arts by Super Eyepatch Wolf]]

Some rational non-fiction. This is a very interesting look into the world of fake martial arts - both those who claim to have mystical martial arts powers and more borderline claims like super-exaggerated results from things like Tai Chi and other traditional Chinese martial arts.

The video coves a number of topics, such as 'no hit knockouts' that fail independent replication to the fascinating story of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong][Xu Xiaodong]]. Xu is a Chinese MMA fighter who got sick of the traditional masters making supernatural claims. So he challenged and beat them in a fight. Unfortunately, this has resulted in heavy backlash from the Chinese community and government - who see it as an attack on China.

Also, the video narrator is Irish and has a voice like velvet poetry, so there's that too.
