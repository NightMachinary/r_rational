I feel like this deserves a rational holiday. Dedicating ones life to reveal the truth at great personal cost is praiseworthy. Can anyone figure out when Xu Xiaodong's first match against that Tai Chi master(Wei Lei I think) happened? Earliest sources I can find are from May 5th 2017 but none of them actually mention what date the match was scheduled for.
