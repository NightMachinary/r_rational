  famous scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark

  where Indiana Jones demonstrates how to win by bringing a gun to a sword fight. Apparently, this wasn't part of the original script, as Harrison Ford

  described during an AMA

IRL he'd probably die or get severely wounded.. Guns neither kill nor incapacitate instantly, without headshots.

  At 20 ft (6.1 m), the gun-wielder was able to shoot the charging knife attacker just as he reached the shooter. At shorter distances the knife wielder was always able to stab prior to being shot.

In the movie the guy had a sword, not a knife. Even if he had the time to unload the entire revolver on the dude he'd still be alive and well enough to strike him a couple times before falling.

And he'd still live for a minute or two, which he'd spend suffering, excreting and crying.
