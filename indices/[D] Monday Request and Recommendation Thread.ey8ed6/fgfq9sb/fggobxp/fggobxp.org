There's an episode of Buffy where she encounters an enemy that "no forged weapon" can harm. Immunity to forged weapons does not mean immunity to explosions, however, as Buffy demonstrates in dramatic fashion with the use of a rocket launcher.

There's also that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdnA-ESWcPs&t=1m50s][famous scene from /Raiders of the Lost Ark/]] where Indiana Jones demonstrates how to win by bringing a gun to a sword fight. Apparently, this wasn't part of the original script, as Harrison Ford [[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xh4j/i_am_harrison_harrison_ford_ama/cgrc21n/][described during an AMA]]:

  We were shooting in Tunisia, and the script had a scene in which I fight a swordsman, an expert swordsman, it was meant to be the ultimate duel between sword and whip. And I was suffering from dysentery, really, found it inconvenient to be out of my trailer for more than 10 minutes at a time. We'd done a brief rehearsal of the scene the night before we were meant to shoot it, and both Steve and I realized it would take 2 or 3 days to shoot this. And it was the last thing we were meant to shoot in Tunisia before we left to shoot in England. And the scene before this in the film included a whip fight against 5 bad guys that were trying to kidnap Marian, so I thought it was a bit redundant. I was puzzling how to get out of this 3 days of shooting, so when I got to set I proposed to Steven that we just shoot the son a bitch and Steve said "I was thinking that as well." So he drew his sword, the poor guy was a wonderful British stuntman who had practiced his sword skills for months in order to do this job, and was quite surprised by the idea that we would dispatch him in 5 minutes. But he flourished his sword, I pulled out my gun and shot him, and then we went back to England.

Awhile back I also [[http://kineticliterature.com/intelligent-characters-and-the-brains-vs-brawn-fallacy/][wrote about]] characters who are willing to solve problems using physical force, rather than trying to find a complicated "intellectual" solution to a problem:

  One of my favorite examples of this comes from a scene in the movie Sneakers (a delightful 1992 thriller and heist movie about cryptography and espionage) where Robert Redford's character goes to steal a cipher device from a researcher's office. After socially engineering himself past the front desk, he finds his caper brought to a halt when the door to the office is protected with an electronic keypad. He radios the guys in the surveillance van and says, “Anybody remember how to defeat an electronic keypad?” Because this is a thriller about computers and cryptography, we expect them to come up with some kind of backdoor solution to breaking this lock, the cyberpunk equivalent of “recite this magical incantation and the lock will open for you.” The audience waits in tense silence as Robert listens to the voice of the computer guys speaking into his earpiece and mutters to himself, “Alright, that might work.” And then he takes a step back and kicks down the door.
