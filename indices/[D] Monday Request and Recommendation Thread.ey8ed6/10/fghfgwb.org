This is a request not really specific to [[/r/rational]] stories, but I'm hoping that what I'm looking for may intersect with the interests of some of the dwellers of this sub.

A while ago, I [[https://old.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/c97lvt/looking_for_stories_where_something_seeks_to/][asked]] on [[/r/scifi]] for stories where some humans/aliens/AI/etc use most of their resources to expand their boundaries as fast/far as they can. I got some interesting suggestions, and I truly enjoyed some of these books, but I haven't found what I was looking for. In fact, I'm not sure if what I'm asking for can be made into an interesting story.

The entities I'm thinking of want to take full advantage of Nick Bostrom's [[https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html][cosmic endowment]]. One thousand years after starting expanding, they want the radius of their sphere of influence to be as close as possible to 1000 light years. After a billion years, they hope for that radius to be larger than 1 billion light years (because the universe is expanding). At that moment they would have "won", for no single other race could ever "catch up" behind them (presuming no FTL). And yet they would keep on expanding as fast as they can, because a bigger sphere is better.

Densifying inside that sphere is also important to them, but it has a much lower priority: any equipment left behind in the effort to push forward the shell of their sphere of influence may later be used to densify/colonize its bulk. This contradicts the standard tropes "move to the next system once you ran out of resources" or "run away from the danger (without dispersing)".

So, does this sound like anything you've heard of? I'm fine with "lower quality" stories: I'm fishing for how they've managed/tried to make such a story interesting.
