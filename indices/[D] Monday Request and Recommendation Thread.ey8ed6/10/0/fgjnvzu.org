I was going to mention some Egan books but it looks like someone already did in that thread you made.

The other one I'd think worth mentioning is the Culture series, I guess. You get to see that universe at a bunch of points throughout its history over the different books, so you get an idea of the different expansion rates and tactics of different competing civilisations in it.
