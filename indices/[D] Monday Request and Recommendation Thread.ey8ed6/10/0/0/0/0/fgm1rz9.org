I'm not sure I get your comment. If you're still talking about Schild's Ladder, I think it's great/believable/fitting that they have non-homogeneous ideologies. The problem with respect to my present request for suggestions is that "expansion" is not among the themes being explored in the book. Of the two factions I describe in my spoiler tags, none of them makes a real attempt at expanding.

Thanks, I'll try Diaspora next.
