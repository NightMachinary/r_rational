I feel like I've run out of good web fiction. I'm sure there's more out there in the vastness or the internet, so here's what I've liked (starting with the best):

Mother of Learning

Harry Potter and the Natural 20

Worm

Ra

Hpmor

Worth the Candle

The wandering inn

The last 2 were kind of meh for me, I'm not interested in reading other wildbow things (tried them), and if it helps, I'm a fan of Brandon Sanderson.

Also there's more but I'm sure I'm forgetting some things and I'm not listing the ones I didn't like (mostly because i dont remember their names).

Thanks so much!
