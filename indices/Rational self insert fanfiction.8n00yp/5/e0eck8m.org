If I may, even though I'm late by almost two weeks...

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/roll-the-dice-on-fate-naruto-si.348922/threadmarks?category_id=1][/Roll the Dice on Fate/]] [72k words; extremely slow updates], a /Naruto/ self-insert into a random clanless genin. Explicitly meant to be rational, and as far as I could remember it's satisfactory.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-calculator-dc-multiverse-si-as-canon-character.39138/threadmarks?category_id=1][/The Calculator/]] [50k, likely abandoned], a DC self-insert into a neutral-evil villain/information broken with a talent for programming and artificial intelligences. It is rational and it isn't wish-fulfilment. It's also my favourite on this list.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/threadmarks][/Blood and Chaos/]] [280k, likely abandoned], already mentioned by someone here. A /Buffy/ self-insert, who immediately gets eaten by a vampire -> replaced by a demon with his memories. The author explicitly tried to make the story rational, though the protagonist's natural abuse of meta-knowledge ensured he has it relatively easy.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/technology-will-win-the-day-worm-cyoa-si-complete.327745/][/Technology Will Win the Day/]] [63k, complete], a /Worm/ CYOA self-insert. /Worm/ CYOAs are characteristic of giving the protagonist overpowered abilities, and this is no exception --- the protagonist is essentially an all-purpose tinker. It's rational, though.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/threadmarks?category_id=1][/Prison of Glass/]] [110k, hiatus], another /Worm/ CYOA self-insert, with a reality-warping power. This one has two notable features: it's told through viewpoints of other characters, never the self-insert; the self-insert was turned selectively sociopathic upon insertion, she cares only about likeable canon characters and disregards the of humanity. It's rational, in modelling other characters' behaviour^{1}, and it's quite unique.

Ultimately, it comes down to what you want more: rationality (defined as "every character makes an honest effort towards achieving personal goals") or non-overpoweredness? My list above is ordered by how much power the self-insert starts with, from least to highest; I think /The Calculator/ is the most rational of them, closely followed by /Roll the Dice on Fate/, followed by the rest.

--------------

^{1. Example: in many /Worm/ self-inserts, it's expected of Slaughterhouse Nine to come after the self-insert and end up slaughtered after a morality lecture. Here, though, Jack Slash realizes that the self-insert is too powerful to engage with without major preparations, and avoids her.}
