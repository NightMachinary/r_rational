My bad, misread and thought a well written fix-fic was precisely what OP asked for.

I personally think it avoids most pitfalls for fix-fics and takes a relatively reasonable route without absurd levels of plot armor or reliance on it.

The precog resistance seemed largely based on his meta knowledge, which makes sense since most precog works using known variables and being fictional is certainly not something the entities are aware of.

That the best PtV to get the best use out of his info would be to cooperate doesn't seem at all unfeasible to me - more extreme methods have the drawback that you lose out on being handed the most useful info first by a cooperative party.
