Though it requires reading the free supervilain book [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] to not suffer from being spoiled on this absolutely fantastic superhumans-story that is subject to constantly escalating scale and the best anything I've read or watched to date, I would recommend the SI fanfic [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/security-a-worm-si-story.3724/][Security!]].

It consists of a reader of the books who works as a security guard and writes fanfics in his spare time ending up in the Worm setting shortly before the main story begins, and doing his best from there to keep the characters he likes alive and to minimize the casualties of the plot, having no powers of his own save having read the story (which incidentally makes him one of the most powerful precogs in the setting, though only in the beginning before he sends all the butterflies flapping in every direction).

It's completely finished and one of the best reads I've had since Worm itself.
