I feel obliged to post my disagreement here. It's exactly what the OP described most SI fics as being - a blatant wish fulfilment fix-it fic where the SI easily solves everything with his meta knowledge. It's also just not very high quality writing, with character leaping to improbable deductions without sufficient evidence that just so happens to be right. It's certainly not rational.

Still, people shouldn't be downvoting you for being wrong.
