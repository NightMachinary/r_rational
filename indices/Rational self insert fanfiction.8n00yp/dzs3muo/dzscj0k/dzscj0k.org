Going to have to derecc (unrecommend) Security. The SI has extreme plot armor. The SI carries out over complicated plans to help every character that somehow work despite dealing with several Thinkers (which should be able to work around him or subvert him) and the PRT (who have Master Stranger protocols that should slow things down) The SI gets Cauldron to work with them by promising information when Contessa could just PtV a way of getting the information out of the protagonist much faster. Their priorities are not very utilitarian, instead of prioritizing helping Cauldron deal with Scion they waste a lot of time helping individual characters. The characterizations are all twisted by fanon (woobie Panacea, sympathetic easily reformed Undersiders, etc.).
