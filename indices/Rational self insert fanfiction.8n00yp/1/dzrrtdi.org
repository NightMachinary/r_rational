Look at the stuff posted by [[/u/DataPacRat]] they have a pretty good set of incomplete stories that are midway between the Bobbiverse (waking up uploaded) and Accelerando (future shock and dealing with it). The [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit][FAQ on Loadbear's instrument of precommitment]] a set of terms and conditions to instantiate an open-sourced upload is the only one I know is completed, but they are all good though some have NSFW elements.

Edit: fixed auto-incorrect from my phone added link to the Loadbear FAQ: it's a really interesting.
