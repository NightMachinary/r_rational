First off, when I saw this in my morning Reddit browse, I gasped out loud and thought it was some sort of early April Fools, but overall I was SUPER excited for an early update. And now I'm just sad. :(

I refuse to fucking believe it. Someone in there had an Abra and they all got away. I'm REELING at the consequences of this; of course, Aiko being dead is the worst part, but...they're going to have to tell her father, he's going to be utterly crushed, Red's gonna have to tell Blue and Leaf, and *Red...*I can't see any possible way he's going to bounce back from this night. If Aiko lived, MAYBE. But this radically changes the rest of the story and the characters. With Aiko's death I fail to see how anything could continue as it did before. Red is so god damn mentally screwed. At least someone gave him a hug.

As always...I await the next chapter. Just with a lot more trepidation this time.

Edit: Ah, I forgot to pay respects. F
