Was that a massive psychic induced feelings block? It would be a likely way out from Red. I'm glad Sabre was able to break that (which would mean that red was flooded with greaf for Aiko AND his parents. That's horrible) I hope this causes a growth in the direction of "I'll be the best trainer to protect people"

Silent edgy Red. That concept created by the avatat's muteness.
