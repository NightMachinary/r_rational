Im still going to hold out a fools hope that Red is simply wrong, not good enough or experienced enough - only because right now, the narrative structure of Aiko dying on an interlude seems like it *cant* be the whole story, the way we as readers experience her death - its too "dying off page". Of course we are going to get later chapters, so that can be addressed (one last Aiko chapter, or a Red-thinking-back section), but given that we don't have that yet I still will wait for that 100% confirmation.

But this is still 99% confirmation, lets be real. I said in the comments of the last chapter that Red was probably right to oppose her - I did NOT need this level of proof, I could have used a *much lower level of proof*, thank you very much!!

Also, side comment: If I recall the correctly, when I first read the last chapter it ended with Aiko kissing Red on the cheek, and her thinking something along the lines of "well everyone else is doing it." Now that line is gone, its more straightforward. I felt that was a nice little moment of humourous personality, a good little Aiko moment, and I am sad to see it retconned way particularly if we get no more of those. But maybe I imagined that? Not sure after all!
