What I find really tragic about Aiko's death is how easily it could have been avoided. There were so many moments when she could have decided she had done enough and called it a day. And she wouldn't have been wrong to do so. Instead, she always felt she can and needs to do more, even when the odds were against her surviving. If only she was a lesser person, she may still be alive.

And, yet again, poor Red. How is he going to come back from this? I don't even want to imagine what must going through his head right now. Hopefully, he doesn't blame himself too much for what happened, even though I have a feeling that he does.

Poor Aiko's father... The scene when he finds out what happened is not one I'm looking forward to. Red will probably have to tell him (after all, he was the last one to talk with Aiko). Blue may come as well. Too bad Leaf most likely won't be able to go (being in the hospital and all that). She could have helped to soften the blow.
