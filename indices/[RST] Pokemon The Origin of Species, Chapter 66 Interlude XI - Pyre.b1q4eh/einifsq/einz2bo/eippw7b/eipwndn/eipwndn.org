I was shocked at the death, till I read the last chapter again, and Aiko makes a comment along the lines of "she was tired of making hard choices for the greater good" and i realized that that was a sign of, well, bad thinking. The greater good is the right way to survive most times, but wont feel good - It was just told from the perspective of someone who didnt know that, so it seemsd triumphant. Your comment really hit that concept, helped me make that connection.
