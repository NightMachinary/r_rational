I feel this chapter had less of an impact than it could have had. Hopefully it's not too spoilery, but I'd be interested to understand your decision to withhold Red's internal reactions after Leaf's injury and Aiko's disappearance.

In the last four chapters we've seen Red go through a lot. His manner of thinking has been tested. His desires and goals have been pitted against odds he has fought to calculate. While he did succeed occasionally, his losses were severe. During this time we've only seen Red from an outside perspective.

I wanted to see his decisions during conflict with his available information. I wanted to understand his decision to go fight the nidoqueen, His decision (or lack of) to stay with leaf after. His decision to return to the field with Aiko. I wanted to see his reactions when his choices had bad outcomes. His reactions to how his quick decisions led to Leaf's Injury. His reactions and turmoil after he failed to convince Aiko and Jack from entering the building. How all this made him feel about himself.

I feel that these moments are inciting some of the biggest changes in red that we've seen, and we're missing out on those scenes of struggle, discovery, and change by witnessing all this instead from an observers perspective after the events have occurred.

I'm intrigued about how you will proceed! Good luck on your next chapter!

Also, now that we know the results, I really enjoy how you portrayed Aiko's decision at the end of chapter 65. I've been having a strong feelings of dread these past couple chapters.
