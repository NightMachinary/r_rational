Thanks for the perspective, and glad you enjoyed the chapters! Keeping us out of Red's head was partly a decision based on pacing logistics (I wanted each character to get a full chapter once the Zapdos arc started) and partly because based on building expectations.

I've spent so much time building up Red's perspective and values that I wanted to go an extended time outside of his head (after kicking off the arc with his thoughts/feelings) to let the readers feel as separated and uncertain as the characters in the story do, and to let the readers practice guessing/predicting what would happen next without having as much information about his internal state as they would if I did dip back into his thoughts after Leaf's chapter or during Aiko's.

Hope that makes sense, and you continue to enjoy the upcoming ones!
