I've been getting the sense that a timeskip was going to happen after this arc for a while, seeing how Blue was probably going to be in Vermilion for some time and that'd maybe give Red an opportunity to train under Sabrina without missing out on his journey with Blue and Leaf. Well, now Leaf's temporarily incapacitated and Aiko's permanently incapacitated, and we're in the denouement process of an in-universe calamity. Whether or not a timeskip ends up happening, it certainly feels like an event this intense is fit to close off an "Act 1" of the story.

Aiko...like others have said, her death is depressing but not too surprising. I'm not sure when and how I started thinking she'd be the most likely to die - I think it was around the same time I started thinking a timeskip was incoming, taken together with her presentation as a mix between the three mains? (I.e. Having a mix of Red's rationality, Blue's battle-mania, Leaf's caring.) I'm not really looking forward to how they'd break the news to her father either - it was, after all, the trio's combined efforts that made Aiko go against her father's wishes - but I'm also not looking forward to how Red'll have to break the news to his friends. Leaf would probably take it bad at first; I'd guess she'd regret insisting Red go with Aiko and potentially have lost both of them, not just one. But Blue...seeing how Blue seems to look at Red as an equal, but holds everyone including himself to a high standard - I wonder if he'd blame Red for not doing better.

Also, something I noticed last chapter - this was exactly what Tori was talking about in the chapter before that, wasn't it. That part about how even when the Pressure's departed, it still primes people for the way it made them feel for a while afterwards. For the entire length of the last chapter, Aiko's been trying to overcompensate for her weakness during the Pressure and was having a hard time feeling afraid. The first part of it clearly factored into her decision to rush headlong after Jack. The second part probably did too, and she only risked her life because her usual warning signals that'd prompt her to re-assess how likely she was to lose just wasn't there.
