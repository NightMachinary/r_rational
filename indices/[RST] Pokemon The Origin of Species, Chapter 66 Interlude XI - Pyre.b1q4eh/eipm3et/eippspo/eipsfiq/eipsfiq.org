Oh, glad I didnt imagine it! And obv your story, go with what you want - i think it was the gravity of the situation that made it work, it had a vibe of "this act could go incredibly wrong, but eh fuck it lets part on a mental quip". Worked with her quiet-but-rebellious vibe she sometimes had, and people joke even in the darkest settings - and it matches her confidence going on vis a vis her decision. Still of course if that wasnt the vibe you wanted from her emotionally, then thats the call you want.
