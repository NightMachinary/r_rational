I agree 100%. Originally these last three chapters were going to be one long chapter entitled "Now You Know How Nice It Feels", because I didn't want to digress too far from the main theme of the ponies, but I also needed to establish some backstory so the ending arc would make sense.

But the chapter kept getting longer and longer, and somewhere around 20,000 words in, I made the call to split it into three chapters. I've tried to keep the delays between publishing the three chapters fairly minimal so as to avoid dragging the arc out.

Incidentally, I allude to the fact that they're an arc in the chapter titles, "Have You Heard, Part 1", "The Voyage", and "Have You Heard, Part 2" are the ending three tracks on the Moody Blues album "On The Threshold of a Dream", which when played back-to-back-to-back form one long song, (which is the lyric where the original title was drawn from). That song was also featured in a certain TV show in a certain context which is particularly relevant here.
