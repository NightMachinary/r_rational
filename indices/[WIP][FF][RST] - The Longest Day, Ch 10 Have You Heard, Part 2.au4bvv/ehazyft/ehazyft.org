While this story's expanding its focus, I'm afraid that it's in my mind starting to lose sight of the gem that's at its core. I wasn't expecting to read about Sombra and Bellatrix (why's she attacking Hogwarts now anyway?); I was expecting to - and looking forward to - read about Harry and Hermione and the Mane Six.

I hope that after this two-chapter digression, you'll be returning to those central plot arcs?
