#+begin_quote
  teacher gives Horry a not!time-turner that's already been through the loop once
#+end_quote

This was a mistake on her part, and I'm glad it got confiscated by F&G. If the not!time-turner was stuck in the same time loop, over and over, eventually it would break down and end the loop. It might take a thousand loops or a million, but eventually it would happen, causing all manner of problems for whichever Horry it broke on.

Of course, since she was explicitly stated as refusing to teach chronomancy, perhaps it was an understandable oversight on her part.
