Right, so that principle says "it's impossible to change the past". The problem is, between the time the first iteration started and the time the first iteration ended, the timetwistor will have lost a few atoms here and there to the effects of entropy, which means that the timetwistor which starts the second iteration is minutely different from the one that started the first iteration, which would be in violation of the Novikov principle.

Unless, of course, the timetwistors were charmed to be absolutely immune to the effects of entropy.

Actually it's probably that, now that I think about it.
