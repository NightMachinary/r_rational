  "So it's the Eldar wand?"

  "I dunno if ye could say that..."

  "Why not?"

  "Why what?"

  "Why can't I say it's the Eldar wand?"

  "Say what's the Eldar wand?"

  "Alvin's wand!"

  "What about it?"

Just to confirm, this is basically what happens when someone talks about a CLASSIFIED topic, right? They can't remember the contents of the discussion from moment to moment? Then what changed so that Horry can keep it straight but Horbid cannot? Or is it that Horry doesn't /know,/ so he's just guessing/asking, and Horbid /does know/ so he can't remember? And if that's the case, is there no way for Horry to ever get stuck under the CLASSIFIED magick himself, since no one will ever be able to "confirm" the truth?

I think it's pretty obvious that this is the case, but I was wondering if I misunderstood...
