Vampire girl was an underling of Quatach Ichl early in the story (Ch 26). She was the scion of some noble vamp clan on Ulquaan Ibasa. Author has stated elsewhere that she was supposed to be a lead in for Zorian to explore Ulquaan Ibasa during the second arc, but the thread got dropped because of time/pacing.
