I think the epilogue will focus a portion on this issue. The Eldemarian government had a major city destroyed, and a few of their Eagle Riders maimed by super powered beings out of nowhere. It's a pr disaster.

I always looked down on the Eagle Riders, and didn't realize they were strong enough to fight against Oganj for a few minutes. The last time they were in the story, they got their asses kicked easily when QI and Z&Z were fighting in that field.
