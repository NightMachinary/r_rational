I kinda liked the Zach (I Win) chapter. He did kinda broke down after feeling such remorse in losing Zorian. I know Zorian can be a jerk but it was the only way for Zach to be saved. You can kinda see how Zorian was trying to lighten Zach's mood by the end when there was someone who asked Zach if he was okay at the hill and showing some fireworks for celebration.
