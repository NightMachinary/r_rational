I was thinking the Simulacrum plasma body could morph into a liquid/gaseous state since he deformed his body when he was talking to the detective in the tavern.

Creating the core would be a lot tougher, but he could do something similiar like the Iasku Mansion soul. The necromancer dude used his wife's soul as the controller for the mansion, which Zorian could do something similar like that.
