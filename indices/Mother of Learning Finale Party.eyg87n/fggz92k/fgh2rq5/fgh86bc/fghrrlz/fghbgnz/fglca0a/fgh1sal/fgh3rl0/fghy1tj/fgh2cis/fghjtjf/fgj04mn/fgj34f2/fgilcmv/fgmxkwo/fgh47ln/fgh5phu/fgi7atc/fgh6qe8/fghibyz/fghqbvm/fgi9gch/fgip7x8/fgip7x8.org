Is there? Zorian's limited mana pool is often referenced, especially later on in the story. I don't remember readi g anything about regeneration dipping negative. As I understand mana takes a long time to naturally regenerate and that's why mana wells like the hole are popular for mages.

Anyways that's beyond my point. Zorian uses golem bodies for his simulacrums so they don't get destroyed easily in combat.
