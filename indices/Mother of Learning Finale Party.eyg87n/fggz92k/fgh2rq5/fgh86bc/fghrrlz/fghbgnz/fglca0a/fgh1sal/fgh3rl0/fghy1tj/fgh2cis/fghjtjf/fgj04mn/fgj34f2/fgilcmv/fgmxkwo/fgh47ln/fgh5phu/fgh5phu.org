Didn't he mention giving having his simulacra basically possess golem bodies? That seems much more efficient than making a hollow golem controlled from the inside by a normal golem.

I had just assumed that any time Zorian mentioned his simulacra in the final chapters, they were his golem-simulacra hybrids.
