  I think the epilogue will focus a portion on this issue. The Eldemarian government had a major city destroyed, and a few of their Eagle Riders maimed by super powered beings out of nowhere. It's a pr disaster.

It was by the Exiles, though, who are sort of a wild card when it comes to politics, and they can presumably get some great PR back by smashing the exiles, and helping The Isle would be bad optics for any of the other Splinters.
