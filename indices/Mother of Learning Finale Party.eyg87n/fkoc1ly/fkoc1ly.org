I loved the ending and i will sorely miss reading this story, i wish nobody103 would continue writing it after a few months break. something like he said he was considering: a slice of life following our characters in their life, probably after a time skip.

i can't convey how i loved this story, this world, these characters.

only one tiny thing still annoy me:

i'm still disapointed RR is really Jornak. i forgot what i was saying in my several analysis of the subject but Nobody103 got us used to crazy plot twists and Jornak came really late in the story. All others important characters were in the first 3 chapters beside Silverlake and Alanik (both living in the far north and unrelated to the time loop storyline until zorian meet them)

i guess i was just unimpressed with him. I believed until the very end he was actually a puppet for the real RR. I think i just wanted a better villain

Of course it's nothing compared to what this awesome story brought to the table
