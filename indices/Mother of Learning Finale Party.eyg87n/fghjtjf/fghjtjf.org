  I only wished to see more of the classmates and teachers in action during this battle, so we can get some of that delicious reaction. Alongside that, the author could have included a segment with Taramatula estate battle with the Ikosian forces.

While I'm not disappointed in what we got, I definitely agree that the different parts of the battle could easily have been dragged out into 3 more chapters following many more of the many characters and factions introduced throughout the book. I wonder if we'll get a lot of that in the epilogue. Ultimately though the story is about Zorian, so his bits were the parts I wanted, and we got that.
