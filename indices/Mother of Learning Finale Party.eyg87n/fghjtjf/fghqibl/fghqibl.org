Nobody103 hasn't really been big on writing perspectives outside Zorian's. If you've noticed, even Zach and Red Robe's perspective had been under the influence of Zorian's mind magic. So I dont think we'll find out much about the others.

I myself am disappointed on not knowing how Zach got the crown the first time.
