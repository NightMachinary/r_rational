Nobody103 has talked about this. Basically, putting a soft fleshy body inside of a golem just removes some of the best parts of golems, namely that they can survive pieces of their bodies being blown out.

As far as the simulacra go, they are actually built around golem bodies, its what make them more efficient and durable. Nothing as crazy as Mrva, but Mrva has a different precious cargo to hold on to.
