Both reasons are mentioned for the golem bodies, in chapter 74:

  He was a brand new type of simulacrum that the original had thought up recently -- instead of being embodied into an ectoplasmic shell like a regular simulacrum, he had been attached to a real matter golem body designed to mimic the original. This was a step up from the base spell in just about every regard, granting him vastly increased durability and halving his maintenance cost at the same time. It allowed Zorian to maintain twice the usual number of simulacrums and ensured that they wouldn't be destroyed by relatively minor damage.

  He could only maintain three simulacrums at most without his mana regeneration going negative, so that was not an entirely irrelevant cost.
