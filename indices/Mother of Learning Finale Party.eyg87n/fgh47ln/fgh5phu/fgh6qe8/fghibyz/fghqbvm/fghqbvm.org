AFAIK the reason explained for why Zorian does this is because simulacrums are made of ectoplasm and they can be dispersed with ease.

To effectively have the mind-web setup Zorian has at the end of the book he has to ensure his simulacrums don't just blow up to simple force spells.

Also I'm fairly certain the simulacrum spell only costs mana when creating a simulacrum. The magic system in MoL isn't defined very well but it really seems the only time you're burning mana at a constant rate is when you're consistently shaping mana.
