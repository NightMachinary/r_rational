He couldn't inhabit the golem, because he wasn't a simulacrum, he was the "real" one. And he /could/ have made another simulacrum to inhabit the Mrva golem the whole time, but he was trying to limit how many simulacra he made I think. I'm pretty sure earlier on he discusses different kinds of simulacra bodies, but I don't remember if there were tradeoffs or not.
