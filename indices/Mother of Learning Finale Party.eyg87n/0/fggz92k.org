I kind of want to see government reactions to Zorian. While he never has really had political aspirations, he's the best human mind mage who can bypass Mind Blank, connections to the psychic spiders living under Cyoria, the fancy teleportation grid thing, and the ability to do all of this and be at multiple places at the same time. People trying to fit him into their political calculus are going to be having a nightmare.
