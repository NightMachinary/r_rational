I think it's unusually hard for movies to be rational. They're under very tight time constraints, which often forces them to skim over obvious plot holes or move the story along by giving someone the idiot ball. Hollywood movies also have to appeal to an absurdly broad audience if they want to be profitable, which pushes them toward the median taste in plots and hurts their ability to experiment.
