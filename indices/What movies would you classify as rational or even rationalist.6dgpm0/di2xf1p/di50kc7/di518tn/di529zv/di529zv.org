Honestly, I'm never gonna find it. I think it was something like a TVTropes Wild Mass Guessing page or similar. No idea. But I remember it pretty well:

I think the ultimate explanation was that the time travel worked like the time travel in Michael Crichton's /Timeline/ -- parallel universe, not same timeline. The protagonists are confused by the fact that it takes the same amount of time to travel backward as it does forward, but that this is actually not indicative that they remain in the same universe.The reason they see themselves in the past is that it's some other, parallel copy of themselves that acts identical, and not actually them. Plus, the whole stuff with Granger or the phone call -- parallel timeline, no causality conflict.

If you haven't read /Timeline/, I suggest you do (great book!), but in case you haven't here's one of the main concepts, explained:

1. There are infinite timelines that progress at different rates "simultaneously" (e.g. there is a timeline we can cross over to that is currently in the Middle Ages).

2. You can cross over between timelines through the medium of the Quantum Foam.

3. There are an infinite amount of timelines that have the tech to BOTH disassemble a person and reassemble them in another timeline.

4. There are also infinite timelines that only have half of this process. They can either reassemble or disassemble but not both. They can still time travel by relying on the other half of the timelines to make up their knowledge gap.

The argument said that our heroes are actually missing some of the technology and that another universe is "helping" them along. We follow (at least initially) one set of heroes who don't realize that the rules keep changing on them as they are "reassembled" in a new universe each time. Then, later on, the heroes change to people who understand it but don't bother explaining it to us the viewer.

I don't think I explained it as well as the initial argument did, but if you see any flaws in it please point them out to me. They might either be my mistake or a general flaw I haven't considered.
