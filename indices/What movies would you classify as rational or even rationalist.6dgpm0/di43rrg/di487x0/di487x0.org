I can accept the premise for the duration of a movie.

I don't know if I would say that humans have free will, everything we do is a direct result of what comes before and it would probably be silly to say that the processes in a human brain are not deterministic in nature we are too big to be properly random. I don't however think that the universe itself is deterministic in such a way but a wavefunction doesn't exactly have free will just because it could collapse in different ways. My thoughts on free will on determinism are a bit confused and rambling it seems.
