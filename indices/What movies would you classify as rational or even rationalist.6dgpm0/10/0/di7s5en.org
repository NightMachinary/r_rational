The motives of the characters are not even slightly rational. They are entirely insane and ruin their own lives over magic tricks.

You get the power to duplicate things and creatures and humans and instead of using it for massive profit and create an economic revolution you use it to commit serial suicide?

The other guy is slightly less insane but still ruins his own life for one single magic trick.

Maybe it could be considered rational if we assume they are magic-trick-paperclippers, who only value magic tricks and everything else in the world exists only to serve that purpose. This is consistent with their behavior, but I hesitate to use the term rational to describe such an inhuman psychology.
