I don't think the story should count as internally consistent if it's too confusing and poorly made to figure out what's going on and the fans end up making graphs to explain the story only for there to still be plot holes left over like what happened with the guy from the future that led to them using the fail-safe machine.

I also didn't buy the characters' motivations as logical when I finally figured out what they were and I don't recall them actually utilizing creative problem solving. I don't get why people praise this movie so much since I think it makes no sense and ultimately accomplishes nothing with its story.
