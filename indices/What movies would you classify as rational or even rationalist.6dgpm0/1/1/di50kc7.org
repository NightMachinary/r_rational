I think one of the great points about Primer is how, despite the protagonists acting rationally, they are wrong.

Primer seems convoluted if you assume the time travel works the way the protagonists think it does. However, in reality they got it wrong.

I feel like shit because I can't find the article, but I read a really good breakdown of how there are some rules of the time travel that the protagonists don't understand. I think it's a great film where the idea is having a rationalist piece of fiction where the characters are still in the dark.
