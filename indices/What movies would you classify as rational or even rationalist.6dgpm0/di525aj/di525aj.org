I would argue for the Prestige.

Yes, there is one bit of "real magic" in the movie, but everything else is explained and the motives of the characters are rational with the exception of the initial revenge plot, which both pursue in rational ways.

Also, it's emphasis on how everything can be explained in a magician's tricks is very, very rationalist.
