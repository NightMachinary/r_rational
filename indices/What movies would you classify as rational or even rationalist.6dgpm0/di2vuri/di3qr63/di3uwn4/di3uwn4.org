Same group recently released [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVuNlu0LCk&][Firebringer]]. It takes place in the stone age and is about the discovery of fire. The protagonist is something of an inventor. When I backed it on Kickstarter I thought it wouldn't be very interesting, but I did it anyway because I like the group. The result was amazing.
