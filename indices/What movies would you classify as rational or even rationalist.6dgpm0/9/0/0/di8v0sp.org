Free will isn't about determinism, it's about how it feels when your brain subconsciously plans out your future actions. Whenever it feels like you by an exercise of free will /could/ do something if you wanted to, it's because your brain evaluates the proposed action and finds it to require negligible effort. (You could totally stand up from you seat /right now/ but you can't just go win a Nobel Prize.)

It is this feeling that has prompted ~2000 years of discourse. Also there's a medical term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboulia][for when people lose this ability.]]

Humans are deterministic (although currently only in theory) and also they have free will. The feeling of free will is about highly non-trivial planning ability.
