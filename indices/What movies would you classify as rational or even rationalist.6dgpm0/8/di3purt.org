[[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/europa_report/][Europa Report]] is a good sci-fi movie, and fits the rational criteria. There are plot points where other scriptwriters would have had the characters do stupid things for drama, but Europa Report doesn't go that direction. When characters conflict, they have good reasons, driven by their beliefs and values, and they approach the disagreements pretty reasonably.
