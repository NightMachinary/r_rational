That's what I'm here to find out!

Although it is very complex, I try to avoid complexity for complexity's sake. Whenever I add a mechanic or a system, it's either to permit deeper and more interesting decisions, or in some cases even just to make it easier to develop. The anatomy, affinity, and aspect systems all appear to add an incredible amount of complexity, but they also alleviate a certain amount of workload themselves by removing the need to, say, manually define move lists. Time will tell if this turns out to be an efficient trade.

Another design rule that I'm always keeping in mind, (but that doesn't always show through in these posts) is the concept of an /unfolding design/. The idea is to build systems in such a way that /scale/, that work as a whole if I put 10 hours of work into it or 100. This is mostly a matter of scope on the macro scale: first I aim for a game that lets you walk around a map that's generated from a template. Then I build a game that's the same thing but generates Pokémon for you to look at. Then I do the same thing but a game that has those Pokémon interact with you and lets you fight them. Then a game that also lets you catch and tame them.

And so on and so forth: by focusing on keeping each iteration self-contained and as complete as possible as a game, it keeps the idea of fun-ness and usability as central as possible. This concept has also been referred to as building in 'stripes' or 'layers', and hopefully it keeps everything grounded, no leaving big holes in the game with the hope that "it'll be fun once I fill it in later".

I still might end up way over my head with nothing to show for it, who knows. But I /think/ I can manage it; the burden of complexity is mostly in balancing the Pokémon data and not the systems that read that data, and I like to think I have a knack for that. We'll see, though; I'm as interested to see if it will work as you are! The point is to gain experience with this level of detail, after all, win or lose.
