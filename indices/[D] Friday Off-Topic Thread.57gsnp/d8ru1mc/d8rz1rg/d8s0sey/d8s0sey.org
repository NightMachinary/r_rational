Well I aim to start on that this week. I have made games before, but you're right that it's a lot of front-loaded design work. Part of that is because it's horribly complex, but part too is because I don't want to have to throw work out because systems turn out to not be compatible with one another. There's a lot of moving parts, and many problems can be avoided by thinking through the issue thoroughly. This process has also forced me to clearly define what this game /is/ and /isn't/ about. Having those sorts of limits are important rather than just throwing code together and hoping it all works.

Tarn Adams defined a list of things that he wanted in Dwarf Fortress, like, ten years ago /and he's still working on that same list/. Granted, I have no hope of being so dedicated or consistent, but there /is/ virtue in thinking it all out ahead of time so as to build each system with the whole in mind.

But to /actually/ answer your question, the two things I will start with are the hex grid/ movement and Pokémon generation. I aim to have map reading/writing and movement working by the new year, and a rudimentary Pokémon gladitorial simulator working by around the same time. The grid will allow me to start testing what speed, initiative, and movement mean in this game, while the gladiator combat will aid in defining how Pokémon are generated and allow the community to help start balancing individual Pokémon and move stats.
