Quick question: how close are you to making a prototype of this game? From the little I've seen, I feel like you're defining way more rules, mechanics and other gameplay elements than you should before having a playable version. You should have a prototype super early so you can test if the general mechanics are enjoyable and nothing in your system is broken. There are a lot of things that can look good on paper and go super wrong once people start playing your game, and you do /not/ want to find them after you've already spent hours building a system that depends on them.

On the other hand, I'm following this from afar, so I might be completely wrong, and I have no idea how much experience you have in game design.
