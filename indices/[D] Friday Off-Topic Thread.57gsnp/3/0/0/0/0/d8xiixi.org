CoCoSci. I've now slogged through too many neurosci papers whose constant refrains about the neuralness of neural nets are every bit as bad as machine learning papers. I'd rather deal with neurophysiologists when I need them and with half-decently descriptive theories the rest of the time.

Also my friend the neuroscientist hatrd his program for being too obsessively physiological.
