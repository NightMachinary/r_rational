I think I have depression. Many of the symptoms I've read about online apply to be, and I've been having something resembling episodes for the past year. I've decided that this isn't a problem that's going away on its own, so I've decided to seek professional help as soon as I can muster the will to do so. At the same time, though, admitting that to myself has improved my mood slightly. I'm still in a crappy state, but I feel more comfortable with it and a bit more confident that I can get better.
