Rather, you start as Kebab to make sure you can play for the first little while without dying horribly. You're well placed to see your first few wars and work out the mechanics surrounding them without much opposition. The game has enough mechanics to be hard to survive and you stand the best chance of figuring it all out painlessly if you play as one of the strongest countries of the time period.
