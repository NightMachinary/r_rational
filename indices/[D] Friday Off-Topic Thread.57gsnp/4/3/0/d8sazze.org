As soon as you're aware of that then unreasonable arguments are suddenly reasonable. There are plenty of things that are weird and unintuitive, such as Relativity and Quantum mechanics, that we nevertheless know are correct. Two people arguing about different models of Quantum Mechanics are going to both sound completely ridiculous to someone who only understands Newtonian physics, but if you recognize them both as experts then you lower your standards for understanding and so when they make analogies and give simplified explanations you decide that those sound reasonable, although still less reasonable than Newtonian physics that you understand.
