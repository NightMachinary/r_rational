I'm not sure what you mean, but I think EY's point was not about whether or not the arguments of n+1 players seem reasonable absolutely, but whether they both seem equally reasonable/unreasonable.

His point was that, if you can't distinguish a 'n+1 player' from a 'n+100 player', then you will be confused when people tell you in strong terms that the 'n+? player' is obviously better than the 'n+? player'. From your point of view, both players are very smart/sensible/incompetent/corrupt, so you think that anyone who strongly prefers one over the other is probably engaging in confirmation bias or something, because you assume that they can only see what you see.
