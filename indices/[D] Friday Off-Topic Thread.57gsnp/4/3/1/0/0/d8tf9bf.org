The Dunning-Kruger phenomenon may or may not exist at all, and most certainly doesn't exist in the way it is usually understood (including the wikipedia article about it).

The Dunning-Kruger experiments found that, on average, people consider their "competence" to be closer to average (well, slightly above average) than they are.

- People who have a 10 think they have a 30
- People who have a 40 think they have a 50
- People who have a 90 think they have a 70

I'm inventing the numbers, but the idea is there: incompetent people know they're incompetent, but they're a bit off as to how incompetent they are, and vice-versa. The more someone is competent, the more they think they're competent. DK explain it as "being more competent gives you more tools to see your limits", another explication is that this is a statistical phenomenon, basically people's estimation of themselves being noisy towards "higher than average competence", with return to the mean when they do get closer to that level.

As a personal note, I found out about this recently, after noticing it felt like a meme that would spread independently of its accuracy. Confirming that it was more or less an urban legend made me decide to never trust or quote any popular finding in psychology/sociology/etc that I hadn't verified myself, including but not limited to: Milgram's experiment, The Stanford Prison Experiment, that one experiment about conflicts where they opposed two groups of kids, The Peter Principle, The Talos Principle (wait, no, not that one), the Asch conformity experiments, etc.

EDIT: Also, I'm not sure you understood my point. What I was saying was that, if you saw a n+1 commentator having a strong opinion on two n+?, you'd think the commentator is unreasonable to differentiate them so much since they both seem undistinguishable, so you'd assume that the commentator only has their opinion because of some bias, even if their opinion is actually well-formed.
