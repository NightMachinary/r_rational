  never trust or quote any popular finding in psychology/sociology/etc that I hadn't verified myself, including but not limited to: Milgram's experiment, The Stanford Prison Experiment, that one experiment about conflicts where they opposed two groups of kids, The Peter Principle, The Talos Principle (wait, no, not that one), the Asch conformity experiments, etc.

Excellent decision! For example, [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201310/why-zimbardo-s-prison-experiment-isn-t-in-my-textbook][here]] is a wonderfully detailed (and referenced) article disputing the standard interpretation of the Stanford Prison experiment. In summary: the methodology was designed to get shocking results in order to sell mass-market books!
