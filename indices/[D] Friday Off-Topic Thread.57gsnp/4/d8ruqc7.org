Mr. Yudkowsky made some interesting Facebook posts on the topic of Donald Trump: [[http://i.imgur.com/thz1QIC.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/KSDguWs.png][2]]

/[[http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4][Europa Universalis IV]]/ is a "grand strategy" game, in which the player controls a country between 1444 and 1821. It's been derided by some people as "mindless map painting", as it's rather abstracted--especially in comparison to its predecessor. The goal of [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234109254][the MEIOU & Taxes user modification for EU4]]* is to replace abstraction with properly realistic (rational?) simulation. For example:\\
- In vanilla EU4, the player can click a button and spend abstracted "monarch points" to gain abstracted "development points" in a province. In M&T, this button is removed; instead, each point of development represents ten thousand people (with exhaustively-researched numbers at the start of the game in the year 1356), and the population of a province gradually rises or falls depending on the circumstances (war, famine, terrain, crops, etc.).\\
- In vanilla EU4, if a player sends a missionary to a province, the province typically will be converted from its original religion to the state religion in at most 100 months, if it can be converted at all. In M&T, only ten percent of a province's population (divided into twenty-one separate pieces, of which each can have its own religion) can be converted by a single missionary, and decades may pass before the majority religion of a heathen province becomes the state religion.

The release of MEIOU & Taxes 2.0, which will bring the accuracy of the simulation to [[http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/42atyf][even greater heights]] (e.g., large cities will import food from agricultural provinces, will produce special urban goods, and will have large influence on trade), [[http://i.imgur.com/tDG8Li4.png][is drawing ever closer...]]

*The Steam Workshop version is the most convenient link for me to place here. The vast majority of discussion takes place on [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/839][the Paradox forums]]--but it's accessible only to people who have registered EU4 there.
