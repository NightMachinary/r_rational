The only reservation I have is that Worm wasn't really a superhero story, at least after Leviathan. It was more like a modern dark fantasy, bordering on horror, where the characters just happen to have unique powers and wear masks. It's still good, but it needs a more consistent identity all the way through to avoid disappointing superhero fans the same way it did for me.

After Leviathan, the story stopped being something I wanted to read and the superhero trappings made less and less sense given the state of the world. If it had been more clear that I was in for something out of a seinen instead of something like Daredevil or Watchmen, I wouldn't have been put off that it defied basic genre conventions of superhero stories after an AMAZING start.
