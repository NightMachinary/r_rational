That's the problem, though. Worm feels like a superhero story written by someone who doesn't like the genre. People like me who are fans of it understand that some of the tropes can be dumb, but we get past that because we enjoy the core of the stories. We're still happy to see more realistic takes on the genre, at this point we're demanding it, but if that core is changed then we won't enjoy the story.

The reason why Watchmen was a fantastic deconstruction was because it stayed true to the central theme of superheroes while turning every other trope on its head. It wasn't beloved because it was realistic, in many ways it was as goofy as ever, but because it gave people new insight into stories they loved. Madoka Magika, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and HPMOR succeeded for the same reasons.

A lot of people like Worm, and that's fine, there's a lot to like about it and I like a lot of it too. But it's a story that defies the themes superheroes are built around. It creates a world that resembles a superhero verse on the surface but lacks any of the same substance. It should carve out an identity for itself separate from the superhero genre so it can be appreciated for what it is instead of what it isn't.
