Right, but this just incentivizes people to favor simplistic analogies more likely to misrepresent complex issues, fueling the exact scenario of viewing one player as someone who may not seem quite reasonable. Examples are myriad with pop culture academics.

I disagree with your first statement. It is a matter of attempting to discern the reasonable from the more easily digestible when the audience lacks awareness of what is correct.

I don't see how listening to purported experts with differing opinions would cause me to lower my requirements for believing the arguments a particular person is putting forth. For the sake of the problem it's not helpful to assume outside verification of expertise, when for example you reach the cutting edge of knowledge in certain types problems.
