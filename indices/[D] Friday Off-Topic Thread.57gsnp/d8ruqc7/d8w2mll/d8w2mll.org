EY should avoid politics, he makes no sense. He admits Clinton is hawkish against Russia, and supports a no fly zone in Syria, which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says would be impossible without declaring war on Russia.

Then claims 'Maybe you heard that Trump said maybe we shouldn't defend NATO countries if Russia invades' and that is somehow worse? Despite the fact *Trump didn't say that* how is demanding allies hold up their agreements in the case of war with Russia a bigger risk of nuclear war than provoking that war?

The comments on that are hilarious as well. In response to:

  So by your comment, Trump did NOT say it [...] I loathe Trump. But I loathe misquotes in order to persuade people to one's own views, even more.

  What sources are you reading, other than the two I linked? I'm finding lots of relevant experts paraphrasing his comments as "maybe".

'Relevant experts' ie. media partisans who are no doubt more knowledgable than mere Joint Chiefs. Imagine someone argued to EY he was obviously wrong about some AI topic because he didn't understand the difference between levels a and b of the subject, and all these phd's who have decades of experience obviously know better.

Then imaging those experts experience was the AI equivalent of voting for the Iraq war.
