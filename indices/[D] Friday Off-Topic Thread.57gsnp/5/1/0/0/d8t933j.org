I'm not a fan of overly-generic RPG systems (or, for that, matter, overly generic game engines, but that's probably a flaw in my reasoning). I have a hard time putting why into words, and I haven't yet seen a snappy article describing the concept, but I feel that at some point abstractions in code should be flow from either existing structures that you want to interface, or for specific structures you're planning to add, and not the other way around.

I really have no example to give, because I can't think of any "They did this -> It caused problems -> They should have done that instead" dynamic. So I'm starting to doubt myself here.
