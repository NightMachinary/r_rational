Mostly what I'm talking about is cohesive damage-types, consistent ways of measuring hit-points, damage, and the like.

My idea is that if you want, say, a quake like twitch-shooter you import standard characters, then give them traits that give them the features you want. In this example, a consistent amount of health, floaty-movement, infinite stamina, and perfect aim (or make guns with perfect aim).

RPG-ish stuff gives you the basic behavior, which you can then completely override.

Hopefully that means a platoon of WW2 soldiers can take down a quake-soldier, in enough numbers.

Start with something that approximates real-life, and then break the rules for particular genres.

I'm very interested in counter-arguments to this though.
