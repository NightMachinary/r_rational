The github page says it's intended to be used as a real engine. How good is the API?

The main thing that turned me away from Minetest (outside of the general poor quality of the baseline game) is that, while it has the perfect tools to help you make your own version of Beta-Stage Minecraft, with your own (very dumb) mobs, your own XP/potion-making/spell-casting/enchanting system, and your own ores for making yet another bunch of pickaxes/shovels/swords, it's incredibly hard to make an original game with it.

You can't make a tower defense because the game doesn't support mobs, and the mods that add mobs don't include pathfinding or aiming, you can't make a Sim-City style game because there's almost no support for interfaces other than the classic inventory bar, etc.

So if you really want the engine to be used, I'd recommend trying to make your own games (and/or get other people to do the same) in various genres that aren't usually associated with Minecraft, and learn from the experience. How good is your engine for making a hack-and-slash? A strategy game? A racing game? A survival game in space where you must mine asteroids to repair the breaches in your space station while desperately trying to hold off against waves of monster that feed on electricity, trying to survive until help arrives? If I ever make a boxel game engine, these are the kind of games I want to see pop up.
