A voxel is a coordinate in 3D space (in a rigid grid). A boxel is a voxel with a box around it, and textures.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km0DpZUgvbg][Here's]] a voxel engine without boxels, in much higher resolution then minecraft.

You can think of voxels as a PNG image, and boxels as a tile-engine.

But for the most part, you can probably use boxel and voxel interchangeably.

EDIT: better example engine.
