  I'd say the problem is that the 'life' attribute of an entity, and the whole damage system surrounding that entity, is a product of the surrounding gameplay and can't necessarily be translated to a different gameplay without reworking it from the ground up.

This is a particularly interesting point. For example: Dwarf Fortress doesn't have health points at all, but actually tracks tissue damage to each organ - and inflicts it based on material properties including armour.

I still think it's a reasonable system to provide by default, but ideally it would be possible to substitute in something else.
