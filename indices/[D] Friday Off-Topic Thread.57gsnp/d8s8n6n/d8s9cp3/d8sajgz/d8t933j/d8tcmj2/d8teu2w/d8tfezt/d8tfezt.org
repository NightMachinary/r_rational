I'm imagining in that example that MOBA heroes would just be stronger in general, if killing them is a big deal.

The trick of it is that I'm not worried about balance. You want your D&D fighter to be able to compete with legendary archtypes? Pick up some goodies from transhuman space.

Once you throw the idea of balance out of the window, it becomes a lot more reasonable. And real life isn't balanced anyway. A quake soldier is probably going to be able to handle even an experienced and well equipped platoon of WW2 Soldiers, etc.

Gurps wasn't balanced either. If you want to create a balanced game you're going to have to go further then just importing assets and behaviors from another game.
