Worm is a deconstruction of the genre. Pre-Leviathan was making the point that, on the surface, a world looking like the superhero verses might make sense. Post-Leviathan was throwing all the glaring problems with these verses into harsh light.

For instance, the biggest problem with superhero verses that they never, ever take a look at in a satisfactory way is collateral damage. You expect me to believe that Galactus is devouring large sections of the world, or that Parallax is eating entire cities, or any of the other extinction-level events in these worlds are happening, and that none of the cities look like warzones? You expect me to believe that, after Superman gets thrown through multiple buildings, there's no evidence in Metropolis that this has happened before, that buildings are damaged?

Superhero verses have some sort of magical fix-everything-ium. All the destruction and obliteration happening onscreen never has effects on future episodes, like it was just wiped away. In Worm, though, Leviathan shows up and then Brockton Bay never recovers. Which is exactly what we see in the real world when massive natural disasters hit nations unable to absorb the losses.

In addition, you have the problem of the heroes being too "good" to ever consider killing anyone, from Batman's pathological aversion to using anything resembling a lethal weapon to Superman deliberately pulling punches. /This makes no goddamn sense!/ In the real world, the Joker would accidentally fall down the stairs four or five times the second or third time he escaped from Arkham. Hell, he might not even survive Arkham! I take as evidence the case of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer who killed over 100 people around 5 years ago. Norwegian prisons are famous worldwide for being really, really nice, and his "cell" is more of a luxury apartment by comparison to prisons most everywhere else. He's attempting to sue, though, because they won't let him leave that cell for any reason. Why? Because all of the other prisoners in the facility have sworn that they will kill him on sight. These are patriotic Norwegians, a nation with the lowest recidivism rates in the developed world, and one of the lowest overall crime rates, and they are vowing to murder the guy.

That's the prisoners. That says nothing about someone who might actually be able to get away with killing him in a "tragic accident." And that is what would happen to the Joker in reality.

So. Worm turns that on its head and gives us Jack Slash. Crazy, obsessed with knives, no obviously busted superpowers other than charisma, /and makes a point of not getting caught because he knows that he will die if he does./ Marvel and DC have this thing about how killing is always a bad idea and about constantly bringing back characters who should have kicked it already. Worm neatly sidesteps that problem.

Leviathan is the wake-up call. It's saying "Hey, you know all those tropes of a superhero verse? They make no sense, and here's why." It replaces those tropes with grim reality, a world where the heroes must kill on occasion, a world where most of the villains just dropped into villainy accidentally. A world where bureaucratic efficiency overtakes the common good, where the heroes are often wrong and the villains...not right, but not wrong either.

A world much like our own, in some respects.
