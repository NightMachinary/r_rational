  Worm feels like a superhero story written by someone who doesn't like the genre. People like me who are fans of it understand that some of the tropes can be dumb, but we get past that because we enjoy the core of the stories. We're still happy to see more realistic takes on the genre, at this point we're demanding it, but if that core is changed then we won't enjoy the story.

What? There are plenty of superhero stories around by people who don't like superheros, and they don't look anything like Worm. If this was actually the case the author would have pruned off the superhero parts and ended up with urban fantasy or something similar. That's what a lot of urban fantasy and science fiction is. Superhero stories by people who don't like superheros.

Worm is about finding logical in universe reasons to explain all the things that happen in regular superhero stories but don't actually make sense. Heroes have got to fight when they first meet 'cause (out of universe) the comic book reader wants to see that? Okay, have a shard driven urge to conflict to explain that.

Reed Richards is useless (no science hero bothers to use their amazing tech for anything but superheroing)? Okay, have a Simurgh specifically hunting for any Reed Richards' that are about to make good, plus various tinker power restrictions.

Villains don't get killed off permanantly and prison is a revolving door? Okay, have regular Endbringer fights which necessitate preserving every superpower in the hopes that it might someday allow for a combo to save the day or the world, and hence a system designed to keep villains busy but not dead.

Does it seem rather odd that almost everyone decides to put on a costume and either declare themselves a hero or villain? Have a not particularly covert government propaganda and PR program to narrow down the decision space that people think in when they consider they should do with new powers, which is devoted to finding something not /too/ damaging for all these conflict seeking semi-psychotic people with superpowers (both heroes and villains) to do to keep themselves busy yet alive for the Endbringers.

Etc.
