I don't know.

I love Worm to bits, but it's absolutely massive in every sense of the word. I can't fathom what the SFX budget would have to look like to truly do justice to fights like Leviathan's or Behemoth's. Not to mention the fact that it's currently longer than all Lord of the Rings and Harry Potters combined.
