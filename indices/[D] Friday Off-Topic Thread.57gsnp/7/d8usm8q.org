*New Demiurge seeks suggestions*

"Sorry for interrupting; I mean you no harm, and I need to ask your advice on something.

"In terms you might be familiar with, I found a glitch in reality, bootstrapped myself to having root authority over the universe, fixed the glitch, and discovered that there are entities out there that want to do the equivalent of using our universe as a CPU to send nine-dimensional spam. To keep that from happening, I have to turn myself into something pretty in-human. I'm not giving any other people access to outside-the-universe, but I don't want to lose the things about the universe I value, so I'm keeping part of my human mind around and am asking everyone for advice about what to do with the universe. Yes, I mean /everyone/.

"No, aliens don't exist in-universe, it's just Earthly humans. If souls exist, I don't have access to them. I can't bring back the dead in the sense you mean - you can think of me as being able to rearrange matter and energy. I can do some magic tricks if you want proof, as long as they don't bother anyone else. Right now, nobody is in any physical pain, and anyone who asks for a change to their body gets it. I'm trying to work out protocols for people who may not be considered competent to make decisions for themselves. And I'm trying to work out protocols for when people disagree about anything else I should do. I'm not saying I'm going to follow your advice, but I /am/ going to listen to you and carefully consider it.

"So: what do /you/ think I should do?"
