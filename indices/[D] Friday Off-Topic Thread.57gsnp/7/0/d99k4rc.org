Outsource parts of the problem to us. You have a lot of power, but not necessary the mental capacity to handle it. You even say that you need to change your mind/body to handle the problems. So break down whatever you have to deal with into chunks and whichever chunks you think is safe for us to help out with, send it to us with some rewards as incentive.

Preferably after you alter our world into one without any death or meaningless suffering as a post-scarcity society that is.
