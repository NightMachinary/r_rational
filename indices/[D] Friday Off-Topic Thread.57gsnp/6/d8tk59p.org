I've been following /Star Wars Rebels/, which is currently in the middle of its third season, which introduces Grand Admiral Thrawn, probably the most popular character from /Legends/ books.

While Thrawn is way more menacing than usual /Rebels/ villains, I feel he's still a downgrade from trilogy!Thrawn. The awesomeness of the original Thrawn wasn't that he looked very smart. It was that his plans /were/ smart, and made obvious sense. Every single important decision he made was visibly optimized to increase his chances to win. Whereas one of his major decisions in the last /Rebels/ episode to date (let his enemies go after they blew up their own base, ostensibly as part of some greater plan) visibly decreased them.

The show got most of his personality right, though I'm a bit ticked off at the parts where he personally uses physical violence (he needs a Noghri bodyguard); the studying art is there, the way he captures Hera is well done, and the show seems to imply he ran drills to train the stormtroopers to navigate the local environment. But what I feel is the core of Thrawn, the uncompromising search for victory? Isn't there.

Trilogy!Thrawn wouldn't have let the rebels escape. He would have either executed Ezra or kept him securely locked up in his ship, and shot down the Phantom as soon as the hostage exchange was over. There was no gain in letting them go. The intelligence he did get about Twi'lek mentality was not worth letting two Rebel leaders and two jedi go, especially since he could have had both. And while it was shown that letting them go was somehow part of his plan, I'm pretty sure that whatever this plan will turn out to be, it will work worse than it would have if he'd just killed them when he could.

Also, as much as Thrawn himself is well done and mostly faithful to the Heir trilogy, I wish Disney hadn't gone for the easy route of making him look smart by surrounding him with stupid/slow underlings. Book!Thrawn was almost always surrounded and opposed by smart, or at least competent people, which made his genius all the more apparent when he outsmarted them. Pellaeon in particular was a key part of Thrawn's character: he was both fairly dull and unimaginative, and very competent, aware of his limitations, and perfectly capable of understanding subtext, following Thrawn's reasoning and coming up with his own insights. Governor Price and agent Kallus could have that role, but neither of them has the military position that would justify following him around and serving as his foil. And Admiral Konstantine and Captain Slavin are very poor foils.ï»¿
