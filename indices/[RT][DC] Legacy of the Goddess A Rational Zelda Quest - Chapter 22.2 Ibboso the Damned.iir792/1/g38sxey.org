*Announcement:*

My co-QMs are strongly in favor of moving the quest back to SV, and despite my other objections, I have been convinced of the merits. As the [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/588230711987798026/744749079032103023][Discord poll]] was a resounding "¯\/(ツ)//¯", we will be moving back to SV in the coming days. Given the prior retcon, this will be a new thread since it will be less hassle to post the chapters anew than to edit old ones in the old thread. As such, please hoId off on voting until the new quest thread is announced.

(One of us will continue to crosspost to r/r -- voting just won't happen here. You can also [[https://chaossnek.com/Account/UpdatePreferences][subscribe]] directly on the site if you just want story updates.)

Your previous VP total was 10193.

In chapter 21, Fi spent:

- 24 VP on telepathic communications
- 10 VP on one intangible avatar (with Zelda)
- 130 VP on thirteen intangible avatars (translating/dictating books with Link)
- 200 VP on two ethereal avatars

Marking Taetus was successful, and cost 2658 VP. He now bears an active mark.

In chapters 22.1-22.2, Fi spent:

- 60 VP on telepathic communications
- 10 VP on one intangible avatar
- 300 VP on three ethereal avatars
- 639 VP on attempting to Compel Link (twice)
- 399 VP on attempting to Compel Koja
- 263 VP on attempting to Compel Grenja
- 453 VP on attempting to Compel Ryn

Fi spent 10 of her stored magic restoring Link and 167 restoring Ryn. This comes out of her previously stored magic, leaving her with 795 remaining.

Chapters 21-22.2 spanned 2 days. During that time, you earned: * 64 VP from Zelda * 108 VP from Link * 27 VP from Taetus (only from chapter 22)

You have earned an additional 167 VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus. Total: 334.

*You currently have 5580 VP.*
