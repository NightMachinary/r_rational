A report:

Two hours and sixteen minutes prior to my most recent update, Link and his party departed their campsite on horseback. One hour and two minutes later, at approximately five hundred and fourteen meters from their supposed destination, the party dismounted and proceeded on foot. They stopped in front of an obelisk of unknown construction and unknown origin for a period of twelve minutes, twenty-six seconds. At this time I sensed a potent magical presence and attempted to inform Link of such. I received no response or acknowledgement.

Notably, I observed no communication between members of the party during the interval between them dismounting and the aforementioned event. My models overwhelmingly suggested Link and the others were being adversely mentally influenced by the aforementioned magical presence. I attempted to inform Link of such and received no response or acknowledgement. I unsuccessfully attempted to Compel Link to leave the area. It was at this point I alerted Zelda to the potential danger.

Three minutes and thirty-five seconds later, the party entered the pass. Eleven minutes later, they came upon the ruins of a small town. From my observation of the weathering patterns of the stone buildings, I estimated the age of the ruins to be between three-hundred and eight-hundred years old. The ruins appeared to be uninhabited. I attempted to inform Link of such and received no response or acknowledgement.

Upon entering the ruins, the party came to a halt for a period of one minute, twelve seconds. At this time, I noted adrenal stress responses from each of the party members and informed Zelda of such. I also observed that Ryn was using magic at an unusually high frequency. As per Zelda's suggestion, I restored Ryn's magic and again attempted to Compel Link and the others to flee the location. The attempt was unsuccessful.

Grenja, Koja, and Ryn then proceeded to the remains of a stone building approximately forty-three meters away. Thirty-three seconds later, Link sprinted to the same location. The party remained at this location for thirty-one minutes. During this interval I observed no communication. Additionally, the party continued to exhibit signs of physiological and psychological stress.

At this time, Link and Ryn departed the building and proceeded to the remains of a ritual burial site on a hill overlooking the town. They arrived at its central structure four minutes and twenty-nine seconds later. After eight minutes of inaction, Link used approximately seventy-three percent of his magical reserves on a single Soothe effect. As per standard operating procedure, I restored his magic. One minute, twelve seconds later, Link used Invigorate at his observed maximum capacity, consuming sixty-five percent of his reserves, and then Scry moments later. It then that I ceased being able to sense his presence.
