At the end of 22.2, it was very likely that Ibosso had taken over Link's body, which would either involve extinguishing Link's consciousness or merely "pushing it out of the driver's seat." If the former were true, Link would be dead. If the latter were true, while the situation would be less dire, Link would no longer be a player character.

And that's before we even ask whether Link's team of Sheikah survived.

If you're coming from chapter 23, then you probably already know the answers to a lot of these questions.
