Welp, I'm dropping reading this quest. There's a sweet spot between being GRRM and killing everyone and plot armor always saving the day, and this isn't it. I would also be okay if we could see the "show" behind Ganondorfs plan, revel in a villian succeeding, but with the "tell" we are given, we can't. So... I as a reader don't care about the characters left sufficiently.

My advice is to offer to redo the last arc, with some serious penalty, but I doubt that anyone will see this.
