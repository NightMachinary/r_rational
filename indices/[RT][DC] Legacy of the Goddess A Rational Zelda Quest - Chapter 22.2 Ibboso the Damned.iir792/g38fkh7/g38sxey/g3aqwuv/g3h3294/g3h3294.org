Hi, longtime reader/lurker of LotG here. This chapter was super depressing to read--I've been invested in Link's character arc since the beginning, and I don't want it to come to a close. Losing him has been really demoralizing and it'll take me some time to process what's happened.

â€‹

For a variety of reasons, my life circumstances haven't permitted me to be an active participant in this quest, but I wanted to wish the current active participants the best of luck and--as a personal request--ask that they try their darndest to get Link back. I don't know whether his consciousness can be saved from whatever Ibosso has done to him, but I really hope it can be.
