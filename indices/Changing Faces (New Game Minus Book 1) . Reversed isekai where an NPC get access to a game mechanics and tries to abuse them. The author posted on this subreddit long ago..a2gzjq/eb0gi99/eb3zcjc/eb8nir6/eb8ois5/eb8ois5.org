Yeah. Though I should note that as I continue reading, he seems to be doing more reading and information gathering so that he can exploit the system than he did at the beginning. His dismissing them seems to have been an initial reaction to them suddenly showing up and constantly spamming him with mostly redundant information about rocks and trees and stuff, with the relevant information buried in all of the noise. He still should have paid more attention at the beginning, but he seems to be adapting more as the story progresses and he gets used to it.
