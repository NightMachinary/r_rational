I'm actually super down for a character who attempts to be rational but has different assumptions and biases due to culture. I would be very frustrated though by a character that refuses to gather as much information as possible to help in decision making. That seems anti-rational regardless of baseline assumptions. (Unless your base assumptions are from some kind of horror world where knowledge leads to death or consequences due to some inherent rules of the universe or something.)
