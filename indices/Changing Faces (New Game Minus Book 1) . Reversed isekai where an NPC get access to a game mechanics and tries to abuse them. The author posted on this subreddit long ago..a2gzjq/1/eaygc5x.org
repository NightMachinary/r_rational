Pitch:

The world is a classic RPG game. Adventurers come in kill liches and go back to their boring lives. Our protagonist is an NPC that switched souls with such an adventurer. So we see his interactions with the same world from a PC point of view, his fight with game mechanics and his tries to find game developers and eat their faces.
