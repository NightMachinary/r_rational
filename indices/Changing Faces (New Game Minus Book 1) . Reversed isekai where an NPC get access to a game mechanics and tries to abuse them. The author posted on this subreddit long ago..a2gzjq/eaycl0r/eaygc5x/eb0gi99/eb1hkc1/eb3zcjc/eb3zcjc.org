I just got it also have read the first few chapters, and I sort of agree. The main character is attempting rationality, but with a whole bunch of weird cultural biases and assumptions that are different than the biases and assumptions of a modern day human.

He doesn't understand game mechanics, his dismissal of the boxes advice and not reading every single line of text explanation is by far the biggest mistake he keeps making, but he's not used to playing games where you have to read the instructions to learn all of the mechanics.

He's spent his whole life being rational by his own perception of such a thing. Might makes right, magic is awesome, emotions and bodily functions are unneccesary distractions. And he munchkined to some degree by becoming undead and having his followers be undead so they no longer have to put up with these distractions. He's used to exploiting his universe one way, and now these game mechanics are a complete paradigm shift that need to be exploited in a different way, and he's only partially sucessful at realizing this.
