There's no rule against posting Amazon links, and probably never will be (same for any other commercial site).

That said, I do think that submission statements are more important if there's no way to judge quality without spending money, and to reduce the appearance/presumption that it's just being posted here because this is a place where people read fiction, rather than because it's actually a good fit.
