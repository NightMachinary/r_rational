My main problem with Breaking Bad is that the protagonist, who is evil, ends up getting what he wants. He gets to, in his own eyes, undo anything bad, by saving Jesse and dying "heroically". I think it was a goddamn shame that the writers didn't force everyone to confront the fact that Walter White was a piece of arrogant shit (who was surprisingly lovable) by having everything he ever wanted torn away from him in a brutal and realistic manner (eg, going to jail, having his work exposed, not saving Jesse).

I feel like despite his very, very evil acts he still got what he wanted, and at that point it wasn't about the fact that we needed to still like him. I think the real coup de grace of the show would have been him, alone and broken, in jail, for the very real and horrible crimes he committed.
