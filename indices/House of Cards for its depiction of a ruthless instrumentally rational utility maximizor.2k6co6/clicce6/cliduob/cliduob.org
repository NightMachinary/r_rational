An utterly fantastic character piece. Walter White is one of the most fascinating villains of modern fiction. And he's well-written enough that, even to the last episode, a significant portion of the fanbase still believes that he's the hero. I firmly believe that the final season (and "Ozymandias" in particular) is the greatest piece of television ever produced. It beats out even /The Wire/ and /The Sopranos/ at their very best.

The first season is more of a black comedy than a drama, playing up the apparent ridiculousness of the situations that the still criminally-inept White keeps dropping himself into, but the tone keeps getting darker and darker until by the third series there's very little left to laugh about. It's also really, really easy to binge through the whole lot.

That said, none of the characters are strictly rational in the sense that this sub goes for. Walter is driven entirely by ego, despite his protestations to the contrary, and will make terrible decisions because he simply doesn't want to lose, or to look piteous. The chemistry uses more-or-less accurate terms but not in a way that anyone could hope to replicate without sitting down to study it for themselves (and there's a lot of dramatic licence thrown in too).
