Path to world domination.

Exploitable interactions.

1. You can level up a skill to beyond human levels, as with running.

2. You can develop a skill by reading a book.

3. You get more experience the stronger a lifeform is.

So first, read a number of books on programming, nanotechnology, AI development, AI ethics, life extension, genetic manipulation, cloning, cybernetics and robotics, cooking, inspirational writing and machine gun use. All of those skills should help you start the singularity.

Injure yourself with cutting, poison, and such regularly to increase your durability. Improve your cooking skills so you can better restore your health. Use the storing ability to steal enough valuable goods to get starter funds 10-20k should do it. Fly to a third world country with good food on you for health, buy a machine gun, and gun down a load of extremely strong wild animals. Use this to enhance your intellect to high levels.

Using your superior intellect grind a number of your skills and work on acquiring greater funds. Cracking security systems and stealing money seems like something you'd be well suited to doing, or private investigation. Gather more money while grinding skills, grinding charisma and constitution and wisdom.

With more money get your sailoring skills up, go to a third world country, buy some heavy weaponry, and get a trustworthy crew together to slaughter some whales. These are the largest and strongest lifeforms on the earth, should give you more exp.

Use these levels to further advance your intellect and charisma and start working to build an organization in support of your goals. Broadly speaking, human enhancement, reviving dead species, and cybernetics. Your immense charisma and increasing skills on whatever necessary areas- public speaking, organization management, fund raising, all that- should make this easier. Work on building up your wealth more, to the hundreds of thousands to millions level.

Next, find an appropriate country, and buy a tank.

Cybenetically work on linking rat or monkey brains into the tanks and controlling them. Try and get your ability to identify them as one organism. If you can get this to work you have an exploitable source of potent exp. Use this to level up.

Regardless, continue to advance all your skills to inhuman levels. Revolutionize fields, earn money doing so, win more supporters. If you succeed at creating a cybernetic tank work on ever larger mechanical monstrosities and the mechanical skills needed to maintain them.

Eventually, work on cloning and genetically engineering dinosaurs and megafauna. Work on increasing their mental and physical levels to immense levels, cybenetically enhance them, and kill them. Use nanotechnology to increase their strength further. Others can help you in restraining them. Continue to increase charisma and intelligence as necessary.

Eventually, build a strong AI and use it to take over the world.
