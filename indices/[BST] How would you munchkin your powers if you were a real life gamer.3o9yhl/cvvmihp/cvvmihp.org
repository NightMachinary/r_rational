  Killing any life form gives experience based on it's level which is an abstraction of it's strength. Killing anything beneath you will give less experience eventually resulting in zero experience gained. Killing things above your level will give scaling experience. You must kill the life form with no help to get full experience, you will lose percentage experience based on percentage of damage done (If someone deals half damage and you deal half damage you get half experience).

This sounds like paradise for bombers. And if you level up these:

- Pickpocketing
- Stealth
- Bombing

you can pull Fallout trick with making people explode in their pants through reverse pick-pocketing an explosives on them.

Also your inventory can be used like a refrigerator.
