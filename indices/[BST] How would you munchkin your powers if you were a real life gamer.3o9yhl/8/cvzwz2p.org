Honestly, I always feel that it's better to have "Stats spent" added to some separate pool that isn't counted against your un-purchased stats for increasing them via repetition. It's extremely counter-intuitive to never want to spend your stat points because doing so destroys your potential.

I know that's the way it's often portrayed in fiction about this sort of thing, but having it as is has always just felt really obnoxious to me.
