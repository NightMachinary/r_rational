My thinking, by having the abilities tied explicitly to killing, would be to have the Gamer be the antagonist in the story. Have them do one of the things others in the story mentioned, hunting big game, bombing major cities, etc, and then have the story unfold that the rest of the world starts to band together to stop/kill them.

Possibly this is even the main character's motivations, she wants the entire world to focus on one enemy to unite in hate or something similar.
