1) Get a job in a slaughterhouse, ideally for cattle or other large animals 2) Use the XP to level int and charisma 3) Genetically engineer hugely strong, extremely tasty animals 4) Kill animals for infinite XP (engineering bigger / tougher animals as required) and set up a world dominating fast food chain (using charisma to mitigate the GM aspect of my food source).
