It's going good, just trying to pump out chapters as fast as possible while keeping good quality. I have the entire story more or less planned out.

It's good to hear you liked it, I haven't heard much feedback yet. I tried to keep the world as rational as possible so it's awesome that someone from this subreddit thinks its good. For now I'm trying to get the word out and get my ratings up. If you want to help you can leave a review on royalroadl. Thanks!
