Naruto's also has shallow settings that... Implicitly draw on anime/generally japanese tropes, which gives fanfics more material to work with. Hot Springs isn't super fleshed out, but you can draw on n Yojimbo and a million anime to give it depth in your fanfic, and it fits with the Naruto setting well enough.
