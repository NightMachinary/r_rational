Honestly I think it's more that Wales' imagination is so vast and off-the-wall that it fulfills the fanfic writer's itch of "what would happen if..."

The only real departure point I can think of that wouldn't just end up with "still WtC but worse" is re-spec'd Juniper. And since only Wales knows the specifics of the stat system, even that would be difficult to write.

I'm not usually a fan of fanfiction anyway (with a few exceptions that are usually pointed out as the best works in the genre), but it seems especially redundant for WtC.
