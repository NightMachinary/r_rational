It's almost entirely unexplained, though. A fanfic wouldn't be borrowing much from canon, because aside from the exact places Juniper's been, there's not much to work with, and most of the attention has been placed squarely on the party. You can't really go off and do another thing without inventing things wholesale, at which point why even use this setting?

Other works with a great deal of fanfiction, like Naruto, Worm or Harry Potter, have some well-established settings and frameworks to work with.
