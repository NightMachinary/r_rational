On the other hand, I've had maybe a dozen people tell me that they're taking stuff from /Worth the Candle/ for their own tabletop games, so that's something, it's just personal rather than public. I would generally agree that it's not fanfic bait; if someone were going to write fanfic, I would assume it would be character-driven shipping stuff, which is extremely popular for certain franchises, but not really in the demographic that usually reads WtC.
