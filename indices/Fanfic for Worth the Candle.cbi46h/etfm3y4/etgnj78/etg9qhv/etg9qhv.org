Yeah, I don't think you'll have much luck.

The thing is, Alexander Wales is the kind of author that writes works that you want to take inspiration from, but that aren't super easy to actually turn into fanfic.

Like, I would love to write a video game based on Glimwared, or a political series set in WtC, but that's /a lot/ of effort and I just don't have that kind of free time.
