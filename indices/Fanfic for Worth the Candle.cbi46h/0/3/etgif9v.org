Another part of it is that Wales frequently does the Sleeper thing (to a lesser extent) where Proper Nouns are referenced frequently but they are not exposited about for the reader's benefit.

Now this is a perfectly fine style, but it's not one that lends itself well to fanfiction.

While the story is in progress, it gives would-be authors fewer interesting things to play with, can lead to one's fanfiction becoming outdated, and can make them feel as they don't yet understand the world.
