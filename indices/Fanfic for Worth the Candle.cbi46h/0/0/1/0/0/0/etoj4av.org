Besides the excellent writing, I love deconstructions of settings that originally didn't have a lot of internal consistency. This is also one of the reasons I love Worm and Ward so much. I enjoy the rationalist protags of HPMOR and OOS, but I think I'd like both of them just as much if nobody ever mentioned a cognitive bias.

It's also why Sanderson is one of my favorite authors. Say what you like about him, the man /thinks through/ his worldbuilding.
