You could definitely write a fanfic for A Wizard of Earthsea, in fact it would lend itself readily to the ratfic format.

Rationalist protagonist worries about the problematic world of the dead, takes up quest to end/improve death, character drama in their eventual dismissal of Tehar/Tehanu's desire for an abolishment of the world of the dead and resumption of natural cycle of life/death. The shadow Ged releases is a good lead in to an HPMOR style dark side.

Easiest way to write it would probably be to make tehanu or the prince the rationalist protagonist, but I think it would be more nostalgic and endearing to make it ged, tehanu, or some other character from earlier in the books.
