Points of departure is the key here, I think. WtC is too structured in narrative to create good fanfic without reworking the entire story. If joon does almost anything significant different canon immediately goes off the rails because of how much he affects the plot.

Compare this to other stories with major fanfic presence: Harry Potter has the events of Sorcerer's Stone almost assured to happen no matter what house Harry goes in, Naruto's chuunin exam will happen no matter what team he's on, Leviathan and Coil will usually do their thing in Worm, and so on. I think a strong external conflict that (initially) cannot be affected by the protagonist is a key factor in how popular a series will be for fanfiction.
