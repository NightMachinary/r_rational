There's also the factor of the DM fairly actively maintaining the status quo (or perhaps the first derivative of it), plus the whole "story element will come back in another form if it's bypassed or one-shotted" issue. You might get slightly different versions of the main cast, or slight variants on the quests, but they won't diverge anywhere nearly as easily as in most universes.

The DM /might/ even be able to spot, in-universe, the usual kind of variation-on-the-main character fics, and act to either burn out the discrepancy, or forcibly keep the story on track.
