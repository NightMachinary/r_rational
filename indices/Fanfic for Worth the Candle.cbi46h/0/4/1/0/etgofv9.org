That's another good point. While WtC's setting is defined fairly well, it is also very, very shallow in how much its fleshed out compared to other more fanfiction-ized stories. Joon & Co pretty much speed from town to town trying to stay ahead of their problems, which is very appropriate for an RPG session but doesn't let itself well to derivative fiction.

To elaborate on those examples, Harry Potter only has a handful of settings that are explored very deeply: Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and Diagon Alley. You also have character's houses but those are more minor. Then in Naruto, virtually all of the story pre-shippuden takes place either in Konoha or Wave, the latter of which's setting is pretty much glossed over beyond "oppressed fishing village". The thoroughness and minutae those settings are given is far beyond Barren Jewel, Comfort, or even Li'O.

[[/u/sfinebyme]] I think you misunderstand what most people want to write fanfic about: they don't want to work with almost completely-blank slates like Uther's adventures, because at that point you're practically writing original fiction with stolen characters. What people like to do is lean on deeply-defined settings and plotlines to support how their change to the story propagates.
