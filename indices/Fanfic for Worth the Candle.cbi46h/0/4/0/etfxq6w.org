No, fanfic explodes with reasonably defined settings. The median author wants to change one or a few linked things, and extrapolate how canon changes in response. For WtC, that would be something like "How would things change if Amyrillis was a Sailor Moon?" Or "What if Joons power was being Naruto?" And then following the Stations of Canon.

Actually having to extrapolate the /setting/ is a much more limiting factor.
