I agree, the author portrayed Klein at least as transphobic. The author themselves might not have been so. Anyway, this novel is already way too Western. Most Chinese novels' morality is at the level of "don't bully the innocent too much if you don't absolutely need to and they aren't related to people you have a beef with." I guess this is because the Chinese society has less economic abundance and more corruption. This is not something that one person can solve, it's a stable nash equilibrium.
