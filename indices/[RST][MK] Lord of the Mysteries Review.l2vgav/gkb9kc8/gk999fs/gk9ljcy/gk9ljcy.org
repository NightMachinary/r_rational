Don't think it is xianxia, Western Continent as per author's notes might be, still depends on author, and that is where sequel is supposed to be.

First volume to me is more of a merger of Charles Dickens, since similarity of setting like Oliver Twist, or Great Expectations, and H.P. Lovecraft and his Mythos cosmology, Chthulu and the gang.

For me the best part is Tarot club meetings and Emperor's diary. Don't feel side characters are forgotten, some are mentioned as snippets in the news if no direct connection.
