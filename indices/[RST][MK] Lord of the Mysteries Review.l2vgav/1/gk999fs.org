I don't think I would call it a Xianxia, unless any progression oriented fantasy written in Chinese is. There aren't really any cultivation themes.

Personally I quite enjoyed the high level conflicts later in the story. I didn't notice a simple higher number means victory pattern, unless you mean truly vast power differences.
