What fillers? As for the characters that got left behind aspect on your bad part, it is mostly because near the end of the novel their stories or journey that thay started out when they first came into the scene has already ended, Xio got her revenge, Fors got rid of her curse, Derric already liberated his City, other than an end to their journey, there are also some that has just begin their journey like Alger sailing towards the west continent, Leonard and Emelyn starting to seige an enemy territory, Cateleya is growing out of her nest, Audrey just left her family and even Klien himself starting his journey of dreams. The characters is LoTM is not just objects that revolve around the MC alone, some of these character mentioned stop trying to improve after they have achieve their goals and feeling comfortable with thier position as not all of them have high ambition like Alger, Emilyn and by a strech Leonard and Cattleya is, unlike most xanxia, the stronger they are, the more they will lose themselve and go crazy or lost control a cost most xanxia MC would not wish to pay, if Klien was not the type of person he is he would just stop advancing after sequence 7 or at sequence 3. But this story is mostly themed on journey, the fool is the beggining with unlimited potential and the world returning to origin.
