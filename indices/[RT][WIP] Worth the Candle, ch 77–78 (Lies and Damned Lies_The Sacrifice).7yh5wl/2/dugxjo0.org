I gotta say, I was slightly panicking when Amaryllis was explicitly selecting the most boring locations, because that reasoning is a slippery slope that will eventually just make the story boring.

But that last scene makes me fully expect the DM will address what I'm thinking and make Joon stop playing it safe one way or the other, so that's good.

Also, a warning: the story /SHINOBI: the RPG/ was ruined when it introduced the DM as the main antagonist, because it was handled horribly. Please please please don't let your DM ruin WTC.
