My understanding was that, assuming damage rolls are using a d20, Joon gets to reroll any critical injury (5% chance of a natural 1). Or if it's a d100, anything 95 and higher gets rerolled.

The wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it was meant as "if they are in the +lowest+ *highest* five percent of outcomes (you keep any lower rolls)". [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]?
