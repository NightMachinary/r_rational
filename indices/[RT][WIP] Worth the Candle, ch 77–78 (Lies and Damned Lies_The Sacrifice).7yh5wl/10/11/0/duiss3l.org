This is a callback to ch 44:

#+begin_quote
  “-- it doesn't show her as a companion, not yet, which means that I can't see what her loyalty is, and we know that those can start in the negatives.” I hoped that my pause didn't entirely give me away. Fenn and I clearly needed to have a pointed conversation, ideally in private.

  Grak sniffed at that, sucking air into his wide nostrils. “I assume that was me,” he said. “Fenn planned to betray me. It would have been foolish not to plot against you.”

  “Water over the bridge,” said Fenn with a wave of her hand.
#+end_quote

Grak is repeating Fenn's phrasing as a form of deadpan humor. Fenn gets the expression wrong there, and in ch 31 (when the same issue is being discussed), either through a deliberate attempt at tweaking people who care about the correctness of their expressions, to feign cluelessness, or because she doesn't have enough cultural exposure to have all the idioms down pat (kind of a character interpretation thing, so your choice).
