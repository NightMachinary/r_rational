Depends on whether you parse it as

"you went from X to Y" (in which case mother fits)

or

"you went from thinking of her as X to [thinking of her as] Y" (in which case daughter fits)

Ambiguous enough to need changing, but just changing "mother" to "daughter" wouldn't fix the ambiguity, it would just switch which half of readers get confused.
