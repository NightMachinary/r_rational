  If they are constantly jockeying for position, knowing their competitor got eaten is amusing if anything

It's /useful/, I'd say. If all devils are constantly at war with all other devils, it's nearly a certainty that they would be /very/ interested in this new way to kill their competitors, once they learn of it. Or, looking at it from another perspective, they would be very /worried/ about this new unknown threat.

I suppose it's still better than if they were coordinating, but not positive either.

Regarding knowledge about which non-anima is eating them: fair point. They wouldn't be necessarily even aware that it's a non-anima's doing. But perhaps they could somehow investigate it.
