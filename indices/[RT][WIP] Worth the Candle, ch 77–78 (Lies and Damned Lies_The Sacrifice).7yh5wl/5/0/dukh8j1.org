Devils have a concept of personhood that doesn't apply to non-anima so it's not far fetched that it doesn't apply to other devils. Otherwise it's plausible they'd be stuck in a perpetual loop of trying to frustrate one another.

Coordinate relies on them being able to predict each others actions and reactions and if the only tool they have for doing that to humans is one that immediately drives them to sabotage said actor it's plausible that they deliberately nerf their own ability to understand each other to avoid it. That or trying to analyse schemes ala you-know-I-know-you-know is too frustrating to deal with so they use dumb brutes when they have to and sidestep each other when they can.
