depending on interpretation the DM is the manifestation of RNG. really good DMs make their rolls where you cannot see. Many DMs are the first members of the group to own dice/many players borrow from the DM. Anyway I look at it the result is the same. this is the guy who controls fate and outcome (You cant fudge numbers if you don't have a desired outcome).
