Not this again, Ana. It depends on whether God would define "the best possible question" as "question you should /expect/ to maximize your utility" or "question which /does/ maximize your utility". If it's the latter, recursion doesn't occur since such an answer would be useless -> not something utility-maximizing. If former, we're likely dealing with a literal genie, which isn't something we should do at all.

(Of course, “What answer to this question would maximize my utility?” is still a preferable alternative, but if I used that, I wouldn't have made a reference.)
