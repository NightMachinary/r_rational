I'm still wondering about the devils. Are they not communicating? It's implied they are immortal beings, since quite a few of them have millennia of experience. Older ones shouldn't be expected to die very often, especially not on outings to Aerb, yet Valencia consumes them with unnerving regularity --- more than that, she seems to be able to reach into the hells and grab herself a devil whenever she desires. Wouldn't they notice that, eventually? Amaryllis mentioned that they're bad at coordination, but are they /that/ bad? I would think that it's actually the main danger here: Valencia attracting the attention of a powerful devil after eating one hell denizen too many. Would be a fun quest.

One possibility here is that devils don't control when they possess non-animas at all, they just randomly find themselves in their bodies from time to time. It explains, partially, their poor coordination, makes what Val does a little less irregular, and is also rather amusing.

Alternatively, there's extremely many devils, and they don't have distinct identities and/or don't form connections of any kind with each other, so it's entirely possible for one or a few dozens of them to disappear without anyone noticing. Hm, if they're perfect actors who could fool even each other, it would indeed be hard to keep track of them...

Ah, a fellow self-appointed court member! That's an interesting development.
