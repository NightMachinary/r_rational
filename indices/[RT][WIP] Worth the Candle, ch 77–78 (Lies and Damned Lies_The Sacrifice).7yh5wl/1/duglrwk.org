I hope someone has insight into the man in the Hoodie, because I'm dying to know what's about to happen. I guess the obvious guess would be it's the DM, and more specifically (but with much less confidence) it's Arthur. I don't remember enough to tell if the characterization matches for older-Arthur, although I suspect with the buildup in his description it's someone the reader could recognize from prior descriptions and thus probably Arthur?
