Wild speculation time -\\
My theory is that Juniper is dead and this is a test for him.

Not in a metaphysical sense, but like a unit-test for a recovered personality. My guess is that he died (possibly killed himself) but was preserved via cryonics. The real world is post-singularity, and his personality is being emulated before it's put back into a body (or maybe wherever it is that ems live), and this place is running error checking on his personality. Everything being pulled from his subconscious because that's the easiest way to run it as well as giving insight into the personality by seeing what it dredges up.

His mental state is kinda shitty as proven by the state of the world (and again, I think he likely killed himself). So this place is designed to fix him. The entire leveling up mechanic and adventure serves to give him a "hero's journey" so at the end up it he'll be a well adjusted human being.
