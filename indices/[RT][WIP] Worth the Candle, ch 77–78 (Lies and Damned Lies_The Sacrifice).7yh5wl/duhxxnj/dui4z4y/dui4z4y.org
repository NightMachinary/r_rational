In some systems, you roll for injuries on an injury chart, e.g. like so (assuming 1d100):

| Number | Outcome                |
|--------+------------------------|
| 91-100 | Actually, you're fine. |
| 70-90  | Cuts and scrapes       |
| 50-69  | Major bruising         |
| 30-49  | Broken bone            |
| 10-29  | Multiple broken bones  |
| 5-9    | Life-long injury       |
| 2-4    | Amputation             |
| 1      | Death                  |

So if you have an injury in the lowest 5% of outcomes, you would get a re-roll on that chart that might make things come out better for you. (The "you keep any lower rolls" clause is a fairly typical clause for rerolling mechanics that means if you reroll a 4 and get a 1, you keep the 1, not the higher of the two.)
