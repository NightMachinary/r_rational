Just wanted to say that I've really enjoyed your story thus far. The recent author reveal made me like it even more, because you managed to instill an entirely different tone than all your other works, which to me speaks to your skill as a writer.

Normally I'd make a paranoid post about how how trusting Val the social AI to self restrict the use of her abilities and not manipulate the party is asking for trouble, but instead I'll just comment on how heartwarming it is to see how Jun internalized some the values that Tiff tried to instill in him and is doing his best to apply them despite his damage (avoiding the whole "infantilized girl needs a white knight" trope in favor of treating her as a person with agency, etc.).

These interludes of his past DnD group prior to his breakdown have implied how much of an effect they've had on Jun the person. It's great to see how even though Jun's circle of friends may be dead and gone, and even though he's saddled with a ton of baggage from that time, he's still carrying forward their teachings and that memory of better times.
