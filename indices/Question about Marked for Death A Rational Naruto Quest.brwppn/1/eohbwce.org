Our merry quartet is a group of missing-nin, being hunted by the scariest hunter-nin alive, Captain Zabuza. As it is, its really hard to stay hidden. A civilian along forthe ride would get them all killed. Noburi at this point has some alpha-dog ish confidence issues. She shut him down /hard/ here so he wouldn't even think about ignoring her.

Additionally, something Mary thinks about but Nobby doesn't is that civilians really cant ever give consent to ninjas due to the inherent extreme physical differences. There's really no way to get some kid to come along with a group of missing nin besides kidnapping them, politely or not.
