Oof. Yeah, this is some hardcore projection. Sorry : / I mean you recognized it yourself, which is why I'm being so blunt. I would look into why this hits you so hard, because while on one level you're right (the sexual stamina joke in particular can be a pretty mean insinuation), it's really common and generally not a big deal among friends who clearly aren't making it a personal remark, or have no reason to expect it to be taken seriously.

A much bigger issue is some of the physical violence threats that are actually carried out later in the story, but keep in mind also that these characters live in a world often full of literal daily life-and-death struggles and are trained assassins, thieves, seduction experts, etc from childhood. Not only should they be expected to have thick skin, if they don't it would be a massive liability to everyone around them.

(I'll also note that Shikamaru's apology was mostly instructed out of political necessity, from one noble family member inadvertently insulting another.)
