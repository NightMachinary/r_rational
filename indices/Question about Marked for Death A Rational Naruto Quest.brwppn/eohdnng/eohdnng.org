I think you overestimated the severity of her threat --- I read it as good-natured ribbing with some overacting (both on Noburi and Inoue's parts).

Cursory investigation revealed that this is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5923487/][a response to a joke]] one of the players made previously. In this scene, Noburi was about to jokingly suggest that since their team can't take a kid from elsewhere, they should /make/ one. Inoue saw the joke coming and turned it around on Noburi, either because she thought it wouldn't be received well, or because messing with him amused her (you have to remember that she's a recovering sadist).

I agree that all of this isn't very clear.
