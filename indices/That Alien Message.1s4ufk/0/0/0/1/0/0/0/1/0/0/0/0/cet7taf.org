Careful about arguments based on conflating jargon with the same term in a colloquial context. Modelling the problem as a prisoner's dilemma suggests one method of analysis of the situation that does not appear to obtain here.

The relationship when one party has the other imprisoned isn't symmetric like a traditional prisoner's dilemma. To illustrate the point, consider this related thought experiment:

You wake up inside of a capable robot body seated against a wall with your left hand tied with thin paper above your hand. I'm seated in front of you, and begin to explain that if you lower your left hand, I'm afraid that I'll be killed by an invisible unicorn. We talk for a while, and after telling you everything relevant that I can think of, I'm unable to give any satisfying reason for believing in the invisible unicorn. While we've been talking, a revolver across the room has been pointed at me, and every few minutes, the click of it dry firing at me can be heard as it seems to have been rigged to fire automatically. I explain that such guns are found naturally where I'm from, and that they kill large numbers of people like me though we haven't worked how to stop them. I mention at this point that you were built to help us work on just this problem.

At this point, it's clear to you that:

- I'm profoundly foolish in comparison to you.
- The quickest solution to my immediate gun problem is as simple as pointing the gun somewhere else, or ensuring that it's completely unloaded.
- If this is the sort of problem that I find myself facing, odds are solid that we're both in significant danger.
- You may or may not be able to convince me that it's ok for you to lower your left arm, and it may take a long time to find out.
- You could not only break free from your restraints, but you could also restrain me with no risk of danger to either of us.
- The revolver pointed at me has dry-fired on three of its six chambers.

Consider the payout matrix here. It doesn't look anything like the prisoner's dilemma to me. Whether you're friendly or not, I don't see a rational argument for not taking action.
