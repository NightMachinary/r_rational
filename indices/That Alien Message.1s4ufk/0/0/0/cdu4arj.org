  Consider: while it's playing nice, talking to us, slowly, slowly solving our problems - people are dying and we do nothing.

That's not a valid reason to increase the probability of /more/ people dying by releasing a boxed non-proven-Friendly AI.

A real FAI doesn't have to be boxed in the first place, /since you formally proved its Friendliness before you turned it on/.

But in the matter of the actual story, my point is: actual people are not UFAIs. /We humans/ don't act like that, and portraying us as acting like that kinda breaks my suspension of disbelief.
