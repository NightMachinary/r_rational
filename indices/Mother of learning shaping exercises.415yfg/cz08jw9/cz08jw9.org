I put way to much thought into this, but I'm not entirely sure that you can come up with shaping exercises for most of the things that you want. There is just too much complexity, it'd be like trying to break a complex algorithm down into assembly. It's technically possible, but not practical in a usable, on the fly, sort of way.

Lets take illusion for example. An example shaping exercise for this would be something like changing the refracted color of a marble from red to orange. Because I don't have anything else to compare this to, to equal a DnD wizard's shitty first level illusion spell, silent image, the wizard would have to shape the refracted color of whatever size patch of air would be needed for the illusion. That's an insane amount of complexity, even without getting into how precise the illusion would have to be to not be obviously an illusion, or the other senses like sound and touch. A human going through time loops would literally become insane before mastering any of these fields through shaping, from what I understand of the Mother of Learning magic system at least. (Except maybe soul magic? Not well explored yet)

TL;DR: It's easy to come up with shaping exercises, just decide how magic makes a thing happen, then break it down to the finest manipulation that you can.
