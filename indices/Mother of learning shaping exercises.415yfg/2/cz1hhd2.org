Hmmm, here's some ideas I can think of:

For Dimensional magic one can move a small object (heh, marble) as accurately as possible in a single dimension. An example would be to make it disappear and reappear exactly 1mm to the left / right Perhaps, even more simply, one could simply move it 'up' and 'down' in another (presumably unseen by humans) dimension that allows for it to disappear and almost instantly reappear in the exact same location to our eyes. Extra points if you don't waste any energy in the form of excess light / sound.

Illusion magic could be taught by modifying individual senses or modifying the real world to hide/show something. The former could be by trying to make a tasteless marble taste like apples or something, or attempting to magically make oneself colorblind to an increasingly specific hue. The latter could be done by tinting a marble a specific color, attempting to fake an increasingly 'pure' (sin wave of a certain desired frequency) sound, making transparent marbles opaque (as well as the opposite) or even attempting to bend light around the marble such that everything behind it can be seen squished up against the edges of the marble. (like light passing around a black hole and being focused back at us)

Soul magic would probably be much like he's already doing. Getting a feel of one's soul and attempting to poke it at a certain location as accurately as possible. Something interesting would be to attempt to visualize it well enough to map the 'surface' of it to a marble. (you'll have to use illusion shaping exercises in order to color the marble to match your mapping of the topography of your soul or something)

Of course, one could just combine these with any existing shaping exercise in order to make it even more of a challenge.

EDIT: So yea, pretty much what Tellan607 TL;DR'ed. Just decide how something is done and isolate a single aspect of that and then apply it (somehow) to a marble.
