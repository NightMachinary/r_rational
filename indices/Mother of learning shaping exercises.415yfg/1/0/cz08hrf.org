One thing I always envisioned would be Zorian trying to add modifiers to his missles. At the moment, they're simple volts of pure force, with some optical leakage that should be ironed out. But I want to see missiles that have elemental modifiers like heat or lightning, or a variety of other magical effects. Hell, even soul magic.

Additionally, while not a shaping exercise, I hope Zorian extends his invisibility modifier to his other spells too. Invisible fire would be pretty badass.
