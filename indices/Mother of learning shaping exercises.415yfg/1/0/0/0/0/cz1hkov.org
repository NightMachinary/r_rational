Hmm... how about attempting to take out a rat's (or any other small animal's) soul and embed it in a marble? Fiddling with small animal's souls seems a lot safer than fiddling with your own.

(or as I suggested in my post, you could attempt to topographically map a soul onto a marble with some illusion magic shaping, assuming a soul is mappable of course)
