*In Russian, with no translations that I know of:*

/Disclaimer: Rationality of the following work varies, but I do think that all of them contain ideas, themes, plots or plot points that people here may enjoy./

- Some works of Yuri Nesterenko arguably qualify.

  - [[http://fan.lib.ru/n/nesterenko_j_l/text_0830.shtml][«Отчаяние»]] (30k). Ontological Mystery: a person with no memory wakes up in an abandoned facility of some kind. Somewhat reminiscent of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4c24f8/hsfc_cordyceps_too_clever_for_their_own_good/][/Cordyceps/]], in my opinion. Warning: there are some extremely gruesome moments.
  - [[https://royallib.com/book/nesterenko_yuriy/absolyutnoe_orugie.html][«Абсолютное оружие»]] (30k), about a group of soldiers sent into jungles to save an archaeologist. The latter recently discovered new Mayan ruins...

- SCP Objects and Tales.

  - [[http://scpfoundation.ru/scp-1001-ru][SCP-1001-RU - «Пустотная сингулярность»]] (4k). Very interesting concept.
  - [[http://scpfoundation.ru/sculptors-who-failed][«Неудавшиеся скульпторы»]] (17k). Collaborative work, essentially an analogue of our Saturday Munchkinry Threads. First person thinks up a human-based SCP: powers, goals, motivations. Second person writes how the Foundation ultimately defeated them (quality varies, obviously).
  - [[http://scpfoundation.ru/scientific-rise-addiction][«На игле прогресса»]] (1k), about an alternate-universe Foundation that was forced to /actively use/ SCP objects to defeat alien invaders. Eventually developed into a spin-off project, [[http://scientific-alliance.wikidot.com/][Андивионский Научный Альянс]].

- Creepypasta.

  - [[https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8][«Новые тени»]] (1k), interesting concept based on the idea of "shadow biosphere".
  - [[https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB][«Вигилия в пустыне зеркал»]] (9k). The protagonist finds a coded message stapled to a tree, which turns out to be the first step in a long series of riddles prepared by a mysterious girl to whoever stumbles upon them. [[#s][Slight spoiler]]

A virtually infinite number of people get teleported to a world consisting of one virtually infinite room; what happens?\\
    (I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/76cly1/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dod04xh/][posted its premise]] to a Munchkinry Thread once.)
  - [[https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D1%83][«Окно наружу»]] (6k). The protagonist discovers that one window in his apartment leads into a different world of some kind^{1}, decides to investigate, and does so in a surprisingly rational manner.
