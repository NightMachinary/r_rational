  Would you mind summarizing the “shadow biosphere” fic?

Not at all.

The protagonist begins by describing an interesting optical trick: by pointing a flashlight at a concave mirror, aligned so that it reflects the light onto a razor's edge, one could see the most minuscule changes in air refraction.

One day, he was operating an advanced microscope-like device based on the abovementioned trick, and made a mistake when fine-tuning diffuser lens. Instead of microorganisms he planned to observe, he saw a strange complex collection of shadowy threads and knots. He began dutifully committing them to paper; as he did so, they dissipated.

He experimented some more, turning light in the room on and off. Some rules became apparent: the threads appeared after he turned off all light, then dissipated in around three minutes, whenever he observed them or not.

He continued experiments over the course of a year, improving on his equipment and making new discoveries. He noticed some similarities between these shadow-constructs and mycelium, and utterly failed in his attempts to interact with them in any more physical way. He figured out, though, that light closer to the blue side of the spectrum accelerated their dissipation, and found a way to cut them with lasers.

Further experiments confirmed his hypothesis: he was observing some kind of pseudo-non-material life, based not even on "darkness", but on "the concept of a newly-created darkness" --- a /literal/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_biosphere]["shadow biosphere"]].

At that point he cuts to the chase: five years after his first discovery he began observing more complex shadow-organisms, and around two years after /that/ he made contact with sentient shadow-organisms. They were as surprised as he, as they considered "material" world an incoherent collection of electromagnetic radiation. He communicated with them for a year, then they made a deal: they don't attempt to interact with human world, and his findings don't become public until he dies (he made his research in secret, because he was a bit of a glory-seeker).

That's not very important in the light of his last discovery, though. There's a colossal shadow-creature which occupies all of Earth's night. Its nature is even more alien that those of shadow-microorganisms or shadow-sentients, and /every/ instance of new-darkness adds to its mass: every time night sets on any part of Earth, and every time a human turns a night lamp on and off, it becomes ever-larger. He has reasons to believe it was around for billions of years.

He is worried that it is capable of detecting disturbances in natural day-night cycles, namely those caused by artificial lighting. As such, he is deathly afraid of creating new darkness, implicitly in fear of causing an extinction-level event.

Still, he wants to continue his experiments, because humanity, fuck yeah!^{1}
