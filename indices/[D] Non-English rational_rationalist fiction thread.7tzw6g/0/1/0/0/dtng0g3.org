"Ник" (Nick) by Andjey Yasinskii. (vague spoilers below)

A series of currently 8 books + 1 spin-off, book 9 is ongoing. The series drops in quality around book 7.

Synopsis: A programmer (from a futuristic Earth) gets transported into a fantasy world. He discovers an inactive friendly AI and they explore the world and it's magic together. But who needs learning the magic if they can research it?

*Is it rational? Yes.*

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

There are some plot-driven events, but there is a reason for all characters' actions, even if it's often a bit too emotional for us used to HJPEV.

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

This is the strongest suit of this series. All characters have well-defined motivation and we get to see them through interlude segments.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Definitely. Books 1-3 contain abuse of one magic spell into dozens of different forms.

#+begin_quote
  The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
#+end_quote

The genesis of the world has an explanation. There are several magic systems, each of which is consistent and the interactions between them are fairly well described. However in latter books the author introduces new magic systems which stop making sense.

*Is it rationalist? Partially.*

#+begin_quote
  Rationalist and scientific methods are used to demystify mysterious phenomena.
#+end_quote

Sometimes, yes --- magic is demystified alright. Other things --- see below.

#+begin_quote
  The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.
#+end_quote

Nick often shows how to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ][TRIZ]] and Tolleus literally uses half of the patterns from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns][Gang of Four]] for his spellweaving.

#+begin_quote
  The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, half of the time the puzzles are solved as "an AI did it".

*Best things* other than the ones mentioned above

After Nick, Rick Cook's Wizardry will see like a fantasy for casuals. There are /pages/ of pure spell invention monologue, sometimes in the middle of the battle. If you're into magic systems, this is for you.

It also has the smart characters who are not MC nor share his goals, but are independent agents (Eclectus, Balavatkh, Tolleus), but the conflict against them, if it exists, is usually resolved through talking.

*Flaws* The biggest problem is escalation. The MC is too powerful --- after book 4 he's an archmage, after book 7 he defeats gods, etc. Also he seem to always succeed like a proper Mary Sue. The author thought it'd be a clever solution to create a major failure of his plans and a setback for him to cut his power level, but Nick regains it.

Books 1-4 are good. Books 5-6 + Tolleus are different, a bit slow-paced, but still alright and present a clever edge. From book 7+ the series went downhill really fast, and book 8 is 90% a non-subtle Russian nationalistic propaganda.

Another flaw is that the author holds some beliefs that leaks into the book as an obvious things that exist IRL and don't need any explanation. The existence of auras, unrealistic martial arts "magic", simplification of the AI issues/handwaved control problem, objectification of women to some extent (doesn't pass the Bechdel test) and Slavic chauvinism are some examples.

conclusion: 8/10 with rice
