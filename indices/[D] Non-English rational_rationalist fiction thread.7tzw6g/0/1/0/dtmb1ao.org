/The Last Ringbearer/ was mentioned in the previous thread, so I omitted it.

  Are there none that are longer?

Well, there are, I suppose. Works of established Sci-Fi authors, classics, etc. I was trying to pick relatively obscure ones, because in all probability the ones who could benefit off this list are already familiar with popular authors.

Hmm, looking through lesswrong.ru's thread with recommendations...

- [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vita_Nostra][«Vita Nostra»]], see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7tzw6g/d_nonenglish_rationalrationalist_fiction_thread/dtloi2n/][below]].

- Works of [[http://technocosm.narod.ru/][Alexander Lazarevich]] are mentioned. I recall I read some, but wasn't overly impressed. «Червь-1» features a reasonable-enough portrayal of a conflict with an Unfriendly soft-takeoff AI, but «Червь-2» is quite bad in comparison (not the least because at one point the plot gets derailed by some random monologue about Soviet mentality length of which would put Ayn Rand to shame).

- [[https://fantlab.ru/work214561][«Ник»]] by Alexander Yasinksy. [[/u/ShareDVI][u/ShareDVI]], I'm seeing you've read it, would you elaborate on the recommendation?

- [[https://fantlab.ru/work388198][«Остров без сокровищ»]] by Victor Tochinov, it's apparently a deconstruction of /Treasure Island/. Something something reverse /Princess Bride/?

- [[https://fantlab.ru/work366567][«Не жить»]] by Yuri Brigadir is said to feature a smart sociopath (he is compared to HPMoR!Tom) as the protagonist. In my opinion, a work with such a premise is quite hard to write without running into darkness-induced audience apathy; seeing as I didn't read it yet, I can't vouch for it. It could be really interesting, though.

- [[https://fantlab.ru/work524703][«Обет молчания»]] by Andrey Ilyin, a series of detective novels. Apparently the author takes Wildbow's approach to plotting, i.e. "write the characters into a hopeless situation and then try to figure out how they can escape".
