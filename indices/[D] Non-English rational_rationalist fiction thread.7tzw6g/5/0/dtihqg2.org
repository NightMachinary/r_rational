Mh, both French and rational? I dunno.

Leaving aside cookie-cutter cop dramas / sunday night movies / high school kid show, most of the French media I know about that isn't translated from American / Japanese stuff is comics (also cartoons, but those were mostly before my time).

There's the classics: Tintin, Lucky Luke, Asterix et Obelix, les Schtroumpfs, Spirou et Fantasio.

The classic-but-slightly-less: XIII, Yoko Tsuno, Valérian, agent spatio-temporel (which was recently adapted into a movie by Luke Besson, and less recently inspired /motherfucking Star Wars/).

Some of my favorites: Les Nombrils, Lanfeust de Troy (to be pronounced "Lanfeust deux trois") and its sequels.

Some of the stuff on [[http://www.bouletcorp.com/][Boulet's blog]] is pretty rationalist and sometimes gets posted here. If I find the time, I'd like to read his series Donjon Zénith and Raghnarok. I've read some of it and it looks pretty good.
