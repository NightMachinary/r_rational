[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3972188-vita-nostra]] A Russian novel. There is an english translation though its very limited in terms of regions ([[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vita-Nostra-Sergey-Dyachenko-ebook/dp/B00A7GP5ZW][see this link)]]. I ended up pirating it after searching for and failing to find a legitimate way to buy it. While the story does deal with the supernatural, I've never read a story with a similar premise. I'm just going to point to the name: Metamorphosis.

Ignore the sequels listed on goodreads. The story stands on its own.
