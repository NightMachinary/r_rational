  HakoMari's first volume (really a short story) is fairly representative of the series as a whole, and is a mostly self-contained story. Surely a short story is not too much for you to decide for yourself?

Short stories usually have a length of around 5,000 words (anything over 7,500 words would typically be considered a novelette), and the Kindle version of HakoMari volume 1 is over ten times that length at over 60,000 words.

Given that the Kindle ebook for volume 1 cost $8, I'm actually somewhat glad to find out that the first volume contains significantly more than a single short story's worth of content, but for most people, 60,000 words is a pretty big time commitment (3.5 to 4 hours for a typical reader).
