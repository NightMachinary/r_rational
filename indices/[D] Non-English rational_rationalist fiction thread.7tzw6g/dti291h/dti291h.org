I think the works of José Saramago is the sort that this community might enjoy. His novels have crazy premises, but all the characters act in an appropriate way given the crazy premise. That is to say, they act crazy but in a rational way, as a reasonable response to a crazy world.

For example, the premise of the novel /As Intermitências da Morte/ is that one day people just stop dying. The novel is about the crazy yet reasonable reactions of the Church, the funeral and life insurance industries, the Maphia (with ph), the very old and sick, the government and so on.

Another novel is about a mysterious epidemic of transmissible blindness, and another one is about an election where everyone voted blank.

It's the sort of novel that is fun to read because it always makes you think about what you would do in place of the characters.
