  I was just thinking this weekend that I would totally buy 2YE since the munchkin-min-max aspects of the world would be really great for my own fiction-spin-off for D&D.

Hey, don't let me stop you! ;>

I'm glad you want to read it, and thank you for saying so; it makes a huge difference to my morale and motivation. And a special thank you for being a supporter. Incidentally, if there are any rewards you'd like to see offered, let me know. I can't promise they'll happen, but I'd welcome suggestions.
