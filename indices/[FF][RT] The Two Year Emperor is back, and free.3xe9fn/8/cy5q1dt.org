Thank you -- I missed 2YE during its serial posting stage b/c of Worm and HPMOR and didn't really get into the idea of D&D spin-offs until I started reading Mother of Learning.

I was just thinking this weekend that I would totally buy 2YE since the munchkin-min-max aspects of the world would be really great for my own fiction-spin-off for D&D.

I love reading Change Storms. I'm always surprised that the characters are able to derive the precise way their own powers function, but that's probably bleed over from Worm where most of the characters are clueless on how their powers work.

I will always be a Patreon supporter of yours!
