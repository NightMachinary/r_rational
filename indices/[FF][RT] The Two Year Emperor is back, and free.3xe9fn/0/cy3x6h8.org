[[/u/Mraedis]] is right, your work is awesome. I had a lot of fun reading 2YE, when it ended and I started reading Team Anko I guess I wasn't done processing so I didn't give t a fair chance before quitting. A couple days ago I started reading Team Anko again and it's really freaking good, I binged it. I don't know what I want more, Team Anko or Marked for Death.
