It's not available online at the moment because it has some problems and should really be revised when I get the tuits. If you'd like to read the current version, you can have [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/Two_Year_Emperor__Book_2.tgz][this archive]] of it. When you unzip it you'll probably find a bunch of files beginning with '_'; just delete those. They are an artifact of the OSX filesystem that I haven't found a way to get rid of.
