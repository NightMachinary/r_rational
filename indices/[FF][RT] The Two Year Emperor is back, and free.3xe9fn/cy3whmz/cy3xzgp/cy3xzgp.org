Save [[http://pastebin.com/dWm3LWYS][this pastebin]] as a .bat script, place in the folder with all the chapters, then run it. That will put in "Previous" and "Next" links at the top and bottom, along with a line below/above the link to separate it.

I'd be surprised if you needed it, but [[https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110818171632AA4szz5][instructions on running a .bat from Mac here.]]

(Note that this is a quick hack, apologies for any programmers who have to look at the thing. Should be short enough that it's nearly human readable though.)

Edit: I just realized that I have your e-mail, so I sent you a .zip of the html files. They look good to me, YMMV.
