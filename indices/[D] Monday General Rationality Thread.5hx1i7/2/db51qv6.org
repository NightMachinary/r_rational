I have a six year old half brother. He is showing an interest in how things work. Picking apart toys and remotes (often breaking them), asking about where lava comes from, etc. What's a good Christmas present to stimulate such interests?

He is also unsure about whether Santa is real, but has come down on the side that it's better to believe and get toys for sure than to deny him and face some risk of not getting toys. This I find funny.
