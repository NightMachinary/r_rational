It's more of an emotional thing, that someone actually cares enough to read the post than forgetting. I don't forget the stuff, but if no one expresses interest I won't put effort into it. If I get substantial responses to these posts it'll provide enough motivation to keep going. Seeing responses to ketura's Friday posts is enough to keep me posting here for now.

I'll probably even formalize the post format a bit before I'm done to make it easier.
