I remember reading once about how people's brains turn off when they're handling notifications or questions that they've handled before. The example was a tech support person standing right next to someone and telling them that, when this message box pops up, click B instead of A, but when the message box came up the person clicked on A anyways because that's what they've done in the past. Their thoughts never came into the equation.

I've experienced this myself with this alarm software on my computer I've set to remind myself to, among other things, get to bed at a decent hour. Even though they're incredibly intrusive, I've long since memorized exactly what it takes to make them /go away/, and it's a rare day I even remember they said something.

The downside, to these alarms, then, is that they're easy to get rid of. I don't make the alarm telling me to go to bed go away by going to bed, I make it go away by clicking on the right button, and I'm back to doing what I do. If you ask someone to pester you, not incessantly, but periodically, to get the post done, that would function as an alarm that you can only stop by doing what it's telling you to do. Having it come from someone you don't want to disappoint is even better, since it cuts you off from trying to circumvent the system by ignoring the PMs.

Good luck.
