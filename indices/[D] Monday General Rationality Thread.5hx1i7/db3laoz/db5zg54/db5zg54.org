I really liked your text and am certainly going to link friends to it. I used to link them to the Sequences but it doesn't start quite right for "outsiders", this text will work much better as an introduction.

That said I made some modifications to your text, and added a few comments to explain my decisions. I didn't mean to sound rude or offensive in the comments I made, if it looked like that I apologize. If you feel like answering my points I'd rather you did that here.
