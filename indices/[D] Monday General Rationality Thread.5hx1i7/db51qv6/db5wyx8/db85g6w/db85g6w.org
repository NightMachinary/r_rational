Likewise, as a kid, I played the Castle of Dr Brain which was a good educational adventure game by Sierra. I think point and click adventure games can actually be really good for kids, there's little to no violence and the games are purely focused on the story and solving the problems that are in the way.

Humongous entertainment (the company cofounded by Ron Gilbert the creator of Monkey Island) released a lot of good educational adventure games for kids that are a good introduction to the genre. They're available on Steam.

BTW, I'm curious what the title of the game is in Portuguese.
