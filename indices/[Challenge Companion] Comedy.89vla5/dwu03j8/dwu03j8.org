  Of all the broad style/tone genres, I think that comedy is the worst fit for rational fiction, though it's an element in much of the "rational canon".

I've thought a lot about humor in Rational Fiction and I tend to agree.

Most humor seems to come from a variation of surprise, where an absurdity reshapes an unremarkable reality that otherwise might have gone unquestioned. In some cases this is a bit of observational cleverness - something otherwise conventional /isn't/ taken for granted and that reveals the necessary absurdity - but usually humor's just dramatic irony: The characters don't know what's going on and the audience knows better. Reaction to the latter is some variation of a cheerful internal, "Oh no!"

Although much of the latter (and even the former) are pretty shallow, there's no reason they must be. Intelligent, rational people are forced to act on insufficient knowledge with insufficient resources all the time. Understanding the ways that rationalist and scientific methods can, and do, stumble is every bit as valuable as admiring the ways they succeed.

Where that gets in trouble is on the audience end of dramatic irony. They have to understand what's about to happen, or we're just watching the protagonist fumble. Sometimes entertaining and enlightening, but not usually funny.

Observational cleverness is more in-line with the needs of Rational Fiction, and so we get cute references, witty puns, defied tropes, and (as mentioned) deconstruction of world-building oddities. Satisfied smiles and nods rather than a lot of laugh-out-loud madness.
