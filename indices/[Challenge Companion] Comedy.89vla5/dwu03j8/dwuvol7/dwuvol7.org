Have you tried reading a story called HPMOR? It contains a lot of humor (see e.g. Ch. 5) and is widely considered to be ratfic.

Humor is difficult and good humor is rare, but there's not much special or additional difficulty for a humorous author finding places to express it in ratfic. It's true that differing perspectives and unshared information are often key, but what's antirational about that?

I'd consider Terry Pratchett to be a counterexample as well.
