I would disagree on some points. It's hard to write a rationalist as a protagonist in a comedy, but there are some ways rational fiction can intersect with comedy.

1) Jokes used to demonstrate irrationality on what not to do:

- The importance on testing: "Of course you needed to test the edge-cases in the simulator you stupid fools! Now that device you sold for millions has been given to the president who is using it on national TV! Now guess what failure they are talking about on channel 1!!!!"

- Planning fallacy: "Of course I'll finish this paper in time. It's not like I've been late with this paper the last four times this happened! Wait..."

2) Jokes to make biases and techniques more memorable (like a study aid):

- Confirmation Bias: Of course what you see and expect turns out to be right every time, you're god! Just ignore or misinterpret all of the evidence telling you otherwise.

- Planning for the worse: If you don't assume the worst case scenario, the gremlins will make sure things go FUBAR just to screw with you.

3) Funny solutions to a problem that are also rational or genius. I sometimes try to be more creative by asking myself what the 'funny' or 'cool' answer to a problem would be:

- Have bratty kids who won't behave going in a car trip with you? Bring a bag of candy and every time they misbehave, throw a piece of candy out the window.

- Want free alcohol at a party? Tell people you've never been drunk!
