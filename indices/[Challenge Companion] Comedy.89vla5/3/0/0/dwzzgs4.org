  I'm still a bit confused: was it [Spoiler]?
#+end_quote

Yes. That was the intention.

#+begin_quote
  The dialogue in the beginning didn't feel entirely natural.
#+end_quote

There's one line there ("I'm sorry," etc.) that I agree doesn't match the rest, but, other than that, I don't see what you're seeing. I get that describing what exactly "doesn't feel natural" is difficult, but are you able to be any more specific?

#+begin_quote
  I think the whole first scene could be significantly shortened.
#+end_quote

Agreed. I wanted to set it up so that the second interview scene paralleled the first, but that didn't work out beyond the first couple of lines (and then there was a third one, as Jack, that got cut entirely). But yeah, I shouldn't have let a scene that's just tangentially related to the overall plot drag on for two pages.

#+begin_quote
  I probably would have understood the story better if I were more familiar with the comics.
#+end_quote

Possibly, but maybe not. I was cribbing more off of the movies and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries][B:TAS]] than the comics.

Thanks for the feedback!
