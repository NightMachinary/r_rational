#+begin_quote
  I get that describing what exactly "doesn't feel natural" is difficult, but are you able to be any more specific?
#+end_quote

I'll try!

I think it is mostly that I always read the repeated ellipses as pauses. When Bartwell is interrupting Stephen I kept misreading it as Stephen trailing off. Using '--' would make it easier to read. For example:

#+begin_quote
  "Well, Mr. James, I want--"

  "To be an actor with a career on Broadway. Yes I know."
#+end_quote

Stephen's thoughts slow down the conversation and make the interruptions less forceful, so I'd consider removing them unless they are really important.

Other than that...

In the next few line Stephen says

#+begin_quote
  "Now? We scheduled..."
#+end_quote

which is implausible to me. I wouldn't expect Stephen to think Bartwell is talking about the meeting time, even given Stephen's nervousness.

In the next paragraph Bartwell says 'Jacobsen' twice, which is one time too many, maybe two times. It's important to make Bartwell seem formal and impersonal, but once is probably enough for a single paragraph.

The

#+begin_quote
  "I'm sorry, son."
#+end_quote

seemed alright to me. A breaking of formality to emphasize to Stephen that there is nothing to be done, and Bartwell would help if he could. He then tries to help.

Other than that, I don't have anything. I hope it's useful, in particular because I feel like I owe you for the useful comments you provided about my story.
