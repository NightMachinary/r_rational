I enjoyed your story more after I stopped looking for jokes and just read it for what it is. The [[#s][idea of]]

The dialogue in the beginning didn't feel entirely natural. Also, I think the whole first scene could be significantly shortened. I like the idea of the main character being pushed into the dangerous henchman work by his desire for a better job, though--and I see that the first scene helps with his characterization and setting up his part in the story. Hmm, it's important even if it could be shorter.

I probably would have understood the story better if I were more familiar with the comics.
