All right, feedback. Here goes.

- I liked the idea of a creator arguing with his non-sentient creations. The comedian/straight-man dynamic is good when it works. The pronunciation joke, especially.
- As someone who knows just enough about DBZ to realize that that's the story being referenced, it seems like half of the references were going over my head.
- "Rubber duck debugging" went over my head, and I'm a programmer. A line or two explaining it would probably be helpful.
- The technobabble gets a bit dense, especially towards the end of the lecture.
- I like the ending, where the doctor completely misses the point about intelligence and obedience.

I think the main way you could improve upon this is to make it snappier. A comedian/straight-man routine is much more back-and-forth; it doesn't work so well when the comedian is explaining everything in detail. For the Ur-Example, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg][Who's on First]], it's bang-bang-bang all the way through.

Oh, and well done on the mad scientist character. I don't know if that's an actual DBZ character or an original character, but I liked him.
