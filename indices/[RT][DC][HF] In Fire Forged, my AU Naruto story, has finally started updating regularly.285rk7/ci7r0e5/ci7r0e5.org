I like all the characters in this story. Naruto's got that willingness to escalate in defense of his friends, Sakura's got that tendency to analyze problems and solve them using outside-context solutions, and I have no clue what Izanami's deal is but I'm sure she'll also become very very cool in time.

In short: keep it up! I'm putting this one in my faves folder.
