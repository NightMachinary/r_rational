Trust me, I've searched for it too. I think the problem is that I got it from an artemis fowl fan website (it wasn't a fan trailer, though, Eoin Colfer was in the video, with the teaser projected on a screen), and most of them are dead nowadays.

I know it sounds pretty convenient, but trust me, I wouldn't go to the extents of lying just to agree with some obscure subreddit user about Eoin finding farts funny.

Also, Mulch wasn't 3D or anything that would have taken too much effort to make. I'm just saying Eoin projected a picture of Mulch with some added effects and some text about the movie. I think you might be thinking of a trailer when I said teaser.
