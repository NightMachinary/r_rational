It'd be hard to not write the Faeries as rather evil and hypocritical.

Much of the books take a poor view of human actions on climate change. Fair enough, and the Fairy characters' words on it come off as reasonable rather than soap boxing.

That being said, these are people with nuclear batteries so ubiquitous they put them in their standard-issue weaponry. Sharing the technology would probably help out a lot with the whole fossil fuel issue, guys. And your advanced technology. And magic healing ability...

The sheer, inherent power behind the Mesmer ability is there to. The fairy people really should have most of the world under control given that a single agent can mind control any world leader.

The racism is also a bit sketchy. Foaly claims that Goblins are about as smart as dogs- There's even /tests/ that show it! This sounds less like a reasonable theory and more like the ramblings of 20s eugenicist, but it's less-or-more taken for granted in the main story.
