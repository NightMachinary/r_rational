Alright, a read through of the first book shows the existence of an elf-goblin hybrid, along with mentions of Goblins protesting their childrens' imprisonment due to a gang war.

Also, for whatever reason Trolls, which are much more like animals, are given a higher value than humans. Officers are explicitly banned from killing them.
