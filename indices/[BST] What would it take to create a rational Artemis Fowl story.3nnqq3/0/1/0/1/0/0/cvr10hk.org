Domovoi is a vital part of Artemis Fowl, the first books at least. It'd be like removing Ron Weasley from Harry Potter fics, if Ron was a good character.

If we're still comparing it to HPMOR, his role in the story might be a little like McGonagall's, a connection to his humanity and morality while also being one of the adults he can trust. (Also he'd still get Artemis out of physical situations since I'm sure the best rationalists still forget to exercise frequently)
