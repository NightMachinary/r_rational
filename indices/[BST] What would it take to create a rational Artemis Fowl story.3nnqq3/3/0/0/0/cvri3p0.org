Any minor character is a blank canvas you can do whatever you want with, but without the negative mental associations. If you're just picking her because she's smart, you could just buff some character's intelligence like most rational fics do instead.

EDIT: Oh, you edited your post after I posted. Rational fics are usually loosely related to the original plot, they don't just make up a completely new one or they wouldn't really be fics. The humans vs. fairies conflict is the core of Artemis Fowl.
