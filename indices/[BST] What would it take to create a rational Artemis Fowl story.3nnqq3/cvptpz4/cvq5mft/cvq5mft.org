I actually like that fairies in the books make so many of those types of mistakes. It gives them a definite twist of blue/orange morality-- maybe their societies view fairy technology as sacred in some sense and find the idea of sharing it with humans questionable at best and sacrilegious heresy at worst.

Agreed on the Mesmer ability, though its worth noting that its not all powerful and can be resisted (usually with bad health consequences.)
