OKAY.

I know EY used Sherlock Holmes as an example of how not to do rational fiction, because Sherlock Holmes makes inferences using evidence not available to the audience. Going by the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this is not actually the case. Holmes deduces things that are /really really unlikely/, but the stories are scrupulous about fair play. Granted that sometimes the details are trivial (EY deliberately avoids this with James' rock), but it's definitely fair play.

Artemis Fowl is not. In fact, Artemis Fowl is what jumped to mind in place of Sherlock Holmes specifically because it was such a better example of how /not/ to write a genius character. Also because I liked those books, but yes.

I think...

I think the best way to do it would be just the first book. At first. What would an actual genius do to profit from the knowledge that magic is real, and exclusively the domain of fairies who do not negotiate with humans?

I'm not ashamed to say that I've got a long list of potential instigating actions Artemis could use sitting in a file on my desktop. Given better character flaws, he'd be a genuinely interesting villain protagonist.
