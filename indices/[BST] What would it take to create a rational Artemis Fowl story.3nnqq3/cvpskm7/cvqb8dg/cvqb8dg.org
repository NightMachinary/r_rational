I mean, unless you're going to pull a HPMOR and rewrite the main characters backstory, you ought to keep in mind that Artemis grew up getting "gold is power" drilled into his head by his father. Then the father comes back and has a complete change in goals, so... maybe you could work off of that, actually. Artemis is a rationalist with a misguided utility function - optimizing for personal gold and power for the Fowl family.

Course, if he was a perfect rationalist he should figure out pretty fucking quickly that he's got the wrong idea.
