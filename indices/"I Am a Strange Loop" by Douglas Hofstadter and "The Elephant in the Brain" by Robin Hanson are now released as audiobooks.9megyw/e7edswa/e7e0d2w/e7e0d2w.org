I do find dense material easier to get through in audiobook form, I'll check them out, thanks.

A few more recommendations:

There is a starslatecodex podcast, with quite a good narroator. I found it much easier to get through than the written posts.

Superintelligence by Bostrom was also quite a good audiobook.

There are two recordings of Rationality from AI to Zombies available, read by differen't people. I much prefer from-ai-to-zombies.eu because it sounds like they are having fun, so you might want to check out both and see which you prefer.
