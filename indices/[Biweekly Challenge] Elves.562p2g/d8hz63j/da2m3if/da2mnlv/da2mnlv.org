Woah! I didn't think anyone would read it. And yes... my grammar / spelling etc is horrible. Thank you for looking that over.

I was not sure about what fonts can be legally published, not that it's a big deal but I try to keep track of that.

The body font is called Lora and is an open source font that is available through Google Fonts. It's a serif font designed to work well both for print and screen.

The heading font is [[http://www.1001fonts.com/dyer-arts-and-crafts-font.html][Dyer Arts and Crafts Font]]... also free for commercial use.

In the rules section of the rpg game, the heading font changes to Ubuntu Condensed, which is also an open-source font.
