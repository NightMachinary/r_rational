A cheeky name suggestion.

If Pokemon (ポケモン) is short for (ポケット・モンスター) Pocket Monsters, then perhaps Pokeron (ポケ論) could be short for Pocket Ron (ポケット・論), or pocket argument, debate, discourse. It doesn't really fit semantically, only phonologically*.

If you want to be really cheeky, make it Pokemon Gōri (or Gouri)（ポケモン合理）for bastardized Japanese literally translating as Pokemon Rational. If you have a clever design you can hide the 'ri', maybe in an exclamation point where the lower case 'r' comprises the left half of the upper portion of a rounded exclamation point, and the 'i' hugs the right side creating the appearance of an exclamation point but still clearly spelling 'ri'.

As a separate note, if you're creating a developer's brief or prospectus, you might wish to send it to your local Nintendo chapter to frankly put open up discussions on what it will take for them not to sue you. Put tactfully, to open up discussions as to how both you and Nintendo can benefit from moving forward on the project, possibly meaning Nintendo lends QA to the game once complete and gets a majority or large share of profits, depending on existing or past arrangements of a similar nature. Or, if lucky, gain official license to proceed with a free fan game if that's your intent.

*I think there's a better word but a brief search can't find it. Please correct me if you know it.
