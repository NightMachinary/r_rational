Has licensing ever happened with Nintendo? The only thing I even remotely recall is the Zelda Reorchestrated project, which received official approval and was then yanked. AM2R, Pok√©mon Uranium, and others were all shut down the moment they made game news, though admittedly I doubt they even made the attempt.

It just seems like all that would do is paint a target on my head, though I would totally be down if there was a reasonable chance of tacit approval.
