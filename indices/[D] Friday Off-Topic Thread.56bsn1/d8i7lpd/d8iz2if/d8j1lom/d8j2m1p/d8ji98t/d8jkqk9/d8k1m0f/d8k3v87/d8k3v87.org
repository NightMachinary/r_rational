I don't think Steel maps onto bullets very well. Besides the fact that bullets aren't damaging specifically because of what they're made of, most physical Steel attacks aren't really like bullets either.

  So if players go for fighting pokemon, I want it to be for a reason for that playthrough and not because the online metagame drives them to do it. I won't complain if an arena or whatever is set up and people then plan for that, but this game is entirely being balanced around the single-player experience.

That helps, but remember that balance is important for single player games too. You don't want one type to just be so powerful that using any other type is just gimping yourself :)
