  I know you call Ice a "leveled up Water" in Bill's PC, so why not just make Rock a "leveled up Ground?"

When I was toying with type pairings I came up with these pairs:

Normal -> Fighting

Water -> Ice

Bug -> Poison

Ground -> Dragon

Rock -> Steel

And though I still feel like there's something there, I'm not sure it would manifest beyond some kind of design guideline rather than a mechanic.

Now that Dragon has been restored as a damage type, it might be better to do Fire -> Dragon and then Ground -> Rock -> Steel. At any rate, these pairings were to describe the archetype and not the damage type; Ground was a tough, ferocious Beast type and Dragon is an even tougher, even more ferocious Beast type.

It's something I need to decide if I'm doing anything with, and then if so probably throw it on the tree as you suggest.

  I think it's implied that Rocks being thrown are heavier than other objects that are used as projectiles, though. The idea isn't that they're just throwing "rocks," and that the earthy power within them is unleashed on impact, it's that they're throwing boulders, or at least rocks bigger than any human can just pick up and toss around. Sure this could be reflected in Attack Power of each move, but then you're basically relegating all Ground moves to be pretty weak and all Rock moves to be either very strong or rather pointless.

Sure, it's implied in the state of the move, but this is separate from its type. I have to try and figure out comparisons somehow, and assuming the variables of each are equal is about the only way to do so.

  Also when you say "bullet," are you referring to guns, or moves that have the name "bullet" in them?
#+end_quote

Guns, as a stand-in for a theoretical Steel-type move.

  Also, in this case I think part of the reason people have that feeling may be because Fighting is such a uniquely placed Type in the metagame. It's so important as a check against Steel and Dark that effectively removing it as a Type really changes the landscape of the game. Tyranitar and Aggron in particular becomes monsters without their 4x weakness to Fighting, though Aggron would still have his 4x weakness to Ground.

  But so many other things are going to be different in your game that ultimately it's not going to matter, and the dust will really have to settle before any decisions about balance can really be made.

Yeah, I'm not afraid of having unbalanced pokemon. I am going to build the game in a multiplayer-friendly format, but do not plan to actually implement that multiplayer at this time. I'm not afraid of players getting access to OP characters because, well, they'll have to defeat OP characters just to have a chance to use them.

So if players go for fighting pokemon, I want it to be for a reason for that playthrough and not because the online metagame drives them to do it. I won't complain if an arena or whatever is set up and people then plan for that, but this game is entirely being balanced around the single-player experience.
