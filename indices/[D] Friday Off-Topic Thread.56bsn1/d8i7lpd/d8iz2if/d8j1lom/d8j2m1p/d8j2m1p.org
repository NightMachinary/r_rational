  Ground is difficult. At times, it represents an Earth type that is so frequently conflated with Rock as to be indistinguishable, and at other times represents a Beast type that is really just a tougher and more feral Normal.

I think you might be basing the perception of Ground pokemon too heavily on Gen 1. Which makes sense since that's primarily what the pokemon you're designing will be from, but in later generations Ground pokemon are quite distinct from Rock pokemon.

Especially when you look at partially Ground pokemon: the Water/Ground types are amphibians with a particular focus on mud attacks, Golurk and Claydol are made of mud/clay, and Garchomp is a literal sand shark-dragon. The vast majority of Ground pokemon have some kind of distinct affinity with soil/sand, either for movement or as part of their body.

  (Even if we didn't redefine, what creature is weaker to dirt than it is to a rock? Short of inhaling it, I can't imagine such a situation.)

Offensively, mud attacks should stay Ground rather than become Rock because of the similarities in Type with Water (both are strong against Fire and Rock, and resisted by Grass) and burying something in a wave of soil should be distinct from Rock's effectiveness (Bug and Flying pokemon both resist Ground moves for fairly obvious reasons but are weak to Rock moves).

I guess the main difference is again that you're working purely off of substance vs substance, and not tying how hard it is to hit an opponent with the substance into things. But even on that level, I think it makes sense that, say, Grass pokemon have a resistance to attacks that use soil or mud, while not having a resistance to attacks that use rocks.

  If a Machamp hits you with Comet Punch, it's going to hurt. A lot. If he hits you with Cross Chop, it's also going to hurt. A lot. All things being equal on the offensive front , I cannot imagine why a creature would withstand (or even resist!) the first while utterly crumbling to the second, as an aspect intrinsic to the defenses.

Well, the only pokemon Types besides Normal and Dark that Fighting is strong against are the "hard" types: Rock, Steel, and Ice. Two of them resist Normal attacks as an extension of the idea that they're "very hard," but are weak to Fighting because (in this rationalization) the Fighting attacks are targeting their weak points.

So to get around the issue of why a Charmeleon or Alakazam's weak points aren't so debilitating, how about this?

Instead of having different Super Effective modifiers, physical Fighting type attacks neutralize a % of their opponent's Defense. So for the majority of types, a Karate Chop won't be much more effective than a Body Slam, but for the types with high Defense (which are primarily Ice, Rock and Steel) the /relative/ damage from a Fighting Type attack will be much higher than that of a Normal type attack. It'll be "super effective" compared to a Normal attack, but only as long as the opposing pokemon has high Defense.

And this works the other way around too. Fighting Types are weak to Flying and Psychic and Bug types, and they generally have very low Defense. Realistically if you CAN punch a bird it's going to feel it pretty hard, but there's no real finesse needed there. The Types that resist Fighting are just not letting Fighting benefit from its passive Defense reduction.

Ghost pokemon are the only Type that resist Fighting with a decently high average Defense score, but the immunity is supposed to help with that. The whole phasing thing makes the interaction strange anyway, since Ki is the most effective way to hit them, and it should probably also have the Defense stripping attribute.
