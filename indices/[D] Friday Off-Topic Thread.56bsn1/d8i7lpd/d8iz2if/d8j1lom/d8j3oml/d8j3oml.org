Reading through the list, there also appears to be plans for an injury system, perhaps fighting type moves could have a higher chance to injure/injuries cause a larger percentage of unhealable health on super effective hits? That might be confusing though...

perhaps physical fighting moves are still made normal type moves, but with a high chance to injure, and make rock/steel/ice types more resistant to injury, but injuries affect them more.

OTOH, the whole "fighting type is strong to rock" seems to have been based off the classic "martial artist breaks /thing/ with bare hands" which is kinda silly, given the existence of the move rock smash.

I'm also not sure if the system will have a STAB mechanic. If it does, it would make sense for martial arts moves to do more damage if preformed by a fighting type, which should be taken into account.

And then there's the flying type resistance... Ugh, I think I'm starting to grok the dilemma.
