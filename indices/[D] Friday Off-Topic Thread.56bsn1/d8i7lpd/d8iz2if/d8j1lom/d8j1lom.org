  (Poison is just a nonsense type in general, when it comes to its weaknesses and resists).

Isn't it? It's seriously just kind of the consolation prize of types, thrown in to sweeten an otherwise sour deal.

  I like it a lot, though presumably this doesn't include things like Signal Beam and Bug Buzz? Or are those going to be re-Typed?
#+end_quote

Basically, the idea is that everything is Normal unless there's an explicit reason for that not to be the case; it's really more "colorless". Bug buzz seems like a sonic attack and signal beam I think will be reworked to be used as a way point for directing bug minions, so both will probably be retyped to normal.

  Why not just make Ground pokemon be pokemon that are more reliant on being on earth/soil, either for mobility or as part of their substance?
#+end_quote

So when I say it's been gutted, I'm referring to the move pool and not the Pok√©mon, so Earthquake is getting retyped but Diglett is only getting a small adjustment.

Ground is difficult. At times, it represents an Earth type that is so frequently conflated with Rock as to be indistinguishable, and at other times represents a Beast type that is really just a tougher and more feral Normal. It makes sense, I think, to push the type to mean Beast as far as descriptions go; both Sandslash and Marowak fit this archetype fairly well, in spite of being one of the few pure ground types. We can then fold the Earthy bits into Rock and end up with a clearer, albeit sparser, classification.

Which then begs the question, what is ground damage in that case? If Ground is redefined to mean Beast, well, that means it doesn't really define a unique substance to be resisted or weak to.

(Even if we didn't redefine, what creature is weaker to dirt than it is to a rock? Short of inhaling it, I can't imagine such a situation.)

It is in this context that I say that mud slap et al should just be made part Rock, and let Rock circumscribe the whole earth concept. Now that I type that out, maybe earthquake etc can go be rock instead, hmm...

  To me, Normal attacks that use fists or hands are just blunt damage. What makes Fighting moves Fighting is the intent and strength behind them: basically a Hitmonchan can use a Normal attack like Megapunch by just hitting any part at random, whereas a Karate Chop is a direct attack against an enemy body's weakpoint, like a joint or neck, since you wouldn't Karate Chop someone's face or chest.

This is primarily what the argument against me has been, and while I've come around to accept that from an /offensive/ standpoint, it doesn't make any sense to me from a /defensive/ one.

If a Machamp hits you with Comet Punch, it's going to hurt. A lot. If he hits you with Cross Chop, it's also going to hurt. A lot. All things being equal on the offensive front , I cannot imagine why a creature would withstand (or even resist!) the first while utterly crumbling to the second, as an aspect intrinsic to the defenses.

  Kind of like the distinction between Scratch and Slash.

So are those different types? Steelix doesn't care whether you rake him with claws or rake him with claws with the intent to make him bleed, he's made of steel and will laugh at you before crushing you.

I would contend that he also doesn't care whether you make a general punch or a highly sophisticated, practiced, honed chop that seeks out weaknesses. Surprise! His weakness is that he's indestructible, and also that he laughs too hard when crushing people.

But wait! People say. Machoke is strong enough to jump up in Steelix's face and punch it so hard it puts a /dent/ between his eyes. Surely this means there's something different between that and double slap! I'd say the only (rational) difference is the amount of training put into it. If Machoke spent a year and a day training nothing but his deadly open-handed double-slap, then I would contend he would be able to face down the same Steelix, jump up in its face, and bitch-slap a dent in its /cheek/ instead.

The only /real/ difference is when we hit chi and auras. /Those/ I am perfectly okay with enshrining as Fighting, because I could see a situation where a creature doesn't care if you punch it, but keels over if you Kamehameha.

This all really stems from the problem of describing Affinities, Archetypes, offensive prowess and defensive vulnerability /all using the same system/. It's nuts, and disentangling it is proving to be much more formidable than I had previously anticipated.
