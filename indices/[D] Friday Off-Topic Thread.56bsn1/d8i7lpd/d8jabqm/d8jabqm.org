Have you considered ditching the "pokemon" theme entirely, for the main engine?

Call the game engine "Ketura's combat monster engine", and then release pokemon themed data files, as a separate entity.

This makes it a lot easier to respond to intellectual property claims, and keep you branding intact throughout.

Nintento asks you to take down pokemon renegade, but fans still know to google "Ketura's combat monster engine" for the latest news about where to find data files for the engine.
