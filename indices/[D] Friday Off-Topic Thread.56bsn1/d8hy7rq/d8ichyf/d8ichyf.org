Ugh, that movie annoyed the hell out of me. Steve Trevor goes to the United States with an Amazon, an ambassador of a forgotten people who have decided to connect with the outside world again, and the first thing he does is... take her to a bar and tries to get her drunk? HOW ABOUT GETTING HER TO THE FREAKING WHITE HOUSE ASAP? Like, you can make all the points you want about sexism and gender equality and how society shapes your role, if the only non-evil male character in the movie is a stupid, immoral jerk, I'm not going to feel very touched.

Otherwise, I liked Wonder Woman in Justice League, but in retrospect I have to admit she was a bit generic. She was the calm, ruthless, no-nonsense character in a team which already had Batman, John Stewart and Hawkgirl.
