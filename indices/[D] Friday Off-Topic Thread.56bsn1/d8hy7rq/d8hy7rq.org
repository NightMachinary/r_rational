We've frequently discussed superheroes here, so it's shocking just how little anyone has brought up Wonder Woman. Each member of the DC Trinity is meant to represent a different idea, and her's may be the one most relevant to rationality. Batman is Justice and Superman is Hope, but Wonder Woman represents Truth. She forces people to confront uncomfortable truths about the world and themselves, which is why she's a feminist icon. At least when she's written well, that is.

I admit I didn't really like Wonder Woman at first since I found her to be rather generic in the Justice League cartoon. However, in the comics I have seen her act as the Amazon's official Ambassador of Peace, maintain a charitable foundation instead of a secret identity, and talk both super and mundane villains down as often as fight them. Though it contains none of those things, the best introduction I've seen to Wonder Woman's character and mythos is the animated movie, which isn't very long and can be watched [[http://kisscartoon.me/Cartoon/Wonder-Woman/Movie?id=15274][here]] for free.
