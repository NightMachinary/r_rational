Comic books have really surprised me with how rational they can be. Superman's reboot in the 80s explained that no one knew he was Clark Kent because everyone just assumes the flying man on tv with no mask doesn't even have a secret identity, while also playing up how Superman is really just a mask Clark wears when he wants to be a good samaritan. Marvel arguable started the trend even earlier with Spider-Man and X-Men turning genre conventions on their heads.

I have more experience with superheroes outside of comics, but I still think many of the stories have shades of rationality. Daredevil is about how hard it is for a street vigilante to fight organized crime, Jessica Jones is about sexual abuse and dealing with PTSD, Superman vs. The Elite is largely a drama about the moral use of power, and I can sing the praises of Young Justice all day long. Seriously, go watch it on Netflix so we can get a third season.
