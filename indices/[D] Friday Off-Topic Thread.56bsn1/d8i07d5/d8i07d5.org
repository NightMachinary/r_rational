Has anyone been watching [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/][Westworld]]? Takes place in a simulated western town populated by android NPCs looping their scripts, with whom players - the visitors interact with. The cinematography is gorgeous and the score is by Ramin Djawadi. It's been such a long time since I've seen something good.. I think I found my new favourite show. They just released the second episode early which I am going to be seeing asap. So spoilers, people.
