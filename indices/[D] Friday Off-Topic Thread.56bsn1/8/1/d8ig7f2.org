Well, the obvious bottleneck is real estate.

Beyond that, houses are more than room-shaped piles of bricks. You need support beams for the walls and the roof, especially if your house is going to have multiple floors (which is better if you want to make cheap housing). You need plumbery and electricity at the very least, as well as windows, telephone or internet access, gas, some sort of heating contraption (I don't know how well compressed earth insulates), and maybe an elevator.

All those things need human labor for now, and are absolutely required if you're going to live in a metropolitan area. On the other hand, technology is evolving, and I think (don't quote me on this) that mass-produced building parts are getting a lot more frequent.
