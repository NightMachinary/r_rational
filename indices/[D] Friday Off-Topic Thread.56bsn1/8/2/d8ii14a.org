That's not the solution I'd go with, personally.

I want to copy "space inflatables". Mylar fabric (ir reflective) double-walled tents. Mylar is generally very cheap. They're portable, and I think everything could fit in a steam trunk.

Where everything includes some way of generating electricity, pumps to keep the tent inflated, water-filtration, water-purification, water-pumps, etc.

I think portability is important for people that don't already have houses. You need to be able to pack up your life, and move off-grid, or move to your cousins property for a few years, or move to a different municipality, etc.
