Things this week:

- Ran a 5K and lived after finishing in reasonable time.
- Submitted my goddamn paper to the goddamn journal.
- Working 40 hours in a four-day work week thanks to Rosh haShanah and a project where the clients JUST DO NOT GET IT.
- Day drinking on Friday due to the above.
- Gonna try to figure out how to implement Fristonian "active inference" in OpenAI Gym. It's philosophically nice, but can it play video games?
