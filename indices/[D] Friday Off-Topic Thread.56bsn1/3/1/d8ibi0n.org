I haven't seen the second episode yet, but I was really impressed by the first. I'm trying my best not to think about the world-building too much, because it feels like a setting that's not terribly robust outside its central conceit. I'm also hoping that it doesn't end up like Lost as it piles up intrigue and mystery - but it's early days still.
