I wasn't actually disappointed with the books as I was reading, it was only when the last book went full high fantasy clich√©s in its final act that I realized how much the series had thematically drifted from where it began. On the one hand I have to respect a series that starts as low fantasy, transitions into heroic fantasy, and ends as high fantasy; but on the other hand the first book is the most profound by far and stands well on its own.

I really shouldn't complain since I read all of the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow sequels and found Ender's Game to be my favorite by far, but still enjoyed all the rest of them. It's not like my experience with Night Angel was all that different, even the ending in both cases was strange and failed to resolve everything. I've probably just become more judgmental.
