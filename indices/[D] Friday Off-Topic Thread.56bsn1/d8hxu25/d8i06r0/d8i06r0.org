I can sympathize, especially since I have a tendency jump ship on long running stories earlier than other fans agree they jumped the shark. I wanted to stop watching Supernatural and Fringe halfway through despite how much I liked the characters, I only recommend the first seasons of House of Cards and Penny Dreadful even though they're only part of the story, I thought Daredevil's second season paled in comparison to the first, and as much as I loved the first 10 or so episodes of Death Note I still pretend the rest never happened.

Of course, there are a few examples where my perseverance paid off. I was disappointed with season 2 of Sherlock only for 3 to blow me away, the middle third of Young Justice season 2 was bland and generic but the rest turned out to be awesome, Madoka Magika failed to resonate with me until the ending made me feel something I never had, and I even thought HPMOR was going downhill near the end with Harry angsting and getting no help from even his parents yet I found the ending satisfying.

There are some other stories that triggered less dramatic feelings in me, though. The first book in the Night Angel Trilogy was the best by far, I liked the first half of Code Geass significantly more than the second, Sgt. Frog is one of the funniest things I've ever seen but failed to deliver after the first season, and Kenshin is still my favorite manga despite a ridiculously long and dull epilogue after Shishio.

I guess in the end you just like what you like and get what you can out of what you can. A lot of what we like is imperfect, which makes it difficult to recommend to those who may not share our feelings toward it. We all have our own masterpieces and want others to love them as much as we do, but they frequently don't. As someone who is WAY too self conscious about what I do and don't like, this is something that shouldn't bother us no matter how much we relate to people through shared fandoms.
