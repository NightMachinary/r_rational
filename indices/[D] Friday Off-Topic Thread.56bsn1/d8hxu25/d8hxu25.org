In [[http://archive.is/msyTF][this very interesting discussion]], the denizens of 4chan's "/v/ - Video Games" board dispute the definitions and connotations of various words that are used to describe users of magic--=wizard=, =sorcerer=, =witch=, =warlock=, =shaman=, etc.

Can a person truly be called a "fan" of a work if he doesn't like the /entirety/ of that work? How valid is the position of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ as my favorite story if, as [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bz8l/q_recommendations_similar_to_mother_of_learning/d80kjy3?context=2][this argument]] revealed, I've largely skimmed its lewder sentences in /each/ of my /six/ readings of the book? How valid is the position of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ as my second-favorite /Naruto/ story if I skipped /most/ of the epilogues on my first reading and omitted not only /all/ the epilogues but also /the entirety of Arc 5/ (which makes up eight percent of the story's chapter count, epilogues and author's notes excluded) from my second reading? How valid are the positions of /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/ and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][The Fountainhead]]/ among my favorite stories if I've always neglected to read the vast majority of each book's climactic speech? (And so on.)

Of course, more clear-cut instances of this phenomenon do exist. I gave up on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887][Wharf Rat]]/ at the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887/19][Chapter 19]],* on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10894754][Trump Card]]/ at the beginning of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10894754/20][Chapter 20]],* and on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ (on all readings after the first one) at the beginning of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/35][Chapter 35]]--so, for those stories, I can very simply say, e.g., "I like the first half (through Chapter 34) of /Chunin Exam Day/, but it's my opinion that the second half sinks too far into bashing and harem shenanigans to be enjoyable." Where, however, is the line drawn between "I like this story, with a few negligible quibbles." (e.g., /Time Braid/) and "I like this /part/ of the story, but hold only indifference or dislike toward the /rest/ of the story." (e.g., /Chunin Exam Day/)? After what particular percentage of the story has been discarded does the overall /shorthand/ opinion shift from one position to the other? I, at least, think it's an interesting question.

*Or, more precisely, I /read/ one or two chapters past that point, but bothered to /download/ only the chapters /before/ it.

If you haven't read them, by the way, I do highly recommend both /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/. /CED/ starts to get bogged down with boring harem shenanigans in [[#s][Chapter 22]] and descends into pathetically-petty bashing against Sasuke and Kakashi in [[#s][Chapter 35]], while /PKH/ veers closer to the [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_The_Line_Twice]["crosses the line twice"]] end of the spectrum [[#s][as it nears its "end"]]--but both stories contain many /extremely/-cool ideas.
