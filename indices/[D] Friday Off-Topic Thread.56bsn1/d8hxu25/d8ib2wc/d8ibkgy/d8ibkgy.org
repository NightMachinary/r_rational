I have no idea whether that article is brilliant or idiotic. On the one hand, humans do congregate into social groups as a defense mechanism and there is evidence that implicit loyalty gave us an evolutionary advantage. On the other hand, I find the author's extreme simplification of the subject to be insufficient for something as complicated and unexplored as the psychology of taste in fiction.
