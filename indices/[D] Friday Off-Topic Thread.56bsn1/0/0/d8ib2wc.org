  Can a person truly be called a "fan" of a work if he doesn't like the entirety of that work?

There's [[https://web.archive.org/web/20130525211228/http://plover.net/%7Ebonds/objects.html][an argument]] that fandom (as opposed to general appreciation/enjoyment) may even /require/ a work to be flawed. If a work isn't a mixture of inspiring and flawed, then the appreciators and the detractors aren't sharpening their memes against each other, and (so goes the theory) it'll be difficult for some elements of fandom, such as fan identity, to form.

(While hunting that article I found there was [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/z4/do_fandoms_need_awfulness/][an LW discussion of it]] as well.)
