this is an interesting way to look at stories. most stories i read are not super good only partway through. Either they are very good throughout or they are subpar throughout. Or they start off decently but not amazing in the beginning and either get slightly better or slightly worse as the story goes on. I've rarely if ever read a story that started out really really good and drastically deteriorated as it progressed. The only example I can think of that really comes close is the Bleach anime, and that was only because it kept increasing in filler and fighting without enough plot and character development to make up for it, not because of anything inherently worse about the story or the storytelling itself.

You must be very skilled at finding high-quality novel writing if you can even find that many novels that have high quality beginnings and low quality endings, in addition to overall good works, despite sturgeon's law.
