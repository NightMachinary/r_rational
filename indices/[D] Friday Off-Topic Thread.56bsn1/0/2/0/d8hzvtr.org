  You must be very skilled at finding high-quality novel writing if you can even find that many novels that have high quality beginnings and low quality endings, in addition to overall good works, despite sturgeon's law.

I haven't found /that/ many. /Wharf Rat/, /Trump Card/, /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114][The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope]]/, and maybe /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9265719][For the Price of a Soul]]/ and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200][The Unincorporated Man]]/ are the only individual books that come to mind. For series, the drop from /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872][Vapors]]/ to /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552144][Clarity]]/ qualifies, as well as perhaps the ever-expanding cast of the series begun with /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25966][Austraeoh]]/.

(I also have vague memories of being disappointed in /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632753][The Golden Transcendence]]/ after greatly enjoying the first two books in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41545][the trilogy]], many years ago. I was quite surprised when, just a few months ago, I read in /[[https://intelligence.org/2015/03/12/rationality-ai-zombies][Rationality: From AI to Zombies]]/ that Mr. Yudkowsky himself shared this opinion, and that the drop in quality was soon followed by the author's conversion to Christianity.)
