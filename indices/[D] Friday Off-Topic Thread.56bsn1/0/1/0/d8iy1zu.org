  A lot of what we like is imperfect, which makes it difficult to recommend to those who may not share our feelings toward it. We all have our own masterpieces and want others to love them as much as we do, but they frequently don't.

This is very well put. I sometimes get frustrated when I recommend something to someone that I know (or think I know) they'll really enjoy, but they get caught up on early imperfections and stop reading/watching rather than share my level of ability to take the bad with the good.

  The first book in the Night Angel Trilogy was the best by far

This was my feeling on it too. I'm not sure if I made this observation before or after you finished the trilogy, but I'm glad I wasn't the only one to feel disappointed by the second and third, after how great the first part was.
