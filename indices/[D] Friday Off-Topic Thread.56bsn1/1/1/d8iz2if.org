  Dragon has been redefined as a damage type to represent raw energy manipulation and as an archetype to represent rage. Hyper beam is more than likely a Dragon-type move for both reasons.

Yep, this is basically how I'm imagining Dragon Types so far :)

  Fairy has been given a purpose: it is a type that has to do with Light, both in the use of optical illusions and photonic blasts. Dark types are not immune to these illusions as they do not affect the mind.

I approve, and this is how I headcanon Fairy moves being resisted by Fire and Steel, though why Poison resists it is still a mystery. (Poison is just a nonsense type in general, when it comes to its weaknesses and resists).

  Bug has been salvaged and redesigned as a damage type that centers around infestation. Parasect spreads a rapidly-growing fungus while Beedrill injects Weedle larva, both of which deal Bug-type damage as they atonomously consume the target inside-out.
#+end_quote

This is a really neat way to conceptualize what Bug types attacks are as a distinct physical trait, rather than the emergent-property-types idea of bug pokemon themselves being what matters most. I like it a lot, though presumably this doesn't include things like Signal Beam and Bug Buzz? Or are those going to be re-Typed?

  Ground has found itself more or less gutted.
#+end_quote

Why not just make Ground pokemon be pokemon that are more reliant on being on earth/soil, either for mobility or as part of their substance? Bone Club/Bonemerang definitely need to be re-typed, but what Ground moves are more like Rock moves? Most that I can find are earth, sand, or mud related.

  Fighting is also currently under debate. It seems to me there is no fundamental reason that something would be hurt by Karate Chop significantly more than it would by Double Slap, so my current idea is to roll most physical Fighting moves into Normal, with Ki-based and Aura moves staying as the true manifestation of Fighting. I am recieving backlash on this, though, so we're still working it out.

To me, Normal attacks that use fists or hands are just blunt damage. What makes Fighting moves Fighting is the intent and strength behind them: basically a Hitmonchan can use a Normal attack like Megapunch by just hitting any part at random, whereas a Karate Chop is a direct attack against an enemy body's weakpoint, like a joint or neck, since you wouldn't Karate Chop someone's face or chest. Kind of like the distinction between Scratch and Slash.
