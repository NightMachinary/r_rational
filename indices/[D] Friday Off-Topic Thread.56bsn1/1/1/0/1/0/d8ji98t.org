  I think you might be basing the perception of Ground pokemon too heavily on Gen 1. Which makes sense since that's primarily what the pokemon you're designing will be from, but in later generations Ground pokemon are quite distinct from Rock pokemon.
#+end_quote

I am biased, you're right, but part of that comes from the fact that they're so similar in spite of efforts to superficially make them distinct:

--------------

Ground is weak to: Grass, Ice, Water

Ground resists: Poison, Rock, and Electric

--------------

Rock is weak to: Grass, Water, Fighting, Ground, and Steel

Rock resists: Poison, Normal, Flying, Fire

--------------

From a pure defensive profile, if you combine the two you get:

--------------

Earth is weak to: Grass, Water, Ice, Fighting, and Steel

Earth resists: Poison, Normal, Flying, Fire, and Electric (and presumably Earth)

--------------

If Quagsire were changed to be Water/Earth, his defensive profile changes from [[http://i.imgur.com/w71MaF3.png][this]] to [[http://i.imgur.com/xNQLTem.png][this]]. If you discount Flying and Fighting (since they're different under this system), the only real difference is that Steel got better against him, Normal got worse, and Fire even worse.

Would we even have /noticed/ if Game Freak hadn't tried to shoehorn the type in? Once upon a time there was a Bird type that was distinct from the Flying type, but they realized this was stupid and merged the two, which resulted in some weird things like Flying being super effective against Bug, but all in all it was a good change. What if they had done the same with Ground/Rock? Would we care that Garchomp is Rock/Dragon? Sand is just crushed up rocks, we would claim, it's still consistent.

I'm very leery of type distinctions that were made for metagame reasons rather than truly justifiable ones. This has that stink all over it.

(Also, even the TCG realized this was stupid, and just lumped Fighting/Ground/Rock together.)

  The vast majority of Ground pokemon have some kind of distinct affinity with soil/sand, either for movement or as part of their body.

So I'll give those pokemon a bonus to Dig and Tunneling moves. This is an observation of what they're good at, i.e. specific Moves, and not how they inherently, fundamentally interact with other types.

Fire/Water/Grass are all /inherent/. No one ever questions those types advantages because of what they /are/ and not what they /do/. It bugs me that there are then these action-descriptive types that are given the same amount of legitimacy.

You've already picked up on this with your Substance/Descriptive definitions, though I feel now as I look at the list that it's flawed. It should be like:

Substance: Fire, Water, Plant, Electric, Ice, Poison, Rock, Metal, Ghost, Dark, Psychic

Descriptive: Normal, Flying, Fighting, Ground, Bug, Dragon, Fairy

Though Dark/Psychic/Dragon/Fairy are admittedly nebulous sliding-scales and probably have feet in both camps depending on the individual.

  (Bug and Flying pokemon both resist Ground moves for fairly obvious reasons but are weak to Rock moves)

It is for this exact reason that I divided physical attacks into Contact and Projectile. Propelling a rock, seed, or bullet of the same size and the same speed should do the same damage, by and large, to a flying type: I see no reason that the rock would bring it crashing down where the seed would actually do /less/ damage, and the bullet's over here like "Guess I have no advantage at all".

Admittedly throwing a dirt clod of the same size and speed would do less. But this seems to describe a weak Earth move, not an inherently disadvantaged type.

  I think it makes sense that, say, Grass pokemon have a resistance to attacks that use soil or mud, while not having a resistance to attacks that use rocks.
#+end_quote

Plants tend to die when buried. It's like the elementary school riddle: what weighs more, a thousand pounds of dirt, or a thousand pounds of rock? Answer: they both crush an equal amount. We like to handwave it with the same elementary-school reasoning: "well, a plant can put roots in soil, so obviously it can take getting a fifty-pound bag of it thrown in its face!" I drive a car, so obviously I control and have influence over it, but you drop one on me and I'm gone.

This seems like it would be better modeled with move power: mud slap has 50 power, rock slide has 300. Fire types will react to both unfavorably, but you don't /resist/ the mud slap more than the rock slide, it's just a matter of scale.

The one thing that this stumbles on is Electric; I can see Electric types being interrupted by mud caked on their body where they wouldn't by an equal amount of gravel, but that's more a long-term effect than an immediate damage one. I'll probably have to put something into those Rock/Water mud attacks that specifically dampens Electric attacks for X turns to compensate.

  Instead of having different Super Effective modifiers, physical Fighting type attacks neutralize a % of their opponent's Defense.

This is a decent idea, and will probably be combined with one or two other ideas to differentiate the old physical fighting moves from old normal moves in the new Normal space. The thing is, though, this is a design guideline and not an inherent type difference: I mean, I'm /fine/ with it, but it's interesting how people jump up and insist that there must be /some/ difference between the two types. People so far don't seem to care /what/ that difference is, so long as /some/ distinction exists, and I'm happy to define a subarchetype within Normal for it.

Come to think of it, subtypes need to be more of a thing. In Magic the Gathering (and other TCGs), one particular faction doesn't do just /one/ single thing, it has a collection of related, yet separate families that work together. Normal could probably have "physical moves, basic moves, sonic moves, and everything else that doesn't have a unique identifier", while Psychic has "telekinesis, barriers, teleportation, and telepathy", Fighting has "chi and auras", etc. Being of one type means that you could sidestep into one or more of the families without /too/ much trouble, but these subtypes don't vary /too/ much from the mean, either.
