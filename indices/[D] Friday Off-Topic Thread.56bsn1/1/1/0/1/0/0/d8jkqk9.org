  What if they had done the same with Ground/Rock? Would we care that Garchomp is Rock/Dragon? Sand is just crushed up rocks, we would claim, it's still consistent.

If it had started that way, I don't think anyone would have gone "Hey, this type is too broad, it should really be two different types!" But I do think it would have reduced the variety and uniqueness of a lot of pokemon, past Gen 1. As a design decision, it made very little sense in Gen 1 but opened a lot of creative space past it.

  I'm very leery of type distinctions that were made for metagame reasons rather than truly justifiable ones. This has that stink all over it.
#+end_quote

Honestly the metagame in Gen 1 was so bad I don't think ANY decision was made for that reason XD

#+begin_quote
  (Also, even the TCG realized this was stupid, and just lumped Fighting/Ground/Rock together.)
#+end_quote

Yeah, but to be fair they also rolled Bug and Poison into Grass.

Actually the more similar argument is to roll Ice and Water together. In Gen 1, other than Articuno there's no pokemon with "ice" as part of their identity. Hell Jynx is the only Ice type that's not also water, and there's no obvious reason why she's one.

I know you call Ice a "leveled up Water" in Bill's PC, so why not just make Rock a "leveled up Ground?"

  It is for this exact reason that I divided physical attacks into Contact and Projectile. Propelling a rock, seed, or bullet of the same size and the same speed should do the same damage, by and large, to a flying type: I see no reason that the rock would bring it crashing down where the seed would actually do less damage, and the bullet's over here like "Guess I have no advantage at all". Admittedly throwing a dirt clod of the same size and speed would do less. But this seems to describe a weak Earth move, not an inherently disadvantaged type.
#+end_quote

I think it's implied that Rocks being thrown are heavier than other objects that are used as projectiles, though. The idea isn't that they're just throwing "rocks," and that the earthy power within them is unleashed on impact, it's that they're throwing boulders, or at least rocks bigger than any human can just pick up and toss around. Sure this could be reflected in Attack Power of each move, but then you're basically relegating all Ground moves to be pretty weak and all Rock moves to be either very strong or rather pointless.

Also when you say "bullet," are you referring to guns, or moves that have the name "bullet" in them?

  Plants tend to die when buried. It's like the elementary school riddle: what weighs more, a thousand pounds of dirt, or a thousand pounds of rock? Answer: they both crush an equal amount. We like to handwave it with the same elementary-school reasoning: "well, a plant can put roots in soil, so obviously it can take getting a fifty-pound bag of it thrown in its face!" I drive a car, so obviously I control and have influence over it, but you drop one on me and I'm gone.
#+end_quote

I actually always saw it more as Plant pokemon being able to dig themselves out if buried or use roots to stabilize themselves/the ground around them in an earthquake or be nourished by mud.

Again though, obviously the substance vs substance goal is the root of the difference here. I don't know how many special rules can be brought up without /some/ implied type interactions, but then, you are turning Flying into a completely special rules Type, so I think I might just have trained myself too well to think in terms of justifying the current type interactions rather than mapping them onto a whole new structure :)

#+begin_quote
  This is a decent idea, and will probably be combined with one or two other ideas to differentiate the old physical fighting moves from old normal moves in the new Normal space. The thing is, though, this is a design guideline and not an inherent type difference: I mean, I'm fine with it, but it's interesting how people jump up and insist that there must be some difference between the two types. People so far don't seem to care what that difference is, so long as some distinction exists, and I'm happy to define a subarchetype within Normal for it.
#+end_quote

Yep, and this is what I meant when I warned about poor reception among Pokemon fans ;) I think your suggestions by and large would all make the game more realistic, and if you were using your own brand and world I don't think anyone would bat an eye. But it's the age old fanfiction debate, about how much you can change before what you're writing might as well not even use the name of the source material anymore.

Also, in this case I think part of the reason people have that feeling may be because Fighting is such a uniquely placed Type in the metagame. It's so important as a check against Steel and Dark that effectively removing it as a Type really changes the landscape of the game. Tyranitar and Aggron in particular becomes monsters without their 4x weakness to Fighting, though Aggron would still have his 4x weakness to Ground.

But so many other things are going to be different in your game that ultimately it's not going to matter, and the dust will really have to settle before any decisions about balance can really be made.

  Come to think of it, subtypes need to be more of a thing. In Magic the Gathering (and other TCGs), one particular faction doesn't do just one single thing, it has a collection of related, yet separate families that work together. Normal could probably have "physical moves, basic moves, sonic moves, and everything else that doesn't have a unique identifier", while Psychic has "telekinesis, barriers, teleportation, and telepathy", Fighting has "chi and auras", etc. Being of one type means that you could sidestep into one or more of the families without too much trouble, but these subtypes don't vary too much from the mean, either.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think that's where "Mental attacks" and similar will be so useful. Ghost, Psychic, and even potentially some Bug and Dark type attacks could have the "Mental" attribute that gives them similar effectiveness or attributes against a specific enemy, even if that enemy's type has a second layer of interactions that reacts differently to all of them.
