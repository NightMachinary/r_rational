I think that's my primary issue with fighting: all of the strengths/weaknesses are for the most part "cute" interactions that are geared around easy mnemonics but not actually reflected in reality. The karate master breaking concrete and bending metal, the heroic fighter standing up to darkness, "two birds with one stone" for rock vs flying, etc.

The rest of us are then left holding the bag trying to /justify/ it. I can totally understand why purists would want to twist things around to make it fit as well as possible, but I'm only passingly interested in preserving the original's type distinctions. If it makes more sense to divide things differently, then I'd like to divide them differently.

Your higher injury suggestion, [[/u/DaystarEld]] 's inverted defense mechanic, and [[/u/infernovulpix]] 's sliding skill scale mechanic are all good suggestions, and I imagine they'll go in in one form or another.

STAB will exist, though maybe not at exactly 150% effectiveness, in addition to the Affinity system, which I think will end up being the more impactful. Flying types will already treat Normal and Fighting moves as Flying while in the air, and I think letting Fighting types treat Normal as Fighting is fine, from a strict damage output/offensive effectiveness angle.
