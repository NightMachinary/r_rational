She is not worse than the average dog. She is as good as a dog, maybe even better. It's just that dogs aren't expected to socialize with humans on the level Rachel has to.

Dogs never have to form complex coalitions, keep track of favors, etiquette and fashion, possible betrayals, romance, irony and sarcasm. All those things that Rachel hates.

But Rachel does have the same innate understanding dogs have of human body language. She could tell when Taylor was upset from body language alone, even though Skitter's costume has a mask that hides her facial expression.
