If my sample of two is anything to go by, dating websites suck (I tried Once and OkCupid).

The way I understand it, dating websites basically take the same problems you have with real-life dating, only you're dealing with them by typing on a keyboard. So women receive a huge quantity of messages, the majority of them going from poor quality to "ey u wana sho me ur tits", which incentivizes them to never make the first step and send an unprompted message, and means they're unlikely to commit to any given conversation. And on the other side of that wall, men need to send lots and lots of messages to maximize their chances of getting an answer, which incentivizes them to send poor-quality, quickly written messages (or even copy-pasted ones) too reach as many women as possible. So on one side you're flooded with attention, often from very unsavory, immature people. On the other side you spend your time sending messages and getting ignored. This sucks.

So I guess I'm done with dating websites for now, unless someone here has a recommendation. I'd also be interested in other people's experience in that domain.
