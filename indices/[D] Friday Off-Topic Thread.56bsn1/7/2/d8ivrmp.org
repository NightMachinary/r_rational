OKC does have a section where they publish their statistics and glows. You'll notice that for a guy, information about personality and having a good profile are considered important.

I know that women don't initiate conversation, but they do read profiles recommended to them, and search for people with certain filters. Being prepared for that with a fun, engaging profile with interests listed is a great idea.

If you are a guy with an engaging profile, a DP that makes you look good(not too good though, apparently nudes don't work for men) and are someone who can send fun messages, you'll find a quality partner (short-term or long-term).

Don't give up!
