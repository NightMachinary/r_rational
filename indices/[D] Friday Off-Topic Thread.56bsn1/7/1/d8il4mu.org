Theoretically, [[https://bumble.com/][Bumble]] addresses this problem. I've never used it and therefore can't really recommend it, but it was designed to be a solution to this problem. The woman has to message first. It could go too far in the opposite direction, but because it's so contrary to the norm, it doesn't seem to. In other words, men don't seem to get flooded with unsavory attention and women don't send tons of messages and get ignored. Again, no idea how well it works, but I thought I'd mention it since it does seem to be at least /trying/ to solve the problem you described.
