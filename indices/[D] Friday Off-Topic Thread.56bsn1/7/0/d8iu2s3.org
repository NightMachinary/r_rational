I have had excellent success with OKC. Admittedly I'm a poly woman so I'm likely in a different sort of situation, supply and demand wise, than you are?

Here's a list of my "outcomes" from every single in-person meeting/"date" I had:

- Boyfriend ~8 months

- Friendship (was mostly looking for a friend), still maintained as a casual/peripheral sort of friendship

- Conspiracy theorist 9/11 was an inside job/etc. No second date.

- Boyfriend 4.5 years (ongoing, very high chance marriage / etc end-game in this relationship)

My advice:

- be very picky with who you message - do the screening BEFORE you waste time, energy, resources meeting up. Women get a lot of "hey what's up" , so rather than sending 10 really low quality messages, send 1 good message to your top candidate. If I get a message from someone with a match % in the 80s I basically don't bother to reply.

- If you aren't excited by any of the women you see on the site, don't waste your time. Come back every month or so and see who the new flock of single people are.

- Ensure your profile (especially your photo) is high quality. [[/r/okcupid]] is good for this, or I'm happy to have a look. Note that you are trying to sell yourself so don't highlight or even mention your flaws. They don't need to know that you have debilitating OCD that is controlled by medication until they've known you a few weeks.

- Some people are shallow about height so if you're below 5'8" increase your height by an inch or so. (Actually, increasing your height by an inch or so above your real height is probably a good idea regardless.)

- If you're interested in someone and messaging them, don't pressure them to meet right away, but you want to have an in person meeting in the two weeks to one month range or else it might never happen.

- Gently hint to your friends / family / colleagues (as appropriate) that you are looking for a partner, and see if they will introduce you to anyone.

Other comments:

- The size of your metro area is really important here. I had a really tough time when I lived in a city of ~300k but there's several good candidates in a city of ~1.8m. If you live in a small town you might want to look at nearer larger cities, or resort to traditional methods (friends of friends)

- Different dating sites have different specialities. OKC is more associated with the young / alternative / poly / short term relationship type scene, though there's obviously normies there. Eharmony and similar are more associated with the "I need to find someone to marry" type scene. There are others that are more associated with the casual sex / hookup type scene too.
