Tiny tiny idea for Worm fanfic: Rachel's understanding of human psychology is bad. Probably to the point where it's worse than the average dog's. A house pet can tell when someone's tone is threatening or happy, and won't react to a smile from a human as though it's a threat. So what if she kept a dog with her and read the human's psychology via reading the dog's psychology? Sort of like a translator.
