Huh, I'm not really into superhero comics, and have found the ideas of some mainstream superheroes compelling, but never Wonder Woman (she always struck me as a token female character). This post is the most intriguing description of her thematic/symbolic significance that I've ever seen; could you elaborate at length? Wonder Woman is such a well-known character that I figure that any general attempt to intelligently, rationally reboot DC's lineup would have to include her, but she's never seemed compelling from what little I've seen of her.
