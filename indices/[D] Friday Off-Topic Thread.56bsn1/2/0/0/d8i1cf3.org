Unfortunately, I haven't seen much more that you. I learned that I was wrong about Wonder Woman from Atop The Fourth Wall's very detailed reviews of bad comics, which included examples of good moments. I found the film by accident and it convinced me she was a character with depth and the feminist themes were well executed. I've heard that Gail Simone's run on the comic series was great, but the best example I've seen so far was in JLA: Tower of Babel where her interplay with the rest of the team showed off her personality and how effective it makes her.

In a story that otherwise felt like an excellent episode of Doctor Who, Wonder Woman ended up stopping a terrorist attack all by herself just by talking to a suicide bomber. He didn't even have a name, he was just a minion for the real villain, but it ended up being one of the best scenes in the comic for how seriously it addressed the situation and everyone emotions surrounding it. She had plenty of other awesome moments in the comic, but that one stood out to me.

I've heard from fans that Wonder Woman actually has one of the smallest rouge's galleries in comics simply due to the fact that she ends up befriending most of her enemies. Don't get me wrong, she's still a badass who's slain hordes of monsters without breaking a sweat, but she's just as much a diplomat as a warrior. There's even a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3061070/1/Probationary-Member][pretty damn good fanfic]] I've read that features the characters going to a women's shelter she runs.
