I didn't say the film was rational and the story does feel abridged due to its short runtime, but the fact that Steve is an ass at first plays into Diana's character arc. She is completely right to think he's sexist, but realizes she was mistaken to think he was inherently like that and couldn't change. He admits that it was wrong to treat her the way he did and promises to do better, which goes against the Amazons' ideological justification for living in seclusion.

However simplistic the presentation may be the theme is still about the importance of fighting prejudice without going too far in the other direction, which shows that the basic moral conflict Wonder Woman is built on is not oversimplified. For a character who is meant to idolize the empowerment of women to acknowledge that her own society has encouraged prejudice against others and resolved to do better is exactly who should be a feminist icon.
