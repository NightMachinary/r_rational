ShenzhenI/O just came out. [[http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/]]

Just bought the game and printed out the manual. I've got too much work to actually play it right now, but I should have some time to check it out this weekend... After playing TIS-100 and nearly completing it, I kind of expect the same to happen here, however the possibilities of this game are significantly more interesting than TIS-100.
