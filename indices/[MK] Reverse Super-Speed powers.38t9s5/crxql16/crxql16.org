It's going to be pretty powerful regardless, but exactly how it could be leveraged depends on how the power resolves the resulting inconsistencies with physics. Some possibilities:

1. Chopping/fracturing things by making one part of them go slower while the other part is subject to sonic vibrations and so on.
2. Making soft objects and liquids brittle enough to fracture.
3. Reverse entropy: Turn warm to cold by slowing its atoms, then after it warms, negate the effect and it becomes hot again.
4. Free energy: apply to a hot object to slow down the rate at which it becomes cold or to a cold sink to slow the rate at which it warms.
5. Juggernaut: Make something maintain its momentum for a long time due to slower deceleration rate while plowing through a heavy object, escaping a gravity well, etc.
6. Projectile: Apply to an object prior to launch and/or impact to harden it against outwardly high / inwardly low gee forces.

Definitely a power you could leverage for space travel and so on, unless very carefully nerfed.
