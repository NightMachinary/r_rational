It's free energy if the object stays the same temperature as measured externally for a longer time.

IOW If you were to heat something to thousands of degrees then slow it down, and it was to stay there glowing and pumping out heat for days on end because the boundary has a filter to actively prevent temperature changes, that would be energy that didn't exist before.

A thermos makes the object seem cool (close to the ambient) on the outside by reflecting heat on both sides. So that's another possibility. But if the temperature differential is extreme, that implies something extremely hard and reflective, which could be munchkined in other ways (for example, making a sword with ridiculous strength and durability out of thin air, or concentrating solar power and storing it at absurdly high temperatures.)
