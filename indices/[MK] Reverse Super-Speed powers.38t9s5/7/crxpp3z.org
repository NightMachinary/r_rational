What happens if you slow yourself down by some absurd degree? Can the universe end before you have time to switch your power off?

How do non-slowed-down things interact with slowed-down things? Are you invulnerable while slowed down? Or does everything in your environment seem to be moving at absurd speeds and kill you if you're not in a sealed box?
