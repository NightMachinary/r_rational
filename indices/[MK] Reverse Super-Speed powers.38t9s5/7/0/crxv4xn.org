Yes, but you have enough control that that isn't a real danger, unless you feel suicidal.

During the slowing, the power messes with your momentum a bit in order to prevent the earth from starting to rotate under you, etc. Once at your final speed, things generally interact with inversely proportionate momentum relative to you- That falling rock that hits you on the head now hits four times as hard since it's traveling twice as fast, relative to you.

At lower speeds, the time field extends a bit more from your body in order to prevent random air molecules from tearing your body to shreds, but you're still not invulnerable.
