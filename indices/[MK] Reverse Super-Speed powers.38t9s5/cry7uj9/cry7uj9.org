The behaviour of the power isn't specified enough. As it stands, any object you use this on will quickly subjectively heat up, because of radiative heating. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law][Black body radiation intensity goes with temperature to the fourth power]], so slowing yourself down by a factor of 16 will increase apparent ambient temperature by a factor of 2 (300K -> 600K). This is not a defensive power, it is the power to destroy anything within that 27 cubic meter volume.

Well, unless your hand has to actually be inside the volume, because then it's the power to blow up (sublimate) your own hands.

#+begin_quote
  You can apply your powers to another person, object, or space of up to 27 cubic meters at a time. You must make physical skin contact, or have your hand in the space you want to time-shift.
#+end_quote

You didn't provide limits on the shape of the volume. This turns it into a power which works at arbitrary range, except for a nanometer-thin strand of slowed-down space spanning from yourself to the target.

Ergo:

1. Any matter other than iron-56 can be made to explode like a nuclear bomb.

2. Use activation/deactivation of your powers to play Maxwell's demon, producing arbitrary amounts of negentropy with the right set-up.

3. Destroy (heat stress, ageing, nuclear detonation, localised immobility, etc.) anyone or anything you have line of sight to, or perhaps even just know the location of, at the speed of thought.
