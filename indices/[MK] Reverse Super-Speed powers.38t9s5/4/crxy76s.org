I'd make a particle smasher out of a rope, a shield of some kind, and a gun with a piece of string tied around the trigger.

First, set up the rope so one end is in the control room and one end is behind the shield, in front of the gun. Next, grab the rope and slow it 1000000x. Fire the gun. It will hit 1000000^{2} times as hard because of the time warping, which could probably beat most particle accelerators.
