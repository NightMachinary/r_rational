This is similar to the metals Bendalloy and Cadmium in the Mistborn series, specifically the Alloy of Law book. Someone burning those metals creates a time bubble around them which slows or speeds up time depending on which metal they burn.

In the book, the character Wayne could burn Bendalloy which was very good for slowing down everyone else to plan inside the time bubble or whatnot. The character Marasi could speed up time outside the bubble with Cadmium, but she felt it was quite useless compared to the Bendalloy. It did turn out to be useful in keeping someone in place for the cavalry to come help you.

With your idea, when you apply the power to someone else, does it also affect you or just them? Being able to affect either does sound like Clockblocker from Worm as [[/u/Gurkenglas]] mentioned. That was not as controllable and made the object immovable as well which had tactical uses.
