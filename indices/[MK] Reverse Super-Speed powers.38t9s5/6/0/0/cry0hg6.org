Sorry, I didn't mean to attack you personally. I realized I sounded slightly bitter. I'm mostly just curious why many different people here have taken a sudden interest.

There have been discussions of super-speed, discussion of some of the Alloy of Law powers, discussion in a post about "useless super powers", and at least one other. Your ideas were all new to me, so I'm not saying the post was unnecessary. :)
