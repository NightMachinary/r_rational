Can you apply this power to electronics? If the device in question draws power from an external source--say, a laptop plugged into a wall outlet--will there be any weird effects? Say, would the device fail from being unable to pull power quickly enough, or will it seem to pull more power from the perspective of the power source?

In either case, could you conceivably save on your utilities bill by slowing down most of your house to 0.9x, or would even this be enough to cause disasters?

(You'd of course be able to save the most money by using your power on the air, and therefore not needing so much costly temperature control.)
