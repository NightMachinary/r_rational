  Huh, you're really nerfing ninja. How far a jump is that?
#+end_quote

About five meters, but remember that these are new genin who haven't even learnt how to climb trees yet.

#+begin_quote
  So ninja are weak, but kunai are somehow strong enough to hold a person's weight?
#+end_quote

Sure. The chain bears part of the weight, and characters like Kakashi have done it plenty of times in canon.

#+begin_quote
  My random reminder that Sasuke has obscenely large reserves as well, though not at Naruto's level.
#+end_quote

Yes, but that's because Kishi has a hard-on for the Uchiha clan. I declare nerf.

Regarding your second point: I guess weird minds think alike?

#+begin_quote
  is it really that hard to just transform your clothing instead of wearing camo?
#+end_quote

It's not so much the chakra cost as it is the constant mental focus necessary to keep that up. But it would be good practice...

hm, now I'm thinking I need to add that to the next Arc.

#+begin_quote
  Personal note: not sure why you want to go to Land of Waves.
#+end_quote

Honestly I'm really doubting whether I made the correct decision there. The Waves Arc is actually the first part of the story I wrote, because after years of writing it in my head I just wanted to put something on paper. The Waves act was the most convenient way to do it since it was a mostly distinct/separate/self-contained (is there a better word for that?) part of the story. But now I'm looking at it and going "If it's mostly separate from the rest of the story and it's not 100% original, should it really be there?" So I'm scratching my head a bit there.

I still think the second half of the Waves Act at least is really good though, and well-written, and some important things happen in it so I don't just want to throw it away...

#+begin_quote
  I felt the little digression on economics courtesy of Sakura felt a bit forced or out of place.
#+end_quote

Hmm, you're probably right.

#+begin_quote
  in canon its a combination of spiritual and physical energy, and there isn't really a 'reserve' of it. Many instances in canon have character recovering from using too much chakra pretty quick, with some ill-defined threshold of chakra exhaustion that causes immediate collapse.
#+end_quote

Canon kinda seems to contradict itself on this: Yes, it's stated many times that chakra is something you 'mould', though it's never explained how. But on the other hand, if you have the Byakugan for example you can SEE how much chakra someone has, and techniques which drain chakra can make someone fall unconscious or die if they 'run out'. How can someone run out of chakra if it's something you have to mould first? How can Neji see that Naruto "split his chakra even across his shadow clones" unless there is a pool of chakra to spread out?

My solution is to combine both explanations: You do have a pool of chakra running through your veins at all times, which is sufficient for 'steady state' exercise as you put it and which kills you if you run out because your organs have grown to depend on it. However, when you run out you can speed up the production of chakra by the organs in your body through conscious effort, which ninjas call "spiritual energy" because they are a bunch of superstitious dweebs. Why there is a reality-bending substance like chakra being produced in your body in the first place is an exercise left to the reader.

Originally I wanted to explain all of the above in one of the earlier chapters, but it became too much exposition and detracted from the story. A shame, really, since I put a lot of (read: way too much) time into thinking about it :P
