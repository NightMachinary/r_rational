Just one, but he's a really good writer himself (and a historian to boot). I also gave the full Act 1 to about 60 other people here on R/rational, but almost none of the buggers actually left any feedback!

I can certainly use more beta readers: I'm definitely a bit concerned about the structure of the next act and its originality in particular, as my only beta reader never actually watched Naruto. Why, do you know any or are you volunteering? :p
