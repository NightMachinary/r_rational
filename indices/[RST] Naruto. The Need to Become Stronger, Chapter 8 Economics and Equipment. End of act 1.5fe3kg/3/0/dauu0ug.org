Hey Eaglejarl! Great to see you're still reading the story. The answer is that Sasuke can see it when his Sharingan is activated - it wasn't. He had it activated during training because he knew in advance what Kakashi would be doing.

Even with his Sharingan activated, he could still have been caught unaware if Kakashi had cast it on him from behind, but it would have been much trickier to pull off.
