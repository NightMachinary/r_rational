  I hope you make genjutsu as big a part of this story as ninjutsu. In a rational story, the ability to attack the mind directly seems incredibly powerful.

Yup, and it fits the theme too! It'll certainly play a big role in the story, but it will generally be used more subtly than ninjutsu.

  Is genjutsu going to be used by more than just Sakura and Sasuke? Because a version of Team 7 where they are not just an assault based team, but a genjutsu focused team as well, would be something I have never seen before in a fic. And while I know genjutsu is normally seen as the realm of Sakura/Sasuke, Kakashi's comment about immobilising enemies via brute force seems right up Naruto's alley.

On the one hand, I agree with you. On the other hand, it would be overpowered as heck! In Naruto there's always been this balance between "genius types" with lots of subtle techniques and skills on the one hand, and "Will" types who have tons of chakra/power. If I gave someone like Naruto all of Sasuke's abilities and let him use them intelligently in addition to having enormous chakra reserves... holy crap he would be unbeatable.

Unless you can think of some downside or weakness to him having body-bind genjutsu, I don't see him having that until maybe very late in the story :s
