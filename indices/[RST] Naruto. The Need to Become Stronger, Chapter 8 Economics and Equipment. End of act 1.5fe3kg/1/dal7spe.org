"They arrived at the river, and Kakashi body-flickered across, while Naruto and the others were forced to take the long way around, as they could not jump that far."

Huh, you're really nerfing ninja. How far a jump is that?

"Meanwhile Sasuke used a kunai with a length of chain attached as a grapple, and scaled the wall vertically. "

So ninja are weak, but kunai are somehow strong enough to hold a person's weight?

"Somehow the Uchiha heir seemed to have no difficulty keeping up with Naruto, despite the massive difference in chakra reserves."

My random reminder that Sasuke has obscenely large reserves as well, though not at Naruto's level. See: using fireballs as an 8 year old, keeping up with Naruto in all-night tree training, etc.

Also, your ficcanon for the two types of genjutsu is weirdly similar to mine. Makes sense of Kakashi's genjutsu against Zabuza (super subtle) and the opposite type: Sasuke using genjutsu in part 2, which is usually not subtle (against Danzo its an exception) but generally pretty effective.

"Despite Naruto's protestations, Kakashi had insisted they wear something resembling actual camouflage for their first real mission outside the Village. "

I don't remember how chakra intensive you made transformation in this fic: is it really that hard to just transform your clothing instead of wearing camo?

"daemon"

My own personal trigger: "demon" --> "daemon" though I admit that's entirely subjective.

"Slowly, very slowly, the tension in Sasuke's muscles drained away. “...I will be expecting you to pay me back at some point,” he said at last. “Don't think I'll forget, dropout.”"

Man, I continue to not like your version of Sasuke, and how you're using him, but scenes like these make me half-convinced he's playing some long con where he pretends to be arrogant and impulsive just to make people underestimate him, instead of actually being arrogant and obsessed with his heritage.

Personal note: not sure why you want to go to Land of Waves. Hopefully you'll subvert expectations by having it be quite different, but in the Naruto fandom its a bit like Taylor (from Worm) fighting Lung on her first night out or Harry Potter going to Diagon Alley to buy stuff.

Overall: your writing continues to be technically very good, and Naruto's inner dialogue is quite good as well, though I think Kakashi's dialogue was a little off. Also, I felt the little digression on economics courtesy of Sakura felt a bit forced or out of place. We know its a fic with thought out economics. That can recede a little to the background. Though since its the beginning of the fic I can understand more of that in this part.

Re: chakra mechanics

Not sure how exactly you're treating it in this fic, but in canon its a combination of spiritual and physical energy, and there isn't really a 'reserve' of it. Many instances in canon have character recovering from using too much chakra pretty quick, with some ill-defined threshold of chakra exhaustion that causes immediate collapse.

one way to conceptualize is analogous to physical capacity for exercise: there's total exhausation that leads to physical collapse, exhaustion that can be recovered from in a couple minutes of rest, and a kind of steady-state exercise that can be maintained relatively indefinitely. Analogous to that, we have Kakashi post-Zabuza fight (collapses), Kakashi post second Zabuza fight (very tired, still able to fight), and ninja travel that doesn't seem to tire them.

Here it seems more like a 'tank' or reserve of chakra. Interesting choice.
