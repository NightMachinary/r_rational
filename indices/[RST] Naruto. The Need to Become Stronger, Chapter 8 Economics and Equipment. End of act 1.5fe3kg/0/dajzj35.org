Very interesting so far. I especially like how you, unlike most fanfic authors I know of in this fandom, are actually taking genjutsu seriously. I never really forgave canon for basically forgetting about them / making them useless as the series went on. I hope you make genjutsu as big a part of this story as ninjutsu. In a rational story, the ability to attack the mind directly seems incredibly powerful.

Is genjutsu going to be used by more than just Sakura and Sasuke? Because a version of Team 7 where they are not just an assault based team, but a genjutsu focused team as well, would be something I have never seen before in a fic. And while I know genjutsu is normally seen as the realm of Sakura/Sasuke, Kakashi's comment about immobilising enemies via brute force seems right up Naruto's alley.

Great work so far; this is definitely one of the more interesting Naruto works I've read. Once its finished it could be one of the greats. I can't wait to see what you're going to do with Team 7 :)
