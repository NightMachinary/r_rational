I think canon dropped the ball a little in not letting Sakura explore genjutsu (though she gets hilariously awesome super strength so I think it works) but genjutsu continues to be important throughout canon. Of course, it's mostly confined to the Uchiha clan: Sasuke, Itachi, Danzo, Kabuto, Second Mizukage (giant clam dude) all use genjutsu effectively.

of course, the jinchuuri immunity to most genjutsu (ala Killer B + Naruto) if their partner helps out is a mild copout, but it makes a fair amount of sense.
