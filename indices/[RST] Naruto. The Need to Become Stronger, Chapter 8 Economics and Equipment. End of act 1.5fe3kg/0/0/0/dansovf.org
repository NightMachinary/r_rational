Ah but that is the thing; how does the conept of having 'Will' types who just blaze in and win via brute force really fit in to the concept of a rational Naruto story?

For example, in canon Naruto is a classic 'Will' type, and uses his shadow clones as an instant army. Which is a pretty good use, I'm not complaining about that. But why was he never taught proper military strategy, so his clones could actually act as an army if needed? And why wasn't he ever taught stealth, so he could send in a clone to try and assassinate an enemy; the perfect, uncatchable, risk-free assassin?

For that matter, in a rational version of Naruto, the only way I see stealth not being incredibly over powered (given the number of one shot one kill techniques) is if you also buff sensory abilities.

But to get back on point; I don't see how 'Will' types fit into a rational story, especially as a protagonist. I'd rather read a rational Naruto story from Sakura's point of view if that was the case, as she would be on the only one in the team who really really really needed to think in order to win any of her battles.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if Naruto is going to be a classic 'Will' type in this rational retelling, while I do think you could write it well (showing him learning to avoid tricks and apply his power effectively), I don't think he was the right choice for a central protagonist.
