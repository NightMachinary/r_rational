Hmm, I didn't mean that Naruto is a stupid courage-before-reason type in this one; just that his lack of techniques in canon is part of the balancing act. In NTBS he definitely has a lot more smarts and correspondingly only a fraction of his canon chakra (still more than 10 times as much as Sakura though), but Sasuke is still the "always someone better" rival who is at least seen as being even smarter than him but much less powerful in terms of chakra.

The point being: The story does not work if Naruto is too unbeatable. Why? Because I have read plenty fanfiction where they gave Naruto too much power, and it completely removes any plot tension stemming from his dynamic with his team and the Village.
