No no, I love your line by line comments! That sort of thing is very helpful in getting a better idea of how my story comes across.

I could send you the next Act, but I have to warn you: Right now it's still too similar to canon for my tastes and so I was planning to modify it quite a bit. If you betaread it it would be very helpful, but the version you'd be getting would be less good than the final release.
