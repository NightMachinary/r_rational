Honestly, at the rate it's going, it'll be at least 5 and very probably more. With 5000 words a chapter, and maybe 60 chapters in total... 300000 words? I mean, that's a lot of story.

I feel like my beta reader should have maybe warned me about this at some point.

(In all seriousness, I do kinda worry that the story's massive size and chapter lengths combined with the prose might scare off newer readers - lots of short and snappy chapters generally works better with fanfiction, I think)
