And that's it, we've caught up to the initial release of Act 1! Everyone who downloaded the zipfile from mediafire can look forward to new chapters being released each week from now on - though there may be a short hiatus as I get the next Act in order.

The challenge here is to make sure that the next arc is as interesting and original as possible, given how many times it's been done before. But if you liked what you've seen so far, then it should be fine... right?

Do let me know what you all thought of the first Act! Feedback in every form is always very welcome!
