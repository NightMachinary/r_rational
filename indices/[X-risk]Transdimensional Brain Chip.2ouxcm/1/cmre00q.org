This is awesome. I don't care about the art, the writing fits with the idea he seems to be trying to convey that people are generally stupid. The guy has a story to tell to us (and I wanna hear it), and when you're bad at writing and drawing and stuff, having your readers read a bad comic costs them less than having them fight through bad prose.

The whales thing also kinda makes sense...

(The part about him being able to merge minds with himself does feel like an unnecessary tack-on.)
