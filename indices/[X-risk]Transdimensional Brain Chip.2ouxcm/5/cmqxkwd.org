I just finished reading through it and....well I can say it's definitely not rational fiction. The summary given is: Ulf gets a chip in his brain. It allows him to talk with other versions of himself in parallel universes.

It sounds interesting, but right from the first page, you see that Ulf is very stupid (or should that be gullible?) and to me, most of the interesting parts is how he learns/plays with the technology. The art doesn't get any better than the first page and I feel that the plot only gets really interesting around page #100. [[#s][Before that is]]
