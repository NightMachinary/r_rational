I knew I should have linked to this earlier, but I was too lazy. :(

A tip: try to look past the art and Scandinavianisms. I know, it's hard, but it's like Order of the Stick; you do get used to it eventually.

That said, /The Accidental Space Spy/ (also on the site) is IMO funnier and perhaps slightly more relevant on a rationality end of things. The closest analogy is perhaps /Gulliver's Travels/ as written by Douglas Adams.

/Hitmen for Destiny/ (ibid) is also fun in a sort of baroque maximalist way of continuous layering of jokes that reminds me of /Problem Sleuth/ or /Arrested Development/. It's a bit cruder due to inexperience with the medium, but it is worth the commitment.

One thing you will notice is that Thorsby is /the/ modern master of the comedy of errors.
