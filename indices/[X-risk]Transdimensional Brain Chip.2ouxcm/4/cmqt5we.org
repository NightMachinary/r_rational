While the whole thing seems really flimsy, it has a sort of cool concept going for it. That said... the author's artistic skills are really not all that great, and the art is just sort of brutally bad. I gave up even looking at it and just speed-read text boxes instead after a few pages. I didn't finish it yet. I would have preferred just reading the story in a text format instead of this - even though the prose doesn't seem that great (possibly the author learned English as a second language?) the art is far worse.
