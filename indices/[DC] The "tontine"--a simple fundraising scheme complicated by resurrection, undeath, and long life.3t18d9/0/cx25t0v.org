/tl;dr of the background (from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tontine#Concept][Wikipedia]]):/

#+begin_quote
  Each investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual dividends on the capital invested. As each investor dies, his share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until only one investor survives. Each subscriber receives only dividends; the capital is never paid back.

  By the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.

/tl;dr of the article:/

- Section 1 is a mildly-related tale. Seven adventurers collectively absorb the magic of a broken artifact. When one of them dies and they all become more powerful, they realize that the magic is spread evenly among all of them, regardless of number. It's implied that they kill each other until the entire endowment is concentrated into one person. (See also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11570855][this short story]], in which is discussed the gradual dilution of a hereditary curse among all the many descendants of a single person.)

- Section 2 is a descrption of how an adventuring guild, inspired by the story of Section 1, sets up a tontine to raise funds for building a larger facility: adventurers will pay a lump sum to become guild members and build a larger guild hall, in the expectation of receiving dividends from the saloon in their retirement. When only seven share-holding members remain, the shares will mature and those seven people will receive joint, inheritable ownership of the new guild hall.

- Section 3 discusses how resurrection and immortal undeath complicate these plans. On one side, evil adventurers who make themselves into immortal undead will get dividends forever! On the other side, what should be done if someone dies only temporarily? Should his share be returned to him after it's already been distributed to the survivors? Or does even a single death exclude him from collecting further dividends?

- Section 4 details how the bickering eventually blows up into a worldwide fight between long-lived elves and immortal undead, while the bankers laugh in the background. The tontine eventually pays out after several hundred years.
