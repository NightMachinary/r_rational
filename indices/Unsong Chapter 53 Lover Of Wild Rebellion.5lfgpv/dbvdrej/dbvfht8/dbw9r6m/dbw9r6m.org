The magnolia genus is named after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Magnol][Pierre Magnol]], one of the botanists responsible for "the botanical scheme of classification". Magnol was a Calvinist who later converted to Catholicism.

The "Five points of Calvinism" can be memorised using the mnemonic "TULIP" (another flower, which is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence):

- Total Depravity - no man is able to not sin
- Unconditional Election - God chooses to save some people unconditionally
- Limited Atonement - Jesus didn't die for the whole world, just those chosen few
- Irresistable Grace - if somebody is saved, they cannot resist redemption
- Perseverance of the Saints - if somebody does not persevere with their faith, they were never truly saved

From this we derive a correspondence between people with flower names and classifying things according to their deeper nature.
