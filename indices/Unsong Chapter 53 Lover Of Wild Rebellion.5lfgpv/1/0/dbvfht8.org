Magnolia is the state tree of Mississippi, which is stereotypically the worst state in various measures (e.g. education, poverty, health).

It is more generally associated with the South, sometimes in the context of that region's history of racial violence, as in the song "Strange Fruit": "Pastoral scene of the gallant south / The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth / Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh / Then the sudden smell of burning flesh."

The magnolia is also a symbol of North Korea, which is stereotypically the worst nation.

The film /Magnolia/ includes a rain of frogs, which is a Biblical plague.

The title of the play /Steel Magnolias/ describes tough Southern women.

The Grateful Dead song "Sugar Magnolia" is a love song about a woman who (among other things) covers for her man's irresponsibility: "Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double / Pays my ticket when I speed".
