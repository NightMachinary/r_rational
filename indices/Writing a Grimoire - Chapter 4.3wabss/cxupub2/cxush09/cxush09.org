This doesn't quite explain the cold: slowing down the molecules /once/ would cool down the paper once, but forcing the molecules to stay slow will also prevent it from absorbing any more heat than usual, so if the molecules stay slow it won't feel cold. In fact, slowing down the molecules seems like a great hypothesis for what's going on with the hardened paper. The only trouble with /that/ is that it's still easy to rotate the paper or accelerate it, it's just hard to bend it.

If we look on the scale of the molecules, making them cold would be like adding an opposing force to them that is constant (like dragging a box) or that opposes the velocity (like air resistance), while making them slow would be like adding an opposing force to them that /opposes other forces/.
