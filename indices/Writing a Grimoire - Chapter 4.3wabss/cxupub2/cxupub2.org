Hypothesis: before drawing the line, the molecules of the paper are slowed down, which causes the paper to appear cold. After drawing the line, this property becomes macroscopical and the paper itself is slowed down in time, which gives the impression that it's hard. So both modifications observed so far are related to time manipulation.

How does this sound? Any way to test it?
