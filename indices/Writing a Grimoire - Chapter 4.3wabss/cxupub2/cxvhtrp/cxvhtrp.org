I'd draw most of the diagram, set a corner of the paper on fire, and finish the diagram.

If the paper keeps burning (albeit very, very slowly) we've got good evidence that the paper is being macroscopically slowed, as opposed to just frozen.

The paper going out is a less clear signal; it only rules out some of the ways that "slowing the molecules" could work.
