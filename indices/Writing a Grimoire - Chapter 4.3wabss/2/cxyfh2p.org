Next order of business is to figure out if the pentagram can be disabled. We want to know before hand how to disable the paper (in case of fire gram, black-hole gram, or up quarks gram)\\
Hypothesis: scribbling a part of the outer circle disables the pentagram.

Obviously the way forward is to not mess with adding more combinations to our knowledge base. If all we know already presents us with danger (metal papercuts and cold burns) I don't think any other grams we discover would nesiccarially be safe.

On the topic of new grams we could discover, hard and cold grams seem to follow a pattern of "elemental" effects, they also all seem to have utility. I'd hypothesise that future grams could be: the hot gram, anti-grav gram, ghost gram, explosion gram, alpha/beta/gamma radiation gram.

Furthermore, if we can't tell anyone about the grams or utilize the grams to better human society, I don't really see the point of enquiring further into them. Curiosity is not worth the potential risks of finding a very dangerous garm.

If we /are/ going to do new gram testing, it should be done in an empty room, or deserted place outside, and drawn with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot][turtle robot]]). I'm worried that the explosion gram will take someone's hand off.

What do you guys think?
