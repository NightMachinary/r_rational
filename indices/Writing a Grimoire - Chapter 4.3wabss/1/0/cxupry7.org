This is a good opportunity to discuss philosophy of science, which is my main motivation to write this story. If I were a better writer I would be able to embed this directly into the story.

What you first suggest is to experiment with how the pentagrams are drawn, by changing the order they are drawn or using something other than pen and paper. But you never say anything about what result you expect from these changes.

That expectation would be your hypothesis, for example: If the pentagram is drawn starting from the outside circle and inward, the paper will be cold. If the pentagram is drawn starting with the inner triangle and outward, the paper will be warm.

The characters can draw the pentagram in different ways and test this, which makes the hypothesis (or theory, if you want) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability][/falsifiable/]].

This is in contrast to you two last hypothesis, that the the world is a simulation or that the source of magic is a supercomputer. There is no experiment our characters can currently perform that will show these hypothesis false (that I can come up with!), and thus these hypothesis cannot be considered to be scientific. And more importantly for me: it does nothing to drive the plot of the story forward.

Of course, if the way the pentagrams work are directly connected to the /Ultimate Truth of the Universe/, there may be a way forward here, but I'm keeping [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics][Metaphysics]] for the last Arc.
