If you believe magic has existed throughout history and your roommate was able to get a hold of it then that implies that magic is available to at least some people but something is stopping it from spreading and that experimenting with or using it enough will end up with that something happening to you.

If you believe magic is only a recent occurrence and your roommate was able to access it then either your roommate had access to god like powers at some point and made the world the way it is (world is a simluation) or you are being screwed with by some other higher order being.

In the first case leaving runes lying around will likely lead to some horrible consequence like a masquerade kill team detecting and tracking the source of the magic to your house if you use cool charms in your fridge to save on electricity for example.
