They don't /know/ it's destroying energy... it could be radiating it as neutrinos or polarized gravity waves ^{(spot the reference)} or something, and any temperature gradient can be used to do useful work. A chunk of cold could keep you warm well into the future.

What to do?

Go back to Tom's original idea, and draw stuff in different orders. At arms length.

See if you can sketch it with a flatbed plotter, if you can find one any more.

Or try a 3d printer.

Hypothesis?

1. The whole world is a simulation and this pattern is a backdoor.

2. There's a supercomputer that's the Source of Magic somewhere, and it scans the stellar neighborhood for instances of the pattern. (eg, Ra or Scott Meyer's /Off to be the Wizard/)
