  But you never say anything about what result you expect from these changes.

There isn't nearly enough information to make that decision. They only have two data points, and they're qualitatively rather than quantitatively different. Right now the only thing they can /scientifically/ do is get more data points. And the best way to do that is to try changing the things that have already made a difference.

There is also not nearly enough information to form a hypothesis of what's causing this. It's way premature to start hypothesizing.

  There is no experiment our characters can currently perform that will show these hypothesis false (that I can come up with!)

You can attempt to distinguish between them by performing the tests in physically different locations. If the source of magic is a scanner in a specific location, it should be possible to triangulate on it by examining the strength of the effect in different places.
