Awesome! I've been reading through the Google Docs and it's really good and well-written. I wouldn't say that your plot is taking too long to get anywhere, but rather you have such a detailed and involved world with fascinating characters who all demand their 15 minutes (or more!) of the spotlight.

Are you planning on trying to get this published? I would definitely buy it (preferably as an e-book). Although I get that sense you aren't going to, otherwise why would you make a [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/][website]] for it?
