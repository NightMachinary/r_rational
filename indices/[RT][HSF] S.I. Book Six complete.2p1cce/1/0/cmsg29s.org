  Are you planning on trying to get this published?

There are multiple reasons why this book is never going to go through any of the traditional publishing houses. My current thoughts are that, once I finish, I'll probably make it available in chapterized form on my website, and a "Pay What You Want" tipjar mechanism for a nicely formatted ebook. (Said thoughts are open to being changed between now and then.)
