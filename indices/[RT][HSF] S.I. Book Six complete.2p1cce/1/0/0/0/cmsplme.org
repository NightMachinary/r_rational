  why does your website have only the first chapter up
#+end_quote

Laziness, mainly. I put the first chapter up while experimenting with how to format the text, and the site's general layout; but just haven't gotten around to converting the rest of the text into individual chapter-pages. One kind soul created a shell-script to run some regex on the plaintext that I write in and convert it into HTML that matches that sample chapter, with curly quotes and em-dashes and so forth; and it wouldn't take /too/ much effort to adapt the first chapter's header and footer into a template to copy-and-paste the converted text into... but I've been focusing on other things, such as writing the story itself.

  what is the significance of the syllables by each book number?
#+end_quote

When I started writing, I thought I'd end up with something like a novella, and starting each chapter with 'Re' seemed like a decent way to reference Bunny's recycling and rebirth and renewal and all that jazz. By the time I figured out that the story would be at least three 'books' long, it seemed easier to adapt the system with a new prefix per book, then to try to come up with thirty chapter titles all starting with 're-'. If you squint hard enough, then each Book's prefix could be viewed as the theme for that book, but I haven't felt a need to let that tightly constrain what I can write.
