I mean, I certainly wouldn't call them garbage. They are a lot more standard though, going with the hard boiled detective theme in a much more classic way than the following books. But yes, Alera gets way better after the first book just like Dresden. But, just like the first three Dresden novels, the first book has a lot of integral set up and starts many plot threads that span the series.
