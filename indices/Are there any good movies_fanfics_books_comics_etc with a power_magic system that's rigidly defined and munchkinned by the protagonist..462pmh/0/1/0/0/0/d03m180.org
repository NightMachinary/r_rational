"A few plot holes" is different from "the entire plot hinges on a massive plot hole requiring an entire culture to fail to notice the blatantly obvious." Ender's Game has a few plot holes; Jurassic Park has a few plot holes; LOTR has a few plot holes. Elantris is something else.

I also disagree with "superbly written and excellently characterized"---I found the writing itself blunt and clunky and /particularly, notably/ amateurish. That being said, I'm not trying to get fans of the book to STOP liking it (I've loved many, many things that were badly written). If you enjoyed it, I think that's awesome. I just won't allow the recommendation "Read this, it's quality work!" to pass by without qualification and balancing counter-perspective.

People reading this thread and looking for recommendations can simply note: I'm stating it's a /very/ poor book, and not worth the time it takes to read. Others have made the exact opposite assertion. Feel free (obviously) to weigh both opinions as you make your own decision.
