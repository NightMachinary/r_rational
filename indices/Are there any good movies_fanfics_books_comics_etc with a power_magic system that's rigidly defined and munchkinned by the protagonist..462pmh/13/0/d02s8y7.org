I wouldn't say FiO is rigidly defined, from our perspective anyway.

I assume you're thinking of the limitations on CelestAI. But as readers, we don't get access to whatever binary code rigidly defines them. So we can't predict how they'll work in practice, or admire CelestAI's cleverness when it routes around them. The author could've made CelestAI do /anything/ by claiming the existence of a hidden loophole in its hidden code, and we'd just have to accept it.
