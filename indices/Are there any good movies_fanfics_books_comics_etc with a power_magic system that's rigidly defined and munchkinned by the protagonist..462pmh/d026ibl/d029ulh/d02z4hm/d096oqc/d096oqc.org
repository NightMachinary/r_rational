I am the ink of my introductions.

Character description is my body, and settings are my blood.

I have written over a thousand first chapters.

Unaware of middles, nor of conclusions.

Withstood pain to write words, waiting for the perfect idea.

Yet these hands will never finish anything.

So as I pray... one day I'll finish this FSN fic.
