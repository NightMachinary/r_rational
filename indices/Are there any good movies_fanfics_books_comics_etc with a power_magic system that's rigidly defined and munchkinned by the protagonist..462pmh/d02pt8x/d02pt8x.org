I'm surprised it hasn't been mentioned yet, but [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]] has a clear system of magic that's munchkinned by everyone, including the protagonist. Notably, both the villains and the heroes abuse the way magic works as much as they can in order to achieve their goals.
