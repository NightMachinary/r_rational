Yes, I'm glad. Now, despite the desire for action I'm still a rationalist reader so i hope that by the end of the story at least i can step through and define the reasons antagonists and the protagonist move forward and how, beyond a simple "because plot"

The other thing is i hope taelien makes more nonhuman friends, lol.

Last hing I'm noting is the transition from taelien as main character almost to a side character. He's my favorite character so i hope in the next book we get to see more of what he's capable of.
