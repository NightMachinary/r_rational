Some self-promotion since you've already read some of my other recommendations. I write "hard magic", rules oriented fantasy with pretty clear reasoning for my characters. The first book is [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]], and the second book, [[http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Sorcery-Broken-Mirrors-Book-ebook/dp/B016IPJ1R8/][Stealing Sorcery]], has even more of it.

Some characters do more munckinry than others, and in different circumstances; Taelien is very good at combat optimization, but he doesn't utilize his skill set as much outside of combat. Jonan is pretty much the opposite, and Lydia falls somewhere in between.

Fair warning that my writing can come across as "video gamey" - I'm a game designer for a RPG company (Obsidian), and it comes across to some extent in my work.

I recommend looking at the preview chapter to see if you like the style of it.
