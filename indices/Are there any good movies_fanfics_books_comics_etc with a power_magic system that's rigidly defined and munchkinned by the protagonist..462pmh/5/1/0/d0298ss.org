Some of it is (to an extent) parody and gently self-aware humor, and the SI character does get taken down several pegs and beaten to hell by a lot of people later on. Stuff like the muscles are presented as side-effects of not knowing what the ring can do initially, later used as humor, and are even referred to as an example of the character's limitations later on, as while he can theoretically change his body shape, he is psychologically limited to 'the muscles' (in one timeline, at least) due to not being able to /want/ to tone it down enough.

The story is generally considered to be a good example of Showed Their Work, as a lot of more obscure DC characters from various comic runs show up in one form or another, and are for the most part either true to their origins or plausibly altered by the timeline changes.
