I like to see munchkinning in stories which have been serialized over a long time (comics and some low-budget TV shows), and have a lot of Evil Invention / Alien Device -of-the-week episodes. No-one ever comes along and says "Well, hang on, if we combine technologies X, Y, and Z, wouldn't we get something really cool? Or even if we just used a bunch of them in parallel instead of each one only being around for one episode?"

It's one reason I like parts of /With This Ring/ - the protagonist doesn't just rely on the xenotech power ring to do everything (even if power rings are awesome), he actively seeks out, hoards, and remixes all kinds of technologies and weird-ass devices and weapons from the DC universe. /And/ he treats magic and alien abilities and psionics and demons and who-knows-what as just additional fields that can have the scientific principle applied (or at least have a bunch of cool gadgets he can swipe).
