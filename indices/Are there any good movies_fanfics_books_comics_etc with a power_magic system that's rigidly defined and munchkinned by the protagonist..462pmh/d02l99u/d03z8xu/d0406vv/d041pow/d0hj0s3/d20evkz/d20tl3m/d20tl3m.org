Awesome, glad you enjoyed it once things picked up a bit. I really appreciate you taking the time to reply. I'm going to try to make sure my future books are better paced (I think the sequel already did this to some extent, but your mileage may vary).

I think action scenes are probably going to end up being my specialization. There are definitely a lot more of them in the sequel.
