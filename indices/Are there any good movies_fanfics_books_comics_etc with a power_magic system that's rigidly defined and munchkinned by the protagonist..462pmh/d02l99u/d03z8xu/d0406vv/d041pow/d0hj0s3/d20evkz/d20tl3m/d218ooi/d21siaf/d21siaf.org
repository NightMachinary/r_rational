You should definitely be able to see the motivations for the antagonists in the second book - I think they're generally clearer than in the first book, in fact. I think I probably should have made it clearer [[#s][in the first book]]

Taelien definitely does make more nonhuman friends. There's a lot more "making friends" in the second book in general, really. It's more character focused.

You get to see Taelien showing off more in the next book, although you also get to see more illumination of his weaknesses. He grows more as a character in the second book. The characters in the second book get roughly equal time, but the book is about 50% longer, so it's more of each of them overall (even if you include the fact that there's an additional perspective).
