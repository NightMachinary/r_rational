It speeds up somewhat mid-way into Chapter 8 (which is just after the 50% mark), and there are definitely more action scenes in that chapter and beyond it. Most people tend to think one of the parts of Chapter 8 is the best part of the book, so since you're close, you might want to consider reading that scene and seeing if you like it. You could even skip ahead if you're into that kind of thing, and if you like the scene enough, go back and catch up.

Discussing options is definitely a part of the style of the book, so that's still going to happen later on (albeit less and less as things get crazier). The second book has less of that because a lot more of the second book is "solo" content, but I still prefer to have characters actually think and plan their actions. That's an element of what makes this books (mostly) rational, but it's definitely not a style of writing that suits everyone. Even I have to be in the right mood for it.
