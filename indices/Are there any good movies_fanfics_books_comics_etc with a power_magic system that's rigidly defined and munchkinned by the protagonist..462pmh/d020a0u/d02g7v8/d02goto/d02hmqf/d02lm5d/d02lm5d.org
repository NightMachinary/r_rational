Eragon does it before several battles in later books. The two main problems with the technique are are that you can only use energy able to be metabolized right now, so you can't dry your target into a withered husk, and using it requires concentration, concentration you need to keep off enemy mages. It's far more efficient to drain motive energy from yourself on resting days and store it for later use.

Also, unless you want to ward cattle, and cows you brought to the field could also be used by the enemy, and at that point why not just drain your own dying soldiers?
