You ward your livestock. If the enemy mages try to kill them, then they'll have to have more power than you, which means they'll need more livestock. Whoever has the most wins.

If you can't ward against draining livestock, then you can't ward against draining soldiers, which means that you can kill the enemy's army by draining them all. Either way, soldiers are worthless.
