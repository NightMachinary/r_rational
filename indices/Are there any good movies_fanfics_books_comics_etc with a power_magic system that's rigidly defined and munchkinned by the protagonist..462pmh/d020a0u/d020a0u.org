Magic in the Inheritance Cycle is very rigidly defined. There isn't much munchkining done by Eragon, though, mostly because most of the low-hanging fruit was already taken after thousands of years of study by immortal elves. Zero energy expenditure methods of killing? At least twelve discovered. External power sources? Loads. Time travel? Many have tried. They all died. Not recommended. Resurrection? Not possible, you'll die. Healing? Just need to know the right words.

Edit: Teleportation? Really expensive, too expensive to do with humans, but doable. Long-distance communication? Impractical for non-mages, highly useful for mages. Radiation sheilding? Obscure, but extant. Detonating your own atoms as a last-ditch effort? Done. Twice. Spells specifically for dulling swords so you can practice with them? Yup. Magic goldmine? Impractical for most purposes, but still used. Immortality ritual? It works on whole species and takes many centuries or perhaps milennia to actually result in immortality. Mind magic? Primary method for mages to fight each other.

Say what you will about Paolini's characters or plot, he has taking advantage of every aspect of magic down to an art.
