Haven't read Earthsea, but is the energy for magic drawn directly from your own biological chemical energy? If you try to do too much, or cast a spell you can't sustain or complete, do you drop dead in that system? Because that was the coolest mechanic of Inheritance magic, that it didn't violate conservation of energy.
