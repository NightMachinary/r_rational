I'm going to preface this by saying that I haven't read Earthsea, so what I know about it's magic system is gleaned off of wikis and previous arguments, so if I misrepresent something, please tell me.

Now, I can see why you think the magic systems are similar-- there's a language where things have true names, and also people have true names, and knowing that true name gives you control over something.

The first difference is that Earthsea's true names are more like giving directions, while Eragon's Ancient Language is more like writing laws. In earthsea, if you say a string of true words, the universe will conform to the meaning of those true words. In Eragon, if you say a string of words in the ancient language, some effect that could be interpreted as having the same meaning as the words said will happen, but what exactly happens is largely up to the interpretation of the magician. If you say "a fireball materializes in front of me" in earthsea, you get a fireball. If you say that in the ancient language, you might interpret that increasing the heat of the air so that it combusts, raising nearby flammable materials into the air and setting them on fire, materializing a fireball (the candy) in front of you, setting a ball on fire, or even something more esoteric like granting yourself laser eyes because your particular interpretation of those words was that you'd convert your own body fat into energy using a combustion reaction, and then your eyeballs would have a material effect on the world in front of you.

The second difference is that the ancient language is actually completely unnecessary to cast magic in IC. Not using it is the usually height of stupidity because of the third difference (energy is derived from biological processes, so if you use too much energy you're dead as a doornail), but it's possible to cast magic nonverbally. Indeed, there isn't even specifically magical about the Ancient Language. In earthsea, there's some mysticism involved in having the dragons, paragons of balance, speaking in a fundamentally magical tounge. In eragon, it's an engineering decision. Magic was too unpredictable because it was hard to concentrate, so the precursors decided to cast a spell that let magicians limit the possible effects of their magic.

And speaking about that third difference, it's actually what plays the largest role in making the magic systems different. From limiting the potential scale of IC magic (creating a thunderstorm, like in Earthsea, would literally kill more or less every single human in Alagaesia) to forcing IC magicians to abide by MAD (to make sure your spell will penetrate their wards, you're likely going to have to kill yourself too) to incentivizing more minimalist use of magic (a magical flashbang is showed off as one of the more effective uses of magic in the series.)

I'm not going to say that the magic systems aren't /similar/ but saying they're identical because they both use words to cast spells doesn't really make sense.
