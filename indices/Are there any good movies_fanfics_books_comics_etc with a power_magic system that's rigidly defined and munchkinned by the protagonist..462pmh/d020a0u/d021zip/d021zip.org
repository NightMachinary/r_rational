Seconding. The plot is meh (though for purposes of disclosure, I loved it at 15, which IIRC was the age that Paolini published Eragon), but the magic system is well-defined, well explored, and well munchkined.

For example, as horrific as it was, the Army-level warfare in book 3 was realistic and very well done. Magicians would ward large groups of soldiers, and if the magician died, you could 1HKO large swathes of enemy mooks by bursting a blood vessel in their brain or something with minimal MP expenditure.
