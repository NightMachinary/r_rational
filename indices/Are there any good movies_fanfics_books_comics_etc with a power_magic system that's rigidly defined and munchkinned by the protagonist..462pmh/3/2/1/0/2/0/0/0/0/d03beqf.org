Well, yes and no.

Draining is actually a closely-guarded secret, taught only to high-ranking Elves and Dragon Riders, once they are thought to be respectful enough of life not to abuse it, but also because you're thinking of magic as a Tolkeinesque "does wut da plot wants" lawless nonsense.

It's not quite so in the IC. Think of magic as an electric current, and wards as an insulator. If you ward (insulate) the livestock, then no offensive magic (electric current) will be able to affect it. And draining counts as offensive magic for the purposes of wards, since it's detrimental to the host creature and may lead to it's death.
