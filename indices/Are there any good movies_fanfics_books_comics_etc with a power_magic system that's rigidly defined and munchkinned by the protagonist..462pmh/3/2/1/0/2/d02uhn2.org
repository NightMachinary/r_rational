Inconvenient. You'd need to assign some of your limited magi to ward the livestock, else they'd get words of death'd. Also, how are you going to keep them near enough to drain in the middle of army warfare? Also also, how are you going to design wards where they cannot be word of death'd nor drained by enemy magi, but are drainable by your or your allied magi?

No, using high class gems with lots of stored was most efficient.
