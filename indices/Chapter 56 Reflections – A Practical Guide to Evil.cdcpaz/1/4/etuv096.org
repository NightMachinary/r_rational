Yes, Black as a character died when he was ambushed on the boat in book 4.

He's not the Black Knight anymore. He is Amadeus of the Green Stretch, arguably a different charater filling a different Role than the Black Knight. That his mindset or character has changed as a side effect of losing his Name would make sense. That the situation, their relationship has changed and evolved over time and their shared experience makes sense too, even if it isn't necessarily the "rationally optimal" route.
