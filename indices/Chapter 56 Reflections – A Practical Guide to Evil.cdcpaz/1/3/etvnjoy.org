You seem to have missed the end of Book I, where Cat leverages Black as her father for the Sword in the Stone shenanigans. That die was cast early on, and nothing came from it. I don't think the characters acknowledging their relationship now is quite as important as that prior moment in terms of fate.

The father / family death, in my mind, tends to be an early trope rather than a later trope. And we're pretty late in the story.

So I don't think Black is being set up by EE to die (again). And I don't think Black's acknowledgment of Cat is his daughter is equivalent to suicide. Black's death wouldn't change or refine Cat's path, just piss her off, and that kind of takes away from the story's weight in our current setting of signing the Liesse Accords and war against the Dead King.

And as a side note, it is my personal opinion PGtE is not rational (fiction) and should not be posted to this sub.
