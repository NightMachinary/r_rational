A couple things: First of all, Black actually is something close to suicidal. He was willing to let Cat kill him at Liesse, then after she didn't running around Procer commiting atrocities sure to lead to heroic intervention. He intends his death to have purpose, but its not something he's avoiding. Second, neither he nor Cat are full Named now. This gives them a whole bunch of leeway with regard to stories.
