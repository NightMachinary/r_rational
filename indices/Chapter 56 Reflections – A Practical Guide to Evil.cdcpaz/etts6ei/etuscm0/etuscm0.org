I mean, I can see why you could see this as frustrating. At this point, though, I'm willing to give EE the benefit of the doubt that he isn't just suddenly holding the idiot ball. He being either Black OR the author, take your pick. Every other time we've gotten upset about an apparently idiotic character decision it's turned out to have a purpose and a huge payoff; I'm sure something like that is happening here, although EE has kept me on my toes enough that I'm not even going to try and speculate at this point. I'm almost guaranteed to be wrong. Again.
