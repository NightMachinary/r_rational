Ooh Amadeus I have missed your cold calculations. Also like Scribe is still on the table as one of the biggest institutional threats minus like exactly the Dead King and The Bard. I do love how Amadeus is so upfront on how Cat is basically his heir-apparent and that while he isn't outright denying that Malicia needs to be removed he certainly isn't in a position to press any claims of his undying loyalty at this point. Also that we only have his word that Scribe is where he says she is, for all we know she's been running the Dread Empire into the ground using her bureaucratic prowess. Granted it's not like Praes really needed anything to be more of a pit of vipers or to take advantage of Malicia's many weaknesses.
