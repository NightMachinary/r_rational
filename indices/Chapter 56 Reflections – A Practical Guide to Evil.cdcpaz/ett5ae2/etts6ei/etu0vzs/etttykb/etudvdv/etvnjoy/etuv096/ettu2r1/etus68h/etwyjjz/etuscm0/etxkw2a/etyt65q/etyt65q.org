What if it's the other way around. Two possible next level reasons if we assume the premise to be true that them calling each other father/daughter significantly changes events in the future and either one or both of them know that.

Firstly for the both explanations I need to specify black was never above dying for his cause or to further his goals and neither is cat as long as she gets her accords signed.

Now let's assume in the next step of our hypothetical scenario that one of them dies because of the story flags set through their relationship, or maybe even unrelated reasons. Ask yourself what would happen next?

And this is where it gets interesting because the story options for avenging someone's loved father/daughter are unrivaled.

1st: Black dying and leaving Cat behind enables her not only the daughter of the wanted / most feared / maybe even rightful ruler (because he got the new fledgling name) of praes retaking the throne from the usurper or backstabber story( if malicia did it, probably even if she didn't ) which malicia desperately wants to avoid, it would make her hugely powerful versus the only force that could be a thorn in her side. Truthfully if black dies, cat is gonna be super powerful in general story wise for a while and whoever killed him is fucked

2nd: cat dying and leaving black gets a lot of shit done as well. Arguably avenging your child's murder is a stronger story then the other way around . Add to that the story that you finish your child's only and last wish in life(accords) Holy shit black would become unstoppable. Again bad guys desperately want to avoid that and the dead king is too smart to fall into this kind of trap, but this is a great deterrent. Kill either of us and our safeguards make your life miserable.

So to me the real question is what is the downside of settings these flags knowing that either outcome reaches your goal and that your enemy's will actually be trying to avoid killing you easily. If you have no issue putting your life on the line to empower the one other person you believe capable enough to fix shit, then this seems like an inspired binding of fates
