Fucks sakes.

Back in books 1-3 this father/daughter dynamic was okay, because it was /implicit/ and /subtle/. Black never explicitly leaned into the trope of having a daughter, nor /would/ he, because that'd end up in him /up and dying/ at some point. But the dynamic was there, and it was good.

Now in book 5 first we have Catherine suddenly start calling him Daddy, after 4 books of doing nothing of the sort. Every bloody time she thinks of Black, she thinks of him as her father. Not even teacher, not very smart colleague, /father/. This after she stabbed him in the liver at the end of book 3 and ignored him completely in book 4. Some faithful daughter she is.

But okay, /maybe/ Catherine was just such a complete and utter idiot she missed the fact that calling Black /father/ would hang death flags on him every bloody time. It certainly wouldn't be the first time she missed what was right in front of her. Or maybe she was trying to off Black while claiming plausible deniability - hang so many death flags on him he'd be guaranteed to die, or some bullshit like that. Okay, whatever.

But now Black himself is using the damn word. Is he suicidal? Did he hit his head? Is implied soul damage affecting him? Who the hell knows, but he sure as shit has been acting as a helpless idiotic damsel in distress the whole book for Catherine to heroically save. In a complete contradiction to his character in the previous books.

It sure looks like author just wants to off him at some point, and have Catherine do the sad-daughter-because-her-father-was-killed jig. And in order to do that, he needs this father/daughter stuff jammed in beforehand as "foreshadowing". So instead of being an actual character, Black gets an authorial hand jammed way up his ass right up to his nostrils, just so he can be moved into the appropriate position for the execution.

As far as I am concerned, Black as a character died in book 4 when he was ambushed on that boat. Everything else is some other character wearing the same meatsuit.
