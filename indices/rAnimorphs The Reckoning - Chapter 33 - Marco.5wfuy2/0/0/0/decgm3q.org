  Also, Earth was an unusual case, as most planets have a much lower total population (only Earth has a high enough population to straight-up outnumber multiple other host-producing planets).

I get the feeling this is because the Yeerks just got lucky (for certain ellimist/etc including definitions of 'lucky') to happen across a planet on which a sapient species was going through a historically-and-geologically brief unstable blow-off top as it unsustainably runs through concentrated fossil energy sources and natural resources before stabilizing after a millennium of crisis at high-tech low-density stable technic civilization (or low-tech low-density).

The timing of that, assuming it was deliberate, would imply either long-term control over the glacial cycles of Earth or timing of the Yeerk breakout. I suspect the latter.
