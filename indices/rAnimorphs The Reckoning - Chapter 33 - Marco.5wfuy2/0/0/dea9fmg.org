Paul Evans doesn't have the power to order black-ops squads around, but /Paul Evans impersonating President Tyagi/ does.

Elfangor was an extremist, and the Andalites have life-preservation and non-interference policies that they're only slowly abandoning. Also, Earth was an unusual case, as most planets have a much lower total population (only Earth has a high enough population to straight-up outnumber multiple other host-producing planets).

OMINOUS INDEED.

Thanks as always for the feedback. <3
