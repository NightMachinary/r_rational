Things blowing up! Livestreams broadcasts! Abducting intelligence officers! Man, as off-rails as this thing went, it's still Animorphs. If not to the letter, to the spirit.

- I like the operation the Animorphs are setting up. Reminds me a bit of Worm, with the whole "recruiting civilians, operating undercover and on the run" themes.

- The whole "torturing a yeerk to death" thing was eerily similar to a CHERUB book, where the kids infiltrate animal's rights terrorists and interrupt a livestream where they force-feed detergent to a corporate executive. The Animorphs acted a lot like the terrorists in the book did (except more brutally).

- Marco's motheeeeeeer!

- The Animorphs give a /lot/ of tactical information in that broadcast, some of which V3 probably didn't know they knew (for instance, that he had a "political rival", or the "stasis technology"), though it's disguised enough to give them plausible deniability.

- I like that they're really going for the "information wants to be free" route. It makes a lot of sense, and they're making a pretty good effort to counter Esplin's half truths and lies by omission.

- Poor Daskan. All he wanted was... well, we don't really know what he wanted. Proooobably didn't get it. Because he died. Horribly.

- I kinda wish the Animorphs had sent a message to Telor, like "guys, Visser 3 killed your brothers, he's gonna do the same to you!". Especially if Rachel could remember something incriminating.

- By the way, Visser 3 must so pissed right now. Come on, I threw an asteroid at these guys? How many of them are still alive?

- Wait, Paul Evans has the power to give any sergeant command of an off-the-book black ops squad? That's both awesome and kinda creepy. Though I guess if it's off the book, all he really has to do is send them some money and tell them "you work for her now", and the rest is faking papers and making excuses.

- I remember the first interlude where Visser 3 started planning for what would happen if the team started using the cube full time. It looks like we're getting close to this scenario. That is, until David inevitably steals it and everything goes to shit.

- Dammit, Algeria! Why won't you let us do our own thing? Anyway, I'm glad we're starting to see the impact the events have on the entire world, even if it's just a glimpse.

- The Australian government just flat-out taunting North Korea in the middle of an international crisis strikes me as pretty odd, on the other hand. And petty.

- Wait, doesn't showing Sergeant Nickerson in public negate the point of giving her a secret task force? I mean, she's obviously going into hiding from then on, but still.

- Sergeant Nickerson confirming the kid's story reminds me that there is no way they could prove any of what they say. Like Paul Evans said, they've proved they're /interesting/, but that's about it. They could have faked the witnesses (unless those stay in the public eye afterwards), infested David themselves, and everything they said could be lies.

- The way Marco acknowledges David's pain, but not the yeerks, and goes "This is V3's fault" is really creepy; and is another CHERUB bad guys parallel.

- It's really convenient that a yeerk starving to death is a perfectly clean process that doesn't leave any amount of dangerous mind-altering toxic waste the host brain. I mean, if /I/ starved to death inside of someone's head, there would probably be puke and stuff everywhere!

- Waaaait a sec. Timestamped by google... does this mean they're streaming on Youtube? Awesome!

- And then I said: OATMEAL? Are you crazy?

- The "fighting on 20 fronts at once" thing is a nice nod to canon, but I'm not sure it makes sense? The Andalites give bridge-slicing guns to their infantry. Surely they have enough nukes to glass 20 planets? (I mean, the USA certainly does) Unless Elfangor was an extremist, as Alloran's pupil?

- "Animorphs out." Squeeeeeeeeeeee.

- Honestly, the entire speech is super cool. The few theatrics moments (like "Welcome the Resistance"), the rising view count... But the most awesome part is the way Marco casually namedrops his group while live, to a million viewers, and /Fox News/. Like, you can just imagine the TV debates and the government speeches where people will just casually mention the Animorphs afterwards. (while Visser 3 watches, petting a cat, and goes "Damn these meddling kids! Damn you, Animorphs!")

- While I'm on the subject, a really cool scene at the end of the Animorphs series was when the team last sneaked into the Blade Ship, got spotted, and guards (who usually shouted "Andalite bandits" as an alert) shouted "Animorphs!" I hope we get a scene like that at some point.

- I like the way Jake is kinda casually dismissive of David's abuse. Well, no, I mean, it sucks, but it's very realistic.

- Nooot sure what happened at the end. It's ominous.
