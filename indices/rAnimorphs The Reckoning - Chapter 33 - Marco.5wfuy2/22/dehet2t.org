Since feedback was requested I guess I ought to express how much I love this story... it's one of my favourite fics and embodies the ideals of "rational" fiction in a somewhat rare way (at least from my limited perspective of having not read everything).

The characters are acting according to their own motives and goals (and limited information) with a blend of brutal efficiency and understandable human fallibility. Their personalities are clear and distinct (V3 especially is just delightfully unpredictable in his "actually being intelligent and not a hamstrung stooge of an antagonist" way) There's no feeling of "cheating" or plot armour - it genuinely feels like every encounter could spiral into a total party wipe if mismanaged.

Just a loud resounding Hells Yes, generally. As long as you keep writing I'll keep eagerly reading.

Also the reveal-stream was pretty badass, and this David thing is going to go so wrong for them. In this world of Unrestrained Consequences I slightly shudder to think just how bad it could be.
