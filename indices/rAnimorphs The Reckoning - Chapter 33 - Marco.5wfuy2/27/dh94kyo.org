So [[/u/TK17Studios]] I just read this after it was linked in a reddit thread a few days ago, and I'm amazed at the way the story developed - much more thought-out than the originals, in my opinion. Sometimes I feel it's hard to follow as a lot happens "off-screen" or simply builds upon stuff from the originals, but the devil is in the details I guess; I sometimes skipped sections as I got a bit carried away by the story! Will there be more chapters soon?
