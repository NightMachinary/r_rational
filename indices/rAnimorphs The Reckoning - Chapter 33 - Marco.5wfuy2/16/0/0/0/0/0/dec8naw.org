  The rules of the game were clear---when the moment came, there could be no discrepancies between the true pool and the projection, no unfair manipulation via cheap and easy deception. It had to be real, down to the smallest peak in the quantum wave function.

This makes me think that the pool scene was simulated (hence why Cassie was brought back to the trees when the simulation ended).
