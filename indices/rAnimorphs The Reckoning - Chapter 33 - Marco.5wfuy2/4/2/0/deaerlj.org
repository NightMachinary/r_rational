Well... the obvious idea, if we look at the paragraph from a sane perspective, is that Marco had his mind altered somehow and got a wrong idea of who David is.

NOT PARANOID ENOUGH! Also, that doesn't make sense. Marco's description carries a lot of information that wouldn't make sense if Marco had been brainwashed into remembering a "better" version of David. If we're slightly paranoid, the personality Marco describes sounds like it has been optimized to make Jake like David as much as possible, not shaped by an organic process.

The obvious idea if we take a completely paranoid perspective, is to notice that no actual name or identifying element is used after the "fleeting disorientation". Or that both the inner voice and the actual thought-sentences sound a bit... off, for Marco. Also the post-disorientation narrator feels "confident, almost hopeful", which would make a lot more sense for a sociopathic kid put in a position of power for the first time in his life, than what Marco would feel after reading a promising recruit's mind.

David pulled a Lucrezia, and somehow swapped his brain with Marco. The sentence "closing down the mental copy of the kid so he wouldn't suffer" refers to Marco. I have no idea how this is even physically possible.
