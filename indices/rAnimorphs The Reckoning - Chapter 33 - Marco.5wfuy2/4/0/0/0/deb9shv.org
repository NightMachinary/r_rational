This has already happened once, on-screen, in a way that is very hard to see ahead of time but stunningly obvious post-reveal/in retrospect (i.e. no one is stupid for not having seen it yet, but it should make perfect sense once you know). It was not denoted by "fleeting disorientation," which was my nod to HPMOR.
