Mother of god. I didn't see the 'fleeting disorientation' part. Is there a precedent in the fic for that denoting mind tampering from extra dimensional entities? I agree with you, but has anyone else been messed with in this way.

Because if the Crayak or the Ellimist is running around capable of directly altering the minds of mortals, then avoiding the game has become almost impossible. Unless the Animorphs start morphing each other regularly to look for memories where their perspectives suddenly, inexplicably change, I don't see how they can guard against this new threat.

I always liked the Animorphs series because it took a very mental approach to the concept of aliens, really looking at alternative minds, something this fic takes a step forward with it's hiveminds and telepathic quasi collectives and artificial intelligences and extra dimensional gods.

But direct, Xavier style mind altering is a big addition to the host of mental threats assaulting our protagonists, and brings even more questions to the table.

This must be a very big, costly move for an entity to undertake. Otherwise why did the first entity waste time simulating the Pool scene, when it could have just made Cassie choose what i wanted her to? Are we to assume that Visser 3 decision regarding the space tunnel was exactly what the entities wanted, because otherwise they would, had simulations somehow failed, hit him with the 'trust me this a good idea beam'?

No, this has to be a massive move, considering what it could be used to do, and I can't wait to see the pay off.
