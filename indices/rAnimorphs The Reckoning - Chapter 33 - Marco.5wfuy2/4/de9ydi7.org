Question time!

I am very concerned. If there was ever a scene where somebody explicitly described what being in Jake's head is like, I missed it, but if there was I have to ask; why the hell does Marco think David is like another Jake?

From my point of view Marco describes a textbook sociopath, caring only for his own well being. Nothing from his experience of Marco's mind denotes any of Jake's perceptive abilities or leadership qualities. I'm not sure what Marco is playing at here.

Does anybody get it? What does Marco think the group gains from including David, that outweighs the dangers of letting a sociopath into their midst?
