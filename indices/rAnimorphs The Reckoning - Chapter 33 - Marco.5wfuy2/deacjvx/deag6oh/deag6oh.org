Luckily, it's broken up into /five/ sections. =P

In all seriousness, though, your criticism lands. It's one of the reasons I struggled with this chapter---I considered (e.g.) cutting the factory attack entirely, and having it take place off-screen, but I was worried people would be upset about "not enough action," so I went with the compromise of showing Marco hovering around the edges of it.

In general, I try to leave each chapter at a place that's either cliffhanger-esque or dramatically moves the plot forward, and lately it's been hard to find those natural ending points, as the story grows more complex.
