David's mind violently resisted the yerk when he was turned into a controller, but the yerk was too strong for him. However, the morph-David would have the same violent reaction but Marco might not be strong enough to stop David. This would lead to David being in control of Marco's body until he demorphs, which could be after the real David had already been given the morphing technology.

Worse, morph-David could choose to just not demorph so that Marco doesn't spill the beans on his hijacking. Also, he now has access to all of Marco's secrets and can share them with the real David

... Or just kill real David, stick in the morph controlling Marco, and reacquire the morphing technology (like Morph Jake did after his resurrection)
