I was engaging in some paranoid speculation while at work and had some paranoid speculation which I don't consider especially likely but I thought I'd toss it out there. Suppose that, instead of the Ellimist or Crayak doing the time freeze chat at the pool, and then the other one messing with Marco's sense of orientation, the same superbeing is responsible for both events? Kill the moral compass and stick in an amoral sociopath, and make it look like your nemesis is responsible for whichever of those two things you, the superbeing, prefer to pretend not to be responsible for. I'm not sure this is actually plausible, but I had fun thinking about it. Canon!Aximili described the Ellimist as showing up as a trickster god type in traditional Andalite mythology, and he seems very tricky in this fic thus far (more so than in canon) so I won't completely rule out this silly idea of mine.
