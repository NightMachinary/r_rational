I know I haven't commented before now, but since comments are important for the author, I will give my thoughts:

This has the potential to be the single best work of rationalist fiction. My only fears are lack of commitment to finishing it (too many fanfics..), and a steep entry curve for the uninitiated.

You bear the community's hopes and dreams.
