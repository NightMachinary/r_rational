Hypotheses, arranged from most to least likely:

1) The the fleeting change is the Ellimist or more likely Crayak, meddling, trying to change the outcome of things. Other than that, everything is as it seems - David just happens to be a severely abused sociopath who was captured by a yeerk, and Crayak wants him to be on the team to make the peaceful solution not work out.

2) David is an ordinary sociopath-like individual who is cooperating with the yeerks for self interested reasons. Marco is being controlled some other way. Perhaps via Leeran or other psychic creature.

3) David has some unusual mental abilities, enabling him to manipulate his yeerk and morph-David to mentally manipulate Marco.

4) Yeerks are able to do choose to permanently alter their host's minds before they die, the effects of this somehow hit Marco.

5) Turns out David's personal satisfaction includes the survival and thriving of humanity, a disorienting realization.

6) David's last name is Monroe, this is a crossover fic, and David just used Obliviate.

Implies morph-David is conscious, which if I recall correctly doesnn't automatically happen just from going through memories?
