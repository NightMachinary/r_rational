The thing that really gets me about David at the end is he was so /certain/. This suggests he knew that Marco's mindreading wouldn't cause a problem, which is pretty interesting information for him to have. It implies one of a few things:

- David mistakenly thought that Marco would think he was an A-OK guy. I don't think this is particularly plausible, because David's track record with authority figures seems to be trash, and his entire psyche is built around distrust. This means David knew Marco's read would be spoofed somehow.

- If David's mind is somehow a [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/understanding-memetics][Memetic Hazard]], probably of the self-replicating variety, he might've already flipped the Yeerk in his head. This would give him experience in knowing that his mind is a dangerous thing to touch. This only makes sense if David's Yeerk had not yet had an opportunity to return to the Pool (and I would think he'd seem more frustrated then.) Also, David is still eerily confident given how different the mechanism is here.

- If on the other hand Marco was Obliviated by the Ellimist or Crayak, David's reaction means it is likely he knew this would occur in advance and is either working as some kind of permanent agent for one of them (ala the Drode) or at least has some sort of deal in place.
