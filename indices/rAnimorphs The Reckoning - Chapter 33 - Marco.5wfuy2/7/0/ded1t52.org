Taking off my author's hat and just speaking from general prior knowledge (my mom's a psych nurse)---psychopaths are confident right up until the very end, and generally have a strongly unjustified belief that everything's going to work out fine for them (which, in turn, helps it do so on the margins when it otherwise wouldn't've).

i.e. I don't know if, as a reader, I would've read anything into David acting certain. In fact, if you consider him having /unjustified certainty,/ and then extrapolate out from that what conclusions he might have drawn about Marco, interesting things ...
