Fantastic chapter. All I could have wanted in an Animorphs-coming-out broadcast, down to the unexpected name-drop at the end.

Also, love r!David's appearance in the story. Can't wait to see how it goes, worried as I am for our intrepid heroes. At first I thought some sort of psychic powers were being used, or that Visser had somehow managed to create a clone-body and implant memories in it, or a bunch of other outlandish things, and then I remembered they live in a world of near-omnipotent god-like aliens and everything made sense again.
