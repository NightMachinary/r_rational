This episode needs to be broken up into at least three sections. There's too much going on in too little space to make following it work.

1. The filming. Also, the whole business of David and killing the Yeerk live seems like a really bad idea and playing into Visser Three's hands. That's basically a live execution, that makes them look like terrorists, and you know that's how V3's going to spin it.
2. The attack on the factory.
3. The sequence with David at the end.
