Personally, I really liked this chapter because it introduced a lot of new elements and move things forward, while the previous chapters had been establishing things that didn't really "matter" to the plot.

I guess there's a balance to be found, between the parts of a chapter that develop characters and reactions and the psychological impact of on-screen events, and the parts that just move the plot forward. I think Twig really struck this balance, for instance, with arcs that both maintain a constant pacing and always introduce new characters.

Also, while I don't really care about how the characters were recruited (I mean, we already had three "Tobias explains the invasion to a grown-up" scenes), I'd really like more insights on how they think, how they relate to the characters, how the war is impacting them, etc.

Also, I'd completely read a chapter from Anji's POV.
