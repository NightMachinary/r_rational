I'd have liked to see the reaction of said normal citizen suddenly getting introduced to the resistance and having their life changed forever. I guess I mostly miss the emotional development and repercussions of getting more and more used to this stuff. But then, maybe I'm the weirdo for preferring to also see some "slice of life" parts in the stories of people with unusual lives.\\
And maybe I also have an irrational dislike for major time skips during interesting times. The large time skip in Worm for instance made me so angry (I was a teen) that I couldn't continue reading the story for over 6 months.
