The only problem here is trying to actually wrap up the story before it gets double its current length. There are lots of things where I skip over them because it seems (to me) that the process of getting there is cookie-cutter.

For example:

- We call the number Paul Evans gave Tobias; we get a voice on the other end.
- We agree to meet that person in a place. We shake her hand and acquire her DNA, then GTFO.
- We morph her to see if she's trustworthy.
- We bring her someplace off the grid.
- We show her stuff, tell her stuff, give her the morphing power.
- We coordinate with her to find a bunch of other useful grownups, for whom we repeat all of the steps above.

... there could be some tidbits of good dialogue or character development in there, but it's just not very high-density. It's why I don't show how they break into stores to steal phones and stuff; I think ultimately it ends up wasting your time.
