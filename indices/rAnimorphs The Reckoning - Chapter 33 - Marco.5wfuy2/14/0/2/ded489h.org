Honestly, I'd personally prefer it if you actually draw a few things out a bit more. In the Ventura chapters very little that mattered happened so off screen that all it got was a minor mention. Here adults get added in and all kinds of other things happen and we don't really see how they got to that point or how it affects people.

By the way, have the Animorphs continued morphing into each other more frequently? I'm curious if they decided to use that (creepy) trust reinforcer or not.
