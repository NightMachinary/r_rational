You know it's bad when the malevolent god-thing wants you to do it.

I wonder how long it takes for the Animorphs to realise they've been played. I'm assuming that there won't be any more interventions - it doesn't seem to be how the game is played - so it's either when David crosses the line / someone peaks into his mind (is Marco still doing this following his confession?). David's definetly getting morphing tech, but the damage he can do is limited somewhat if he's outside the group.

And I wonder how the crew is going to react when they figure out that Crayak(?) has been/ could potentially still be messing with their minds.
