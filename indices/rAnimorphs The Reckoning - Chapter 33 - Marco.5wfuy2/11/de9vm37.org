Marco, how is this a good idea? Cassie'd have your head for this...oh wait :( I think we're starting to see the effects of lack of Cassie on the group now. E/C all according to keikaku?

Also, looks like morphing Yeerk is an impossibility now? TemrAx combined would be the authority on this matter, I suppose.

Re: Tobias...in the original, he was trapped in morph. Now that he's lost an arm, he's pretty much stuck using a morph of some sort now to have both limbs, isn't he?
