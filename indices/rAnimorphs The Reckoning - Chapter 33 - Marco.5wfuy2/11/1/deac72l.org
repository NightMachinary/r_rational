There doesn't really seem to be a precedent, but I'd assume a Yeerk would be held in Z-space in stasis like anything else brought into a morph. As we saw with Tobias, acquiring a Yeerk while in morph and then ending the morph destroys it, but I doubt Temrash would be in any danger if it's the other way around. Ax could probably continue to morph, though I'd imagine Temrash would be out of commission for the duration of the morph. Not sure Ax would be willing to compromise that.
