Sorry, that's not what I meant at all. When they tried to morph Yeerk early on, the morph just went strange and they had to reverse it. I'm saying that the combined knowledge pool (heh!) of TemrAx would lend both the knowledge of the Iscafil device from Ax along with the knowledge of Yeerk physiology/anatomy from Temrash, letting them say with a lot more certainty than Ax alone whether morphing Yeerk is doable or not.
