Since the new chapter is going to be posted soon, here's some speculation about what happened with David:

In canon being infested by a dying yeerk gave Jake a nightmare vision of Crayak. This happens in the Reckoning too, though at first it looks like the vision is caused by Jake's death-and-resurrection; but I think it was actually triggered by Jake's artificial yeerk being burnt out by Erek.

Maybe something similar happened to David what his yeerk starved out? We know that artificial morph-yeerks are controlled through Z-space signals, which makes them vulnerable to interferences; maybe regular yeerks can interact with Z-space signals too?

That still doesn't tell us what happened... but I'm suspecting there's a causal link there.
