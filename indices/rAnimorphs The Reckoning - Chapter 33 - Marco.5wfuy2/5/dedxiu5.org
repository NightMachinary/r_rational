I am aware feedback is important for the author. I don't always comment because I have occasionally found the actual events of a chapter to be difficult to interpret. No such problem exists for this chapter.

This is among the best fanfiction i've ever read. The description of David gave me goosebumps. It was evocative, touched on archetypes that I've been expecting you to use in a different context, and offered the same dawning horror as the Leeran chapter where Esplin has like 12 different viewpoints.

Honestly I might describe this as rationalist /horror/. When I know what's going on, there's usually a sense of dread about the world unfolding that reminds me that humans are always less-pessimistic than is optimal.
