That's exactly what happened. E/C's interlude said that the timestop chapter was a simulation, but that for some reason the rules bound it to be completely accurate to "respect" Cassie's choice (which means the only modifications E/C could do to the "final" simulation were the same he could do to reality).

Not sure why this would be different in other situations.
