AHHHHHH. AHHHHH. AHHHHHH. AHH. AHHHHH. AHHHHH. I hope this has been a constructive review.

In all seriousness, I'm very excited that this fic is back!

I'm very worried about what happened to Marco at the end - at first I thought David had taken over his mind somehow, but that doesn't fit what we know about the morphing tech so far. The construct should have no lasting influence on the host emulation. Even if Marco had gotten "lost" in David's morph, as sometimes happens with morphs, this effect would go away when he demorphed. I also don't get the sense that Visser 3 had any opportunity to add some technology to David to cause a brain swap or trace the Z-space interlink. As other commentators have pointed out, influence by Crayak (or whoever) seems the most plausible option.

My guess is that Crayak did the time-stopping thing with David and made a deal with him. He did something like this in the original series, after all. Part of this deal involved David getting the morphing power, which Crayak made possible by altering Marco's mind. David didn't seem surprised by what happened, after all, though that could just be a controlled reaction on his part. Though it seems to me like direct mind altering of the pawns is a low blow and would be prohibited by the rules of the cosmic game.

Alternative, hypothesis: Visser 3 influenced the Chee to implant some kind of technology in David that accomplished what we saw. Or perhaps the Chee were there all along influencing events. Can the Chee modify memories?
