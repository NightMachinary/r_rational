It says her mother published a book called "It's Only Water" but I can find it nowhere. Nothing on google scholar either which I'm surprised about, figure if she's the only living person with the disease she's get a mention there.

Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if all these articles and stuff are also fake and it's a triple level thing. I find it very believable that her parents would stage a theft and have her coat returned in shreds so they go to the papers and get money from being famous. I don't find thieves smart enough to break in when people are on holiday returning to the doorstep with her coat however many days later believable in the slightest.

This is from when she was 12.

Guess it's not published

Edit 2: Also beginning to doubt the whole "of national fame" from how few newspapers wrote anything about her. No TV appearance or anything.
