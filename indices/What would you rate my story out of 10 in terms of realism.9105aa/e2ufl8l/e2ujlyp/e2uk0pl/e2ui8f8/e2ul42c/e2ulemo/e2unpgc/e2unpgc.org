  Angry and frustrated, the parents subsequently refer Heidi to Chinese herbalists and Homeopathic doctors, who then take her and her parents seriously.

Have you looked up homeopathy? Like at all? It is literally drinking water as medicine so that's straight up ridiculous if she's so allergic.

  The town know about her because of the unusualness of the condition and the parents attempts at spreading awareness
#+end_quote

Why are they spreading awareness? Are their others with this condition? Suspected cases? What's the point?

  I'm not sure why the thieves would break into her house but when she was younger she was bullied often and bullies threatened to destroy her suit, so maybe the thieves could have been the bullies parents?

Just no, sorry but this doesn't scan at all.

All in all this is in no way scientifically accurate, nor redeemable in it's current form. You news to have a reason behind this at the very least to hang the rest on. You also need a much much stronger antagonist than maybe the parents of bullies. Especially as the child is only 8. Also why in hell would the parents of pre-teens care enough about this girl to dislike her? Their is likely no reason you can give that would explain why fully grown adults with lives of their own would give a damn other than to pay lip service to how hard she and her family have it.

As is I wouldn't rate it at all. If you come up with an entirely different basis for her condition, research actual H2O conditions, and think of a believable social hurdle to base your emotional investment around then you can try again.
