  Earlier this year it was stolen when thieves broke into Wendy and Dave's two-bedroom home in Tividale, West Midlands.

  After Heidi appealed for its return, the callous thugs left it in a carrier bag on their doorstep - cut to bits.

This story makes it seem like they were just normal thieves who stole everything and makes no mention of it being returning in pieces, in fact I can't find any other mention of that. Do you have another source that includes that?

Edit: Also I am actually curious about the science behind milk and orange juice being ok even though they're mostly water.

Edit 2: Ok I looked into it and she would be totally fine drinking water if it doesn't touch her skin. It's just an issue with her skin touching water, so I have absolutely no idea what on earth the whole drinking stuff is about.
