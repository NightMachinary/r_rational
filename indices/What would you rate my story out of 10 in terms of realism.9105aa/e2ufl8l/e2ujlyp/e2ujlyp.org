Good ol' aquagenic diseases. Rare, brutal, and likely frustrating to live with.

First of all, I would highly recommend not using the word 'allergy' to describe it unless somebody's dumbing down the condition in-story. It's not a true allergy. The first problem with your writing is anaphylaxis isn't really a symptom that can occur from known aquagenic conditions. The two main variants are aquagenic urticaria, which causes rashes and aquagenic pruritus, which causes hives. Both are a common symptom of an allergy, but are not strictly related to allergic reactions.

Re-do your entire plot after studying that, because your story as-is wouldn't work, for a number of reasons.

First up, your solutions to the problem of a water-less human are a bit ridiculous. A full hazard suit just to keep away water sounds somewhat reasonable if the condition is unbearable, but at that point I would have expected her to die in the womb. Next up, if she's allergic to water, an IV drip isn't going to contain water. Sure, an honest mistake /might/ happen, but any nurse that is that ignorant of a patient's needs should be fired and possibly sent to prison. Your choices of beverages are downright ridiculous, because milk and orange juice are both upwards of 80% water.

Next up, a human /cannot/ create an entirely new species in one evolutionary step. This girl could not be human, because her entire biochemistry would have to be re-done to compensate for a lack of a certain liquid. New digestive system, something to replace blood (which is 92% water), and something other than extracellular fluid. You're basically replacing the majority of the human body with /something else/ and expecting it to work without redoing all the rest of her biochemistry. That would require a complete re-write of her genetic code to the point where I hesitate to describe this organism as terrestrial, let alone human.

Finally, nobody's going to break into a house to shred the hazard suit that a little girl needs to live. If such an event were to occur, it would likely be just one person. Even a group of the biggest idiots imaginable would have one person be smart enough to say "Hey, maybe we shouldn't break into a little girl's house to ruin her life by destroying the one thing keeping her safe?". Really, your story flips from her being loved and pitied to being a pariah so fast it's ridiculous. Why does this event need to occur?

Having briefly skimmed over your account, it looks like you're dedicated to writing this idea, and working hard to get the story to be 'realistic'. I can respect that, but as it stands, it's /not/ realistic. It can work as a piece of fiction, but it's not going to be rational fiction, and there's *nothing wrong with that.* A story doesn't have to be 'realistic' to be taken seriously or not lose value as a dramatic piece. If you want to write a story about a girl who has to avoid water, you can do that, but don't think of your work as lesser because it's not anything like real-life.
