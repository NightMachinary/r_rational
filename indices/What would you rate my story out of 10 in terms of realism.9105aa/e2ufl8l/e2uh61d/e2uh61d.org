I thought it was kinda ridiculous. I knew people could be allergic to water in the sense that it made their skin break out in hives and stuff, but we're /made of water/ so I assumed those people still had to drink it. But I googled it, and apparently some of those people are so allergic that it also makes their throat break out and stuff. There's a legitimately legitimate case of a girl who can literally only drink diet coke, water and tea and fruit juice make her throat blister.
