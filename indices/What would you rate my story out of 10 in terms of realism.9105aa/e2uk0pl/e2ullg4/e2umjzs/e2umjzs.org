I figured maybe they were trying one of those "social experiment" things where a true but unlikely story trips our bullshit filters and then after we finish dissecting how overwrought and unlikely it all is, they go AHA! and draw the curtain back, thus exposing our own biases and blind spots.

Maybe they're just a troll though.
