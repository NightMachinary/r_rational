You can get suspension-of-disbelief for basically anything, so long as you make it part of your premise.

Chapter 1 can have some really unlikely or impossible things ("Jane was an ordinary girl, until she won the lottery 3 times in 3 weeks." / "Naruto was born in the hidden valley of Ninjas") and I'd accept them as price-of-admission to your story.

The problem is that everything else needs to flow realistically. That includes explanations for the premise, if you give them.

One solution is to not explain stuff. This happened in /Wicked/. The main character was alergic to water. Tea was fine. The reason was "Literal Magic."

But, if you're going to make the water allergy a major part of your story (and not say 'magic!') then you need to give enough details that I, as a reader, can anticipate how your character would react to different things.

In this case, "Water Based" is probably not the descriptor you want. Orange juice, and IV fluids are water based. So is blood.

If you're making up a fake condition, I'd go with something like, "Heidi's cell boundaries are especialy vulnerable to reverse-osmosis. Contact with ph-neutral water will sap minerals right out of her skin."

That would be enough to give me intuition (rain=bad, OJ=fine, coke=fine, blood=fine) to follow the story.

But, once that's established, you have "[sick kid] needs a space-suit and special treatment."

From there, the things that jump out at me are:

1. Why does everyone know about this person? There are the occasional "sick kid" human interest stories, but they last for 6-months, tops.

Are the kid's parents doing something to keep her in the news? Because "munchausen-by-proxy, except the kid is actually sick" could be legitimately interesting.

What would it be like to be a kid who's on the lecture circuit as "brave child teaches you to appreciate life"? Maybe your lectures -- which you've been giving since you were 8 -- lifted your family out of poverty, but mean that youv'e got to maintain this always-hopeful persona that you're coming to hate.

1. What kind of parent doesn't have a backup plan?

Stuff breaks. So, I'd expect the parents to have some kind of backup plan. And, at a minimum, I'd expect the house to have a room with a dehumidifer. Otherwise, how could the character scratch an itch or change her underwear?

1. Why would thieves break into this house? There's no black-market for kid-sized space-suits. And attempted murder of a kid would actually annoy the cops
