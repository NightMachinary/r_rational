For posterity here is the post OP made:

--------------

I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old named Heidi Falconer - if the name sounds too 'fake' do tell) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

Does this story sound medically accurate? What would you rate it out of 10? The tone of the story is very serious and is meant to be taken seriously.
