Any plot points done solely (or even primarily) to tug at the heartstrings of the reader isn't going to be realistic or rational. Events have to happen for sensible, in-universe reasons; if you want something to happen, arrange your universe in such a way that it is the most reasonable course of action for the people involved.

If you want an absolutely amazing example of this happening (an author asking this sub for a critique and getting something downright amazing out rectifying the same problem), try to find the original post for "Set in Stone" by [[/u/FarmerBob1]]
