I only spent 30 seconds on google for this.

Aquagenic urticaria typically only affects skin contact. Some cases are so severe that drinking water can cause the throat to break out. The one girl I read about can't drink fruit juice, the only thing she can drink is diet coke.

Surgeons wouldn't not take the parents seriously, and it's possible that the parents wouldn't even have to inform the surgeons because, if she's been diagnosed officially (which is reasonable to assume), it'd probably be mentioned in her "charts" or whatever.

Blood is water based. I'm pretty sure the medical drip would have literally zero impact. People who are allergic to water in real life only have it as a topical allergy, and some are severe enough that the inside of the mouth and the throat are also sensitive. It is not reasonable to assume that water touching the inside of her veins/arteries/whatever would cause an outbreak, because blood is like 55% water.

  She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

Just noticed that line. The sentence contradicts itself for one (will a single drop of rain kill her or will it cause her to go into shock?), and for two, just straight up /no/. A single drop of water will kill her? Have you done /any/ research on aquagenic urticaria? I mean, 30 seconds with google, man.
