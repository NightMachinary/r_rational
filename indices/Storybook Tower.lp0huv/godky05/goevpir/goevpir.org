just an idle thought, but this comment made me draw a link between this story and "Two Games", both of which have something of a POV from a demon (assuming that's what's going on here). I thought in the other story, this made for an effective stinger---but here, where that voice is used throughout, I found it less effective

in "Two Games", I read a deliberate ambiguity over whether Ellie would actually get caught by the trap eventually---but it felt like the point (the reason why it needed to be from the demon's POV) was to show that the demon's doing a long-term gambit that has presumably paid off countless times on countless Ellies in the past, to reveal the full extent of the farce. A different (lesser?) ending might have been to stay entirely in Ellie's head: after her plan works, you see unease over how easy it was, before skipping ahead to a future Ellie (faced with an economic problem) who sure seems sorely tempted to try it again with larger stakes...

similarly, a different version of "Storybook Tower" might stay in the King's head (or, perhaps, a different audience surrogate)---thus, playing directly /into/ the reader's desire to learn more about what's going on, and pulling the rug out from under their feet as they come to independently realise that the protagonist they're reading about is also just playing out a story. As is, the audience is deliberately alienated from the King, which I think is a missed opportunity to personally invest the reader in the implications of the introdump...? So I think the conceit here's strong, but there's a good case to be made that the POV is what scuppers it a little
