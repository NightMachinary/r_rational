I'm glad someone thought this was worth posting, but personally I'm not very happy with it.

One of my long-term projects is trying to figure out how to do infodumps in a way that isn't boring. One technique writers who are better than me use is putting the infodump into dialogue, and dribbling out the info like the answers to a mystery. If there's also fun dialogue stuff happening, you can spend a surprising amount of time doing worldbuilding without people feeling bored.

This short story is basically me practicing that technique, but I think it suffers from two failures.

1. The interaction is kind of boring, because it's fundamentally a delivery mechanism for the information rather than an interaction I thought would be fun to write.

2. I think I tried so hard to dribble out the information in a way that made the reader curious, that I made it too difficult to figure out what the fuck the information actually /was/.
