(--And this explains the morphing effect in this canon. I find myself wondering if any meaningful decisions get made in the pool, or only by those with prolonged host-bonding; come to think of it, that greater reliance brings to mind the Iskoort, though they also suffered from the Controller issue of 'even if necessary for life, might actually prefer death'.)

I confess puzzlement about why Aftran couldn't talk with Karen directly and hash things out (earlier or later), or--assuming Karen comprehended her own suffering--why she couldn't lift the comprehension directly from Karen's mind. If in this canon there can be something that a host understands that the Yeerk doesn't, that opens up interesting possibilities.
