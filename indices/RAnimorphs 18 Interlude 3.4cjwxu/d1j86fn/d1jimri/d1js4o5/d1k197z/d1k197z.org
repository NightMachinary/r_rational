It could simply be a language issue. Aftran struggles to understand concepts innate to Karen as is. We see "conversations" between Esplin and Alloran, but we also know that Andalites have a much more visual and mental rather than word based conception of concepts and the world around them, which might be easier to communicate with a similar being. Karen as a human and a human child at that might not be able to communicate with a being so different from her in that way, and Aftran has the same problem - an inability to understand concepts unless they are explained to her. If neither of them can explain to the other in terms they understand, they're at a stalemate. Probably why Karen goes to such an extreme at the end.
