I think with an adult you could brute force it - and here, Aftran does control Karen with brute force several times, and indeed, always has the capacity to do so.

Canon Aftran was curious though and wanted to do things differently, and the Aftran here has that quality too. Perhaps so do some other Yeerks - with the hive mind, that gets a little hazy. This is an interesting and unusual case though, the Yeerk is deliberately letting go her control to try and share the cockpit with the human and that's where the dialogue of them not understanding each other is coming from.

  if you're talking with a Yeerk in someone's head and the Yeerk has 'an inability to understand concepts unless they are explained to her' while the host would have understood those concepts, then you're going to be able to notice that something's very off about the conversation (certainly compared to before infestation), and start strongly suspecting alcohol or drugs or a stroke. A potential major dent in the secrecy part of the invasion mission profile.

which is why most Yeerks do what Aftran was mainly used to doing, shutting the host in a small corner of the mind and not letting them out; taking over the brain wholly themselves. Aftran presumably calculated that the risk of letting the host take some control back was lessened with a child - if she zoned out, who would see that as noteworthy, and if she blabbed, who would believe her? In fact if the Aftran hive mind compared notes, so to speak, in the Yeerk pool, this particular Aftran would be the perfect selection to experiment with allowing a human some freedom to try and set up a dialogue or an understanding, due to who her host is.
