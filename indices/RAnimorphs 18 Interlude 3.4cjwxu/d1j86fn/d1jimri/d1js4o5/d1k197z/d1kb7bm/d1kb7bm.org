<nods...> In that case, though, what happens when a Controller has to interact with an uninfested human, and the host only wants to scream and die? Can the Yeerk properly emulate a different innate state of mind without being able to grasp that state of mind without communication? Manually sifting through memories to pick and choose what muscle movements to copy seems as though it would take too much time, compared to a full intuitive interface.

This can be put more simply: if you're talking with a Yeerk in someone's head and the Yeerk has 'an inability to understand concepts unless they are explained to her' while the host would have understood those concepts, then you're going to be able to notice that something's very off about the conversation (certainly compared to before infestation), and start strongly suspecting alcohol or drugs or a stroke. A potential major dent in the secrecy part of the invasion mission profile.
