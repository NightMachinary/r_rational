    Her name was Aftran 927 -> feeling her self expand as more and more of her siblings joined her, became her, released their names and took the name of Aftran for their own.

  If she's the original Afran and others took on her name then why is she 927? Or am I misunderstanding the temporal correlations here?

I could be wrong, but I took this as a metaphor for the pool reading her memories: as the others absorb them more deeply, they can be considered to "be" her, at least for a while.
