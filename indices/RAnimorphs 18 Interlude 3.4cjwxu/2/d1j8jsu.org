Christ that got dark quickly. The perspective was everything in that chapter. Just imagine the story if Karen was telling it. Aftran and her colleagues are essentially three kidnappers who play with Karen and her parents.

Chilling. And very well written to get into the head of those characters, so to speak.

Edit: also. The little girl probably puts her eyes out with a knife because that's the only way she knows to kill herself - she would have grown up being told to never play with knives because she could put her eye out and die.
