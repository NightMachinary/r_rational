Very interesting chapter. Yeerks as a hive-mind officially confirmed! 9-years-olds trying to commit gruesome suicide! Fun for the whole family!

Mhhh... I wonder if Karen ate the cake before, um... you know, going Wake!Skitter.

Otherwise, I like the naive alienness of the yeerks here. Their train of thought is basically "But, I gave my host a healthy dose of sleep, a sufficiently nutritious meal and physical activity today, and yet she is still upset! What is this sorcery?", which makes sense for a species used to infesting non-sentients. I'm still a bit annoyed, because when I read these sort of "Robot/Alien trying to understand weird human things" story, I always get the feeling I would have done a better job of explaining it in a way the alien could understand.

Actually, while I'm on a complete tangent, there was one story that did it pretty well: the anime Parasyte (didn't read the manga). There's one episode where one of the eponym sociopathic aliens goes to an university lecture about ethics and morality, and it's really awesome because the lecturer does a good job of explaining (some of) the origins of ethical thinking in a way you could totally understand if you were an alien wondering "Uh, why /do/ these people constantly not eat each other?".
