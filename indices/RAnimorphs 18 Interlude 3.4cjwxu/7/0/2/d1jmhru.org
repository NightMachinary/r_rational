That made me chuckle. In part because "yeah, stop wasting your time with human emotions and get a life, nerd", and in part because Aftran's observations and conclusions about love kind of felt like the theories you tend to imagine when you're thinking too hard about something and you have no way to actually measure whether you're right or just making stuff up.
