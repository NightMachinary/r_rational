  She gathered thousands of memories---what wonder, to be able to hold so many!

Wait, are Yeerk not able to do that outside of a body? In that case how do they carry over their memories from one host to another?

  Her name was Aftran 927 -> feeling her self expand as more and more of her siblings joined her, became her, released their names and took the name of Aftran for their own.

If she's the original Afran and others took on her name then why is she 927? Or am I misunderstanding the temporal correlations here?

  This love, she asked herself, in a chorus of ten thousand voices. What good is it?

  She dwelt on it for days---brought the question back to the coalescion, felt it echo through her siblings, watched it bounce off of their indifference.

If they think as one hive mind while in the pool and share all memories how can she hold a different opinion regarding love and compersion (may be the wrong word as I'm not a native English speaker) than her fellow pool inhabitants?

I still have a lot of questions regarding the intricacies of Yeerk functioning and would like it if you shed a bit more concrete light on stuff as long as it doesn't contain spoilers for the story itself.

Oh and I suppose I should comment on poor 9 year old Karen having to live through body horror and cutting her own eyes out in hopes to escape it. Meh. It was good story telling.
