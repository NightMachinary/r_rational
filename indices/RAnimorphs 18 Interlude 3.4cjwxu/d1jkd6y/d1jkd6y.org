I really like it. Also, the Yeerks parallel the Andalites a bit now, which is thematically cool. Both are hive minds, although the Andalites at least understand individuality enough to see that echoed minds are false. How can mere humans compete with either species? I guess by becoming hive minds as well, through brain sharing morphs. But is that the only way? Kind of reminds me of the conflict against the Buggers in Ender's game. I've always felt OSC's answer was too cheerily optimistic about the value of individuality mixed with teamwork.

However, relevant scientific paper: [[http://www.unavarra.es/digitalAssets/128/128596_abstract-Jaromir.pdf]]. Using that as inspiration for ideas, maybe social diversity is good although for some reason not often preserved in species that reach interstellar travel. Can the Animorphs overcome their greatest challenge yet: Fermi's Paradox? (In the sense that we haven't all already been disassembled by Von Neumann machines, not in the sense that aliens exist or don't.)
