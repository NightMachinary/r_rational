I've considered this myself. There was an animorphs continuation fan fiction on AO3 about an artist yeerk who's job is essentially as a life change for hire, IIRC. I would pay good money for someone to take control for six months, putting my life in order, squelching bad habits, and otherwise getting my ducks in a row.

Heck, intellectual partnerships could be amazing. You take control during my boring dead end day job, you get all the sensory experiences you want, and we both get a companion to bounce ideas off of and shoot the shit with 24/7. A neutral authority asks me during feeding every 3 days if I still want to continue the partnership.

Honestly, if the Andalites weren't around, you're right, the yeerk-human alliance could be an amazing thing. Combat operatives have a backup if they go into shock or are knocked unconcious. Information and memories could be transferred efficiently or confidentially. Can you imagine a math tutor that fires your neurons to get you to understand something?
