Ah nice to see the seeds of the internal yeerk rebellion being sowed.

Honestly if we could have organized everything differently you could probably have gotten a lot of humans to volunteer to be yeerked.

Not the entire population, but honestly if the numbers I'm hearing about the andalites are similar to what they were in canon and the human tech progression rate is also as it was in canon the yeerks could win against the andalites with humans as allies using even a TENTH of our population.

How many of those that suffer from executive dysfunctions, schizophrenia, compulsive behaviors or just plain and simple terrible lives or with life sentences in prison be willing to spend a tour of duty in the yeerk empire fighting the evils of the andalite monsters?

A yeerk psychologist or therapist or fitness trainer could be enormously helpful.

Really a human-yeerk alliance could be wondrous and 'great'.
