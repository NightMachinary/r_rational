This Aftran had a different number. Canonical Aftran was 942, not 927. And in this fanfic, yeerks get their names from the yeerks that they memetically descend from (as a result of the experiences exchanged during the Sharing), and they increment in number as they get more experiences. So we're reading the perspective of a younger and less wise iteration of Aftran.

So she got close, but not quite. It leaves the possibility that yeerks can, or that Aftran could have if Karen had cooperated, understand and feel human love.
