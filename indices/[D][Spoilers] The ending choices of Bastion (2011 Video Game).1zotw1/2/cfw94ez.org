I actually took the *restore* option, but immediately regretted doing so. I then started to go back through the game to pick the other option, but it kept crashing.

The reason I found that restoring wasn't a good idea was that, well, it doesn't actually change anything. Maybe there's a small chance it does change anything, but the game doesn't show that.

I think the real question is whether or not it's moral to keep killing the same people over and over again until you get it *maybe* right.
