I went Restore then Evacuate, and if the Narrator's deja vu is "reliable" then that's also how the canon timeline worked. As for why exactly Rucks is the only one who seems to display any sort of change between timelines, I've got no idea other than the fact that he's the only one we hear for the majority of the game.

If you recall, the way the Restoration works is by using the memories of the Windbags living in the Cores, but the only way for anything to change between Restorations is if the memories were imperfect, either initially or through some side effect of the Restoration itself. It's possible that after an arbitrarily large number of Restorations the feedback loop of imperfect memories will somehow result in the prevention of the Calamity, but I think that the differences the Kid would experience force him to choose Evacuation before any meaningful changes appear in any of the Mancers pre-Calamity.
