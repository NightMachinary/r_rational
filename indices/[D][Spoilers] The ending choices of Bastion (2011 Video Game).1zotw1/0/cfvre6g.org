  The work of the Mancer's was imperfect; the fact the Calamity happened in the first place is proof of that. It seems reasonable to suggest their time manipulation could cause slight divergences in the new timeline.

You have a tool that will *rearrange all matter and energy within thousands of miles*, and you don't trust it to function properly, so you are going to press the big red button and hope that it's broken in a way that is useful to you. As opposed to a way that will cause you and everyone else to experience their own horribly painful deaths again and again, for instance. Or destroy everything that's still alive.
