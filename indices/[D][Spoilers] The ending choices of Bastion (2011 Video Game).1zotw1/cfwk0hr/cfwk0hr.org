I have played through the game several times and I can never bring myself to choose the Restore option. The way I see it if the device works perfectly then the calamity will happen again and each successive version of you will also choose Restore, creating an apocalyptic time-loop. If the device, which is powerful enough to turn back time and reverse thousands of deaths, does not function properly then there is no reason to think it will provide a better outcome.

The only safe option is to evacuate. At least that way there is hope for the future.
