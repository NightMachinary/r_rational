Hrrmph, some thoughts on our enemies.

Ganondorf:

We have no idea what this guy wants. It's alarming how nothing we know about him. We know some of his past, and Sheshan indicates that he's collecting Triforce of Power fragments, but that's about it.

Collecting Triforce fragments is like leveling up. It'll be helpful at whatever you turn your hand to. But it doesn't really narrow down his goals all that much.

If we are still of a mind that he was behind the invasion and the assassination attempt on Zelda, then that is a few more data points, but they are entirely coherent with him just trying to collect Triforce fragments, and so they don't really give us much more than that.

Shesan calls Demise 'the power behind Ganondorf', but we don't know when/how they made contact, or why Ganondorf would serve it. When he ruled the Gerudo he had more conventional ambitions than something that killed Hylia would probably share. What's the basis of their alliance?

Demise:

This thing is an even bigger question mark. In the vision the barrier around the world is being cracked by a smoke fist coming off of another world with its own barrier, but it isn't clear if Demise is that smoke (dragon, face) thing, or if it is a thing of the Void around both worlds.

It wants the triforce. That's about all I feel comfortable saying is certain about it.

â€‹

So, if we are doing any more questions for Sheshan this time...can we ask what she knows of Ganondorf's motivations, and most particularly anything she might know about how/when/if he hooked up with Demise? We are currently like a soccer team trying to play defense that doesn't know where it's own goal is. If we are going to stop these guys, we desperately need to figure out what their victory conditions actually are.
