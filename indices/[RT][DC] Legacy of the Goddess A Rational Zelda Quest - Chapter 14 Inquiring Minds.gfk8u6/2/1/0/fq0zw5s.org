  I like the idea in theory - I enjoy that style of gaming. My primary concern would be whether playing in real-time would cause our characters to come across as less component than they are in the standard Quest, since standard Quest play allows for both the players and the QMs to take more time on decision making. It's much easier to make obvious mistakes in a real-time game.

  Basically, I'm worried that those of us playing in the Discord session could get us all killed doing something that we wouldn't normally do in the Quest itself.

  I think I'm generally for doing it anyway, and I'd want to play if there's room and I'm available at the time, but I'd want to know more about the QM philosophy for how the Discord session is going to run.

Think "text adventure game" except with visual aids and also the possibility for some back-and-forth with QMs and more leeway/flexibility in decision points. The way we would handle it would be players providing high-level direction to Link, which we would interpret generously and have Link fill in the details. "Go to this area and try X while avoiding Y" as opposed to "turn left," "go down the corridor," "open the door," etc.

In general my philosophy with QMing/DMing/whatever-ing is to not burden players with having to worry about minor details and incidental mistakes ("gotchas", if you will). Rather, I believe challenge should come from open-ended difficult problems that require making complex trade-offs and have no easy answers.

Of course that changes a bit in a literal dungeon with predetermined paths and puzzles, but the guiding principle remains the same. Any mistakes you make are likely to be strategical or tactical in nature (depending on the context), rather than "whoops we forgot something really obvious and now Link is dead." Most of the work on our end would be done upfront to ensure the challenges hit at the right level.
