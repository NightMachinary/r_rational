That all makes sense. My main concern comes down to whether or not a purely QM-driven version of Link and his party would have a higher success rate with, say, solving puzzles than the actual player base would with those same puzzles.

That being said, it seems like QMs would probably have fun with it, and the players would probably have fun with it, so it's probably worth doing.
