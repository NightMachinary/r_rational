  Mark of Harvesting Divine Power

  Spend up to 25 of my personal points on additional research toward Lesser Marks of Transference with their scope reduced even further. This further reduced version is called Mark of Harvesting Divine Power. (Some old discussion of the Lesser Mark of Transference spell here and here for ease of reference.)

  Spell description: Mark of Harvesting Divine Power places a mark upon an individual that passively generates additional VP based on the person's activities. This has none of the other functions of a Mark of Transference; it only generates VP. This still requires consent from the target, similar to a traditional Mark of Transference.

A report: I do not believe it to be possible to develop any meaningful alterations on the Mark of Transference without a substantially more nuanced approach. To my understanding, the Mark of Transference works by suffusing the target's essence with a large quantity of Void Power. With sufficient power, cascading changes to the target's essence occurs, which results in the state with which you are familiar.

In summary, I am unable to select from individual "functions" of Mark of Transference to develop Lesser Marks.

  Byrna's Armor

  Spend up to 25 of my personal points on researching defensive magic. We have previously researched the Cane of Byrna's defensive function, determining that it may be replicable, but seemingly at extreme cost. Attempt to research a weaker version of this function, using the Cane of Byrna as a part of the foundation, as well as observing the properties of imbued armor as a second point of data. If possible, figure out if it is possible to construct a defensive spell with a function similar to the described one below:

  Spell Description: Byrna's Armor. While active, utilizes VP to defend the target against attacks. This requires an initial expenditure of VP to activate, as well as a maintenance cost to remain active. The efficacy and duration of the spell are both variable based on VP expended.

I have been wholly unable to replicate the effects of Imbued armor using Old Magic. Further, I am not currently aware of any mechanisms by which I could use Old Magic to serve a defensive purpose in any capacity.

An additional note: I do not currently have access to a Cane of Bryna. If you could provide me with an instance of said object, I would be able to study it in more detail. A description of it alone is insufficient to generate additional points of data.
