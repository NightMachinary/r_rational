*Voting!* ... might be weird this time around.

We are maybe planning to do a live DM session over Discord to explore the Obsidian Spire with Link and his Sheikah squad. This would be a 2-3 hour event that would allow much finer grained player agency than just "do prep, follow a long list of protocols, hope for the best." Results would be aggregated and expounded upon in the next chapter.

There seemed to be decent [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/588230711987798026/706113807658778705][support for this on Discord]], but we are not fully committing to the idea just yet. Please let us know your thoughts on this below.

If we decide against it, this post will be deleted/replaced with a normal voting post and we will adjust accordingly. If we decide to go through with it, more details will be posted to the [[https://discordapp.com/invite/B5abMg8][Discord]].
