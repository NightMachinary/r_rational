*Announcement*

We kind of fumbled on giving players any meaningful decision points at the end of the last chapter, and we also aren't ready for a realtime DM session. In the interests of moving the story along, there will be another short chapter between now and ~Wednesday that will have additional actionable info we weren't able to get to. No vote necessary. /Probably/ no one important will die.

Status of realtime dungeon crawl is still TBD but we are leaning towards "no." Our thinking is that as this requires substantial prep and commitment on both sides of the curtain, we are not justified in changing up the format to this degree if collectively everyone is only lukewarm at best on the idea.

If you really want this to happen, now is the time to make your arguments.
