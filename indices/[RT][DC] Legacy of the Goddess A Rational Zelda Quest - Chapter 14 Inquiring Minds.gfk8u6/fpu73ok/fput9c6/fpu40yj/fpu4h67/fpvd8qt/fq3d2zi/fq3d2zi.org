Some feedback on the planning incentive bonuses for VP to help you all calibrate on how we're scoring this. This is taking into account both the c13 and c14 plans since c13 didn't span enough time to accrue VP.

#+begin_quote
  How well did you progress your goals?
#+end_quote

Our estimate here is 9/10. I don't expect a single plan to progress goals much more than you did here, short of actually acquiring Triforce fragments, clearing a dungeon, killing an Exiled King or three, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Did you take any risks, and did they pay off?
#+end_quote

4/10. Heading into the Sunseeker Encampment was tense but not actually dangerous or risky.

#+begin_quote
  How interesting was writing/worldbuilding for us?
#+end_quote

5/10. Median outcome; not really particularly interesting or uninteresting.

  How frustrating was writing/worldbuilding for us?

3/10. This is based primarily off of the fact that the plan was just a laundry list of questions. We understand the desire to obtain information, but in the future we would really prefer you not just ask every single open question you have when meeting NPCs. This is mostly because it makes it difficult to write interesting content and also hampers our ability to pose interesting decision points when most of our focus is on figuring out what said NPC knows in order to answer the questions.

In the interests of transparency, I will likely outright veto plans similar to the c14 plan in the future. It wasn't as egregious as it could have been, but it still resulted in us having to write another short chapter before the story can progress while still allowing for meaningful player input.

#+begin_quote
  How much did we enjoy the discussion?
#+end_quote

9.5/10. Quite a bit of interesting discussion and participation this time around.

#+begin_quote
  How easy was it to figure out what players wanted to do?
#+end_quote

7.5 for the c14 plan and 10/10 for the c13 plan. Overall 9/10.

--------------

This results in an overall score of 39.5/60. This results in 165 VP per day out of a possible 250 per day.
