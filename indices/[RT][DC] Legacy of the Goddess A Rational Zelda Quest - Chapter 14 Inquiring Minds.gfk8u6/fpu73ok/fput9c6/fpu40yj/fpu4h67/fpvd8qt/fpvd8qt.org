I like the idea in theory - I enjoy that style of gaming. My primary concern would be whether playing in real-time would cause our characters to come across as less component than they are in the standard Quest, since standard Quest play allows for both the players and the QMs to take more time on decision making. It's much easier to make obvious mistakes in a real-time game.

Basically, I'm worried that those of us playing in the Discord session could get us all killed doing something that we wouldn't normally do in the Quest itself.

I think I'm /generally/ for doing it anyway, and I'd want to play if there's room and I'm available at the time, but I'd want to know more about the QM philosophy for how the Discord session is going to run.

I'd also be interested in knowing if we'd be using the same rules set as the quest itself, something different that is designed for real-time play, or maybe a mix.
