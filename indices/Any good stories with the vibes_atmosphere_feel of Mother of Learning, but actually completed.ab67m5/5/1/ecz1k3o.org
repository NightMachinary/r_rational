I really enjoyed Time Braid. There were definitely some weird points (What you mentioned + the romance + some minor stuff), but overall it felt like a strong cohesive story with a satisfying conclusion. Probably the most similar story out there to MoL, and still very readable if you aren't familiar with the Naruto fandom.
