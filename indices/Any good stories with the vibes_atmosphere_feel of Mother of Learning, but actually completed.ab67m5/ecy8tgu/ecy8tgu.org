To piggyback off of this, does anyone know any stories that specifically feel more like act 1 of MoL? I love MoL of course, but the points where I loved it the /most/ were in the first act, where surmounting the obstacle with a direct head-on assault seemed impossible, so it was focused more on the trial-and-error, broadening options and trying to learn the intricacies of the repeated month/grow closer to people he originally never paid attention to rather than the more straightforward research-ramping it drifted towards in the later acts. It'd be cool to see a time loop story like it where there /are/ multiple loopers but the big obstacle at the end of the loop truly is insurmountable with normal means so the protagonist entirely has to focus on learning every aspect of the loop and overcoming the antagonistic time traveler that way.
