[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] and its even more complex AU cousin, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]].

Hard Reset is fairly standard groundhog's day stuff, again with a smart protagonist that powerlevels and doesn't angst much.

Hard Reset 2 is hard reset plus multiple opposing loopers.

edit: after a re-read, I'd like to retract the bit about "minimal angst." It does happen in a realistic, rather than overbearing way though.

Edit 2: after a re-read, it turns out that hard reset 2 isn't actually completed, but ends at the beginning of an arc that slots almost neatly into the original's timeline.
