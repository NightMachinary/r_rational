Most of them are like that, plus getting laid more in high school etc. Some of them are super sappy romantic--be warned if you start anything /labeled/ romantic.

There's a series of stories set mostly on Mars by Al Steiner with books titled Greenies, and A Perfect World and I think one other one. I think it's A Perfect World tha has a guy who gets cryo-frozen, wakes up in the future on mars, and then there's some time travel that would spoil the plot. Not really a full loop though. It has the most realistic depiction I've ever read of what warfare in space and in Mar's atmosphere would be like.

Only real downside to the books IMO is bullshit exposition detailing a vision for a leftist Utopian government (which of course is what his future-mars has. It's not Ayn Rand's John Galt speech long, but it's there.) Characters also love weed a bit much for my taste, but otherwise it's a good series.
