For me it's the Ground Hog Day story element that I really like about MoL. If that's the part you're into, there are unfortunately only a few stories that really do that shtick. Someone else mentioned time braid...

Most of the others I've read have been smutty stories on [[https://storiesonline.net][storiesonline.net]] . They have a category tag called DoOver which usually involves only one trip back in time, but sometimes repeated ones. Most stories on the site list their amount of sexual content with some having none, so you can somewhat moderate the concentration of erotica you endure.

I've found the scores on the site to be /relatively/ accurate. Anything over 8.5 probably has really good writing. Anything under 7.5 or so has quirks in the English or the plot that are highly noticeable to me, and anything below about 6.3 is basically unreadable trash.

Because of their Premier Membership thing for unlocking search details, the best way to search the site, after your first page of free results from the Category Search, is actually with Google. Do something like:

#+begin_example
  site:storiesonline.net  DoOver [words/tags you want in the story description such as Ma/Fa] 
#+end_example

You can also add random tags along with the one you want to keep some of the initial results off the first page and get a few more results before resorting to Google--or just pay the $68/year membership if you can justify it.

I also really like the way magic is done in MoL but again, finding stories with the same kind of universe is hard..
