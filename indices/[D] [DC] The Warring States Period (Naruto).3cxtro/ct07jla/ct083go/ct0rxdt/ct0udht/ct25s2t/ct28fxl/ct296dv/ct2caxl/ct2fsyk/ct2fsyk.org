  Oh, okay then.

    Why do ninja fight with knives instead of guns?
  #+end_example

  ...because they can blow shit up by waving their hands around? Tech arises out of necessity, and it's absurd to think that the very particular circumstances and coincidences that resulted in our current technosphere would be replicated in any alternate universe, much less one with such a radical difference as chakra magic. We developed guns because human-propelled arrows and spears were eventually just not good enough. They never had that problem.
#+end_quote

- /Some/ ninja can blow shit up with their hands, sure. Not all. Certainly not genin.
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_M82][Barret M82]] rifle has an effective range of over a mile. I'm not aware of any jutsu that comes even close to that.\\
- Jutsu aren't usually suitable for sniping. Guns are great for that.
- Chakra is a limited (albeit self-renewing) resource, and genin don't have a lot of it. Why /not/ use guns? It lets you conserve chakra for when it counts. Basically, use the right tool for the job; shoot a guy when you just need him dead so you can use your chakra to call down a giant water dragon to blow the crap out of an entire company. I'm not saying that jutsu have no place in the military -- they absolutely do. There's simply no reason that they should be the military's /only/ tool.
- Even if ninja don't use guns, why not anyone else? A company of samurai, or a village full of civilians, equipped with good rifles would give most ninja pause. Probably not the S-ranks, no, but genin? Low-level chunin? Sure.

Ninja use shuriken and kunai as projectile weapons. This is an excellent choice if you're on a stealth mission, but a lot of ninja combat seems to happen out in the open and involves no stealth at all. Not only would guns be useful for actual assault, but for battlefield control. During the first battle against Zabuza, suppose the genin had pulled an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M240_machine_gun][M240]] out of a storage scroll and used it to deny certain parts of the battlefield to Zabuza, herding him into Kakashi's killbox? Is that a perfect tactic? No. Zabuza's clones would have been a problem, and there's others. The point is, it's /an/ option, and it's one that came to me in literally two seconds, and I'm a civilian. Surely experienced ninja commanders could find a way to factor guns into their battle strategies?

    Why do ninja travel on foot instead of in railroads?
  #+end_example

  Same as above - because why would people who can cover dozens of miles at a flat-out sprint and some who can straight-up teleport ever feel the need to develop them?
#+end_quote

- Again, why burn the chakra?\\
- A train can transport large amounts of people and cargo; a group of ninja can't.
- Serious question: how fast /is/ a ninja? Can they outsprint a train? Can they outrun it over the long haul, over the course of several days? A train doesn't sleep, eat, or take bathroom breaks.
- Even /if/, for the sake of argument, ninja don't need trains...what about civilians? And samurai?\\

Shoot, the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Land_of_Snow][Land of Snow]] was considered unusually advanced because they had some of these things.

    Where are the chip fabs that those computers come from?
  #+end_example

  Konoha is not a country. It's a single military-base-esque city in a rather large country. Would you build a chip fab in Guantanamo Bay, or would a story set in Guantanamo Bay ever refer to a chip fab? Does that mean there are no chip fabs in the United States?
#+end_quote

I didn't expect Konoha to have a chip fab. My question is: /in canon/ what do we ever see that would constitute significant modern industry, much less something as sophisticated as laptop-building equipment?

    the outboard motor
  #+end_example

  I find nothing peculiar about it, other than that in this day and age people still think poverty = no tech whatsoever for ever and ever. I've lived next to some of the poorest peoples on the planet. Half the fishermen I know use motorized boats. Never mind that the Land of Waves' poverty was a recent development brought on by a corrupt magnate, there is no indication that it's [solely] a fishing boat, and its only seen purpose is ferrying people to and from the islands. Poor islanders still need to visit the mainland, no?
#+end_quote

Given that literally a month ago I got back from living in Southeast Asia I'm quite in agreement that poverty allows for tech. My point is that the tech is inappropriately dispersed -- we see one outboard in Wave. Serious question, no snark: do we see any other piece of modern tech in Wave at all? Maybe it's there and I'm not remembering it -- can you point to a canon example? Either tech is scarce and that's why they have only one piece, or tech is common, in which case we should have seen electric lights or something. If it's scarce then that needs to be explained, and the question of 'why an outboard that requires gasoline?' comes up.

    The simple truth is that the Naruto-verse runs on Rule of Cool
  #+end_example

  Or rather, that people assume so and then make no effort to see the sense that it makes.
#+end_quote

I guess my simple question is: before he started writing, Kishimoto undoubtedly sat down to do some worldbuilding. He probably figured out the bit about the Sage, and the Ten-Tails, and the One- through Nine-Tails and a bunch of the exciting ninja history. Do you really think, though, that he stopped to work out the economics? Shoot, the timeline doesn't even make sense. According to the wiki, [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake][Kakashi]] became a genin at /four/, graduated at five, became a chunin by six, was assigned to several teams, then got assigned to Obito / Rin / Minato's team, and /then/ tested for genin.

It's much simpler to believe that Kishimoto made stuff up as he went along that to believe that it's all part of some carefully-woven, carefully-preplanned world. Don't get me wrong -- Naruto is a kickass story with a great world to play around in. It's got great powers, cool characters, exciting action. It doesn't seem to bear a lot of close scrutiny though, /and that's okay/. That's not the point of the story.
