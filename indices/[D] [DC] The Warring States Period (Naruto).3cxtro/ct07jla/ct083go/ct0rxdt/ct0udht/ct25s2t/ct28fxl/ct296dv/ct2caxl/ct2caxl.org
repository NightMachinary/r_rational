Oh, okay then.

  Why do ninja fight with knives instead of guns?
#+end_quote

...because they can blow shit up by waving their hands around? Tech arises out of necessity, and it's absurd to think that the very particular circumstances and coincidences that resulted in our current technosphere would be replicated in any alternate universe, much less one with such a radical difference as chakra magic. /We/ developed guns because human-propelled arrows and spears were eventually just not good enough. /They/ never had that problem.

  Why do ninja travel on foot instead of in railroads?
#+end_quote

Same as above - because why would people who can cover dozens of miles at a flat-out sprint and some who can straight-up *teleport* ever feel the need to develop them?

  Where are the chip fabs that those computers come from?
#+end_quote

Konoha is not a country. [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Geography][It's a single military-base-esque city in a rather large country]]. Would you build a chip fab in Guantanamo Bay, or would a story set in Guantanamo Bay ever refer to a chip fab? Does that mean there are no chip fabs in the United States?

  Why are there computers and bluetooth-esque radio earpieces but no cars?
#+end_quote

There's a need for those devices: they provide solutions and significant value which their bodies alone have no or poor equivalents to. As covered before, there is (or was) no such need when it comes to transportation.

  Where does their electricity come from
#+end_quote

From power plants, like all mainstream public-use electricity comes from. See above about cities and countries.

#+begin_quote
  Did Konoha have any form of street lighting?
#+end_quote

Its architecture is drawn on traditional Japan. Illumination is largely provided by establishments, [[http://muza-chan.net/aj/poze-weblog2/chochin-hanami-koji-dori-kyoto-big.jpg][like it still is in parts of Japan]]

  the outboard motor

I find nothing peculiar about it, other than that in this day and age people still think poverty = no tech whatsoever for ever and ever. I've lived next to some of the poorest peoples on the planet. Half the fishermen I know use motorized boats. Never mind that the Land of Waves' poverty was a recent development brought on by a corrupt magnate, there is no indication that it's [solely] a fishing boat, and its only seen purpose is ferrying people to and from the islands. Poor islanders still need to visit the mainland, no?

  The simple truth is that the Naruto-verse runs on Rule of Cool
#+end_quote

Or rather, that people assume so and then make no effort to see the sense that it makes.
