That does answer some questions, but creates others. A feud could create problems between clans, but historical examples of feuds show that they do not actually last very long. The Hatfields and McCoys lasted from the Civil War to the 1890's and similar feuds in history lasted for a similar length of time. If the feuding added an ideological element, then it might be able to last longer, but ordinary feuds that last from the mists of history are not realistic.

New villages do explain their relationship to the world, but if chakra allows for supermen to exist, then they will automatically rule the world. The daimyou may "rule" them, but it seems more likely that such a rule is both limited and ceremonial. If he has access to his own chakra users then that calculus can change, but not by very much unless he actually has a significantly large private army of them.

In a state of constant war, the danger is that the daimyou may hire an enemy if you fail to do what he requests. On the other hand, he is also in danger of dying if he requests too much. The ninja may not wish to rule because of the demands of training, but if the benefits are greater than the costs, they will rule anyway. In that case, they would replace the daimyou with their clan. The daimyou will know this and insure that the costs of replacing him are too great - probably by paying the ninja well enough and hiring his own bodyguards from a separate source.

It is possible to use shinobi to fight your wars, but remember that it is much easier to kill the enemy civilians than the enemy army. So any war between the two groups would mean that the army to act first would target the civilians. The modern idea of rights and rules of war is out of place here.

Any hiring of ninja during the era of Warring States would have to take these possibilities into account. So while it would be possible to temporarily hire ninja for a limited objective, general hiring would be much different. You might claim that all ninja were hired for short-term temporary assignments. But the problem is that this would very quickly change. The first country to hire ninja permanently would gain a huge advantage. Therefore, assuming no one is holding an idiot ball, everyone would have hired people permanently.
