Reincarnations might explain some elements of the feud, assuming that they are aware of their own status and remember their previous life. I don't know how gods or demigods are supposed to explain the continuance of a feud though. Also, ideological elements really are needed unless the reincarnated remember themselves. (I mention this last part because often cases of reincarnation end up with the "person" reincarnated being very different.)

As for ninja, you claim that there are many other chakra users - monks, samurai and others. Sure, that situation might allow for a balance of forces. The problem is that it is not clear that they do allow that. Monks are presumably separate - unless monks participate in the military as religious forces. Samurai might fight and protect their country, but then they would have to form a large military contingent. In that case, why do the ninja take jobs and not the samurai? What advantage do the ninja provide that the samurai do not? There needs to be an answer here otherwise there is simply no reason to hire ninja at all. Depending on the reason, samurai might provide no true balance of power against ninja.

Assuming that the clan has no true ability to run the country is rather unlikely. Clan leaders must be govern fairly large families (otherwise they could not sustain large causalities). They must hire themselves out to others, maintain training programs, govern their own business (because hiring oneself out is a business) and supply all of their logistics needs. While a country is larger and does have other needs, it is not so different that a clan leader would lack the ability to govern.

I admit that if several clans lived in the same country, then governing that country would not be feasible. But it is still possible to govern a section of that country - such as a state or province or a local town.

Killing enemy civilians will win the war. The ninja need to get paid. If you kill the people who pay them, then they receive no money. It is much easier to kill such people than to kill the enemy ninja. Many wars have been won by destroying the logistics rather than killing the men. This should be fairly basic.

Hiring ninja permanently does not mean they are lapdogs. Hiring a ninja permanently simply means that a continuous contract is in effect for the individuals involved. If the relations between the two parties change, the contract can be terminated. Naturally, both parties try to join their interests so that this does not happen. Furthermore, always choosing the higher bidder is either irrational or impossible. It is irrational if the person bidding cannot actually pay what they are bidding. It is impossible if there is no such person. But there will be some situations where it is simply impossible for a real person to pay more. They might be able to pay more later, or perhaps if circumstances were different, but at that time no person could.

As for losses of permanent ninja, you are not considering the loss due to outside factors. Ninja that attack a clan simply because it has a permanent contract will incur a loss of men. That loss could only be justified if it led to gaining a contract of their own. But there is no reason to believe that it would. You can have hatred in your world, but I do not see how your parties are acting rationally.

In fact ninja are not like Marines. Marines are funded by the government and obey the government as citizens. They do not conduct private wars against the Navy or the Army. They do not determine their own training and pay as a self-selected group. They are not a family organization. They do not act as a private army at all. So whether ninja would take over countries has nothing at all to do with Marines. (Plus ninja are much more physically dangerous than Marines. I would say that in the case of a Marine with weapons is equal to a ninja with weapons, but a Marine without weapons will be killed by a ninja nine times out of ten.)

I should note that the question of what canonically occurs in Naruto in the Warring States period and what is actually reasonable for such period given canonical powers and current political arrangements are not at all the same. I do not think that the canonical Warring States period is at all likely or even plausible given what follows.
