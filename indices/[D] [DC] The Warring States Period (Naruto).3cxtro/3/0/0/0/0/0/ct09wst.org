  I don't know how gods or demigods are supposed to explain the continuance of a feud though.
#+end_quote

I honestly can't explain anymore unless you want spoilers. Though if you don't follow the series anymore maybe that would be okay.

  In that case, why do the ninja take jobs and not the samurai?
#+end_quote

Why does the Navy take certain jobs and not the Army? Why does the CIA take certain jobs and not the FBI? You don't send a full-armoured clanking samurai with a code of honour to go assassinate a rival.

Also, there is a country run by samurai, and at least one instance in known village history where ninja and samurai fought.

  Clan leaders must be govern fairly large families (otherwise they could not sustain large causalities). They must hire themselves out to others, maintain training programs, govern their own business (because hiring oneself out is a business) and supply all of their logistics needs.
#+end_quote

Leaving aside the family (because we don't have such large families anymore), the average boarding school principal or president of a university can do all that and more. Would you hand the average principal the keys to the Oval Office? Or back to the family, do you think Don Corleone for instance would make a good president?

  Killing enemy civilians will win the war. The ninja need to get paid. If you kill the people who pay them, then they receive no money. It is much easier to kill such people than to kill the enemy ninja. Many wars have been won by destroying the logistics rather than killing the men. This should be fairly basic.
#+end_quote

It seems basic and obvious in theory, but it's laughably wrong in practice as anyone who has been touched by war will tell you.

More than two million Biafran civilians starved to death in the Nigerian Civil War. The secessionist government gave exactly zero fucks. The war continued.

Little Boy and Fat Man were far from the first bombs the U.S. dropped on civilian Japan. Hundreds of thousands were killed and a million people displaced in Tokyo alone. The Japanese government gave exactly zero fucks. The war continued. Even after the atomic bombings there were people who clamored for the war to continue.

I could keep giving examples, but you probably get the point. And this was in recent fairly democratic history, not a feudal-style system where 99% of the population might as well have not existed for all the nobles cared. Killing civilians would not stop the hired military from getting paid because the civilians you're killing aren't the ones who hold the money. And the clans are intelligent enough to guard the ones who /do/ hold the money - the daimyou and noble houses. Even if you did manage to off the daimyou, another would rise in his place and the enemy clan would still get paid, because they would still want the money. They don't stop needing it because completely replaceable civilians are dead.

All this doesn't even count for the fact that elite ninja are a very, very tiny subset of the population.

  Hiring a ninja permanently simply means that a continuous contract is in effect for the individuals involved.
#+end_quote

When you're a mercenary, continuous contracts are not something you get into because they offer you no benefit. A day will come when someone will offer you an incentive to turn on your employer, and on that day said contract would be worth less than toilet paper. Also, for the contract to mean anything the clan would have to be on permament call to one employer, which isn't an economically sound decision unless said employer is the daimyou or someone equally as powerful. And that still depends on the employer's willingness to put their longterm trust in people whose very job description is deception and assassination.

#+begin_quote
  As for losses of permanent ninja, you are not considering the loss due to outside factors. Ninja that attack a clan simply because it has a permanent contract will incur a loss of men. That loss could only be justified if it led to gaining a contract of their own. But there is no reason to believe that it would. You can have hatred in your world, but I do not see how your parties are acting rationally.
#+end_quote

Of course they're not attacking a clan simply because it has a permanent contract. They would attack the clan in a show of military might. They would attack the clan to weaken their opposition. They would attack the clan because its employers have something they want. They would attack the clan because they're paid to. In short, when a clan permanently attaches itself to one employer it assumes responsibility for all said employer's problems, and loses its ability to wash its hands of those problems it's not interested in. And vice versa - it's a cycle, which is evident in the manga now that the villages are permanently employed by their countries' governments. The daimyou became targets in a conflict that really had nothing at all to do with them, and the villages had to devote precious manpower into hiding and protecting them.

There is also the fact that shinobi are secretive by nature, and by permanently attaching yourself to one employer you might as well be handing out calling cards to your enemies.

#+begin_quote
  In fact ninja are not like Marines.
#+end_quote

I was referring to the physical danger part. Ninja do not exist in our universe, so they're irrelevant to the fact that probably none of us here would take our chances in a ring with a Marine. And all those things you list them as not doing, they do not do /by choice/, much like the shinobi village system. Not just the Marines - the Armed Forces as a whole are only beholden to the government by choice, because as has been proven time and time again in coup after coup that the civilian government would (physically) not stand a chance if the armed forces /did/ decide to disobey orders. They /could/ take their funds by force, they /could/ reject the government's rule, they already do determine their own training and standards, they /could/ sell themselves to the highest bidder, and we all would be powerless to stop them...but for the most part *they don't*. Because for the most part they're intelligent enough to foresee the damage it would do, and because they already exist in a positively symbiotic relationship with the civilian government. /Just like the villages and the Great Countries/.

  I do not think that the canonical Warring States period is at all likely or even plausible given what follows.

Have you completed the series? Because that's an odd assessment to make if you haven't.
