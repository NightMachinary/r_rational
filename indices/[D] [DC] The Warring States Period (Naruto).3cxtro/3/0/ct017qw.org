All that's been explained in the manga.

The major clans in the Land of Fire fight because of their ancestors' feud. Sure no-one alive knew exactly why the fighting started, but by then there was enough pain on both sides to support the wars without a reason.

Also, shinobi are a small population of the countries they live in. The countries were established long, long before the villages, possibly even before the first human gained chakra (that's also covered). The villages are astonishingly new - Konoha, the first of them, was formed only about sixty or so years before the current time - and they were the ones to align themselves with the countries and not the other way round. For instance the daimyou demands that they select a representative for him to deal with, and that's how the Hokage seat was born.

Civilians had already been using shinobi clans to fight their own wars for years, and that too was an element of the Warring States (IIRC someone even said that if one faction hired the Senju, the other would hire the Uchiha), so that too played a part in the constant wars. They were pitted against each other by outside forces, and they all preemptively tried to destroy each other to remain top military dog and ensure they were hired.
