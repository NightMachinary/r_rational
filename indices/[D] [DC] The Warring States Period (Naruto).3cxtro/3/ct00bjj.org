One of my questions is the reason behind the warfare. Is this set in an alternate universe version of Japan? If so, then many of the drivers behind that feudal warfare must also exist. If not, then why exactly are they fighting each other?

They cannot be fighting because "we have always fought" or because "we hate them". Those reasons would simply not sustain the fighting. People would get tired of war and stop fighting. So there needs to be some reason behind all of this.

My other question is why we are supposing that countries exist at all? If various clans are all fighting each other, how could a country exist without immediately being attacked by the ninja within it? If they are not attacking it, then why do they permit such fighting to occur? It makes far more sense if the countries do not exist at all (or only in embryonic form).
