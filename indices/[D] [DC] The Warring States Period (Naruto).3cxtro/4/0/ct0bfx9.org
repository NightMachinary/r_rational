In my fic?

Yes, there are feudal lords. They have several choices in military forces: there are samurai, monks, classically trained ninja (in clans), and miscellaneous groups who use powers that aren't readily classifiable. The samurai form the bulk of the standing military. The ninja clans are essentially mercenaries for hire and their numbers are tiny next to the general population. The monks have taken a pacifist stance, but they impart their techniques to anyone who comes to their temples with an open mind and heart (don't try attacking them though. Seriously. It will not end well). The miscellaneous groups mostly cause trouble, though there is a faction that tries to stand up for the lower classes who've been constantly screwed over by the wars.

The countries do fight their own wars, sometimes in parallel and sometimes not. When the wars aren't parallel it's a tense time for all. In my fic's very recent past one such conflict of interest led to a civil war - ninja against the government - in the Land of Wind, which has left them extremely weak. The Land of Earth wants to use the chance to overwhelm the country, but the Land of Fire's daimyou is sympathetic because his son is married to Wind's princess (and also he has a vested interest in the cuts he gets from Wind's gold mines). But most of Fire's clans are currently too busy clawing at each other to notice or care, and he can't compensate for their absence by deploying more samurai because the country would be open to possible invasion by Lightning or Water.

...yeah, this is why I loved this period in the first place. So many possibilities.
