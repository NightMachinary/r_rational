I'd be interested to see the political ramifications where moderately-sized countries and some individual ninja clans are equal-sized players on the world field. How does this affect boarders and the like? If the Uchia clan is neutral to you, but lives inside your country, how do you arrange your army? It pretty much gives you an entire new front to defend. I'd expect powerful clans or alliances like Ino-Shika-Cho to act like geographical borders - two neighboring countries might draw their lines with some third ninja clan in the middle.

So much of our political theory is built on several constants in the human condition, like "any single ruler can be assassinated" and the fact no one can oppress a nation solely on their own - you normally need armies for that. These break down in settings like Naruto.
