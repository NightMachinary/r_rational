Oh believe me, this feud was not your regular feud. This was your Zeus-and-Poseidon-are-fighting sort of feud. Literally. [What we would call] gods are involved, and demigods and reincarnations too.

And no, they don't automatically rule the world. /Everyone/ (and every living thing, really) has chakra - shinobi just use it in a particular way. Samurai use it in another. The monks at the Fire Temple use it in yet another. And so on, and so forth. Plus the world is far more technologically advanced than most realize, and not every shinobi is as elite as the ones the story focuses on for narrative purposes. Even if they were the only ones who had fighting power, their lifestyle revolves around missions that are provided and paid for by wealthy clients. Sure they could just kill everyone and take their money, but that's an obviously very stupid choice economically. Kill the daimyou? And then what? They have neither the time nor the training necessary to run a country, businesses, etc. etc. And no one clan can arbitrarily impose itself as rulers of the several dozen other clans in the country, who wouldn't hesitate to team up just to tear the pretenders apart for their presumption.

Killing the enemy civilians is...rather pointless actually. It's not going to win you the war. And you'd be wasting time and resources that are better served elsewhere (and unlike modern warfare, said resources are your actual bodies) as well as leaving yourself and your strongholds open to the enemy shinobi who don't care about the civilians you're killing because they're mercenaries for hire.

And you can't hire ninja permanently because they're not lapdogs and free market forces are at work. There will always be a higher bidder, and the clans themselves will always fight to grab the interest of that highest bidder. A permanently hired clan would forever be fighting off other clans trying to take its place, as well as the usual slew of clans with grudges and so on. And its employer would forever be suffering loses thanks to the shinobi in-fighting, as well as having to pay the clan year-round even if there's no actual work to be done. Permanent employment only worked when stable enough clan alliances formed that the five blocs could mutually agree to keep to their own turfs, and even then there have been four wars in sixty years of village history.

The long and short of it is that shinobi are very much like the Marines. Sure the average Marine is physically more dangerous than 99.9% of the population, sure the average Marine could off any world leader in six different ways before breakfast, but the Marines aren't trying to take over the world are they?
