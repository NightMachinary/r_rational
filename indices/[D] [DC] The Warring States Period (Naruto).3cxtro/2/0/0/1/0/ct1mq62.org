If it takes more chakra to move/create the shadows at midday, then it could be the difference between 2 hours of practice or 30 minutes before you run out of juice. More practice means more skill. Canonically the Nara are very much weaker at midday, and there's a great deal of time spent on clever ploys to overcome this limitation.

Note I didn't said that they would never train at midday. There's only so much you can really do to overcome a hardwired genetic limitation though.
