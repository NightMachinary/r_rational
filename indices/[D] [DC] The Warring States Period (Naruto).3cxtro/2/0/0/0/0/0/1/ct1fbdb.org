  To you it doesn't, perhaps. That doesn't mean other minds can't make sense of it.
#+end_quote

Today, we feature the flavor of salt.

#+begin_quote
  For one thing, you train when you can actually train.
#+end_quote

Luckily the Nara have no trouble making shadows in daylight.

#+begin_quote
  Or do you ask why nocturnal creatures don't "train" during the day so they could hunt better at night?
#+end_quote

And ninjas are supposed to carry out missions in dawn and dusk only, forgive me.

#+begin_quote
  Short shadows aren't liabilities, because their jutsu literally extends shadows. It's a matter of convenience and practicality.
#+end_quote

Yes, and even though chakra control and jutsu proficiency is commonly accepted to be bettered when /challenged/, instead of doing what is convenient, that makes total sense to train when it is easiest.

#+begin_quote
  Or should the water-inclined clans migrate to the desert so that they can overcome the liability of not being near water?
#+end_quote

That certainly sounds like something they should have a plan for. However, as shadows are present only when given light to contrast with (otherwise a Nara would be able to control anyone outside at night), that really isn't a problem here, let alone relevant. You're retreading ground.

#+begin_quote
  Because there's no advantage whatsoever to operating while your enemies are asleep or otherwise at their most vulnerable.
#+end_quote

Even though Nara are not suited to work at night.

#+begin_quote
  perhaps the only clan that's optimised to work at night.
#+end_quote

Yes, because being able to control anyone outside at night is a reasonable and effective constraint on character power, and because there are no other kekkei genkai that help nighttime operations.

#+begin_quote
  Oh yes I forgot, there are no shadows cast between December and February in the Northern Hemisphere. And the Land of Fire is such an arctic, snow-covered wasteland.
#+end_quote

No, I'm fairly certain they would not be tired because the OP claimed that they were /adjusting their sleep schedules to dawn and dusk,/ which would be a much more relaxed schedule in the winter.
