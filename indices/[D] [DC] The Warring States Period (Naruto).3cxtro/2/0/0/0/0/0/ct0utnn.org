  Why on Earth wouldn't they train when they are weakest to shore up their weaknesses?
#+end_quote

For one thing, you train when you can actually train. Just like animals hunt when they can actually hunt. Or do you ask why nocturnal creatures don't "train" during the day so they could hunt better at night? Or do you read in the dark so that you can see better in the light?

  If a short shadow is really such a trouble to them then shouldn't they be making sure it is as small a liability as possible?
#+end_quote

Short shadows aren't liabilities, because their jutsu literally extends shadows. It's a matter of convenience and practicality. You go where your element is. Or should the water-inclined clans migrate to the desert so that they can overcome the liability of not being near water?

  How would they get hired for missions if they weren't able to fight in the daytime?
#+end_quote

Because all missions ever must be executed in the daytime. Because there's no advantage whatsoever to operating while your enemies are asleep or otherwise at their most vulnerable. Because there's no benefit whatsoever in being perhaps the only clan that's optimised to work at night. /s

  Not to mention that Nara would then not be tired during winter.

Oh yes I forgot, there are no shadows cast between December and February in the Northern Hemisphere. And the Land *of Fire* is such an arctic, snow-covered wasteland.
