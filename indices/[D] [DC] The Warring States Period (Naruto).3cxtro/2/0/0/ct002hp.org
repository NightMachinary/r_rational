On the subject of the Nara, my favourite headcanon is that the Nara aren't actually lazy, they're napping all the time because they are tired. Why are they tired? Because they train every dawn and dusk because those are the optimal times for long shadows for their clan techniques. You'd nap during the day too if you were missing that much sleep.
