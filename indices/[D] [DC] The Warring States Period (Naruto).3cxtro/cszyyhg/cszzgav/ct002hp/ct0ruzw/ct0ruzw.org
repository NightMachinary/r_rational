Why on Earth wouldn't they train when they are weakest to shore up their weaknesses? If a short shadow is really such a trouble to them then shouldn't they be making sure it is as small a liability as possible? How would they get hired for missions if they weren't able to fight in the daytime? Not to mention that Nara would then not be tired during winter.
