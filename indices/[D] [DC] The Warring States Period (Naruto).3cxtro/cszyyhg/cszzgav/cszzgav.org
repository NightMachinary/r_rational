OH GOD, NOT THE SMOKE CLAN. Anything but the smoke clan, anything!

I'd almost completely forgotten about the Kurama clan! I can't remember her name but I know she could kill people with her paintings. That was such a cool ability. And now my mind is in overdrive trying to think of a plausible connection between them and the Kyuubi - it's too much of a coincidence to pass up, and it's been done in canon before (with the Kaguya clan).

But even beyond filler, it's so disorienting when there's no mention of the Hyuuga, Sarutobi, Nara, etc. for thousands of words and then suddenly they're all happily trooping in to this village built by a man they've never had any dealings with apparently.
