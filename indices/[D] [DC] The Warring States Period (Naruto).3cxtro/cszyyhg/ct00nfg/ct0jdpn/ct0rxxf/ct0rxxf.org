  "All of the technology we use is summoned, then we use it until it breaks. It all comes out of parallel dimensions or stuff, like your giant toads. No one knows how to create those things, and we don't exactly have good control over what we get, either. We just try to make do with what does arrive. Asking for reliable large-scale equipment networks made out of the patchwork stuff that does arrive is out of the question. About the best we can do is keep our batteries charged. Heck, half of what we summon is mismatched socks!"
