My favourite explanation for the naruto tech level is that "The Era of Samurai" was actually modern Japan, but along comes Rabbit-sama and reduces everything that even vaguely threatens her to ash. And, like most dictators, immediately kills all the intellectuals to prevent uprisings.

This means that we have the scattered remains of modern technology and science, but no modern weapons (which Kaguya wasn't sure she would be perfectly safe from if she allowed them to exist), and no one who remembers how to build them because all the teachers, scientists, and engineers were culled.

Eventually, people start reverse engineering the principles of electronics from fridges and microwaves that Kaguya didn't destroy because they weren't threatening, and medical science has continued unimpeded (why would Kaguya fear the presence of /doctors/?), reaching a stage where genetics and cloning are much better understood than they are now, even if most of science has been lost and humanity hasn't quite recovered it yet.
