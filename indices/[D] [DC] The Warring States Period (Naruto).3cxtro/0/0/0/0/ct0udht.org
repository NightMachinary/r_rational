I'm seventeen. I've built every computer I own.

Science fairs, Maker Faire events, even on YouTube. Half the people you see working with Arduinos or Raspberry Pis or starter drone kits are teenagers.

These days everything comes in pre-soldered easy-to-snap-together parts. Motherboards usually come with a CPU. Graphics card, RAM, sound card, Ethernet chip, wireless module if you're so inclined, SSDs, et cetera - all of those come in PCIe cards. You quite literally slot the tab into the hole and that's it.

Parts. Manual. It's not that difficult. On the other hand, it's quite easy to slip into the "everyone is dumb but us" mentality.

I said *the Internet*. Since, apparently, pedantry is a given, *the World Wide Web*.
