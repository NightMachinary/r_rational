  its tech blown up a long time ago

...was a conflation with a different post. Please ignore.

As to the 'what tech levels don't make sense'...any of them! Why do ninja fight with knives instead of guns? Why do ninja travel on foot instead of in railroads? Where are the chip fabs that those computers come from? Why are there computers and bluetooth-esque radio earpieces but no cars? Where does their electricity come from -- an electrical plant is a pretty big deal from a tech perspective? Also, I don't recall the answer to this one: did Konoha have any form of street lighting? If not, why not?

My questions about the outboard motor still stand.

The simple truth is that the Naruto-verse runs on Rule of Cool, and Kishimoto just makes stuff up as he goes along. I'm totally fine with that -- Rule of Cool makes for great stories. There just needs to be a spade named spade.
