  Some ninja can blow shit up with their hands, sure. Not all. Certainly not genin.
#+end_quote

There's this miraculous thing called an explosive seal tag. Also obligatory reminder that "genin" is a rank and not a measure of ability, that much of the cast were genin for over a third of the series, and that the main character was a genin as of the penultimate chapter in the series.

  A Barret M82 rifle has an effective range of over a mile.

This is such an absurd argument - do you honestly not sense the hindsight bias dripping from it? You're waving a product honed and refined over a millennium of iterations as "proof" that its predecessors should have been invented. Let's talk about the earliest iteration of the gun - what's the effective range of a fire lance? How much power does it pack? How efficient are its ballistics? What significant advantage does it have in the hands of a sniper? Can you give me a single reason why ninja society would invent the fire lance - and this is proceeding on the massive assumption that circumstances were coincidentally similar enough for them to have discovered gunpowder in the first place?

And the rest of your argument equally ignores the proficiency with projectiles, stealth, silent killing, reflexes, durability bordering on the absurd, and extreme versatility that chakra confers and/or enhances, instead boiling down all of that to "giant water dragons". Because big flashy jutsu are the only thing chakra is used for.

It's really funny that you can't see how mind-numbingly coincidental the discoveries and inventions humanity prides itself on are. It's even funnier that you expect those coincidences to extend themselves to an alternate universe and somehow believe that would be in rational in any way.

  Again, why burn the chakra? A train can transport large amounts of people and cargo; a group of ninja can't.

Did you read/watch the same series? The one where you can summon things across continents or seal them in scrolls that fit in your pocket, or was that just me?

And the rest of the train argument does the same as the gun one: flatly ignoring the aspects of the series that contradict your point. Because the very first arc of the series definitely didn't include people availing themselves of motorized transport, the technology of which I'm completely sure was limited to that one boat. Also ninjas are not obsessed with secrecy or clandestine work and would clearly be better served by traveling on documented, public transport rather than untraceable means, plus they'd certainly not object to having railroad lines laid to all their secret locations. They really don't have any interest in keeping the landscape uncharted to anyone but themselves, do they?

Also what the hell is a Land of Snow and why am I supposed to care about it?

  I didn't expect Konoha to have a chip fab. My question is: in canon what do we ever see that would constitute significant modern industry, much less something as sophisticated as laptop-building equipment?
#+end_quote

I don't know, I thought the fast foods, TVs, electric power, VCRs, wireless technology, and the computers they were using were a clue. But then again perhaps that's just me, I like to infer things from the details I'm given and I thought the existence of a computer industry was glaringly obvious from the fact that there was a laptop there.

  My point is that the tech is inappropriately dispersed
#+end_quote

What connection is there between (a) tiny outboard, which runs on fuel that can be purchased or pilfered when needed and can be rowed the rest of the time, and (b) electric lights that depend on (usually government-owned) extensive infrastructure and attract potentially exorbitant bills and taxes? That's about the worst example you could have given. What tech were you expecting to see?

  Do you really think, though, that he stopped to work out the economics?
#+end_quote

So basically because he's a comic book artist he's not conscientious or smart enough to plan out his world? Because he's writing a story for preteens he couldn't think of what elements surround that story, or work out what its world was going to be like?

I didn't know the wiki was named "Masashi Kishimoto", "Shounen Jump" or even "Studio Pierrot". Also I didn't know playing fast and loose with your plot over *fifteen years* of weekly serialized writing meant you never give a thought to its setting. Did I say it was carefully woven or carefully preplanned? I said it /makes sense/, which is something any author worth their salt (and Kishimoto is no less an author for being a mangaka) ensures in their writing.
