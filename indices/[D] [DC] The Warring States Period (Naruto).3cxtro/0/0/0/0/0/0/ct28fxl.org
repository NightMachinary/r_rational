Ummm...I'm not sure what exactly you're addressing? Because I never said the Narutoverse ever had its tech blown up or that it's in any way related to our Earth.

And what tech levels are hard to justify? Their world is almost entirely modern, apart from things ninja would shy away from (e.g. the Internet) or have no need for (advanced medical tech).

Edit: re the computer issue, those parts are available pre-fabricated in stores all across the world. Beyond that, every other home in the developed world already has a computer old or new lying around. So merely destroying a chip fab does not leave humanity thrown for a loop: unless Kaguya went across the world destroying every single store and every single warehouse and every single home that had a PC, computing tech wouldn't disappear. Sure there might be no more development, but the computers we have now work perfectly well, no?
