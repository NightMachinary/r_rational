There's a huge difference between "can snap together chips" and "computers can be built." You didn't build the chips in your computer -- that required a chip fab, which is at the top of a very large tech tree. If that tree exists then the Naruto-verse tech levels are hard to justify.

There's other problems too. For example, the outboard motor in the Wave arc -- Wave was a very poor country at the time, so how did they have this motor? Either they are very cheap, which implies mass production and another tall tech tree, or this was a rare and therefore expensive thing, so how did a random fisherman have one? Well, maybe the village clubbed up to buy the outboard. Okay, where does the gasoline come from? Why did they buy this thing in the first place? For sustenance-level small-village fishing, you don't need a motor. A sail and/or oars will do just fine.

Computers, cameras, digital read-outs, radio headsets, and something that looks like either a radar dish or, FSM forbid, a satellite dish. None of these things work for a civilization that has had its tech blown up a long time ago.

If you can get computers and networks, the Web is relatively easy, although bandwidth is problematic -- there's not going to be a lot of fibre optic cable around, so you're limited to copper, and it needs to be laid over long distances, or you need radio relays. Either way, not easy.
