I don't know, 1000 years is a bloody long time for people to have just come up to the level of electronics we had decades ago. The "no-one remembers how to build them" plotline doesn't really work in our world anymore, what with the Internet and books and even the level of education - a fairly intelligent high schooler could put together a working computer if given the tools. Intellectuals no longer hold all the knowledge in society.

Also their world didn't have a moon until Kaguya came along, so that's Earth pretty much ruled out. Besides, I think the Japanese would have noticed a giant ancient tree that bloomed and fruited only once every thousand years, no?

Personally I think the "schizo tech" is very simply explained by the fact that technology develops according to necessity. A society with people that can accurately diagnose you by passing their hands over your body will never develop an MRI. A society whose livelihood is built on secrets, deception and murder would balk at the idea of the Internet. And so on. There is also the problem of the minds who invented/discovered certain things just not being there.
