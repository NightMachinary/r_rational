Yeah, but we also know that massed “adequate” mages were a new legion tactic. A few dozen high quality mages might be a significant quantity because they are skilled, but these are a lot of people who need the full strength of their fingers back after walking through winter cold for days with them broken.

I'm not saying it can't be done, but they're out of the fight for quite some time.
