Especially note the 'weapons' part.

Horsebowmen require completely different forms of bow than foot archers. In addition, they are special elite troops of a nation, they have specific gear, most likely made for them by that nation. They can't just pick up longbows and go at it, and even the short bows some infantry might use will likely be inferior. (The Mongols, for instance, had a special kind of recurve bow that only they made and used, using a European shortbow would be a downgrade.)

Unless the Tyrant brought backup weapons for them planning on just something like this to happen, they are pretty much done unless they can get resupplied from Helike, and anyone in the way will happily ambush their supply train... so to truly fix the problem, they'd have to spread themselves out and get slaughtered or move the entire army back home.
