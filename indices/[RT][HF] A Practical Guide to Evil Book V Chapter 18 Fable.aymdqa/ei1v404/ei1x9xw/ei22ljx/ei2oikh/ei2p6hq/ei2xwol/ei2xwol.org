  What Black changed with the Reforms is how they are trained and used.

Right. In other nations, the mages and priests are individuals with their own skill sets and unique training and aptitude. Some might be really good and some might be terrible. What Black did was standardize the mage training curriculum to focus on specific spells and rituals that even the worst mages can take part in and were designed for open combat. This standardization made the mages interchangeable and allowed commanders to always know and predict what kind of spells they'll have access to in every encounter at the cost of flexibility.
