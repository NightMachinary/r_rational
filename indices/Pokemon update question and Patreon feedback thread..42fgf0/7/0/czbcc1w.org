Hmmm... That is an interesting question actually. How far will an average person go without context? The story in question I feel I would be above average, as I enjoyed the chapters leading up to it (mostly anyway, I'm halfheartedly reading and skipping leaf's reporter section) Is there a report/experiment somewhere that gives guidelines on how long the average person will read on something without a payout?
