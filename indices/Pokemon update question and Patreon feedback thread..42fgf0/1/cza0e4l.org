I'd go with the clarity option. Research has shown that readers actual enjoy stories MORE when given spoilers, and so given that the extra clarity your considering is somewhat spoiler-esque, I think it's the better route overall.

[[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/soc/2011_08spoilers.asp][Spoiler Study]]

There is probably a valid concern that your audience is far from a normal, regular audience here. That said, it seems the base rate for spoiled > not-spoiled is quite high. In the study, 8 out of 12 stories benefited in a statistically significant way, 3 benefitted but weren't statistically significant, and one was hindered but also not statistically significant.

It seems like given the audience, you'd have to have pretty compelling evidence that we're more anti-spoiler then average to bet on obfuscation as a strategy.

EDIT: Reading this again, I think I probably overstated how widely the research is actually applicable. They certainly found the result in some contexts, but while the question your asking is similar, there are certainly differences as well. So yea, I'm acknowledging that.
