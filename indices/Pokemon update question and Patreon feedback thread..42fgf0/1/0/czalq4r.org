It's an interesting study that I've looked askance at in the past, probably because my own personal experience is that spoilers /heavily/ reduce my enjoyment of stories... or more accurately, having as little information as possible and going into a book or movie blind have incredibly enhanced the experience.

That said, I think this is case where the ambiguity and mystery might be legitimately frustrating to read without understanding what's going on, which may make a big difference in determining how useful the spoil is to the enjoyment.
