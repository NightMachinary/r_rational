I think that a study on fiction in general wouldn't necessarily apply equally to all forms of fiction. One of the hallmarks of rationalfic is that the reader is given enough data to sort of "follow along" with the protagonists and figure things out. If we know the answer ahead of time, we don't get to do that.

I'd say err on the side of mystery, and we'll let you know if you go too far. :D
