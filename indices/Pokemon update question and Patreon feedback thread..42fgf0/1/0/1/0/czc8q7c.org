I think that is something that will differ from person to person. I don't say this as a brag, it's more of a curse than anything, but I'm exceptionally good at inferring the patterns in stories. It's not through conscious expenditure of time or effort, the predictions just pop into my head as I watch/read, and it makes it very hard to ever be surprised by traditional media. It's gotten so bad that I stopped watching trailers or reading the backs of books, because even the slightest of hints makes it easier to predict things.

Part of the reason I've enjoyed fanfiction so much (or certain kinds anyway, HPMOR was my first and set a rather high bar) is that they are far less predictable, and thus far more enjoyable to me, since I can genuinely experience the "not knowing what will happen next" thing. So maybe I'm overvaluing how much a mysterious reveal would matter to other readers, and think I'll end up just naming it the full title.
