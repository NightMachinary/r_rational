Interesting, because it's totally different for me. With the volume of data I have to crawl through each day I've had to develop heuristics for quickly assessing the quality of the work and my predicition of how well I'm going to enjoy it, so it's better to give me more spoilers - hell the only reason I gave 'Blindsight' a second chance was because in some article there was a dialogue directly from the latter parts of the book where things get interesting and an analysis of why it's interesting.

For me I need some sort of anchor, something motivating me to move forward and keep reading - and spoilers definitely work for that.
