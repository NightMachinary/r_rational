That's exactly right, but if possible I'd like to assure you that since I doubt there would ever be enough income from that system to be considered a significant part of my income, it wouldn't particularly incentivize me to write faster, since my current writing schedule is based off of my free time, and I would preaumably still be working my 50+ hours a week day/night job.

In addition, I'm also happy to avoid the chance for an incentive to sacrifice quality of writing for quantity. As much as my readers want to see what happens next in the story, believe me when I say that I want to write it. But unlike most projects I've worked on, this one takes an inordinate amount of research and thought, and I want to make sure it's as rational as I can make it.

So for now I publish monthly and set the Patreon to monthly, as that's the safest option legally and it fits the current pace of my forseeable writing schedule.
