Agreed especially on the last point, however considering the main character is specifically familiar with the experience of writing a serial it does seem to me to be evidence in favour of the author having written something else prior.

The account only talks in Parahumans and only posts their story here in [[/r/rational]] is the kind of half hearted cover up a throwaway attempt I'd expect from someone aware of crj.

But yeah I didn't go stalking the entire profile as I'm not that invested, just ideal speculation
