The psuedonym thing has been discussed in some detail over on the Alexander Wales Discord server, which now has a dedicated channel for this story - it was a while back, but the author themself has stated on multiple occasions that their only previous writing has been short prompt responses and the like under throwaway names and other unpublished work.

While recent updates have proven their willingness to flat-out lie to their readers if they think it'll make the story better, it still seems more likely that they're telling truth in this case (as they seem to do in most cases - remember, this isn't some throwaway account, but one that regulaly participates in discussions on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] and elsewhere). People have generally remarked that this doesn't "read" like someone's first serial, but that can easily explained by experience both reading and (privately) writing. Between the CRJ/AW reveal and the EY hunt, I think we're all kinda primed to just assume "if it's good, it's gotta be written by someone we know" - maybe not the best mentality to have?
