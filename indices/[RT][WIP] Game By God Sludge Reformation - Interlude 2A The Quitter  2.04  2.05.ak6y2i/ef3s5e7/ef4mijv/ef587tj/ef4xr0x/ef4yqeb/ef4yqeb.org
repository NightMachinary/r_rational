I don't think it's EY. Teddy3 loves their mystery visual novels. I've never seen EY talk about any of them, and EY loves recommending stuff he likes.

Teddy also actively denied they were EY or AW when asked, which is something EY would also never do.

From several conversations, I think they're either actually new or someone who doesn't have much of an established fanbase here (could be one of the writing contest regulars I suppose). I know the serial writer backstory implies otherwise, but it's not a self insert and it's not like serial writers actually have panels at conventions, so it's not hugely realistic in the first place.
