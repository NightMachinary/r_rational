The fact that By herself is a web serial writer is certainly relevant - I think one of the central questions of the story is whether not GBG is analogous to By's /Space Attorney/ (first web serial that garners a small following but ends poorly) or /Ionia of Illumination/ (more experienced work that ends well).

Honestly, that's why I'm invested in this thing. For most web fiction, the persona of the author itself and the way the story's written and released don't really factor into the story itself - but here, GBG-the-story, GBG-the-game and /Space Attorney/Ionia/ are kind of all one and the same.
