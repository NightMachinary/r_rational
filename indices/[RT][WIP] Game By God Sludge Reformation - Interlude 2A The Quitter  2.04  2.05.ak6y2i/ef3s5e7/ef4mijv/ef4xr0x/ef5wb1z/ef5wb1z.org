Should've added that I've seen them knocking about in the Parahumans Discord too, and I think in the comments of Ward (though I might be misremembering). I dunno, I'm just inclined to think they're a lurker, someone who's been aware enough of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but mostly participating in other stuff (say, Danganronpa-esque mysteries) - a reader who only felt the need to start joining discussions once they got thinking about writing a serial of their own. It's a bit of a trap to point at the story itself for evidence, but I think in "The Absurdist" By describes her own relationship with the community in those sorts of terms. So that's another layer to it.
