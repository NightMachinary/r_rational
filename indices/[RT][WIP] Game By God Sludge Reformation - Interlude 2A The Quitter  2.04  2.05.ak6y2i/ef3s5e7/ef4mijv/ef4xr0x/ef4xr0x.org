Hm? "u/teddy_teddy_teddy" is a three-months-old account whose activity prior to /Game by God/'s start consisted of starting one thread on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] and responding to two comments in it. Since then, it left replies in seven [[/r/parahuman][r/parahuman]] threads, wrote six snippets on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]], and made one response to a [[/r/offmychest][r/offmychest]] thread. The rest of its activity is directly related to /Game by God/.

Unless I missed something, it's /very clearly/ a throwaway account.

Personally, I don't think teddy_teddy_teddy is Wildbow or Wales, because they're busy with /Ward/ and /WtC/ respectively (as well as for several other reasons). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6749809/Bavitz][Bavitz]] seems possible; the style is different and we've never seen "Bavitz" directly interact with the rationalsphere, but we've semi-frequently discussed his (?) works on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], he is known for employing pseudonyms, and the meta parts are something I could see him doing.

Mainly, I suspect Yudkowsky. This whole "untrustworthy author" shtick seems in-character for him, he isn't busy with anything else (except working on small-time stuff like the AI alignment problem), he has claimed to employ pseudonyms, and I don't see any concrete arguments /against/ this possibility sans those based on prior probabilities.

It's entirely possible, of course --- even /likely/ --- that "u/teddy_teddy_teddy" is a throwaway account of some other r/rationalist. I have several suspects, in fact.
