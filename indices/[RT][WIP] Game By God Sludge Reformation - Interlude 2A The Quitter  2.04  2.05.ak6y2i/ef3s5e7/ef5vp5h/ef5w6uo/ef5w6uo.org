  By's definition of abuse is probably much more broad, she seems inclined to look at commenters in a very uncharitable way. Expecting anyone to stay completely objective about this sort of thing after years of solo moderating an active comments section might be unfair though.

Certainly don't think it's out of character for her just an interesting point.

  I think it can go as far as to be abuse, sometimes. To take the opposite extreme example, the Nazi commenter who complains about a mixed race couple. Once they're told "thanks but fuck off with the racism" if they keep harping on the point I think I'd call that abuse.

Personally I don't think that's abuse still. If they get banned and they circumvent a ban to continue posting I would absolutely agree that that's abuse.

Certainly even if I was to say it was abuse it wouldn't be that the act of wanting something moved in a direction to fit your views is an abuse of the ability to comment or leave feedback but that repeatedly doing something when informed not to is more abusive of the system.
