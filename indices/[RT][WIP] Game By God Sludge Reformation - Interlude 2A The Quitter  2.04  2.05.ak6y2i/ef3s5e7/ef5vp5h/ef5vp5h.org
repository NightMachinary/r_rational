  Am I the only one getting an AR feeling from this like when people find a secret message in video games making them go to some website where they deduce a code that gives them the date of the next sequel or what have you?

Yeah, that URL is so god damn weird and I can't help but feel like it'll be relevant.

  Do you think this counts as abuse?
#+end_quote

I think it can go as far as to be abuse, sometimes. To take the opposite extreme example, the Nazi commenter who complains about a mixed race couple. Once they're told "thanks but fuck off with the racism" if they keep harping on the point I think I'd call that abuse.

By's definition of abuse is probably much more broad, she seems inclined to look at commenters in a very uncharitable way. Expecting anyone to stay completely objective about this sort of thing after years of solo moderating an active comments section might be unfair though.
