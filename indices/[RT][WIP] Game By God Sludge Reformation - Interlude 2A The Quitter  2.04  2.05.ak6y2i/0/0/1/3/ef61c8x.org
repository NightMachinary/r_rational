  Mainly, I suspect Yudkowsky.

I have no idea why people keep suspecting Yud for all of these stories. He has such a consistent style in all of his work and this story, like every other story written under a pseudonym suspected of being his bar hpmor, does not have a shred of it.

Even when Yud is trying to imitate someone else's style as in Trust in God or something it's still blatant.

I love Bavitz but it's clearly not them either.
