I'm enjoying this story and I have some thoughts.

My new position is that this entire story was designed just for very tangential meta commentary about web serials.

Am I the only one getting an AR feeling from this like when people find a secret message in video games making them go to some website where they deduce a code that gives them the date of the next sequel or what have you?

In particular I imagine no one here at this point now believes the author to be a newcomer. Web serials are tough, I think the first web serial someone writes is usually obviously their first. Who wants to start a prediction market with what author this turns out to be?

Perhaps due to this communities particular love of psuedonyms I have scaled up by probabilities too high.

Also to raise a conversation:

#+begin_quote
  there were always people who'd try to abuse that direct contact to move the serial into a direction more suited to their views.
#+end_quote

Do you think this counts as abuse? It seems to me people have an obligation to their views/themselves to make the world more in line with it. It's most obvious if you use an extreme example so say you were reading some Nazi apologists work, is it an abuse of the web serial medium to comment on it saying you'd prefer the story to contain less apologia for the holocaust?
