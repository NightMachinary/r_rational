Where does the money come from? If it appears from nowhere when the transaction is made then it could be used to make trillions with automatic transactions, if it causes people to overvalue units by that amount that is still exploitable but it's a bit hard to think of an ethical way. Actually that first one would bring the feds down on their heads pretty much instantly for printing money. Would Bitcoin work? If so would that imply it could be exploited for P=NP computing?
