Well, they had a similar situation with the bathroom. It was 1) transforming raw matter into a form that would presumably have a higher market price. 2) But it was also disappearing once taken out.

So if 1) is true then cheap ben would turn into a $15 pen. If 2) is true is would turn back once taken of the property.

The wording of bathroom one and this one are different though so 2 might not apply.
