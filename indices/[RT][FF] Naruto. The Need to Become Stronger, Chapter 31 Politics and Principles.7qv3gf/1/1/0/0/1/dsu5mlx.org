  One last question, that's been kind of burning on my mind. Why is Naruto such as asshole? He definitely comes across as one. I enjoy his plausible change in intelligence, but his cowardice in wave combined with his putdown of Lee are against the core principles of his charactered. Those are unfettered idealism supported by incredible charisma and an ironclad will.
