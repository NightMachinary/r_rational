First of all, before I respond, I do want to say that I enjoy your fic a lot. It's well written and your world building is excellent.

In the wave mission, I'm referring to how after Naruto convinces everyone to fight, he and his clones needed to be prodded into actually fighting, and not harrassing enemies from behind barriers.

I do see a lot of canon Naruto, but the part that bothered me was how he talked down to Hinata/Tenten/Lee. That really didn't feel like anything canon Naruto would do on any day.

Last, I unfortunately never quite liked HPMoR or HJPEV, so I can see what you're saying. Keep up the good work though, and I look forward to the next chapter.
