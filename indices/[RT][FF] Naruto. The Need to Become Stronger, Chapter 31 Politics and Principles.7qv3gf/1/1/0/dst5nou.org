Canon Danzo was a total moron, whose every action achieved the exact opposite of what he intended. Realistically, his portrayal here is totally in line with what someone like that would actually be like.

That said, bear in mind that all of this is from Ibiki's perspective: The fact that he thinks of Choza as a sack of blubber certainly does not mean that Choza thinks of himself that way! I've always tried in this story to show how the viewpoint character's biases colour their perceptions.

That doesn't mean however that everyone in that room is going to turn out to be a secret genius mastermind, however. In fact, that's one of the tropes I hate the most in common rationalist works. In my view, the defining feature of rationalist fiction is realism, not intelligence: The kind of story where everyone has to be a secret Machiavellian schemer in order to have any moral worth is just intelligence porn, IMO.
