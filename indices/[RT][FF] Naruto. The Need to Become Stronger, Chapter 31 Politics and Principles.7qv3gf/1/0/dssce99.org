I'm assuming stuff is going on in the background to explain this behavior that Ibiki isn't aware of.

Maybe Danzo is actually acting as "opposition" under the Hokage's orders to give him plausible deniability. Let him look like a big compassionate softy while still implementing hugely unethical things like Root.

If it turns out that nothing is really going on "Underneath the Underneath," though, I'll be pretty disappointed.
