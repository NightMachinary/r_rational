In a world where the Sharingan exists, autohypnosis of that scale would almost necessarily exist.

While it's true that we should have no expectation of anyone in a position of authority being actually competent, it is a little suspicious how Danzo is able to retain his credibility and position while being this openly hostile against the chief dictator super-ninja. It's possible that his political career was engineered by Tobirama to act as controlled opposition, but assuming that he is as dangerous as in canon I consider it likely that he's in cahoots with the Third.
