I'm hoping Danzo has a plan for that little outburst. Otherwise it's extremely OOC for a competent ninja to act that way, especially for someone that is a schemer. You actually made me sympathize for Danzo's argument though. Good job doing that. Ive never actually agreed with him in a fic before.

Question, is the Lady Chiyo feat with Tanzuka Castle from the Manga or will it be expounded upon in story?

Edit: Is it possible that he's already been compromised by whoever tried to assassinate hiruzen? Or he might be the one who tried and then used this to throw off suspicion from himself?
