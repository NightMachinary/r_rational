Honestly I didn't think this update felt very rational. Some of the characterisations were IMO underwhelming. particularly Danz≈ç, who felt somewhat juvenile with his outburst and lack of long-term outlook.

Now isn't the best time for me to go into detail, but given the whole "Hokage's house just got bombed", the characters seem to have put very little effort into thinking about ways to handle the situation that don't just amount to blaming Sand. Even if we ignore mechanically creative solutions, there's at least some unexplored freedom in the political approach.
