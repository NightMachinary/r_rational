I think we are supposed to assume that Danzo and Hiruzen have been in on it together the whole time, that is, since before Hiruzen's ascension. Ibiki isn't slightly confused that the supposed genius head of the least-secret group of secret assassins in the world can't control his temper when someone he's known for years acts exactly as expected? That must mean that this has been the norm at least as long as Ibiki could parse language, to be consistent with Ibiki's character.

There's potentially a great reason to hold mock meetings during the exams: with so many specialist sensory ninja in Konoha /openly/ that means that every single one of the council member probably has a dedicated tail. Pretending at internal unrest would be an interesting gambit, but we at least know that Ibiki isn't in on it since the narrator doesn't lie. Not to mention that they wouldn't realistically risk ad libbing it.

On that note, it's totally possible Danzo either told someone to blow up the Hokage tower and kill Hayate, or did so personally. That would be consistent with his public face as the worst schemer ever with a deep hatred of the Hokage. Unless Hayate actually arranged to be placed under the genjutsu,and it was actually performed on him days prior to muddle his thinking. There are no sufficient levels of paranoia.

EDIT - I just realized that genjutsu that fools the narrator casts everything else in doubt.
