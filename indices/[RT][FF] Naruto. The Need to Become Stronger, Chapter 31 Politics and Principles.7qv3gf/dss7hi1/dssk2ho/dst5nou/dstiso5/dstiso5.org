I understand canon Danzo was a total moron. I attribute that to Kishimoto's struggles at characterization. When introduced, he had such great potential. My disappointment with Danzo isn't due to his lack of intelligence, but rather what his position represents, and the potential of his character.

Logicall speaking, every village has a man like Danzo, who does the dirty work. A hardline conservative who's fanatic about the village. I was hoping that Danzo would be a rational character, something akin to Naruto's transformation.

So, the reason I point out Choza isn't due to Ibiki's observations, but the dialogue.

  Sure enough, the massive man turned to the Nara clan head sitting next to him, sweat pouring from his forehead in litres. "Ah, Shikaku. What uh, what do you think? How I should vote, I mean."

A self-confident man can still be indecisive. "Hmmm, what are your thoughts Shikaku", something along those lines. Or, are you suggesting that Ibiki is an unreliable narrator to the point that his observation of dialogue is colored?

One last question, that's been kind of burning on my mind. Why is Naruto such as asshole? He definitely comes across as one. I enjoy his plausible change in intelligence, but his cowardice in wave combined with his putdown of Lee are against the core principles of his charactered. Those are unfettered idealism supported by incredible charisma and an ironclad will. Also, he's a guy that goes, "fuck fate." Did he had to surrender that when he gained his intelligence?

Imo a rational story is characterized as this: "For every action, there'd a reaction." Which basically means all changes from canon have some motive to them, and every change taken has a reaction.
