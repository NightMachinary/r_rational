  Logicall speaking, every village has a man like Danzo, who does the dirty work. A hardline conservative who's fanatic about the village.

Well, I mean, Ibiki is literally the head torturer, and he's fanatically defending the village from Danzo in this very chapter.

Just because /he/ does not see himself as being similar to Danzo does not change the fact that he's basically exactly what you describe.

  So, the reason I point out Chōzaisn't due to Ibiki's observations, but the dialogue.
#+end_quote

All right, I'll try my hand at writing a (non-canon) segment from Chōza's point of view:

#+begin_quote
  The chair creaked dangerously beneath Chōza, threatening to give way beneath his prodigious weight. A single one of its legs had sprung the moment he sat down, leading him to suspect sabotage: A deliberate effort by one of the players in the room to publicly mock him for his weight reduce his standing in the eyes of others.

  But who would have done such a thing? It was not a lack of candidates that bade Chōza to wonder.

  Was it Ibiki? The scarred head of torture and interrogation had been less than subtle in applying his pressure as of late, regaling him at every opportunity with stories of how he had entertained his 'guests'. However, the misshapen man also could not afford to have Chōza as an enemy. Danzo, on the other hand, would be more than happy to get Choza to give up on politics entirely - so did that mean he was the more likely suspect?

  Chōza hated the uncertainty - hated not knowing, hated having to wonder who was friend and foe. He was a warrior at heart; at his best when he had his trusty comrades by his side, with Inoichi voice to guide him and Shikaku's strategy to advise him. Politics... was not for him.

  But he was also a loyal ninja of Konohagakure, and he'd be damned if he let himself be distracted from his duty by this academy-level bullying.

  “Very well,” the Third said, bringing Chōza back to the present. “And how does the noble Akimichi clan vote?”

  The chief torturer and the secret head of Root both turned to face him with eyes cold and dead, while the Lord Hyuga turned only ever so slightly to indicate that the Byakugan was on him too. /Don't let it get to you/, he repeated to himself. /Defer and deflect: make them think you have no agency of your own, and they'll focus their pressure on the others instead./

  He scraped his throat. “Ah, Shikaku. What uh, what do you think? How I should vote, I mean.”

  Ibiki gave him an almost theatrical look of disgust as he spoke the words, but he stuck by the plan: The Third and Shikaku would give him the chance to present his own, genuine opinion - that letting the Sand keep their army in the Village was madness - and the Lord Hyuga's vote would give the Third his win regardless.

  The chair creaked again. With a subtle handsign he activated his body-modification technique, reshaping its legs and reinforcing it with the chakra he had been pouring into it ever since he sat down. Politics might not be his element, but if they thought they could use the Lord Akamichi's own weight against him, they had another thing coming.

Again, it's not quite canon, but hopefully it shows how you should not judge a character based on a 5-minute interaction from someone else's viewpoint.

  One last question, that's been kind of burning on my mind. Why is Naruto such as asshole? He definitely comes across as one. I enjoy his plausible change in intelligence, but his cowardice in wave combined with his putdown of Lee are against the core principles of his charactered. Those are unfettered idealism supported by incredible charisma and an ironclad will. Also, he's a guy that goes, "fuck fate." Did he had to surrender that when he gained his intelligence?
#+end_quote

Sorry, but this makes zero sense to me. Naruto, a coward? In Wave??? You mean the mission where he was the only one who advocated to selflessly defend the Villagers when the others wanted to abandon them? The Wave mission, where he overcame his own sense of terror to charge into an army of brigands? Faced off against an enemy who was so far above his level he could not even touch him? Carried a civilian on his back as he ran through the snow and ice, rather than let him die? Ran /into a burning building/ for his sake? Nearly /died/ for his sake, and then even when he thought he was actually dying, all he could think was that he was that maybe there was a chance for humanity after all if he and the Kyubi could come to share their feelings?

He is EXACTLY the kind of character who says "fuck fate", and both his words and actions more than show it. He is the most heroic, most selfless character in the entire story - and all of the main characters would grudgingly admit it, to themselves if not others.

The core of his character is precisely the same as in canon: Just like Sakura says, he is impulsive, childish, doesn't think before he speaks, but is also heroic and brave as all heck. The difference vs canon - and the difference vs HPMOR for that matter - is that the rest of the world doesn't go out of their way to make him look good. Events don't set themselves up so he'll have a chance to look heroic. Things don't always work out the way he wants them to, and talk-no-jutsu simply doesn't work. The end result is that people see him the same way they would see HJPEV in real life: As bratty and annoying, but with a grudging admittance that he is also smart and heroic in his own way.

In fact... speaking of the effect of different perspectives as shown with Ibiki and Choza above, perhaps the most important point is that Naruto /doesn't/ make himself look favourable when things are written from his perspective. Precisely because he is rational, the narrator is not unreliable at all, and even goes out of its way to question his decisions. Contrast this with Sasuke's POV in Wave when the narrator was unreliable as heck, or Sakura's POV whenever Sasuke is described.
