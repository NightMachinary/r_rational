I was disappointed in Danzo as well. The feeling we got from canon Danzo was a man who schemed quietly when events didn't work in his favor. He rarely was a frothing at the mouth fanatic that would act in his dis-interest blatantly.

Personally, I think a rational Danzo would accept the decision, and then insert a ROOT shinobi into the Kazekage's retinue, or just have extra ROOT surveillance. His outburst felt quite out of character.

Choza was also a curious decision. Canon Choza has shown to be a calm and composed individual, who was quite self-assured. Not, as Ibiki put it, "a useless sack of blubber". What I don't understand, is why the need to change the character. It doesn't seem necessary for the rationality of the story the way Naruto's character change was (a change I don't agree with fully, but still understandable).
