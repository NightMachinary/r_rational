One kind of answer is that this question is what a lot of short story science fiction is all about. E.g., Asimov's stories are about the question of how people who have read science fiction stories about robots would build robots. He was bored of Frankenstein stories where a robot turns on its master for no reason, so he came up with the three laws.

It's cliche to say that stories are about conflict, but it's also cliche to walk on your feet instead of your hands. So the story emerges when the Three Laws lead to conflict. E.g., one of the laws is to prevent humans from coming to harm, and so there's a short story where the robots won't let humans enter a radioactive area that isn't really that dangerous. So the humans disable the Third Law in one robot, and then the robopsychologist explains how easy it is to murder someone with the third law disabled. Spoilers for decades old science fiction you've already read.

So the principle of writing science fiction short stories is to think of a cool idea for a space ship, a time machine, a matter transporter, or whatever else, and then have it go wrong in some way that illustrates the significance of the idea being contemplated.

A second kind of answer is Atlas Shrugged. Show a society that is the extreme antithesis of the philosophy you want to advocate, then show how the society sucks really hard because they are so opposed to your philosophy, then show how awesome people can be when they adhere to your philosophy. This requires you to come up with a society that's the logical outcome of opposition to your philosophy and extraordinary characters who are plausibly powered by your philosophy.

A third kind of answer is that pretty much every story is about an idea. /High School Musical/ is about the idea that expressing yourself through societally unapproved ways may be the key to personal fulfillment. It achieves this by telling a story where the main conflict of the main character comes from his struggle to express himself through song when society just wants him to play basketball. Characters don't have long complicated discussions about psychology and social norms; the ideas are woven into the characters and story so that you don't necessarily notice they're present.

In the end, the answer to this question is going to be that an idea isn't a story until you have a story, so you organize a story around an idea by...organizing a story! I recall Orson Scott Card saying somewhere that he came up with the idea for the Battle Room while he was just sitting on a bench doing nothing. He wanted a story about war, decided it would be in the future, and thought about how you might train people for war in three dimensions. Once he had that idea, he did /not/ write Ender's Game. He just had an idea, nothing more. Without a character and a conflict, he didn't even have the seed of a story, just something cool to plug into his story if he ever came up with one. Nothing about the main story of Ender's Game depends on the particularities of Battle School as opposed to any other cool idea he could have come up with. Similarly, Asimov's three laws aren't specifically necessary for the main thrust of most of his stories, and Atlas Shrugged didn't need to be about Objectivism per se.

Stories come from stories, not ideas---which isn't to say you can't search for stories based on their ability to service an idea. The main emotional through-lines of HPMOR don't depend on concepts of rationality; at the same time, /Harry Potter/ fanfiction is unusually well-suited to presenting ideas that challenge our norms because the world of /Harry Potter/ is relatable enough that empathizing with Harry is easy, and it's easy to find analogues of his struggles to things that happen in our own world, but it is also alien and strange enough that we can hear Harry's argument for tearing down Azkaban without becoming defensive or biased by the status quo of our own horrible prison system.

In sum, I don't know.
