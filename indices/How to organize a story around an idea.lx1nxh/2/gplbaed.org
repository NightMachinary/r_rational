I think it depends on whether the idea is interesting for practical reasons or intellectual reasons.

--------------

If it's interesting for practical reasons, that usually means that there's something in the world which gets better when people understand it. Working backward from that can yield really really compelling stories, because the problem feels honest.

For example, the scene in HPMOR where Harry uses genetics to help Draco realize that his beliefs about pure wizarding blood being contaminated by muggles are poorly-justified. Not making mistakes like that is a real benefit of understanding genetics, so it clicks for the readers.

--------------

If it's interesting for intellectual reasons, like some philosophy topics or thought experiments, I think the best way is to embed the interesting topic in the physical world magical-realism-style, so that thinking about and interacting with this abstract topic becomes important for the characters.

For example, the recurring theme in WTC where the characters have to discuss narrative and worldbuilding because it seems to at least partially shape the physics of the world they inhabit. This lets the author put real-seeming consequences and emotional weight behind understanding these abstract topics.
