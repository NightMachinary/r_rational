Have you read Pokemon and the Origin of Species? Chapters tend to be that, the author reads some non fiction or article then has his characters talk about it and apply it in the context of the story.

​

I don't particularly enjoy this, I'd rather read non fiction, and get the information directly and a couple examples and be done, but many people do. It's a matter of taste and how you prefer to learn.

​

Other ways of doing this would be more complex, like having a theme for the story and every part of it aimed at conveying that message and theme to the reader. Literary fiction is good at that, it tends to be short too when compared to serials, because there's only so far you can stretch a theme or idea until it loses it's punch. It tends to be pretentious though, and very how do I put this? 'Look at this woman / cripple / minority in the past following his dreams and facing adversity', which I feel is very lazily trying to score 'morality points', so I can't stand most of it, the writing is good though so there's that.
