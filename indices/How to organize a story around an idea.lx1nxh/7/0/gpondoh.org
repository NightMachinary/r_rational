  It tends to be pretentious though, and very how do I put this? 'Look at this woman / cripple / minority in the past following his dreams and facing adversity', which I feel is very lazily trying to score 'morality points', so I can't stand most of it, the writing is good though so there's that.

I feel like that is a bit of a bad take. The people writing things like House of the spirits and Beloved are people writing stories to make it easier to understand a perspective. I think it's true that sometimes readers or critics take the ideas too far, like a lot of literary criticism use Marxist ideas, but overall I think overall if both sides are trying to just understand things better, literary fiction is good.
