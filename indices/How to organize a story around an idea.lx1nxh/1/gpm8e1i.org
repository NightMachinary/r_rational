In HPMOR, I almost always started by writing the events of a chapter, got to the point where something happened where it made sense for Harry to think about a principle or a cognitive bias, and then named a chapter after that. The big exception to this principle was "The Stanford Prison Experiment"* arc, which I thought was a safe bet because Harry would have to think about that at some point, right? But not until ten chapters into it did a natural opportunity come up for Harry to think about it for one sentence. Tl;dr: Targeting stories on predetermined explanations is actually super hard for me, and I get by via having so many different things I want to explain that any random story I write is liable to naturally run through one of them.
