Hmmm.... some more examples that don't perfectly fit or are categories on their own.. All just from Pokemon: Origin of Species. The categories should be more general perhaps?

1. Characters stumbling across/inventing an idea spontaneously, because it is useful for the problem they are trying to solve.example: heroic responsibility group ritual thingy after the Absol-fight

2. A character being super-confused by a complex idea and they're shown grappling with it.

example: Red running thru examples and continuously mixing up numbers till Bayes' theorem clicks

1. A character executing an idea, letting attentive reader figure out the idea on the spot. And less attentive readers getting a direct or indirect explanation afterwards.

example:Leaf entering a door, whilst putting in earplugs, so she can won't fall asleep from her Wigglytuff's "sing"-attack (for the attentive reader). Blue, his pokemon, the renegade and his Sandslash falling asleep, when she tells Wigglytuff to sing.

Aiko asking other trainers in her group for their water supplies, in the middle of a life and death fight against two Onyx. Then using them to threaten to drown the Onyx eggs, so they retreat with them instead of further engaging the group.

1. Group of characters attending a workshop and getting the idea explained to them.

2. Same group of characters then being tasked to come up with an improved version of the idea.

example: Ranger priority system workshop

---though 9 and 10 could be generalized.In "the moon is a harsh mistress", the professor explains how to run a terrorist/revolutionary cell system to minimize risk to the org, by any one cell being captured or becoming traitors. And Manwell comes up with some kind of 3d version, that's more efficient.

Though 8 could also be seens as a subset of 2.10 is kind of related to 3b, but it doesn't assume that the original idea is bad. Just that there's a better one, without the original idea being bad.

1. In Worth the Candle, they often discuss one or more alternative for a problem. Disagreeing and discussing various merits. Part of the operational planning for a magical strike team going into extremely dangerous situations.

2. Also in WTC showing weird Unicorn probability space mechanics by just showing them in the Unicorn fight. Also kind of Show, don't tell.....wait, that's actually part of 8.Ah whatever, I give up. Lists are hard.

[expressing the idea of diminishing returns, by writing so long, that you're hitting... wait that's also 12]

1. Secret antagonist writing a blog post, which helps with worldbuilding and adding depth to their character.\\
   example: Giovanni questioning whether renegades really should be always getting the death penalty, since this incentivizes them to fight life and death instead of giving up. Which could cause much more harm than otherwise.\\
   A fact that he happily exploits by regularly faking the deaths of the renegades, he's supposed to execute as a gym leader and making them his loyal employees. [or shipping them off to some other crime syndicate and receiving them, since there's actually an international renegade black job market]
