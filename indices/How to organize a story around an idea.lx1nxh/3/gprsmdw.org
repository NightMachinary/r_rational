One sub point to your point 2 is immersing the characters in a world in which the Idea is the core part of the reality, and they must interact with it.

Lately, I have been tinkering with a wilderness survival story ("What if all technology suddenly vanished, stranding humans in pristine wilderness??") and the Idea that I hammered into almost every scene is that cool-headed stoicism saves lives, while panic and irrational decisions kill you, often before you realise your mistake. The way i constructed the world the characters exist in, I can do 100% Show Don't Tell, and never have my characters pontificate or think loud about it. It is simply so that the characters who agree with the Idea tend to not die as easily, so as the plot goes on the % of stoic rationalists increases.
