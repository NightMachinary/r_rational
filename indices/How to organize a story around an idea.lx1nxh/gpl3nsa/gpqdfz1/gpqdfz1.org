  A second kind of answer is Atlas Shrugged. Show a society that is the extreme antithesis of the philosophy you want to advocate, then show how the society sucks really hard because they are so opposed to your philosophy, then show how awesome people can be when they adhere to your philosophy. This requires you to come up with a society that's the logical outcome of opposition to your philosophy and extraordinary characters who are plausibly powered by your philosophy.

My favorite Ayn Rand story is The Irregular at Magic High School, time-proven propaganda about how your life would magically be better, /somehow/, if you didn't suck so much. And also how it's a good idea to boink your sister.

It's conceptually risible within just a couple of seconds: the main character is a magic cripple, and in a logical, rational world he'd be a magic shoe shine boy for the rest of his life while the wizards with actual MP points do the important stuff. But here he somehow isn't because he's just too cool and smart. (Perhaps because he boinks his sister? I didn't explore it too deeply, but I'd have ten million times more respect for the author if that was the actual in-world reason.) Though of course all of Ayn Rand's works faithfully follow this exact template precisely, it's nothing special.

Her followers tend to be far more extreme than that though - it's often mentioned that Gravel lost second place in a libertarian presidential primary to a woman who wanted to eliminate the minimum age of consent.

Anyway, I think that's only a good example of how to sell ideology: people want to hear what they want to hear. They don't want to eat slightly less and undergo the horrific trauma of the diameter of their intestines shrinking very slightly for like four days, they want to buy a million weird tricks that don't work. (Because god knows if they worked, there wouldn't be a market for them.)
