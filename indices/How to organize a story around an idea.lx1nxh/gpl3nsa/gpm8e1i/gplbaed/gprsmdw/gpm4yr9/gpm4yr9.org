Imagine a world or a scenario where the Idea is central to how things work, in a way that is more visceral & relatable. Make that the core of your story.

For example, Ted Chiang's story /Exhalation/ takes the Idea of entropy and makes it less abstract and more visceral by inventing a world where it's about air pressure, which people have a more direct intuitive grasp of.

There are other good examples in some of Chiang's other stories, like /Hell Is the Absence of God/, and in some of EY's short stories like /The Sword of Good/ and /The Hero With A Thousand Chances/. Some of Scott's posts, like his [[https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryptocurrencies][lists of fictional X's]] also contain the seeds for these kinds of stories.

This is more straightforward to do with short stories than with longer works.
