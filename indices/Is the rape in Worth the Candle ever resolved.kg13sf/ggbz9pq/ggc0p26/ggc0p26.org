Yeah, that's fair, I was just pissed when I wrote the title. You can't edit titles through. I read the chapters ahead of myself and it seems like the author handles it well and it isn't brushed under the rug. I just saw Bethel listed as a party member in the wiki and the idea that she might stay a member drove me insane.
