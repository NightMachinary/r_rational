  Python-shell is just a repo with ~1k stars, once you start getting to the really big repos it gets rediculous. THOSUANDS of issues, weekly pull requests, dev infighting, etc... For example there was recently some drama in the [[/r/python]] community about removing the 'master slave' terminology for being offensive.

Yah, I think I'll try dumping all this on a Github later today, and see how it goes.
