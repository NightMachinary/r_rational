I would suggest reducing the rating to 3 digits. For example, "Flechette's Foodie Forays (Foodfic, Collab)" is 4.666666666666667 but it would be better represented as 4.67

I would also suggest removing the visual timing information in the search (ex: .097219 seconds) in the production website - it's useful for you as a developer but so much to the casual user.

I like your css transitions on the top menu. Cool stuff :)
