The link to actually read a story isn't really visible enough considering that a part of the site's purpose is to point people at new stories they might like.

Not issues with the site so much, but 'The Waves Arisen' doesn't have an apostrophe in the word 'Waves', and it isn't canon-compliant (a bunch of stuff works differently, most notably the Shadow Clone technique, which is introduced in the first chapter).

Also, thanks for making this, it looks really cool.
