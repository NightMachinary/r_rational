I like how quick the site feels. In the FAQ you mention that you feel that enabling people to submit works would skew the average number of reviews. Maybe you could just require users to have submitted X reviews before (or for each) work submitted.

Also, are you planning to provide public data dumps once you start doing recommendations?
