If not already present:

1) Please add an option of user-triggered data backup \ exporting (similar to goodreads --- in xls, etc).

#+begin_quote
  What genre categories are missing?
#+end_quote

2) Please add an options for creating custom categories, tags, or both.

#+begin_quote
  How much should I prioritize adding a main character field and pairing field to each fanfic?

  How much should I prioritize adding fandom-specific tags?
#+end_quote

These could also serve as an alternative solution to these problems

3) Maybe add an option of importing already existing, "combed-through" data from other similar platforms (e.g. goodreads, TVtropes, wikias, etc) for quicker database accumulation.
