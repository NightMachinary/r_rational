Uploading profile pictures:

- If you upload a picture that doesn't work for whatever reason, then whichever image you had before is gone and there isn't a placeholder either. You just get a blank space next to your reviews where the picture should be.

- There's no information about suitable image sizes/formats. The first image I tried didn't work (which is how I discovered the point above), and the second did, although I'm not sure why.

- When you upload a new image, the filename is shown next to the old profile picture, so there's no way to tell whether the new picture was successfully uploaded without submitting it.

Editing reviews:

- You can edit a review but not delete it (or if you can, I don't know how). I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but it means that if someone reviews the wrong fic by accident or something there's no way to remove their score, just alter it.
