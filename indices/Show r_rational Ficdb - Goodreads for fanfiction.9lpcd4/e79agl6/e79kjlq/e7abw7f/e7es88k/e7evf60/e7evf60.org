Probably being able to sort by rating. It's great to be able to go through archives and quickly find the best stuff. When I try to use fanfiction.net, I have no idea what's good or trash and just give up after 5 minutes. And having so many filter options for sorting is good too, if I not only want to find the top rated story, but the top rated Story with Twilight Sparkle that's also a Tragedy with at least 10k words, I can do that.

That feature alone would make it one of my favourite sites, but along with everything else fimfiction offers, I honestly consider it my favourite website. Not really for the content, I've moved past MLP mostly, but just all the features and the design. The only other site that comes close for me is lichess.org for playing chess.
