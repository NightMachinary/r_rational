Sounds like a good project. I recommend seeing if you can contact knighty from [[https://fimfiction.net][fimfiction.net]] to get any advice. Even if you can't, I recommend modeling your site after it as much as possible. fimfiction is my favourite website; it's brilliantly designed in how easy it is to search for stories, how often new popular stories pop up on the front page, the social media aspect of it, how easy it to navigate in general. Just a generally great 9.8/10 website(there are always things to improve on, but not much).
