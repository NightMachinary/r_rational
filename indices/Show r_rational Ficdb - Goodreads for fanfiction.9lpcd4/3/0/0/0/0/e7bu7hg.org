I manage python-shell. A lot of people don't read the readme and ask me questions instead of figuring it out themselves. Which can be annoying but it's cool seeing people are using the project so I don't mind it too much.

Python-shell is just a repo with ~1k stars, once you start getting to the really big repos it gets rediculous. THOSUANDS of issues, weekly pull requests, dev infighting, etc... For example there was recently some drama in the [[/r/python]] community about removing the 'master slave' terminology for being offensive.

But for small projects like this one I don't see any downside to open-sourcing it.
