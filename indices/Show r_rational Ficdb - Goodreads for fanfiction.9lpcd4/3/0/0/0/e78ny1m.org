What is the bad of managing an open source project? Like, I've heard that managing an open source team is like herding a pack of kittens, but what if you develop the software as you would if it were close source, except the source is available and people can make their own version if they want? As in, you (and your team?) develop the software and don't accept contributions, and if anyone wants to contribute they'll have to make their own fork.

And as someone who loves free and open source software but for some reason browses Reddit, thank you for mulling it over. lol
