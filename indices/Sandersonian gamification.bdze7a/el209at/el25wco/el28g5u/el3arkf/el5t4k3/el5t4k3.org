  What aspect(s) make a game Turing Complete?
#+end_quote

You can implement a computer/turing machine inside the game.

For an example in a card game there's [[https://www.toothycat.net/%7Ehologram/Turing/HowItWorks.html][Magic the Gathering]]:

One may set up circumstances such that if the rules are followed, a computation will be carried out, and gameplay (involving player choices) may resume after the computation is complete. (They didn't end up making this work without additional constraints like "if a card says you may do something then do it".)

How is this Turing complete? I imagine this wouldn't have been possible if there wasn't a way to produce arbitrarily large armies. (For the turing machine's infinite tape.)
