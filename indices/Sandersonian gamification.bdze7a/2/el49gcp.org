Scribblenaughts and similar games exist, as do VR headsets; I feel like it's only a matter of time before someone makes a game based on The Rithmatist.

The ultimate target, of course, would be AR headsets: imagine drawing spells in chalk on the pavement and having those come to life. But we're in very early days as far as AR goes, and the experience would be poor with the hardware we have right now.
