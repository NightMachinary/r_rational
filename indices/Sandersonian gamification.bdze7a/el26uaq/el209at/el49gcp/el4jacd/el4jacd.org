ah, AR malware. did you see this design on the packaging? that triggered the adware we installed in the root of your system at the factory!

oh, and at some point the lobyists will mandate that legally you MUST use these AR glasses. you know, for 'safety' reasons.

if we can get past the inevitable coperate cyberpunk dystopia that some people will try to force on us, AR could turn out pretty cool.
