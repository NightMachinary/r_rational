I wanted more places to discuss one of my recent favourite webnovels, so I'm going to recommend [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] again here and hopefully get more people reading.

The story takes place in an alternate universe Europe in early industrial/colonial era, and the setting is basically a mix between SCP Foundation, Bloodborne/Dark Souls, Lovecraftian horror and Dickens-lite stories. After a relatively slow start where the background of the world is methodically fleshed out (until the MC joins the equivalent of magic Scotland Yard), the plot begins accelerating from one story arc to the next with minimal filler and minimal "idiot balls required by plot".

I think one of the things I appreciate most is how the Chinese protagonist being from Earth actually is significant to the plot, both to his advantage in surviving the world of mysteries as well as in how he reacts to little things other writers usually skip over. From little things like his love for trying out local cuisines, to his empathy for colonised natives / poor washerwomen / lead-poisoned factory workers common to that era, trying his hardest not to get innocent lives involved despite that being riskier for himself and his goals, and the feeling of going home alone while gazing out at the stars and bright lights shining out from the windows of other houses. It's also refreshing that the MC is unable to uplift the world significantly because he doesn't have photographic memory and because someone already did it before him.

He's also one of the few main characters that goes to the toilet often and consistently, funnily enough.

However, one of the most common criticisms of the novel is that it is translated from Chinese, and thus occasionally suffer from strange prose and anachronistic names. There's also some folks who thinks the protagonist didn't suffer enough permanent consequences from courting death so often.
