I appreciate you providing links.

I find the entire premise of putting "objectional author politics" warnings troublesome. The author's politics shouldn't really be relevant, the question is the content. Trigger warnings should be reserved for disturbing content, and even then my understanding is that studies indicate they cause people with trauma more distress, not less. Regardless reading an author with different politics is not traumatizing.

Moreover in this case the author hasn't said or done anything objectionable. Even the characters haven't done or said anything objectionable. Igigigif is just inferring that the author is unsympathetic because some of the characters had a slightly mocking reaction to learning that a group of villains were forced to turn into women if they wanted to continue down their magical path to power (the magical paths being unswappable, incredibly dangerous, and each step a secret). These people are not trans in any real world way. They accepted magical sex change in order to gain magical power, and the issue of their gender identity hasn't really come up. Igigigif may be correct about the author (china is not known for progressive views on trans issues), but their evidence as described is definitely lacking, nor did they even actually link such.
