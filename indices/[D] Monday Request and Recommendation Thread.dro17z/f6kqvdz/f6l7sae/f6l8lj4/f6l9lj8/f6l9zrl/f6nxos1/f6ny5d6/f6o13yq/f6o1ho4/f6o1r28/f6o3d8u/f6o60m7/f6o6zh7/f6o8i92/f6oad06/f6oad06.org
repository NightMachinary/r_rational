  The MC has a few mocking thoughts (schadenfreude) about the surprise these (evil) men must have had at learning the secret that they must transform into women.

Does this not stick out to you at all as maybe indicative of something? Another user has stated There's another pathway that turns the drinker male, who is similarly mocked but to a lesser degree., so, you know, everything adds up. I don't "accuse the author of bigotry," either. The only thing I do is provide a tag that says the author's politics are objectionable, which links here. So if someone wants specifics they'll see this whole conversation.
