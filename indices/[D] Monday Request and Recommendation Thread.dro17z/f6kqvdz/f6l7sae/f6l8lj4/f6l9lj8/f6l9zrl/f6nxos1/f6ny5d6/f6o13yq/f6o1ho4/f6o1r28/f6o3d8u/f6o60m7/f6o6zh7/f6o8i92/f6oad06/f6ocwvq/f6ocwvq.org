I have, in the past, written a short story in which one of the characters was Adolf Hitler. Now, I think we can all agree that his politics were highly objectionable.

Does that make my politics necessarily objectionable?

More generally, is there any good reason to assume that an author's politics must always match the politics of the characters he writes?
