  Like, everyone who has read the story is agreeing that it's there, it exists.

  I mean, that's why I asked for and received direct citations from the text. You can look at them if you want.

I read the story, it's very long so maybe I missed something, but to my recollection it just had, as I said, a few characters express surprise and amusement. The MC has a few mocking thoughts (schadenfreude) about the surprise these (evil) men must have had at learning the secret that they must transform into women. It's complicated because these people didn't want to transform, but they still chose to for magical power. It's unknown whether they identify as women or men. The main plot point was simply that this transformation made tracking one of them very difficult. The scenario just doesn't really map onto real life.

This is really insufficient to accuse the author of bigotry, much less post said accusation on every mention of his book.
