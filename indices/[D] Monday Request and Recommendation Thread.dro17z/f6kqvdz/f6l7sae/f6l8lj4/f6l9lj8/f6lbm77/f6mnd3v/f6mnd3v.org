Not sure if you're referring to the Korean historical figure constellations, or the whole thing with japan in the peace land arc.

For the former, every country would have had equivalents, it's just that Korean incarnations were unreasonably successful.

For the latter, while it is a reasonable outgrowth of how stories/tales work in-setting, it's also undeniably unpleasant. Thankfully, that arc was relatively short.

Regarding the MC's martyr complex it might be some combination of access to resurrection abilities, trauma from his family situation, genuine affection for the other people involved, and his (incorrect) self-perception as the only person able to change the story But honestly I don't get it either.
