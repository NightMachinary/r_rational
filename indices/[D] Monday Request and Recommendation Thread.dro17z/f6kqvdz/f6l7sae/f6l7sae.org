I'll give this a tentative rec. By the standards of it's main selling point as xianxia by way of hermetecism it does an excellent job. Well researched, several fleshed out characters, and an interesting world.

The MC has clear, thematic, and limited powers that reward creative use and is decently intelligent, and the magic system is very consistent as of chap ~550.

By the standards of normal fiction, not so much. Translation jank, aggravating transphobia, and a good deal of as yet unjustified plot armor make it a harder sell to anyone outside the existing audiences for translated webnovels.

But seriously, if you do read this stuff, definitely check it out. IMHO its on par with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and Way of Choices
