I'm a fan. Started this recently due to what was likely your recommendation. As to the statements about bigotry, I've seen hints of whay might be insensitivity, but it's such a small part of the story it's hard to tell, and especially so because the targets aren't real trans people but "bad guys" who got surprised with the need to change into a woman to upgrade their evil superpowers, because the path only allows women. There's an opposite power path as well, that requires only men. As of the current translation, the characters haven't shown any views that made me actually feel like the author had a problem with any minority groups or other countries, races, etc. I'm not okay with bigotry, but I don't think people should be scared off the story for fear of it. Judge for yourself.
