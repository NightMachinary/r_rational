  /I was pretty sure Miss Justice meets a noble at some point and refers to him this way/

That's what I first thought too, but I don't remember if she referred to the noble as a baboon in that chapter.

From the three passages quoted, I believe the slur isn't referring to gay characters, more a generic insult comparing humans to simians. Also, the last passage is likely referring to HIV originating from monkeys (beastality) as well as the rather eccentric cuckold/voyeur fetish.
