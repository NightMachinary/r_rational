I was pretty sure Miss Justice meets a noble at some point and refers to him this way, though I'm only vaguely recalling it and couldn't locate it after a quick scan of the text.

I did find in chapter 624:

#+begin_quote
  In accordance with Admiral Amyrius Rieveldt's traits, he decided to first use work as an excuse. After that would be the excuse of him not feeling well, him losing the ability to have sex, him needing some time to digest any medicine he had just taken, and how he had suddenly realized his true sexual orientation, making him find curly-haired baboons extremely attractive.

A few chapters later he uses the phrase again, though it's less overtly about being gay:

#+begin_quote
  H/e's a gentleman who's of good bearing and garners the affection of women. Eh, this point is open to debate. With his standing and status, even a curly-haired baboon would garner the affection of men and women, no---perhaps even more. At the very least, a curly-haired baboon doesn't tell dated jokes.../

Much earlier, in chapter 462, we have this part:

#+begin_quote
  â€œ23rd April. This bunch of aristocrats really are a mess! I even thought that Ma'am Karen had seduced me for sex because she had taken a fancy for my inner self. But who knew that her husband, the Earl of Champagne, was peeping in the opposite room. He was even thrilled and even f**king wanted to f**k me!

  Klein was momentarily speechless. He felt that the private life of Emperor Roselle was really filled with excitement and that many of the Intis aristocracy were also sufficiently eccentric.

  /If some aristocrat tries to seek novelty and finds a curly-haired baboon, some kind of disease might even be born.../ Klein sighed and looked down.

Rereading it now, it seems less clear that it's a gay slur. But a good number of the times it gets used, it is as part of a situation discussing non-heterosexual sex. It doesn't come up often, but much of the time it does, it's basically comparing non-straight sex to being as eccentric as having sex with curly-haired baboons.
