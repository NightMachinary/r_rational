  /Originally I just thought it was a generic insult, but later on it is used specifically to refer to a gay character./

I think I've missed this part. From what I read, the only time the word "gay" was used was to make fun of the MC's coworker and that was only a one-off comment in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-21][Chapter 21]]. There are a few gay/bisexual characters, but I don't remember any of them being referred to as a baboon.
