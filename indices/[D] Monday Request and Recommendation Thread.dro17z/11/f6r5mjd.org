[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954189-scythe][The Scythe]] was an excellent read. Well thought out post-singularity YA novel. It's technically utopian from the general perspective of society, but despite the constraints of living under a strong, friendly AI, still managed to /feel/ dystopian; not because the AI fucks up, but because humans do, and the AI is programmed not to stop them.

It simultaneously benefits and suffers from the YA imperative to keep novels short and condensed. On one hand, the plot feels a little rushed and a lot of woldbuilding is condensed, but on the other hand, I never read a scene that I think the book could have done without. If I wasn't used to webfiction's sprawling works, I'd probably think it was the perfect length.
