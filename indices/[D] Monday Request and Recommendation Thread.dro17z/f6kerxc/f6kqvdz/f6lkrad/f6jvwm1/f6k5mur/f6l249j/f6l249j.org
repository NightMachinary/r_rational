One thing I like about The Reckoning is that there's almost a role reversal between Alloran and The Visser, relative to the dynamic between ordinary Yeerks and their hosts. Alloran nudges the Visser into doing things subtly differently than he otherwise would, while Yeerks, despite having complete control, are constricted to their host's previous habits to maintain an appearance of normalcy. I generally think of Yeerks as being locked inside the host, but Alloran as being locked inside The Visser. The Visser has a stronger claim on Alloran's body than Alloran, at this point, and it's almost Alloran who is the parasite.

I mention this because

Made me laugh.
