You're putting too much weight on one persons opinions, views and comments.

​

There are rational stories, a subgenre of those are stories with rationalistic main characters.

From sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

It doesn't mean the every rational story has to have them.

At the end of the day though, if your tastes match what's generally recommended / what's in the wiki recommendations here you enjoy rational fiction..

PS. I don't think he means crazy as in Crazy more as in quirky or eccentric. But Again those are generally rationalistic character tropes..
