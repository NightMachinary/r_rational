I like Will Wight's Cradle novels. They're written in English (so no amateur translation - which is my number one problem with other cultivation stories), have good popcorn action plots, there's quite a few of them and the story advances at a fair pace. I enjoyed them a lot. If you're looking for a competently written progression focused series, Cradle is a good place to start.

The quest Forge of Destiny / Threads Of Destiny by yrsillar is also worth mentioning. It stars a young street urchin who joins a cultivation school - the Argent Peak Sect. Power growth is keep in check. While we see the upper reaches, the MC is still steadily working her way through the first and second years of her school. No young masters causally knocked down. Features an engaging plot, likeable characters and a /lot/ of content written so far. Also notable for the MC taking at least partly a support focus. She uses a magical flute that plays haunting magical music.
