Cultivation Chat Group is probably the best one out of them. Like most of them, the start is a little slow, but stick with it. It's a slice-of-life sitcom about a Chinese college student who accidentally gets invited into the eponymous chat group and after a brief period of thinking that they're all crazy LARPers posting in-character, realizes this shit is real and becomes a cultivator himself. It's often hilarious, extremely well translated (especially after the first few chapters) by Chinese webnovel standards and is notable among its peers for having a protagonist who, for once, is just a Tom Hanks-level nice dude who tries to help people.
