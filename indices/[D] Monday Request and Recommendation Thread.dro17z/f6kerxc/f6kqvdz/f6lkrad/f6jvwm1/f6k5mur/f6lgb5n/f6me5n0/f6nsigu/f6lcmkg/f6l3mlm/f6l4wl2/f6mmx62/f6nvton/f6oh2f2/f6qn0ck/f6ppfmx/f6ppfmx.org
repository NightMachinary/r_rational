Oh yes past plot threads definitely recur, but there's definitely a "formula" of (crew travels to new island, encounters conflict, gains new skills/allies/strength). There is this overarc-ing goal of becoming the Pirate King, and you can definitely see progress being made and roughly where the end of the story would be (which should end in like, 10 years...).

Also, to add on to what someone else wrote, definitely read the manga instead of watching the anime. The anime has a lot of pacing issues.
