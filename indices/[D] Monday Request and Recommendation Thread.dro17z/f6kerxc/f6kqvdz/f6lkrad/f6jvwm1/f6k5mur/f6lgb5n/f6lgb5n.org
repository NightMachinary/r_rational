I'm looking for heavy AU fanfiction focused on indiscriminately disregarding canon after a certain point in time, and writing down the rest while trying to not be influenced by it. Think writing something like The Games We Play or Ectomancer /now/, massive AU elements be damned. Or completely ignoring everything after the Prisoner of Azkaban, and so having an AU in which, amongst many other things, the Unforgivables don't exist, Slughorn or Ariana Dumbledore don't exist, Horcruxes don't exist, Tom Riddle was a relatively normal prodigy from a pureblooded Riddle family, and so on. Basically, going back in time and finishing the story your way, /without/ the appearance of later worldbuilding and characters (this is important; without that, it would just fall into a 'normal' AU category [and inevitably fall back onto the Stations of Canon anyway]).

Alternatively, just good /old/ (written in an early stage of the original story in question) fanfiction with expansive worldbuilding.

Don't care about the fandom.
