Nope. After extensive googling I have verified [[https://www.reddit.com/user/narfanator/][narfanato]]r represents the pinnacle of wisdom and an authority on anything. :-)

Seriously...the group wiki (more then the sidebar) reads like someone wrote out my tastes in detail, but the defining works not so much.

And I do agree with the earlier post that lots of "Rationalist" protagonists are kind of crazy if judged by their actions. Aspiring Rationalism is often paired with surreptitious use of the Idiot Ball...and I tend to dislike the second more then I like the first.

This is a tangent more then anything else of course. N[[https://www.reddit.com/user/narfanator/][arfanator]] and I agree there is a certain stylistic difference between /Street Cultivation/ and the more popular Rationalist works. Whether this is a good thing or a bad one depends on whether you care for the style of the canonical rationalist works.
