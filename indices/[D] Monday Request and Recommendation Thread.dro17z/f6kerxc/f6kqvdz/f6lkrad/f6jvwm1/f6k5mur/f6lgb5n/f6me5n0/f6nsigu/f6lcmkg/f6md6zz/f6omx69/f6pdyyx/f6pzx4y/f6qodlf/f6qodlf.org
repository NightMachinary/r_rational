  There is a serial I've been following that features a rational protagonist and which seems to be developing a semi-hard magic system. The protagonist also has a reverence for mysticism, whic makes sense in-universe because the world seems to be set up to reward a certain level of mysticism. Is that rational fiction, and would it irritate people in this community?
