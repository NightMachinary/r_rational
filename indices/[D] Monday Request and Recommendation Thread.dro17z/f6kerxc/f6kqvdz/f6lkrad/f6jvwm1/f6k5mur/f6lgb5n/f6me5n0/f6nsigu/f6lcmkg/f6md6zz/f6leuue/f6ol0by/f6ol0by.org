A quest called [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] on Sufficient Velocity and a story on RoyalRoad called [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]]

Note that White Collar is on haitus and it's unknown when said haitus will end and I sort of dropped out of Dao of Magic because for a while it had sluggish updates... Geez there's 276 chapters now.
