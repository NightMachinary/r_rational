Since it just updated after a long hiatus, I'm going to post a rec for [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]] here.

This is a quest (so, reader voting and all that) about a very traumatized child soldier learning to recover her humanity as she participates in an ongoing war between all of humanity and an invasive, incomprehensible alien force. The initial premise is that the protagonist, Anna, is one of the supporting characters in a harem anime, but the incredible worldbuilding, characterization, and combat scenes quickly leave that premise in the dust with their sheer excellence.

Anna is very well-written and engaging character, and the journey she's on has me 100% hooked.

Note: the wait between chapters is long. As in "a year of hiatus is not unusual" long. If you don't want to deal with that, you may want to skip it for now.
