Being transformed to a sex not your own is treated as a painful/difficult thing by the MC, that's not transphobic.

To my recollection the male transform potion is mentioned in one line, with just an offhand thought that it wasn't quite as bad for the drinker -- a pretty clear fact in victorian fantasy land.

You post a tag "Objectionable author politics" that links to a post saying there's transphobia, and in sub comments say that you think the author is a bigot, and some people don't like supporting bigots. I don't see how that isn't an accusation. You really don't see a problem with posting that on every mention of the book?

Once again you have nothing at all from the author himself. You are entirely assuming the opinion of a character is the opinion of the author. Moreover you are assuming the opinion of the character, because that's hardly clear. Moreover you haven't even read the supposed problematic parts yourself.

Of course the author might be bigoted, I do think this is very slight Bayesian evidence of that, but I think you are way overstating it, and that's not a trivial accusation.
