  Apologies for reading too much into your words. (But do you see how easy it is to do?)

To be fair, you did get the general gist. You can pretty easily guess an author's ideology, especially if a story goes above a personal level.

  including the possibility of being a reflection on society, a subtle commentary on societal reactions, and so on.

Indeed. However, it's one more data point. For Lord of the Mysteries, there is enough data for me to pretty conclusively say that the story is taking a side on that issue, and it is not a positive one. While a statement can have unintended implications, especially if an author is not very skilled, there's just too much here to dismiss.
