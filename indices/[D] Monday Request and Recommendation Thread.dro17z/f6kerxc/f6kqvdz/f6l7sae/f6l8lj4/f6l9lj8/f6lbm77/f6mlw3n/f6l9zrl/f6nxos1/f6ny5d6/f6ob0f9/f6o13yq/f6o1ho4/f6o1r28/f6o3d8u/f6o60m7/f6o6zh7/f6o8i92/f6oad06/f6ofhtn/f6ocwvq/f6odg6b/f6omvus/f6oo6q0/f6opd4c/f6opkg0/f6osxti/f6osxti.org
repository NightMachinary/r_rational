To be fair, the general gist - i.e. what the author is /explicitly saying/ - is (usually) dead easy to guess. It gets a lot more difficult when we get into the question of what the author is /implying/.

Incidentally, just out of curiosity - if the only writings of his that were available were /The Hobbit/ and the /Lord of the Rings/ series, what conclusions would you draw about the politics of J.R.R. Tolkien?

I pick him largely because the books to which I refer are well-known enough that it's likely that you're well aware of them; considering /only/ those written works will allow us both to get some idea (after some more research) of just how accurate you are at reading author politics from fiction.
