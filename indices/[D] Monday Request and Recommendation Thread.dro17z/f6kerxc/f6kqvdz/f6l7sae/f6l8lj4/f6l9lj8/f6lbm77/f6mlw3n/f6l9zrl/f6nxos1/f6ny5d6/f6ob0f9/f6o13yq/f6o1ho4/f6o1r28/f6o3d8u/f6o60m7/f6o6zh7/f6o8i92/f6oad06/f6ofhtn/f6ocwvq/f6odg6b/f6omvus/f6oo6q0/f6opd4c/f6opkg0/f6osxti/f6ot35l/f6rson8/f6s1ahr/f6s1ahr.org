Well, because Christianity seems to be the /main/ influence in LotR lore. Like, when I was a Christian you could be a hundred percent sure I would've spread that all across my books. Nowadays I might make an offhand reference to it or draw inspiration for one of my fictional religions, but it's not going to be the actual history of the universe like it is in LotR. Reading between the lines it seems like Tolkein subscribes to one of the more traditional sects of Christianity.
