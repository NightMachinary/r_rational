  So, this really folds into the above.
#+end_quote

If you wish, you can consider these the same action.

#+begin_quote
  This goes double when the author and the reader are from different cultures (or different time periods). And triple when there's a translator in the mix.
#+end_quote

These can introduce confusion, certainly. Your list is helpful in finding false positives.

#+begin_quote
  So... you're capable of discerning the author's precise worldview from examining the tones of his story?
#+end_quote

Hey now, don't put words in my mouth. I can't tell you the /precise/ worldview of someone given only indirect information. However, a writer does put a lot of themself into their works. Little glimpses past the curtain build up, become evidence of one idea or another the author may have. So while an author using slurs /may/ be an innocent mistake from someone with another culture, and their characters may just be written to be terrible people, and casual bigotry in language or action could just be the author showing how bigotry manifests, it's a bit harder to excuse it all away when you put a lot of evidence together. So while yes, the translator could have subtly shaded the story in such a way as to promote a false version of the author's actual intent, such a thing is pretty unlikely. And while the casual sneering going on about how other characters are trapped in the body of the wrong sex could just be showing how our everyman self-insert protagonist is actually a bigot, the lack of anyone calling out that behavior makes it doubtful. And while a casual reference to X social group could be, just by chance, coded in a way that people who irrationally dislike X social group tend to code them, when it happens multiple times, it's very unlikely. These stack up.
