There's another pathway that turns the drinker male, who is similarly mocked but to a lesser degree. Also, there is an actual trans character (gender dysphoria) who pursued the turn-into-woman pathway for the effect, but she did not yet appear in the currently translated chapters.

I've read ORV and I found it interesting. However, I find ORV's tackling of nationality-based superpowers rather unsettling, and the MC's obsession with martyring himself hard to understand. ORV also has one or more characters change genders as one of their superpowers.
