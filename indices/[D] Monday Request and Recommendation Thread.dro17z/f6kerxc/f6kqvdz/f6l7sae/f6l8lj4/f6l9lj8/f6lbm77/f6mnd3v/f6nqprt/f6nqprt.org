First I must say ORV's concept of a live-streamed “sadistic death game” viewed by ex-human gods is quite a fun take on things.

Yes, I was referring to those segments, they were really awkward in my opinion. As for the MC's martyr complex, I joked with others reading ORV how the MC's obsession with tackling every crisis by sacrificing himself before returning to life had repeatedly traumatize his friends (who looked to him as a emotional crutch) into a constant state of mental breakdowns.
