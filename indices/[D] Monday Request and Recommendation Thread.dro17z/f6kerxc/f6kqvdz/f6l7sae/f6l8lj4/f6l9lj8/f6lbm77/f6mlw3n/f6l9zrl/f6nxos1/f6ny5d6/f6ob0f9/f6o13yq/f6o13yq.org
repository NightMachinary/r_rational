  Politics and worldview inform a story's content.
#+end_quote

This is quite a large topic, and only tangentially relevant so I will just say that worldview may inform content, but you don't automatically know how (or what someones worldview actually is). If you can't point out something wrong with the actual content, clearly it hasn't been 'informed' in a damaging way. So why condemn it just because you don't agree with the author on everything.

  And apparently there is a trans character in this one, so.
#+end_quote

So? Having a trans character proves what? Someone said there is a trans character outside the current translation (I don't know about that part, and presumably you don't either), they didn't say they were portrayed poorly.

  I put this specific warning because there are people who may not want to support someone who's a bigot.
#+end_quote

You are claiming the author is a bigot. The evidence for that is that someone on reddit said that they thought some of the characters in the book written by the author would think negatively about hypothetical trans characters because these characters thought something slightly negative about some other non trans characters.
