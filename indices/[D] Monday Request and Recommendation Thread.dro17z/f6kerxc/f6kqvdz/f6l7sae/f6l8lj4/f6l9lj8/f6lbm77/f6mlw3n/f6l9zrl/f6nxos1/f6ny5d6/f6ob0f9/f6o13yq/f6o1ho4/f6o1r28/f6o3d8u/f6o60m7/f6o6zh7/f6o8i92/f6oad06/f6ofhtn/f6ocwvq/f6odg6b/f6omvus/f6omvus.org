#+begin_quote
  First, you take a look at what the author espouses when they're not writing a story.
#+end_quote

That's reasonable. So, let's consider the case where the author is silent on the matter.

#+begin_quote
  If that's not viable, you look at their culture and see if they've explicitly denied having X position.
#+end_quote

Um... if they've denied holding X position, then that's something written when they're not writing a story. So, this really folds into the above.

#+begin_quote
  Then you look at what's implied in-story, look at the tone, how the narrator treats X issue.
#+end_quote

This is where it gets /super/ tricky. In-story implications, especially about a subject that the /reader/ feels intensely about, can easily be seen where they were never meant.

This goes double when the author and the reader are from different cultures (or different time periods). And /triple/ when there's a translator in the mix. Potential sources for confusion include:

- The author uses terms which have become slurs in Culture A. However, the author himself is a member of Culture B, which has different slurs.
- The translator has a bias which the author does not share; this shades the translation one way or the other.
- The author uses what he considers to be natural language (e.g. using the phrase "all the guys" to describe a partially-female group). A reader is expecting extreme correctness of terms and calls that sexism.
- The author is /not/ trying to write all his characters to be extremely politically correct, and is rather trying to imply that they are flawed in various ways. Some of these flaws are assumed to reflect on the author by an oversensitive reader.

#+begin_quote
  The alternative is that this is just a very, very badly written story that brings across tones that are completely contrary to the author's worldview.
#+end_quote

So... you're capable of discerning the author's precise worldview from examining the tones of his story?
