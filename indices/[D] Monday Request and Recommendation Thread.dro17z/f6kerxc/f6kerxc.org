So, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][The World As It Appears to Be]] by [[/u/Benedict_SC]] is an amazing piece of Overwatch fanfic. Let me count the ways:

1. It succeeds /as writing/. The characters have depth and chemistry. The dialogues are on point. The plot twists are well done.

2. It succeeds /as science-fiction/. It takes a decent stab at hardening Overwatch's hand-waved soft-SF. It has non-silly AI. It has an SF device that I had never encountered before (and I've read a lot of SF), that raises interesting questions.

3. It succeeds /as fanfiction/. All characters sound just like their Overwatch canon selves. You just naturally start hearing them talk in their voices. (With the unfortunate exception of Mercy. Though to be fair, Mercy has shown very little of herself in canon; in all her lines, her two emotions are detached heroism and doctor baby-talk.)

4. But more than that: it takes characters which, in canon, are largely two-dimensional caricatures, and /gives/ them depth, richness, and [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][intelligence]] - all the while remaining true to the caricature. Same with the setting, which is faithful to canon but adds elements that just feel right. Almost everything about this fic slotted right into my headcanon.

 

So, having read this jewel, I got hungry for more Overwatch fanfics. And I got forcefully reminded of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's law]].

Most of what floats to the top of AO3 doesn't even succeed as fanfic. It's just some (gay romance) story with characters who share a name (and /usually/ species and /maybe/ job) with canon but are nothing alike personality-wise. I have nothing against Hanzo/McCree slashfic if that's what you want to write, but dammit girl, McCree has one of the most recognisable voice in Overwatch, would it kill you to write your dialogue to match?

I've lowered my standards considerably but I'm still disappointed. Does anyone have recs?
