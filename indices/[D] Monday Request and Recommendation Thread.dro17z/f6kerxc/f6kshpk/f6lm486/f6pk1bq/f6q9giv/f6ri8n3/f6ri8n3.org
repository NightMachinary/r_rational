Oh, yeah, I wrote a thing about a dude with save scum powers trying to avert the apocalypse for NaNo last year, but I felt like it sort of fell apart at the ending (which I rushed because NaNo) and I've been meaning to rewrite and expand on the ending and actually put it up somewhere (outside of a google docs link on my Tumblr), but I got this full-time job eating my time. It's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw/edit][here]] if you really want to read it, but it's not really up to my standards since I was forcing it to the end to hit the target. Plus, while I try to be clever, it's probably not proper rationalfic since there's surely ways an optimizer who was really trying could have done considerably better (as opposed to the protagonist, who's kind of a slacker.)

Also, thanks for the TWAIATB rec! I... don't have any real recs of my own, unfortunately. I read a decently IC McHanzo fic once that had a pretty compelling B-plot for a while, but it's not rationalfic and it kind of lost the plot after the sexual tension resolved and it switched over to being mostly smut and angst. Don't recall the name off the top of my head and I can't unreservedly recommend it, either. It's a dang shame.

Wait, no, I remember, it was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127210/chapters/16186526][Hang the Fool]]. I never actually finished it, but yeah now that I found it again, I can confirm that it's, like, pretty darn well-done for what it is, but the what-it-is definitely traded off against my enjoyment and I kind of lost interest once it took the foreground.
