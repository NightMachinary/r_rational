Hmm, the fic does reference Overwatch canon a /lot/. Much of the plot points and surprise character appearances might seem a bit... random, without the background.

So I do think that the more you know about Overwatch, the more you'll enjoy this fic. (There's even subtler references to game mechanics and cosmetic items, for the enthusiasts.)

That being said, there's not that much Overwatch lore altogether, and at least some of it is accessible through competently made animated shorts. If you have half an hour and don't mind being marketed to, I'd recommend watching:
