I got suddenly interested in /dungeon core/ as a genre, but everything that is top-rated and most-recommended on RoyalRoad is "a fresh take" or another kind of subversion. And I want to get acquainted with the genre itself before delving into plays on its common tropes.

So, any recommendations for a straight-forward but well-written dungeon core story?
