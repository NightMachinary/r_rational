  although the MC does thing through their situation and comes up with some pretty clever stuff, that's not what defines him, so the rationalist itch is only sort of scratched.

Genuinely curious about the meaning of this statement. Are we requiring protagonists in rationalist fiction have rationalism as their sole defining character trait? Or that they think and talk about rationality? This could be one of the missing pieces that explains why what I think of when I read the official criteria diverges so much from what the group suggests. Personally, I find the idea a protagonist has no personality beyond "rational" a bad thing. I'm also not a super fan of characters who preach rationality...it raises the stakes, makes it more obnoxious if the character does act irrational down the road. Nothing worse then a Murder Hobo preaching logic. I kind of like a character who is quietly sensible.

There is a serial I've been following that features a rational protagonist and which seems to be developing a semi-hard magic system. The protagonist also has a reverence for mysticism, whic makes sense in-universe because the world seems to be set up to reward a certain level of mysticism. Is that rational fiction, and would it irritate people in this community?

Anyway, Street Cultivation is unique in that it deconstructs the Cultivation genre. Nobody does that...the super hero and Epic Fantasy genres are deconstructed all the time. The Cultivation genre tends to be very ritualized and the exact opposite of rationalism...the standard Cultivation universe doesn't quite make sense and the standard protagonist is a reckless gambler with some huge blind spots.
