I'm having some problem with /A Hero's War/ on Royal Road because when the hero acquired an Anime Fox Girl companion it made it hard to take seriously.

Now that I look most of the problematic fox girls were in Progression Fantasy of some sort.

For the record, I'm totally OK with Fox Shifters provided they don't have cute fox ears and tail in human form. Also OK with fox guys.
