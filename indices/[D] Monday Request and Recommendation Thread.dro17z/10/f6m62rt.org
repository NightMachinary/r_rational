I have recently read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/aircraft-design-company-matsuras-planes-are-always-fastest.48927/][Aircraft Design Company Quest]] on SF forums and am now looking for similar themed fiction or quests, where I can follow arms or technology race in some conflict, similarly fiction works on prolonged conflicts that involve problem solving would be appreciated.

Also, the linked quest itself was refreshing in that players had a more open way to look for solutions that fit the proposed requirements. It was very fun to read about proposed plane designs to meet certain criteria, within specific limits. I would gladly devour anything similar as well.
