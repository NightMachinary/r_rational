  I don't know, flavor to the internal reality of the "rational" characters that I'm not finding present in the MC of SC.

This is confirmation of my hypothesis that what a lot of people think of when they think "Rationalist Fiction" is slightly different from the criteria listed to the right. When I read the description of rationalist fiction, I got really excited about this group. I guess that ill defined "flavor" is a huge turn off to me.

  too/ well-adjusted. "scratch the itch" rationalist characters are kind of crazy people.

I totally agree that the most popular characters in the genre are "crazy people". The thing is, one of the core reasons I got into this group is to search for protagonists who are not "crazy people". Crazy people are the opposite of rational, and far to common in fiction. One of the core requirements I have of rational fiction is that the protagonist NOT be a crazy person...I'm willing to compromise on other points. Reading someone who acts like a crazy person think about rationality is just weird and annoying to me.
