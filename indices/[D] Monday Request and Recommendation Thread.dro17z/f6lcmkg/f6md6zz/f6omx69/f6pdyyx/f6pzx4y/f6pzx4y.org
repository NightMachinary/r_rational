Sure! I guess... If you look at the canonical examples - HMPOR, Origin of the Species, Shadows of the Limelight, some characters in Unsong, - there's a, I don't know, /flavor/ to the internal reality of the "rational" characters that I'm not finding present in the MC of SC. Dunno how to describe it, but it's more-or-less present, and pretty similar every time it shows up.

There's also thinking-about-thinking and/or scope-of-goals. These characters are all looking at the entire /world/ they are in, and usually have extremely long-term and/or far-reaching goals. That's the itch.

In SC, he's stuck with very short-term, very small-scope goals. He does a very good job of being both intelligent and creative within that scope, and, honestly, he's kind of /too/ well-adjusted. "scratch the itch" rationalist characters are kind of crazy people.

To name some other parts of it, many high-appeal rationalist characters have "rationality" (or some aspect of it) as a terminal value of their own identity, in SC, the MC's terminal values are his sister and climbing out of the almost-poverty-hole they're in. He applies intelligence in service to that, sure, but that intelligence itself is not one of his terminal values.

To be clear, I don't think this is a /bad/ thing, it's just a different thing. I play 4X games for the feeling of exponential momentum, I play story games for the feelings a good narrative engenders, and I play clever indie games for the novel puzzles they present.

Totes point us (me?) at this serial; I think the only time I've seen this sub respond poorly/meanly to posted fiction was that trollish parody of a rational DBZ that got posted a long time ago.

And yeah! I do like how SC deconstructs aspects of the cultivation genre; I'd actually really like to see a lot more of that, and I'm happy we're learning more about the larger world in this book.
