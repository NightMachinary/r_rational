I read what was already written (book 1) and am now following book 2. I would recommend it, although I'd put it solidly in the B tier. Very nice for when you want something simpler / more relaxing.

It's solid young adult fiction. There's massive amounts of off-screen R&D (mostly prior to the story start), and although the MC does thing through their situation and comes up with some pretty clever stuff, that's not what defines him, so the rationalist itch is only sort of scratched.

That said, massive props to the author - I've started thinking in terms of "investing in my lucrima cores", and I feel like I've learned a new meditative technique from it.
