/Street Cultivation/ by Sarah Lin. Not strictly rationalist fiction, but at least rational fiction. It tries to figure out how elements of the standard Cultivation magic system would work in modern society. The main character behaves in a reasonably sane manner...and when he does something dumb he realizes it and stops.

One of those books that fits the groups criteria as well as some of the stuff that gets mentioned, but is never mentioned because it doesn't quite fit with the very specific tastes of the community.
