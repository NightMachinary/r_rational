This doesn't quite fit your criteria (it's an AU with extensive world building, and it is old, but it's based off of two completed series), but the [[http://www.shadowchronicles.net/][Shadow Chronicles]] are great and I rarely get a chance to recommend it. It's a Ranma 1/2 fanfic (but you don't need to have read the series to understand it) set in a dark AU where demons are slowly devouring the entire multiverse, world by world.

I would recommend skipping through the first four arcs and straight to On A Clear Day You Can See Forever. You don't need to have read the other arcs to understand it, and it's where the crazy worldbuilding really kicks into high gear, and if you enjoy it the previous arcs make a nice prequel.
