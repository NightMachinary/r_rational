[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10408971/chapters/22985466][A Thing of Vikings]] is a How to Train Your Dragon fanfiction that takes the first film as canon, then places it in context of eleventh century European politics. Other works in the HttyD franchise are used for occasional character inspirations, but are not canon with respect to the fic.
