I totally agree that [SPOILER] was not rational and was kind of annoying That sort of thing is a big pet peeve of mine. It's a common problem of the genre. I think it boils down to what you think of as being rational...are you thinking in terms of common sense or a rationalist philosophy? It's a stand for what we see as a rationalist worldview while at the same time lacking in common sense.

I do think the last couple...episodes?...sort of show the main character trying to address his more reckless qualities.

/Azarinth Healer/ involves a protagonist who behaves more like a video game character then a real person tossed into a dangerous person. Reckless and not at all like a person. But there is math, if you like that sort of thing.
