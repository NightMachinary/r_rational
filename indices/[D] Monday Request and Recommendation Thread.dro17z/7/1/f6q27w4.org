I agree that /Azarinth Healer/ and /New World/ were poor.

He Who Fights With Monsters was OK in terms of worldbuilding, but I thought the main character was bad and got progressively worse. His social intelligence only seemed high in the beginning because the social intelligence of the other characters were being dumbed down. What would you classify openly disrespecting an extremely powerful entity as, in terms of social intelligence?
