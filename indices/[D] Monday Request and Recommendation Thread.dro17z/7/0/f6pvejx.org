/He Who Fights With Monsters/ is pretty decent and updates a lot.

If you liked that, you might like /Eight/. One of the most sensible protagonists in the LitRPG genre and it looks like they are setting up a semi-hard magic system. Probably closer to rationalist fiction then /He Who Fights With Monsters./ Lots of stat screens, but not a lot of numbers.
