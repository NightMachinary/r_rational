Nope, haven't tried that subreddit, did spend some time trawling through [[/r/Litrpg]]'s top all time posts the other day but that's about the extent of how far I've dipped my toe into the water (that and the top rated stuff on RR). I'll check both those things out, thanks again.

I don't really have a hate-on for numbers, they just should be in service to the actual story, and so often in these things there really is no 'actual story' beyond endless powerwank and monsters with ever-growing levels to stand in the way and be powerwanked at.
