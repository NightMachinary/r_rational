Looking for a regular old fantasy novel where the hero is a reasonable guy trying to live his life in a very different world rather then a reckless murder hobo. I like rational fiction, but I define "Rational" as common sense. I love hard magic systems, but you can rarely find an author who can do both at once as well as actually write so I'll compromise on the other elements of rational fiction to get a professionally edited book.\\
Loved Mother of Learning, Street Cultivation, Mistborn, Jumper. Limited tolerance for Anime Fox Girls and books that try to imitate Anime in general.
