How far did you get in OP before you felt it got too hectic? Luffy starts his adventure in East Blue, meets friends and enemies while traveling the world. I wouldn't say it's very rational as too many people have crazy powers and aren't using them optimally, but it's definitely a fun story with some truly fantastic world building and character development.

I think my favorite part of One Piece is exploring this crazy world of superpowers and seeing our protagonist+crew travel from island to island and righting the wrongs they see. It's got some genuinely funny moments and surprisingly dark scenarios (children being abducted for research, a villain whose power makes the victim forgotten by everyone, etc.) for a shounen series.

It's been a long time since I read/watched HxH, I think I stopped around when the chimeras were introduced, but I feel that if you liked HxH you should definitely give OP a try.

Let me know if you have specific questions, I'm pretty bad at just selling something haha. I have spent way too much time reading OP so I'm pretty confident I can answer any question you may have, though.
