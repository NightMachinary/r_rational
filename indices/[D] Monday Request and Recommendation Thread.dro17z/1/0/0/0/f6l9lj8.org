Can't pull up a direct quote, but basically one of the cultivation routes, in addition to incentiveizng the user to act evil (on the order of wanton blood sacrifice), turns them into a woman. The thing is, whenever this pathway is mentioned, whoever brings it up will condemn or mock them for this trait. It's on the order of 1 sentence every ~50 chapters so only grating if you're archive bingeing.

I'll also specifically note that in setting it mostly been the case that people grudgingly accept it as the price of power, not bc the're actually trans. Almost certainly just authorial bias shinning through and not a deliberate plot point.
