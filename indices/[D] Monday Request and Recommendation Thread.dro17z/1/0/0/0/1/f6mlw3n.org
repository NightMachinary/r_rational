Agree that these items are pretty messed up when they come up but this reflects the state of the art on trans issues in mainland Chinese culture, as far as I can tell. If you can read 19th century novels, i.e. if you can read things by people with somewhat alien and. from where we're standing, unenlightened views, then you can likely read this. Remember that we won't be remembered well by history for our own unenlightened views, judging from every possible past historical precedent.
