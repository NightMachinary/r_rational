Apologies for reading too much into your words. (But do you see how /easy/ it is to do?)

A writer puts a lot of themselves into their works, yes. But not /just/ themselves. A writer also puts in what they observe of the world around them.

A writer who observes bigotry can include it without being a bigot. A writer who observes bigotry not being called out by society can include bigotry without calling it out for multiple reasons; including the possibility of being a reflection on society, a subtle commentary on societal reactions, and so on.

If you want a list of works that have fallen foul of these sorts of implications in a completely /unintentional/ manner, I'd point you to the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications][Unfortunate Implications]] tvtropes page, which lists exactly that. And calling things out without /very/ good reason can certainly have [[https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/the-toxic-drama-of-ya-twitter.html][negative effects]].
