In the interest of discussion, I have linked some of the relevant chapters for review. If you guys don't mind spoilers, I think this should help clear up things.

For some background: the power is associated with a villainous cult who worships an evil goddess, where those higher in the cult become more and more alike their deity (thus the change in gender for male followers). Few if any of the cult's members are portrayed as sympathetic as a result. However, every single cultist that became female was described in the text as supernaturally attractive (to both genders).

I think the first instance in which the involved character's POV is shown is [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-66][Chapter 66]].

The MC is aware of the involved character's new existence in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-125/][Chapter 125]]. She has shown up twice earlier without the MC realising her change in gender.

The MC finds another, kills her, and finds out some information regarding why they change into women in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-195][Chapters 195-200]].

An important person's diary talked briefly about having sex with someone from the cult in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-290/][Chapter 290]], but he might be unaware of the fact many of them are former men.

The same diary writer mocks the other pathway that turns women into men in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-484/][Chapter 484]].

The MC meets the first escaped cultist again, now a fugitive running away from being a mistress of a Prince and being subjected to supernatural brainwashing in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-470/][Chapter 470-471]].
