Hmmm.

I'd put it to you, in response, that the influence of Christianity on Lord of the Rings is substantially /less/ than the influence of Christianity on, say, /The Chronicles of Narnia/.

Now, if you were to conclude from Narnia that C.S. Lewis were Christian, I would heartily agree; Lewis is unsubtle on the matter. But Tolkien's link here seems a lot weaker. And would it help to point out that Tolkien was writing in the same sort of era as WWII? The concept of Mordor being equatable to Russia is (I would imagine) a far easier conclusion to draw.
