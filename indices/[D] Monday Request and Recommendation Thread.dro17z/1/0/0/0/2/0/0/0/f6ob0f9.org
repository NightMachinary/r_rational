I wouldn't go as far as to claim the author is a bigot (since he has shown no outright sense of intolerance through his work), at most insensitive. However, this is just my opinion since I am not trans.

I do agree with [[/u/nohat]] partially in that there should be direct quotes we can talk over whether they warrant labelling the entire work transphobic though. That would be more productive.
