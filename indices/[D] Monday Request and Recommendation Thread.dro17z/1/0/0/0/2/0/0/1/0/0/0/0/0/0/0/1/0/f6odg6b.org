Naw. First, you take a look at what the author espouses when they're not writing a story. If that's not viable, you look at their culture and see if they've explicitly denied having X position. Then you look at what's implied in-story, look at the tone, how the narrator treats X issue. Now, the narrator /could/ just be a bigot, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, since we're given an everyman protagonist---or so it seems from what I've read. You've got isekai, anyway. The alternative is that this is just a very, very badly written story that brings across tones that are completely contrary to the author's worldview. This is actually very hard to do, usually resulting from very small snippets of text, which /really/ isn't the case, because when an issue in mentioned more than once and in more than a very offhand manner, the author's actual opinion tends to shine through. So by process of elimination, it seems very likely that the tag is applicable here.
