I'm reading it, and I like it, and it helps that new chapters get translated pretty much every day (sometimes a few times per day). To follow up on some of your comments...

  the setting is basically a mix between SCP Foundation, Bloodborne/Dark Souls, Lovecraftian horror and Dickens-lite stories
#+end_quote

You're not kidding here! Bloodborne especially, as one of the aliases the protagonist is using is Gehrman Sparrow, which is a combination of Gehrman the First Hunter from BB and Jack Sparrow from Pirates.

  It's also refreshing that the MC is unable to uplift the world significantly because he doesn't have photographic memory...
#+end_quote

Well, he does kinda get a photographic memory eventually, as well as the ability for others to create copies of things they have read. And another part of the reason he isn't able to uplift the world is because oil essentially doesn't exist, so a lot of the technology he knows about isn't something that is feasible. It is a refreshing take on the trope, though.

  one of the most common criticisms of the novel is that it is translated from Chinese, and thus occasionally suffer from strange prose and anachronistic names.
#+end_quote

I have never seen so much lampooning before!

There's also some amount of cultural differences too. The protagonist seems pretty disgusted by trans characters, and mocks gay people. It took me a long time to figure out, but "curly-haired baboon" is a an awkward turn of phrase that seems to be a translation for a gay slur of some kind. Originally I just thought it was a generic insult, but later on it is used specifically to refer to a gay character.

It definitely isn't the worst kind of work for these things, and they are fairly rare. But each time they kinda caught me by surprise.

  There's also some folks who thinks the protagonist didn't suffer enough permanent consequences from courting death so often.
#+end_quote

I'm not in this camp, but if I had a criticism it would be that the protagonist doesn't really seem to focus on getting back to his original world, nor does he miss his friends/family/old life. Yes, you can argue that his eventual goal is to ascend to godhood and hopefully have enough power to send himself back... but it really doesn't intrude on his mind. It's like he claims he wants to go back because the author feels like that's an obvious thing to want, but by not focusing on what he's missing it just feels like an excuse. It also stood out to me that the protagonist refers to himself by the name of the person whose body he took over, not as his original name. Even internally he thinks of himself as Klein, not Zhou Mingrui. I feel like this is a common isekai problem, where the protagonist being pulled into a new world is just a simple plot device so that audience understands where his references come from, but it isn't how a real person would likely act or think.

Those minor quibbles aside, I second the rec. It's an interesting world with a neat power system that gets used in creative ways.
