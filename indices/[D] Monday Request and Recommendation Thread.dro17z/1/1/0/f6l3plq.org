Yeah, I understand if it's a turn off for a native English reader used to quality stuff like PGtE etc. I'm used to it because I regularly devour translated Japanese/Chinese/Korean series and even stomached through hundreds of chapters of pure machine translations, so I built up quite a tolerance.

I would recommend you to keep reading, at least for a "novel" experience involving the work of a writer from another culture. The writer's plot ideas and weaving narrative definitely shines through despite the occasional bad prose, I guarantee.

Part of the prose is because of the translator's choice of words, but the Chinese language (like other East Asian languages actually) favours a lot of quirks in writing like repetition for emphasis, off-hand references to idioms (that comes off as long-winded in English), onomatopoeia, and words with double/triple meanings which are all relevant in context.

If I have to rate the translation, it turns what should be a 9/10 story into high 7/10. Not as great as it should be, but still definitely worth reading.
