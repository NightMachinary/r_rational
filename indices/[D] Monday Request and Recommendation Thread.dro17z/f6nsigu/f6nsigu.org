This week I watched:

/The Lighthouse/. Very artsy and allegorical, sometimes at its own expense. The horror elements were understated. I confess I don't think it lived up to the hype it's been getting. Pattinson and Dafoe were excellent, but the movie was overlong and, after a fashion, under-resolved. 8/10; if you liked Robert Eggers's other work, /The Witch,/ you'll like this.

/The King/ on Netflix. An amalgamation of Shakespeare's Henriad and the real history of Henry V, I think it tried too hard to hit a middle ground between the two and failed to live up to its promise on either side. I liked, among other things, the reimagining of Falstaff's character and basically everyone's performance. The combat scenes were brutal. Making a Henry V movie without the St. Crispin's day speech is attempting too much to subvert expectations, though. 7.5/10; wonderful cinematography, acting, and sound design that carries a slightly thin script quite far. Undermined a bit by a whitewashing of Henry's motivations and his lack of agency in some ways and a cartoonish depiction of the Dauphin (although Pattinson is magnificently over the top).

And I read J. M. Coetzee's /Disgrace/ in one sitting on a flight. Absolute gutpunch of a novel. A tight and gripping first half that turns exhausting yet held me hostage until I finished it. An interesting meditation on apartheid, reparation, gender relations, and language set in racially divided South Africa. Coetzee's prose is as excellent as always, and the religious symbolism and political commentary manages to be simultaneously overt, explicit, and impartial. 9/10, but I'm never going to read it again.

In terms of web fiction, I'm continuing to be disappointed in the LitRPG / Gamelit stuff out there. From RoyalRoad's offerings, /Azarinth Healer/ was poor, and /New World/ too; the stories available for free trend towards endlessly introspective garbage with more time spent on character stats and bland fight scenes than narrative substance.

/He Who Fights With Monsters/ was quality, though, and I would recommend it (which makes it amongst the only gamelit stuff I would that I've read, along with /Worth the Candle/ and /Threadbare/). I can't quite call it rational fiction, but it is somewhat internally consistent and the main character's social intelligence is higher and better written than you often see in these kind of stories.
