Yeah but for me, the numbers/math is a pro, and it does some cool stuff with it. By having the main character figure out the formulas behind his stats and skills, he can use it to figure out the fastest leveling speed and best skills to buy.

It makes the specific numbers actually meaningful instead of the nearly meaningless stat increases in say, Azarinth Healer and Legend of Randidly Ghosthound (no links because I recommend against them).

If you really want some litrpgs with the stat pages and numbers a rarity, try [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B074C9P3YF/?ie=UTF8&fp=1&pc_redir=T1][Way of the Shaman]].

There's a focus on the game but it's on skill usage instead of increasing the level/skill number. Stat pages are shown like once per book.

PS The preview sample pages on Amazon do a good job of conveying the story. If you don't like it after reading them, don't get them.

PPS Have you tried the [[/r/ProgressionFantasy][r/ProgressionFantasy]] subreddit?
