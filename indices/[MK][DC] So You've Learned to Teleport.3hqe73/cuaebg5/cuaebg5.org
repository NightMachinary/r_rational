If you can move instantaneously, you get to see the future.

If you hang out at the sun, you can teleport instantly to Earth and have 7 minutes of foreknowledge of what the sun will do. Set up a solar flare prediction market and make millions!

Could you leverage instant travel for high frequency trading purposes...maybe not between New York and Chicago, but New York and Tokyo?

Watch out for Jeff Bezos though!
