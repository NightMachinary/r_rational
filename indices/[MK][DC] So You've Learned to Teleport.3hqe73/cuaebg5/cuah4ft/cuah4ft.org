  Could you leverage instant travel for high frequency trading purposes...maybe not between New York and Chicago, but New York and Tokyo?

Only if you can create two portals connecting the cities and put a cable through it to a high frequency trading machine. Otherwise your reaction time is too slow to compete with computers with their ~200 ms ping from NY to Tokyo. Or you need a supplementary power of super-speed and reaction.
