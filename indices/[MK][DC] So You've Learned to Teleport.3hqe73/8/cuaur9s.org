I was hoping he'd mention the required change in momentum when teleporting cross-country, since I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2ckoa4/wp_a_nerdy_kid_discovers_that_magic_spells_work/cjgk7ep][wrote a quick story about that myself]].

You see, teleporting north-south is about as dangerous as teleporting east-west, but for different reasons. When teleporting east, the ground is moving at the same speed but in a different direction, so you find yourself going up. When teleporting away from the Earth's axis (south in the northern hemisphere, north in the southern hemisphere, straight up near the equator), the ground's direction is the same but its speed changes, and you find yourself going west.

And there's variation depending on your latitude - jumping 100km north at the equator is safe, but doing the same at the poles will probably get you killed. Jumping east-west is exactly as dangerous no matter where you do it (proof left as exercise).
