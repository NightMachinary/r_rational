So, let's say your teleportation works by you imagining some object, like Paris or a spot on the surface of the moon, moving you and anything you happen to be holding or wearing to a location near that object, and matching velocity with it.

I think that reflects how the power works in most popular depictions, but it has some interesting implications. Suppose you fire a bullet, teleport to a location and velocity matching the bullet, fire another bullet, teleport to that one, and so on. You could speed yourself up to any velocity you'd like. Now, do that instead with nuclear bombs in space- teleport to the fastest object you can, fire one off, teleport to a velocity matching some of the resulting particles (or shrapnel, if you need a solid object and have some material tough enough to leave near the bomb and not to be vaporized), fire another one off, and so on. I'll bet with a few very easily stolen nuclear weapons and maybe some material made from carbon nanotubes, you could reach relativistic speeds.

You could then use that velocity to skip time. Wait a few seconds at a speed close to /c/, and centuries pass on earth. In that way, you could make safe long-term investments, and instantly see centuries worth of return. You could preserve knowledge and technology through any dark ages, wait until civilization reached some utopian pinnacle, and, assuming money still existed, buy half of it- all in the span of a few subjective days or weeks.
