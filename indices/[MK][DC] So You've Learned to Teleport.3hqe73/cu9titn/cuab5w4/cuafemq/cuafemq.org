The thing I really dislike about discussions on skipping time or immortality is how people seem to forget the difference between a vampire living till present day from say...Victorian England or Ancient Rome and someone from present day living up until a corresponding point in the future.

The vampire would find it far, far easier to gather the wealth and power over centuries without being discovered than any modern child of Facebook and Instagram ever will. Like, we're hoovering up everyone's data today, can you imagine what sophisticated tools we'll develop later on?

Of course, if you're some sort of powerful entity or organization unconcerned with the law or being outed...ignore the above.
