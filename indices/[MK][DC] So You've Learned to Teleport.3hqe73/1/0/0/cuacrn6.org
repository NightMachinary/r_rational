Hmm. One thing Larry didn't seem to go over before publishing was that system-seeding probes wouldn't need to toss out a colony plus a teleport gate - they'd only need to toss out the gate. The entire colony could then be fed through that gate.

Come to think of it, it'd make more sense to toss gates out the back of the probe continuously as it made its way across the galactic disk. Each gate could then start shooting its own probes off at right-angles to the original probe's path, meaning instead of having a single spider-web line of colonies across the galaxy, we'd have an expanding cone with the center of the base sitting on Earth.

Fire two probes in opposite directions and eventually we'd saturate the galaxy in probes and colonies - the only limitation would be setting up mining and refining facilities at a sufficient rate to feed the geometrically-increasing material requirements of the probes.
