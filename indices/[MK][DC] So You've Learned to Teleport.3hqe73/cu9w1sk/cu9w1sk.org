Seconding the recommendation in the video description for the /Jumper/ series by Stephen Gould ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g4jjk/rt_the_jumper_series_by_steven_gould/][which I've linked in this subreddit before]]). /Exo/ is probably my favorite of them, because it's mostly about [[#s][]].
