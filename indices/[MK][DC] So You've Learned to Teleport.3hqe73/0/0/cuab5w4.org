- and you'd be the equivalent of someone time-traveling from centuries ago, in terms of culture and language. Only it would be worse because of the rate of change of technology - someone traveling from even fifty years ago to now could end up with massive future-shock if all the current technologies and social changes were dumped on them.

You'd need to have your money managed by someone (or a trust) which would be prepared for your return and able to bring you up to speed on everything, and who /wouldn't/ simply have gotten so used to having trillions of dollars and corresponding financial power that they'd simply kill you with a 22nd-century weapon you couldn't even recognize, and carry on as they had been doing.

It's also assuming that there were no financial meltdowns, bankruptcies, corruption, or loss of records during that entire time which resulted in your finances vanishing or being stolen, commandeered, or confiscated. Even assuming law enforcement works roughly the same way in a couple of centuries, what are you going to say - "My money was stolen in the collapse of BigCorp eighty years ago; do something!"?
