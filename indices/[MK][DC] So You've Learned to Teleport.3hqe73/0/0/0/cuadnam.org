Well, every investment comes with risk. With enough diversity and probably a heavy investment in government bonds, at least some of the investments would probably survive, and the return on those would be astronomical. Future shock would put you at a serious risk of being scammed, but barring a collapse of society, I think the forces that would prevent people from just killing ordinary stockholders and stealing their assets would apply even to someone several centuries old. Realistically, despite my quip about buying half a civilization, I think you'd become about as rich as a very rich old family, and only personally, rather than financially, outside the bounds of normalcy.

Granted, society might become strange enough that the idea of owning stocks and bonds would no longer apply, but there's no reason you couldn't check in every few years to see how things were going, and move to hard assets if things started to look odd. If the entire idea of people owning things became obsolete, you could consider just skipping that part of history.

Also, if your wealth ever was completely wiped out, so long as civilization was possible, you could probably always find a society willing to buy some ancient artifacts or information, and from there you could try again.
