I want to see a world with stats but without bs magic materials.

​

For instance very powerful people resisting attacks because they are too dense to penetrate. i.e Enemy (who's superhuman already) throws rock at MC, the rock moves at bullet speeds but because of the MCs defense stat, his density is too high and the rock shatters to dust after giving him a small bruise. Maybe if the enemy had use a lead pellet he'd have damaged the MC but his lack of proper equipment to deal with a superhuman means he loses by default.

​

Or bows being uncommon because making a bow strong enough or with enough draw weight to damage a powerful person it'd have to be too big to handle or to be made of very rare materials.

​

People having to use interesting materials for weaponry like lead or gold because of the high density etc.

​

Ranged weapons being lead pellets people throw. Melee weapons having gold tips, crazy stuff like that.

​

I'm reading this LitRPG and some goblins are attacking this MC who could carry a car on his back with bone weapons and they're supposed to be a challenge? Come on, bone wouldn't even scratch his skin at this point it's too dumb to enjoy..
