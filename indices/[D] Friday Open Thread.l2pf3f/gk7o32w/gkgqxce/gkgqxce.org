Effective altrusim - donating blood/platelets/plasma. Especially COVID-convalescent plasma.

I did my first plasma donation today, I've donated blood only twice before. I got $65, not for the plasma, but for my time according to them. It took about 4 hrs though it was supposed to be only 2.5 hrs for a first timer. They pay $100 for donations of tested COVID convalescent plasma. I suspect I had COVID back in Feb 2020, but that's way past the CDCs 4 month estimate of the antibody presence in blood, and during that time the virus was just starting to ramp up anyways.

I was inspired to donate by the Lex Fridman podcast with Michael Mina about rapid testing. I recommend trying both the podcast and donating. Plasma goes especially far in this day and age. The pricing makes it easy to see how badly the stuff is needed. My plasma bottle was marked "for manufacturing use only", so that was neat.
