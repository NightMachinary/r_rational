It's pretty obvious it was just bad a personal experience you had and you just dug up something on demand. That article mentions nothing about the training of the nurses, and the patient complications they referenced were from people who deliberately bypassed the safeties. Lets be rational about it.

If it's specifically the for-profit companies that bother you, plasma donations are taken by non-profit blood donation centers as well.

Again, covid-convalescent plasma is especially important now, no article from 2014 is going to change that.
