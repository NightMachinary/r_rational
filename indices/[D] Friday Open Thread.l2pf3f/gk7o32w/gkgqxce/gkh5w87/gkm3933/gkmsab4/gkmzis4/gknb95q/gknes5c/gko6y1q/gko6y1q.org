  No, 60 or so donations from years ago isn't enough to cover the plasma demand today that readers of this subreddit could help with.

I didn't say that it was. I assumed that maybe a dozen, or possibly even several dozen, people here would consider donating plasma, and that most of them wouldn't go through with it, and that the majority of those who went through with it would be likely to only make one or two donations each. If those assumptions were correct, and my comment about it put those possible donors off the idea of donating, then I've already covered that number of donations, I've already made as many donations as I (possibly) prevented.

But that was an extremely liberal estimate. You got like two or three upvotes.

[[https://abcnews.go.com/US/thousands-low-income-americans-donate-blood-plasma-profit/story?id=44710257][Nearly 80 percent of the plasma centers in the U.S. are located in America's poorer neighborhoods.]]

Realistically, the demographics don't match up. I'm stereotyping /really/ hard here, I'll own that, but I feel like, generally, most of the people who frequent this subreddit would probably be likely to only make a couple of donations at most, if any at all, because they would probably be doing it as "something to do for charity," just a donation or two to get the feeling of having made a difference and then not have to deal with the discomfort/inconvenience anymore, when really the plasma industry is relying on people in poverty who each individually give donations on a regular basis out of desperation/necessity and who each make hundreds and hundreds of donations over the course of /years/ in spite of the track marks and bruises it leaves on your arms, and the weakness/fatigue that comes with doing it once every three or four days for an extended period of time, and the time commitment of having to wait in a lobby for two or three hours before you get the chance to sit for another hour and a half with a needle in your arm. The people who give the most are doing it to survive, and I think most of the people who do it for the sake of "doing a good deed" aren't likely to give more than once each.

Who knows? I might be furthering your cause. Maybe one or two people who weren't inspired by your initial comment will react to what I've said by donating once a week for a month or two out of spite just to prove me wrong because Elizabeth is an insufferable know-it-all. Maybe several more people will make the same decision and then after their first donation decide that maybe they don't really want to go through with doing it more than once.

Regardless, I'm disowning the donations I made, and I'm now retroactively making those donations on behalf of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Boom, you just /instantly/ got somewhere between 60 and 90 donations from [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Congratulations, that's way more donations than I'd've expected you to get for only getting like two upvotes.

I'm not trying to be some type of way, and I don't not understand the need for plasma, but the industry really is kinda problematic and it isn't without risk for the donors. There's a shortage of liver donors too, but you don't go around advocating for everybody to donate a part of their liver (though I'm sure if they could pay poor people to do it the way they do with plasma, they would).

I'll leave with this:

I was extraordinarily stupid not to tell her to remove the needle the instant I felt electricity shoot down into my hand. I let it sit there touching my nerve for a full 15 minutes.

People still /need/ to donate plasma, and nerve injuries can happen during /any/ type of blood draw, not just plasma donation, so if anyone is bothering to look at the Friday thread like 3 days after it was posted, what you should take away from this exchange is that any time you get stuck for any reason, if you feel electricity, or anything unusual at all, immediately demand the needle be removed.
