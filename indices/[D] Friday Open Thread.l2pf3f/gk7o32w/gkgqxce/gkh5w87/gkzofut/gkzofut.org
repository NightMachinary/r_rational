I'm about to post a story to the January fiction challenge that features blood donation. What a coincidence.

I've yet to donate platelets this year. You inspired me to schedule my next appointment.

If I were to find that I have covid19 antibodies, I'd probably switch to plasma. My clinic doesn't pay anyone for their donations... I'm not sure if I'd switch to one that does. Hmmm.
