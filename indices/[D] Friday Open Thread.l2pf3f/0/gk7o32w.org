Fiction so rarely captures the inanity of bureaucracy properly. I just had to send an email asking one of our vendors to pretty please not cut us off because we're going to be late paying them because the money allocated to paying them was written down as being associated with the wrong purchasing group, which has spawned a multi-week "oh no what do we do how do we fix this" festival.

Like, this isn't people actively blocking anything. Everyone involved in the conversation wants things to be worked out and is willing to do their part in getting it there! It just takes this long anyway!
