Time Loop and kids:

lets say you have a non adult stuck in a time loop. Lets say they re-experience the same month over and over, remembering the past iterations and being able to do stuff differently. The world is our world in 2021. How would their psyche change?

How would that affect kids at different ages?

Examples:

- A 15 year old stuck in a 30-day time loop for 100 loops

- A 10 year old stuck in a 30-day time loop for 100 loops

- a 5 year old stuck in a 30-day time loop for 100 loops
