No, it isn't selfish not to do this specific altruism. There's plenty of other things that need doing. Plain cash donations to the Against Malaria Foundation is pretty effective (even better if it's cash from donating plasma).

I hope venting helped a little. Do you think everyone should be scared off from donating plasma? I think the answer to that is obvious, and while not donating because of a personal bad experience is fine, a long public anecdote is a bit self-centered and not much of a public service announcement. "A hugely non-insignificant percent of the people sticking you at those places are very inexperienced" is just unqualified.
