  That article mentions nothing about the training of the nurses...
#+end_quote

Does it not? From the article (first paragraph, btw):

#+begin_quote
  A white-coated attendant (workers aren't required to have medical or nursing degrees) pricked my arm.
#+end_quote

Sure, not specifically about training.

[[https://regs.health.ny.gov/content/section-58-214-serial-plasmapheresis][New York law]]:

#+begin_quote
  Personnel training. All persons performing plasmapheresis procedures shall have completed a training program in plasmapheresis procedure technique. The training program must include training in donor screening, venipuncture techniques, instrument operation, prevention of and initially addressing donor reactions, and proper documentation of all completed procedures.
#+end_quote

Training program is usually 8 to 12 weeks. Can't find source.

#+begin_quote
  ... and the patient complications they referenced were from people who deliberately bypassed the safeties.
#+end_quote

The article was inspired by the author's own experience of complications after his very first donation, which happened by the book. He quotes 5 people. The first three lied. The last two didn't. He says he interviewed "three-dozen regulars" and "more than half of them" lied on the questionnaire or cheated one of the tests.

Did you actually read the article, or did you skim it?

  Again, covid-convalescent plasma is especially important now, no article from 2014 is going to change that.
#+end_quote

It might be helpful. But it might not do anything at all. A couple of small trials have shown that there might be a small reduction in severity or duration. Is that truly indicative of anything? Something something p-hacking?

#+begin_quote
  ... while not donating because of a personal bad experience is fine, a long public anecdote is a bit self-centered and not much of a public service announcement.
#+end_quote

For one thing, I think I've donated enough to cover +most of the regular commenters on this sub+ at least like 70 people. It was 2012. I needed money for weed (or rather, y'know, /fake weed/, "spice/incense/potpourri"). I donated twice a week, every week, for like 6 months (conservative estimate). That's at least 48 donations. Then I donated again for about 2 months in 2017 (not for drugs, we were in danger of foreclosure), another 16ish donations. I've personally donated at least 60 or 70 batches of plasma, possibly as many as 80 or 90 batches. [EDIT: My point was, if anyone reading this had an intention to donate plasma before reading my comment, and my comment has dissuaded you from donating, you can mentally claim one of my donations as a donation made on your behalf, to assuage any moral discomfort you may be feeling as a result of deciding not to donate.]

For another, you recommended plasma donation with no qualifications. I felt obligated to provide them. It's not without risk.

[[https://www.healthline.com/health/donating-plasma-side-effects#citrate-reaction]]

#+begin_quote
  During a plasma donation, the technician will infuse a substance known as an anticoagulant into the blood collected in the plasma-separating machine before the blood is returned to your body. This anticoagulant is meant to prevent blood clots from forming. The plasma in the machine retains most of the citrate, but some will also enter your bloodstream.

  In the body, citrate binds together a small amount of calcium molecules for a short amount of time. Because this effect is small and temporary, most people experience no side effects from citrate. However, a small number of people who donate plasma experience what's called a “citrate reaction” from the temporary loss of calcium.
#+end_quote

It certainly doesn't always, but a citrate reaction /can/ cause you to have a heart attack.

You say "a long public anecdote is a bit self-centered," but I say "it's kind of irresponsible to advocate plasma donation so casually based on your own anecdotal experience of it."
