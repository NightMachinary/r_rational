COVID-convalescent plasma is important for research and production, not for direct therapies, though they use that too to save lives.

They're offering double monetary reward, I think that's a pretty good indication of value. It's just in demand worldwide and plasma donation is being requested of everyone who tests positive for the anti-bodies, they send mail, call you, and ask you in person.

I thought YOU skimmed the article, because even after all that quoting line by line it just doesn't back up your assertion that the staff are commonly under-trained. Bringing up the NY law didn't really help there either.

No, 60 or so donations from years ago aren't enough to cover the plasma demand today that readers of this subreddit could help with. I'm confident in asserting that without qualifications.

I spent 2 hours watching presentations and reading documents on the risks, including the citrate reaction and several others that the article doesn't mention, and so will anyone who chooses to donate. I made my suggestion without all that extra info because we (me, you, the journalist) aren't medical professionals. I do CNC machining, my hands are important too, but so is donating plasma.
