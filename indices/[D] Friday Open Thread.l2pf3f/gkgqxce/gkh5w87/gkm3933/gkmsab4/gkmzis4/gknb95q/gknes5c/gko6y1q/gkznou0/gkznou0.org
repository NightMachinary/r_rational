  so if anyone is bothering to look at the Friday thread like 3 days after it was posted, what you should take away from this exchange is that any time you get stuck for any reason, if you feel electricity, or anything unusual at all, immediately demand the needle be removed.

Seconded. One time a nurse went all the way through one of my veins. I should have said something about the pain. Luckily I came away with just a bruise.

I still donate fairly regularly. I avoid the blood bus (where that incident happened) and I have the clinic stick the other arm, which I'm told is easier to work with. If somebody screws up again, well, I'll mention it immediately.
