The very last time I ever donated plasma, the nurse was in a bad mood and just stuffed the needle into me and I felt electricity shoot down my arm into my hand, and I said as much, but she just said something dismissively uninterested and walked away. The donation happens in multiple rounds of pumping and recirculating, so after the first round I told another nurse something like "get this goddamn needle out of my arm" and then for the next 8 months I had trouble bending my ring and pinkie fingers on that hand, and there was a numbness/tingling on the ring/pinkie side of the hand for the entire 8 months which didn't fully go away until another several months later. Nerve damage.

I looked it up at the time, and apparently there's a pretty important nerve that runs directly beside the vein they stick for plasma, and the nurse poked it. I got lucky to fully recover. It's not impossible for the damage to be permanent if they do more than simply poke the nerve. A hugely non-insignificant percent of the people sticking you at those places are very inexperienced.

I type. Finger dexterity is required. I make music with FL Studio, and I have plans in the future to hook up a MIDI keyboard for music-making purposes and get back into playing the keyboard. Finger dexterity will be required. I'm in the preliminary stages of beginning to start the process of teaching myself how to draw (meaning I have purchased a single notebook and bookmarked a couple of videos and had passing thoughts about the fact that Skillshare is a thing that exists). Again, fingers. I value my own use of my own hands (not to mention my own lack of permanent neuropathic pain) far more than I value the lives of others. Is that selfish? I don't think it is, and /if/ it is, I don't care, because they're /my/ hands. I'll never donate plasma again.
