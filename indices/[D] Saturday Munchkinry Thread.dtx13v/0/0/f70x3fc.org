Ultimate heckler. Show up at any speech, comedy routine, debate, etc. and make some kind of eye-catching gesture. Then, glare. This will cause them to catch their words,thus appearing incompetent. They might even glance back a couple times, attempting to divine the source of their inexplicable fear, in which case they will again be silenced. They will be seen as a stuttering fool by the majority of those watching, reputation=destroyed.
