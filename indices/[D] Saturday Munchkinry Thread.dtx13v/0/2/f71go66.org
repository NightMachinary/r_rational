Could try running for President. You'll probably win every presidential debate this way.

There's also the ability for long-distance glaring. Focus binoculars or a telescope on the person, then have a drone, megaphone or other wireless speaker in the person's vicinity state that "I am glaring at you." Since it isn't specified that they have to actually see you when you do this, you'd be able to snipe anyone with your glare.
