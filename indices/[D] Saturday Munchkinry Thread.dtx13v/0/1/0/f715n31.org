The mechanism: when you simply glare at the target and the target is aware, nothing magical actually happens yet. The target simply feels a mundane level of fear from being aware that he/she is being glared at by you.

The magic happens whenever the target X attempts to speak. At the moment when X is about to speak, X will magically perceive your glare as being massively intensified. Any bystanders will not notice anything magical happening, but the target X will be intimidated to the point where X cannot speak, for as long as X attempts to speak.

But once X stops attempting to speak, the magic disappears (until X next attempts to speak). That is why the target X can take other actions, but not speak: No magic happens except when they try to speak.

So if you try to use this in combat as a distraction, it would only work if your opponents are chatty. You can taunt them to respond to you, to manipulate them into trying to talk to their allies, etc. But if they are the silent killer type, your ability won't be any use at all.
