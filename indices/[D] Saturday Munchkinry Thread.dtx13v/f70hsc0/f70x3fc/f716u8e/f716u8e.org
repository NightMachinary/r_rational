Problem: the target must be aware that you specifically are glaring at him/her. They will not need to divine the source of their inexplicable fear: they either know it is you or they won't feel any fear.

You can destroy their reputation using this method, but they will know you are responsible.

On the plus side: any bystanders that you aren't glaring at won't notice anything magical happening. So if the silenced celebrity tries to blame you for their silence, people will be confused by why the celebrity is so cowardly as to be silenced by a mere glare.
