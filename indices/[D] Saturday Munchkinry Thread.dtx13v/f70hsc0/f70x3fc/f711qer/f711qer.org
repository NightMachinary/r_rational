"Enough fear to paralyze the vocal cords" is a lot of fear.

The strength of this power depends on the mechanism. If it's "target cannot talk but is not particularly afraid," it's pretty limited. If it's "generates enough fear that people are prevented from taking any but the most basic actions," then it's powerful indeed.

The way fear usually works isn't, "your vocal cords are paralyzed specifically," it's "your thinking is interrupted." So if someone cannot speak, then they can't use sign language either, although they can probably make basic communicative gestures.

Most peoples' response to that much fear is to flee or fight, not to realize "my vocal cords are selectively paralyzed so I should attempt sign language."

It's enough fear that it should provide a significant advantage in combat. Courageous soldiers and hardened criminals have probably practiced being combat effective through fear, but even then that's generally expected fear, not fear striking them suddenly. Even so, the best combat use is probably generate fear > they focus on you > your accomplice stabs them in the back.
