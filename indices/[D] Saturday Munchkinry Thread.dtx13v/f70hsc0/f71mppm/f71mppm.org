All towns in the medieval land of Generica may muster special soldiers of three types:

TANK

- Trained to use personal shields which allow them to generate a 10-foot sphere of influence that redirects all harmful attacks (including traps) toward the tank's center of gravity.

- Tanks cannot move when their sphere is active.

- Activation / deactivation time: 0.1 secs. Accomplished by entering a trained mental state.

- Sphere deactivates when shield breaks or tank loses conciousness.

DPS

- Swordsmen and Archers are trained with two-handed weapons capable of shattering any shield in three hits.

HEALER

- Once every 12 hours, healers can restore the health of one active soldier or repair the personal shield of one.

- Healing and repair requires physical contact.
