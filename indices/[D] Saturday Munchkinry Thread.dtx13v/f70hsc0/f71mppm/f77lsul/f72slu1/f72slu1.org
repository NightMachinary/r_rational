Redirecting harmful attacks towards one's center of gravity sounds like a bad idea. For example, if the attack is a molotov cocktail (or other incendiary), you are looking at serious injury or death if you use your shield, whereas you might be able to escape unscathed if you don't use it. That seems like the easy answer to this. Something like a launching crossbow with small flasks of flammable liquid could essentially force tanks to drop their shields or die in a single hit, and could also be fairly effective against other targets.
