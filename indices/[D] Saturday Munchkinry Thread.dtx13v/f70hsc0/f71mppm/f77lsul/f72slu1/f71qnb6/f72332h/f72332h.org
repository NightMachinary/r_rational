  Tank shields state that they can redirect traps. Who is making these traps?
#+end_quote

It doesn't matter. Any attack or trap made with harmful intentions is redirected.

#+begin_quote
  you need 4 coordinated attacks in 0.1 secs on a non-tank target within the shield in order to hit the target?
#+end_quote

Yes, if you wanted to be 100% sure of ambushing a target standing beside a tank with an active sphere. 3 attacks to disrupt the sphere (by breaking the tank's shield or rendering them unconscious), with the 4th attack aimed at your target.

#+begin_quote
  does shattering a shield mean the tank can no longer activate it until repaired by a healer?
#+end_quote

Yes. The shield allows the tank to activate their sphere of influence.

#+begin_quote
  So a tank shield can only redirect 3 attacks before being broken until healed?
#+end_quote

Yes, if the attacks hit the shield. But a tank who sees the attack coming could choose to let it hit their body instead of their shield, or pull someone else in the way, etc. They know attacks are attracted to their center of gravity.

#+begin_quote
  What happens if two tanks have overlapping shields? Where are the attacks redirected to?
#+end_quote

Attacks are redirected to the user of the first sphere the attack touches.

#+begin_quote
  Is the redirection of attacks instantaneous?
#+end_quote

You can think of it as a magnet redirecting attacks. Eg: If you threw a rock at a target within a tank's sphere, the rock's flight path would redirect the moment it became influenced, curving toward the tank's center of gravity.

#+begin_quote
  Since it can bend any attack towards the tank, a tank + archer combo should be able to build up tons of arrows circling a tank with a consistently flickering shield, turning the tank into something like a fragmentation grenade.
#+end_quote

Interesting. A few downsides:

- The arrows' velocity would bleed off as normal, limiting how long you could keep them circling and how lethal they'd be once released.

- Tank can't move while sphere is active.

- Mental exertion of "flickering" probably can't be maintained for long. I can't even rapidly alternate saying "ON / OFF" without soon slurring my words, let alone entering a specialized state of mind.

- High risk. (Hope the tank doesn't get distracted.)

- Obvious setup. I wonder why those massed archers are aiming at that tank by our front lines?

- Situational. Traditional archer tactics possibly more effective?

A coordinated tank / archer team could bend arrows around obstacles tho. Creative possibilities.
