  Thinking about it further, I'm somewhat confused by how the tank shield could redirect all traps. Consider a simple pitfall trap.

That's what I get for speaking in absolutes lol. A simple pitfall could be an effective anti-tank trap, as there's no physical attack to redirect. Just a long drop and a sudden stop.

  Does the revealed pit magically move below the tank faster than the ally can fall in?
#+end_quote

Nope. This isn't a reality warping technique. It's simply magical magnetization.

  possibly accelerating along the way like a railgun
#+end_quote

No. The momentum of an attack (eg, an arrow) would decrease as normal over time and distance.

  Double tank plays!

Fighting alone against a pair of coordinated tanks in hand-to-hand combat would be a pain to deal with. But the tanks would have to be careful about friendly fire. In that situation, I don't know if the best tactic is getting close or staying away from the pair.
