Questions:

- Tank shields state that they can redirect traps. Who is making these traps?
- DPS can shatter shields in three hits, but shields activate and deactivate in 0.1 secs? Does that mean you need 4 coordinated attacks in 0.1 secs on a non-tank target within the shield in order to hit the target?
- Alternatively, does shattering a shield mean the tank can no longer activate it until repaired by a healer? So a tank shield can only redirect 3 attacks before being broken until healed?
- What happens if two tanks have overlapping shields? Where are the attacks redirected to?
- Is the redirection of attacks instantaneous? Or can a skilled tank flicker its shield to bend the path of an attack without making it hit the tank? Since it can bend any attack towards the tank, if this works, a tank + archer combo should be able to build up tons of arrows circling a tank with a consistently flickering shield, turning the tank into something like a fragmentation grenade.
