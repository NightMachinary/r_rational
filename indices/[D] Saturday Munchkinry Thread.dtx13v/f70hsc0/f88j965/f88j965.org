You would make the best character assassin as a media host of some show. Get whoever the flavour of the week is on there, dig up their skeletons and ask them pointed and uncomfortable question and then watch as they become terrified and refuse to answer.

Or lob them an easy question that they can launch into their talking point on, and then prevent them from doing so while castigating them for purporting to support a certain bill, candidate, product, or whatever but being unwilling to actually put their voice to it.

You would also make a great criminal lawyer. Any time you don't want your client to talk, they literally cannot. You might even be able to interfere with your opposition's questioning.
