You have the ability to silence literally anyone with an intimidating glare. Courageous soldiers, hardened criminals, fearless madmen, no one is immune.

As long as (1) You are glaring at some target X, and (2) that target X is aware that you are glaring at him/her, the target X will not be able to speak a single word. Specifically, target X will feel extreme fear towards you whenever he/she tries to speak, fear enough to paralyze his/her vocal cords. Target X can still do other things, like use sign language, or write words, or move behind an obstacle to avoid your glare, or attack you.

Your ability works through the photons that bounce between you and the target X. So your glare can work through reflections and other ways of bending light. But does not work through cameras and screens. And does not work in total darkness.

What can you do with this power?
