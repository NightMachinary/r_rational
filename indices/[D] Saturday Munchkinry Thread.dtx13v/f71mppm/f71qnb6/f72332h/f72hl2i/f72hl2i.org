Thinking about it further, I'm somewhat confused by how the tank shield could redirect all traps.

Consider a simple pitfall trap. An ally walks over the trap while in the tank's sphere. Does the revealed pit magically move below the tank faster than the ally can fall in? What happens to the material that was under the tank? What if the ally was carrying the tank on his shoulders?

  Attacks are redirected to the user of the first sphere the attack touches.

Ooooh! Double tank plays! They can flicker overlapping shields in alternation to constantly bounce attacks back and forth between them. That's much much easier than the orbiting arrows idea.

Also outside of the 3v3 combat situation, you could setup a chain of tanks with overlapping spheres, each deploying its sphere after the previous one, and when an an attack enters the sphere of the last tank, it will be chain redirected all the way to the first tank, possibly accelerating along the way like a railgun. Though the first tank would probably be sacrificed in the resulting blast.
