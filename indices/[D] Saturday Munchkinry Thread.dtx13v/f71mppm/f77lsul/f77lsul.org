In a face-to-face fight without sneaky stuff, take two Archers and one Tank.

Consider: Each Tank is effectively able to take three hits without trouble.

A Healer can re-set a Tank to zero hits (by repairing his shield)

An Archer hits once a round.

So, this enemy group can effectively shrug off six hits, during which time their own Archer is letting off shots. (If the enemy group has a Swordsman instead, then take advantage of the range advantage to kill him).

If I send in:

- All Tanks/Healers: My group can last nine rounds with no damage (as long as at least one is an actual Tank, not three Healers). However, as I have no attacking power, their Archer will destroy my group eventually.

- All archers: First round I do three damage, destroy their shield. Their Archer kills one of mine, their Healer fixes the shield. Second round I do two damage, their Archer kills my second Archer. Third round I smash their shield again, their Archer kills me last Archer. They're vulnerable for the next twelve hours, but they still win.

- One Archer, two tank/healer (at least one an actual Tank): Draw. It all comes down to who gets their first shot off first.

- Two Archers, one Tank: First round, their shield takes two hits, mine takes one. Second round, their shield gets smashed (assume their Healer is really on the ball and repairs it /immediately/ - if not, the second attack kills their Healer and they go down quickly) and then their restored Shield gets one hit. My shield gets a second hit. Third round, their shield is smashed a second time; mine is smashed the first time. Fourth round, their Archer kills one of my guys - doesn't matter which one, because both my Archers shot their Archer in this round, so he goes down. Worst-case scenario, I now have one Archer and one Tank facing one Tank and one Healer, with both Tanks' shields down and the Healer has used his Healing. Two more shots and my team wins.

Of course, all of this may well become moot once Sneaky Stuff comes into play.
