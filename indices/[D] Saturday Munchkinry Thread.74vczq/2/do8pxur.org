According to google, the energy in a lightning strike propagates at approx. 1/3 of lightspeed.

"Riding the Lightning" is an oft-seen electrical superpower.

A 13-pound Pikachu moving at 0.3~c which strikes a stationary object would impart kinetic energy equivalent to a 7-megaton shaped nuclear blast.

Do with that what you will.
