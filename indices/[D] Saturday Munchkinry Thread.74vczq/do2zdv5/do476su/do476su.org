Where in the world is she travelling from? And does she have to end up in the same place? THis will make a hell of a lot of difference, to the extent that I would spend some of the time travelling to a city which still existed 500 years ago and where women are treated less badly if at all possible. Even If I could do this I'd make sure I was wearing modest dress or dress as a man of the period if I could pull it off.

For modern things to sell I would add needles and spices as they were worth a lot by weight. And if I was still menstruating I'd bring several mooncups, and if fertile I would stock the hell up on birth control.
