Laptop computer. She should eventually be able to get an electric generator going so she can charge the battery. Or maybe, just bring a [[https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Zero-Solar-Generator-Nomad/dp/B00GV3XRDW/][solar generator]].

[[https://www.amazon.com/Standard-Mathematical-Formulae-Advances-Mathematics/dp/1439835489][Reference]] [[https://www.amazon.com/CRC-Handbook-Chemistry-Physics-97th/dp/1498754287/][books]]. Prioritize the chemistry book, but don't underestimate the importance of the math one. In fact, if she brought the computer, just load it up with all the reference and history books she can.

Taser. As long as she can charge it, at least.

Money. As in gold and jewelry. Since it's a one way trip, I assume she won't mind maxing out her credit limit.
