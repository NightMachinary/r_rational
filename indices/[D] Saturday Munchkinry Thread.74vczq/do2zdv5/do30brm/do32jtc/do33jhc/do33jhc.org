If it is overwritten, since the setting seems unlikely to survive all those Keter-class SCPs again, avert the travel by any means possible (also so everyone younger than 500 doesn't cease to exist), such as killing herself or using some time dilation SCP (such as a black hole) so by the time her frame of reference reaches "a few hours from now", the universe is over.

If it's self-consistent, generate a one-time pad key and use it to decipher that random text SCP she invents in the past for instructions such as what materials to buy.
