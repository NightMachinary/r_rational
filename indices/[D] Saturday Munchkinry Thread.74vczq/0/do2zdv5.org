I want to write an SCP tale which, at one point, involves a character traveling about ~500 years into the past. The trip is one-way. The character in question is a woman with a Ph.D. in physics. The question is: what should she take with her?

Assume that she has to fit whatever it is she can take into a bag she can reasonably carry. Also, she understands that she has to time-travel only a few hours before she has to use the time machine, so while she has a few hours to make a trip to the local hardware/electronics/something else store, she does not have a lot of time to procure materials.
