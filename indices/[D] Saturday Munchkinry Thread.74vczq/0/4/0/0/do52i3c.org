I do mean for the first bit. You wouldn't want to die from infection while trying to develop a long-term solution.

Maybe it would be worth taking some with? Probably too hard to get a hold of in the specified time-frame.

  Laptop and solar generator
#+end_quote

Amazon was being disagreeable, and I wasn't doing very thorough research; I was just trying to give an idea of the sort of thing I had in mind. You might do something like [[http://www.goalzero.com/p/179/nomad-20-solar-panel][panel]], [[http://www.goalzero.com/p/207/sherpa-100-power-pack][battery]], laptop/tablet. This particular kit would be about 4.5 lbs, plus computer. I would choose a Macbook, weighing 2 lbs. I'm sure there's a more optimal solution, but I'm not willing to spend an hour researching this, when the time-traveller in question only has 2 or 3 hours to shop. As for laptop vs. tablet, there are a few arguments for laptop: fully-featured OS, keyboard, and less likely to crack the screen. I know there are solutions for tablets that do all this, but at that point they're basically laptops.

2.5" HD sounds like a bad idea. Solid state is where it's at. Maybe just grab a bunch of USB sticks.

  assuming she's got the time to get this all set up
#+end_quote

I'm thinking she should call a few friends and ask them to download all the crap she could potentially need. Of course, there's likely to be that one friend who fills up the drive with movies, games, and porn...
