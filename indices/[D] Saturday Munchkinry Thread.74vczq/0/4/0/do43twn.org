Antibiotics have a shelf life, and they'll gradually become ineffective over time, especially if stored in less than optimal conditions. They're cheap and lightweight, not a bad idea for the first year, maybe two. However, I wouldn't go for trying to isolate penicilium mold and extracting penicillin, I would just lean towards making synthetic antibiotics.

Laptop and solar generator are probably a bad idea, they're very heavy and I think you'd need 300-400 watts for a laptop. The solar generator you linked is 39.5 lb, and I don't see many laptops less than 2.5 lb. However, you could use a [[https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIACYN5R34804][tablet]] (1.5 lb.) and you'd only need a 24 watt solar generator for that (like [[https://www.amazon.com/BigBlue-Portable-Waterproof-Sunpower-Rechargeable/dp/B071G4CQSR/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1507538293&sr=1-2-spons][this]] at 1.3 lb., but you'd need an adapter). It looks like there are also some tablets with USB ports, so you could take a [[https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA9DE5MM1470][4 TB external HD]] (0.53 lb.) full of reference data to plug into it. I'll agree that bringing electronically stored reference data is probably one the best things she could do, assuming she's got the time to get this all set up.
