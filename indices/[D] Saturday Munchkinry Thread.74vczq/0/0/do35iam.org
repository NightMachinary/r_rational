Seeds would probably be among the most valuable things to bring, since modern GM crops are vastly more productive than the crops of 500 years ago, and there's no way she would be able to duplicate them in her lifespan. Aside from that, a topographical map and a good compass (one with marked out bearings) would be absurdly useful for navigating. A map of current or historical mining sites to go along with that would give her a huge advantage.

However, to survive long enough for any of that to matter, she'll probably need to start with warm clothes, a raincoat, several pairs of socks, a cooking pot, a hatchet, a good pair of hiking shoes, a tent and sleeping bag, a lighter, a gun, a magnifying glass, a knife, a rope, some clear plastic bags (garbage and resealable), some water bottles, and enough trail mix and/or hard candy to last her for at least a week.
