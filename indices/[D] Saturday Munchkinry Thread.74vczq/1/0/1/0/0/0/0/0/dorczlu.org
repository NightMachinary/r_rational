Going off the default assumption that it's messing with quantum events (or controlling which everett branch you end up in) and wants to expend the minimum amount of effort to accomplish its goal of making the dice come up in a desired way. Then it seems rather inevitable that the difficulty of getting something to occur will happen to correspond to the likelihood of it happening.

Like in this formulation it's nearly impossible to conceive of how the "difficulty" as far as the dice's concerned /couldn't/ correspond to the probability of finding yourself in a given set of everett branches. What i'm going with is the purest form of probability pump I could come up with that meets the canon requirements of always working and not just using telekinesis (based on the author's comment).

I also prefer this to an interpretation that it predicts all future events, simply because due to quantum randomness that's impossible and thus you can't get away from the fact the dice has to mess with quantum events to achieve certainty that it will work as specified.
