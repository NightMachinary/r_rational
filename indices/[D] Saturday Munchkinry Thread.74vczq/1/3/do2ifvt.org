  are, at most, only 5% more likely to land on any side than any other side. (your skill doesn't work on weighed dice)

What about non-weighted magnetic dice? So it is equally likely to land on any side... unless you throw it on top of a magnet.

The magnetic field would "interfere with the die" while it's being rolled, but doesn't actually stop the die from rolling. So it should still land on its intended face... except the magnetic field stops it from landing on its intended face since it repels the other side...
