The simplest way to do this seems to be via gambling. I start off by making a few small bets and controlling the dice such that I lose most of them - this ensures that the dice are controllable and not weighted. Then I put on a big bet and win it.

Repeat as necessary, with the size of the big bet doubling each time until I start running into maximum bet sizes.
