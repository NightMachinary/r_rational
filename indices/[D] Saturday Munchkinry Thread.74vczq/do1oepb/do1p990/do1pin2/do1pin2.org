So the regular method for rolling dice to land on a side would involve knowing exactly how to move your body so the dice would move to land on one side (seeing as how dice are only psuedo-random.) Instead of you personally knowing how to roll the die, you "power" does, and you tap into it to get down the body movements to roll the dice. The "power" can also predict anything that would interfere with the dice roll (from wind to other people) and so long as there's a physical motion corresponding to the proper roll you can execute you'll get it to land on the face you want. But, as I specified, someone completely stopping the die means that you can't complete the roll, meaning there is no possible way you can move to land on the proper side.
