Roll a die down a miniature escalator going up such that it rotates by 90 degrees when it barely falls off each step. Send two bits by stopping the escalator such that the die rolls down a total of 4n,4n+1,4n+2 or 4n+3 steps. Receive them by deducing the modulus from the side that's up at the start.
