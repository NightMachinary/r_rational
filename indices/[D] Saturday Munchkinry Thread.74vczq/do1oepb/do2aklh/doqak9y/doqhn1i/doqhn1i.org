If the power really doesn't care about duration one can quite easily work around that by making the machines such that they will make the dice roll onto a certain number other than the one the power's trying to make them land on.

Thus the easiest way for the power to get its desired number will be to cause the event which triggers the machine to let it land on that number. Basically if you set it up that way then you just need to ensure the event you're trying to force happen is more likely to occur than the machine breaking.
