  Tampering with the machine seems easier.

Well no the whole point is to construct the machine(s) such that the chance of them malfunctioning is less likely than the chance of a given event occurring.\\
I'm not planning on using this probability pump to do anything as extreme as affecting lottery drawings. It should be pretty easy to make a machine that has a less than 10% chance of failing and with that I can cause events that would otherwise have a 10% or greater chance of happening to occur most of the time. Similarly I can do the same thing in reverse to stop many highly likely events from occurring.
