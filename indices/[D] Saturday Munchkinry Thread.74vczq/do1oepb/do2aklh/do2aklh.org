Well I think I know a way to use the dice to generate free energy, however given the limits on the size of the dice that won't be of much real use until the singularity (after which your artificial body might well be a megastructure and that 5% difference in dice fairness could correspond to absurd amounts of mass). However that isn't going to be game breaking over the desired timescales, but luckily I also thought of a way to use it to generate many types of arbitrary information.

How this works is that since dice are actually deterministic it should be possible to make a machine that nudges the dice in midair so that it lands on a particular side, given machines can reliably predict a coin flip in the air this seem highly plausible. Then the trick is to have that machine keep hitting the dice to keep it in midair for a while (but still a definitely finite amount of time so it will eventually land).\\
Now the way you use this to leverage the information about the future, is to make it so that the most likely way the machine stops hitting the dice and makes sure it's last hit would make it land on the desired number is for the machine to detect some change in stock prices or the like.

Basically you rely on the fact that the power must necessarily be able to manipulate quantum events and massively leverage the butterfly effect in order to work in every conceivable scenario it has to work in. Thus even if it only achieves this manipulation through somehow controlling your body it still effectively works the same way as a probability pump. So all you need to do is arrange your setup so that the easiest way for it to get the dice to roll a specified number is for it to manipulate the stock market or some other systems.\\
The real important thing to keep in mind is that the odds of your machine malfunctioning need to be smaller than the odds of whatever event you are trying to cause. I am also assuming it's control over you in how it makes you roll the dice doesn't extend back in time too far, otherwise it might try to mess with your mind in order to ensure you never build your probability pump or other such things.

Anyway as for becoming the richest person alive by 2020 that should be easy by just messing with the stock market. Once I was the richest person alive i'd probably use it by hooking my machine up to prediction markets or something else quantifiable so as to control world affairs massively by having many dice in the air for years, with machines hooked up to let them down when future events occurred.
