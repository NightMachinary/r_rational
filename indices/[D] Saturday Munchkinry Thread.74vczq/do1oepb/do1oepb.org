You gain the preternatural ability to roll dice to whichever side you want every single time provided the dice have the following properties

- are platonic solids
- are, at most, only 5% more likely to land on any side than any other side. (your skill doesn't work on weighed dice)
- are capable of being picked up by you with at most both arms, and at minimum two fingers, without the use of chemical bonds
- aren't capable of switching which face is which (such as, for example, through the use of lcd screens).
- aren't self-propelled

Restrictions that /don't/ exist on your ability include:

- you don't need to know the starting state of the dice.
- even if something interferes with the die while it's being rolled, but doesn't actually stop the die from rolling, it'll still land on your intended face. (Although if an external force completely stops the roll, your power doesn't set the state of the die.)

You have until January 1st 2020 to become the richest person in the world. Can you do it?

(as per usual, your utility function gets replaced with "become richest person in the world," although this doesn't actually give you any more willpower.)
