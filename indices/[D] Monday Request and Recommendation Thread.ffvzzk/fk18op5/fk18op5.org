I have been reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-throne-of-heaven-a-bleach-rewrite.56774][The Throne of Heaven]] which someone posted in this sub last week or so, it's a rewrite of Bleach that attempts to make sense and tie everything together from the very beginning. It's an enjoyable read if you're fan of the series and can get past the fact the writer is in desperate need of a beta.

Another Bleach fanfic that I also would like to recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bleach-worm-arana.305947/][Arana]] by the (in)famous Ryuugi (so don't expect it to be finished, ever). It's a Worm/Ward crossover, but you don't need much knowledge about Ward to enjoy it since it pretty much does away with canon early on. Honestly, I'm not sure whether I would say there's much about the fic itself that is worth writing home about (aside from the last few chapters which are great), no I'm recommending this more due to the sheer amount of worldbuilding/rants/informational posts that it has, which are probably twice the word count of the fic itself. How much value you get out of it probably depends on how much you care about making some sense out of Bleach's highly convoluted setting, and how much Ward bashing you can handle (although most of his criticism is pretty legit, but it's a pseudo-rational analysis of a work that is not trying to be rational at all so tread with care I guess).

Anyone know of any other good, or at least decent or interesting Bleach fics that are worth reading?
