The trope of underestimating an overpowered main character has been done to dust by now, but what about overestimation? Specifically, something like the MC going on a jaunty adventure with no clear plan, which figures of authority work themselves up about and completely misinterpret as having some clear reasoning and deep political motivations, with some tragic background to go along with it.

I've read some stuff with tidbits of this, the most recent being the non-rational Naruto fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5339486/chapters/12328958][Reverse]]. Also [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4]], though it doesn't quite go as far as I would like it to. Are there more works with this sort of trope in them? Doesn't have to be rational.
