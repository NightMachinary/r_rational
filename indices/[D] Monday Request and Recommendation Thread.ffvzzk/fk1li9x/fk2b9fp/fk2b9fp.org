[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Tanya_the_Evil][The Saga of Tanya the Evil]] is a strong example of this trope.

The protagonist is a salaryman who was isekaid into an alternate universe in which magic is real. He grows up as an orphan girl (Tanya) pressed into service in World War I due to her strong aptitude for magic.

Other characters view Tanya as a prodigy who is bloodthirsty to spearhead the fight and/or a valiant saint who sacrifices herself for her troops and her homeland. In reality, everything Tanya does is a desperate attempt to get herself redeployed away from the front lines. Unfortunately for her, her superior officers and underlings keep misinterpreting her words, and her plans go unaccountably well despite her best attempts to fail.
