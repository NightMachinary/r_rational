You realize that Calvin is basically an alternate version of Elliot, right? That when his mother tried to summon a perfect hero, the system incarnated Elliot into the body of a newborn, I.E. it thought Elliot(or an alternate version thereof) was the perfect hero to tackle all the world's problems. I suspect that this is [HPMoR SPOILERS] a deliberate reference to HPMoR, where Harry Potter was a mindwiped copy of Voldemort's soul who was raised as an infant by caring, loving parents, and turned out reasonably well-adjusted, and who was the only one who could psycho!voldemort(it takes one to know one kind of thing.

So either the system made Elliot an advisor to himself, or more likely Elliot avoided getting mindwiped by copying himself into the system(itself a deliberate play on the xianxia trope of having an ancestor ghost advisor, I think). Yes, Calvin is impulsive and arrogant and reckless and that's bad, but that's baked into his character from the very beginning and he's being punished for his hubris, as he should be. His negative traits are also obviously being aggravated by Calvin's unbroken string of successes, and above all by having Elliot as a little amoral devil on his shoulder egging him on to greater risk/reward scenarios, with the threat of turning The One against him if he doesn't advance fast enough.

Like I said, I think that outside the harem stuff this writer is on top of his game, big kudos to him.
