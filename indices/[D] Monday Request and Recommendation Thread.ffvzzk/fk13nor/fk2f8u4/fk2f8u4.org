I too binged this one overt the past week, and greatly enjoyed it. It's somehow effortlessly clever and funny, and I found myself thinking many times how much better this freaking free webnovel is then just about any book I've read (and paid for) in the past year, and certainly better than any comedy book I've read since Pratchett died.

And man is it original! The setting is a bit humdrum at times, but then all of a sudden the magic system or worldbuilding will shock me with how cool and clever it is. Not to mention the plot, which I suspect is at least partly inspired by some of the best parts of HPMoR.

I often see glimmers of Mother of Learning and Worth the Candle in the powers and power interactions, as well, like how the MC gets a lot of cheats, but it never actually feels like they're cheats because not only does he never stop being challenged, he also never stops challenging himself and pushing himself further, often crazily so.

But yeah, the only real mark against it is the unfortunate presence of the dreaded harem, made even worse by the increasing flanderization of the female characters, which in the later chapters has become bad enough to detract from my enjoyment of the story a bit.
