If you want something fun with some really interesting magic try Magik Online. It's kind of like litrpg, except that the players have an app on the phone which lets them buy spells to use. But the thing is that spells can be used almost endlessly, which leads to some interesting fights. Also the spells have some really good creativity, and they go from moving soil in a 10m radius around you to being able to exterminate planets. It's currently on hiatus but it ended at an okay spot.

Wake of the Ravager might be similar to Nanocultivation, in that it's set in the far future with high tech stuff (it has a system and AI). It's enjoyable and can be hilarious at times, but it does have a harem (although it's done in one of the better ways I've seen).
