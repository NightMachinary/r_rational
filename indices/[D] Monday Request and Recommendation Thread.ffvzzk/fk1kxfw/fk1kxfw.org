Any suggestions for something that's, for lack of a better term, Wizards As Fuck? /Earthsea/ definitely fits the Wizards As Fuck vibe, while /Mother of Learning/ and /Harry Potter/ do not. All three certainly contain magic, but only Earthsea has the sort-of-Arthurian vibe I'm looking for.

I suspect something's wizardness depends strongly on both the mechanics of the world (true name magic, geases, the fae, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords) and the structure of the plot, but I lack the vocabulary to express it more concisely.
