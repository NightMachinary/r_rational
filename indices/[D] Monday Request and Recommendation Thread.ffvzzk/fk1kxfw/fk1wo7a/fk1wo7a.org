Lawrence Watt-Evans' Ethshar series has stories about witches Wizards, Witches, Sorcerors, etc... With a Single Spell is a good one to start with.

"Off to Be the Wizard" by Scott Meyer has wizardry which is actually programming. It doesn't go too deep into the programming aspect and is more lighthearted wish fulfillment but it was a fun read.

The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss is good and about a school of magic. The third book will be released any decade now.

"A Wizard's Life" trilogy by Eric Guindon is decent. The magic system isn't rational at all and the plot isn't too complicated but I really like the ending.
