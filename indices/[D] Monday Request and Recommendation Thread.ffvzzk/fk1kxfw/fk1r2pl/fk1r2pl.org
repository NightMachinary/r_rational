/The Magicians/ by Lev Grossman maybe?

KJ Parker's more magical stories might fit the bill also, though they tend to be short stories; they are apparently collected in /Academic Exercises/, though you can find a few of them online, like [[https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/summer_2010/fiction_amor_vincit_omnia_by_k_j_parker][/Amor Vincit Omnia/]]

Edit: oh I remembered some others:

- Max Gladstone's Craft Sequence (starting with /Three Parts Dead/)
- China Mieville's /Kraken/
- A lot of Neil Stephenson's books do the wizard thing, but from the tech side. /Anathem/ is the most wizardy of them though.
