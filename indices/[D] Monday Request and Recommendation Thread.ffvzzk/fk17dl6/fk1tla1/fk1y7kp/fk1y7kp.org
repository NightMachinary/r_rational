It's got a much more personal and relatable power scale than the average Xianxia; for example, the main character's major mobility power-up in the second novel is that he buys a cultivation-powered bicycle, and now he can get places without public transit.

It's a progression fantasy, but instead of punching out Cthulhu the main character is working his way up in the world like many young adults without family resources do.
