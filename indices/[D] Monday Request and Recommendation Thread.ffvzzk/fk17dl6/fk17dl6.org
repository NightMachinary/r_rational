Street Cultivation book 2 ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid/chapter/404675/book-ii-chapter-1-preview-soul-application][found here on royal road]]) is nearly complete and will be shifted to Amazon shortly after it's done, so if you want to read it for free, now is the time.

It's a modern take on wuxia/xanxia. It's pretty well written and mostly I've enjoyed it. Book I has a few chapters up for free as well and the whole thing can be bought on Amazon.
