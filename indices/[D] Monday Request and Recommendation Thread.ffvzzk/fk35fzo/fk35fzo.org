I'm so glad that I decided to revisit the Dunes series. It has been a long time.. and yet few things come close to Frank Herbert's awe inspiring world building.

Has anyone come across any good Dunes fanfiction or spin-offs? I'd even love to read short character sketches, they don't have to be completed or long.
