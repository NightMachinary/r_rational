[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] is a bit like that. Sailor Mercury is summoned across worlds and accidentally becomes a dungeon keeper in a rather dark fantasy setting. She goes out of her way to be a nice dungeon keeper, but everyone knows that keepers are irredeemably evil, so she is obviously a particularly diabolical keeper.
