Also, this is a common theme in Tanya fanfics - [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][Political Record]] has Tanya accidentally succeeding her way through the interwar period, and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/][Delinquency Record]] has Tanya accidentally winning at anti-imperialism through capitalism in the post-war period.

Actually, Delinquency Record is super close to "the MC going on a jaunty adventure with no clear plan, which figures of authority work themselves up about and completely misinterpret as having some clear reasoning and deep political motivations" - Tanya just wants to make enough money to retire and avoid the authorities, but they keep on hunting her down which means she needs to keep on making geopolitically destabilizing moves by accident.

(the names of the fanfics are based on the Japanese name - Yojo Senki translates into something like "A Young Girl's War Record")
