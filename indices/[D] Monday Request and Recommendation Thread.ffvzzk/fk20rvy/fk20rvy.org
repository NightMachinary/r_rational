[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy#toc][Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lillijoy]] [RT][WIP] might be the best thing I'm reading right now that I haven't seen on the [[/r/rational]] front page before. It's set in a post-singularity future where a superintelligence has imposed a set of rules on anything less powerful than itself. These rules include things like: don't replicate uncontrollably, and their effect on the setting includes a cyberpunk alternate reality controlled by a game system. Pretty wild stuff.

On the other hand, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re: Trailer Trash]] [RT][WIP] might be the best thing I'm reading right now that I haven't seen on the [[/r/rational]] front page. It's a do-over fantasy where the MC gets accidentally Quantum Leaped into her own childhood. She approaches the situation in an incredibly pragmatic way, modulo still being a real human being with the flaws and motivations of a human being. She sets about fixing the problems that plagued her youth, but everything doesn't go perfectly just because she has future knowledge.

I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters#toc][He Who Fights With Monsters]] [RT-ADJ?][WIP] and it's been pretty darn enjoyable. Some wacky protagonist syndrome, lampshaded. Interesting magic system and some satisfyingly large power scales. The beginning chapters were weakest for me, but I liked it more once other characters showed up.
