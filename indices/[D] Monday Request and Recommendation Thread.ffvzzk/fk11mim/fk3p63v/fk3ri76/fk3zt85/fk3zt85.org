  I don't think he really understood that his friend was a high level mage, either - he mostly thought of him as a librarian.

If it was me, and I was a magic-obsessed teenager, I'd have asked the librarian every single little thing I could think of. He'd be sick of the questions, and probably would want to murder me at some point just to shut me up.

In Azarinth Healer's world of Elos, it is considered taboo to ask anyone about their class, skills or stats, and Ilea (the protagonist) is a recent arrival, so it was understandable that she didn't know about everything.

But this Ruwen has lived his whole life in this world. Didn't his parents (who only died / disappeared a year ago) have "the talk" with him at some point when he was growing up? Not the birds and the bees, but the stats and the skill trees. (har har)

Since mana total is based on Int, I'd think that he'd know /someone/ (which he totally does) who has an Int higher than 16.
