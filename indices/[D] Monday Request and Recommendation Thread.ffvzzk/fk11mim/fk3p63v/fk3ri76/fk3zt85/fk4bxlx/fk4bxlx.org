  If it was me, and I was a magic-obsessed teenager, I'd have asked the librarian every single little thing I could think of.

They have an interaction in the second book that makes me think this was basically their relationship before the story started.

But again, a lot of teenagers spend their time talking about themselves in various ways, and don't bother asking other people about their lives. I'm sure he knew the librarian was a mage, but I don't think he'd really internalized that knowledge until he saw the fight. After all, not every mage in this world is a combat mage.

His mage/librarian friend was also keeping things on the down-low, which is probably another reason why he didn't realize just how powerful the guy was.
