Sure, though it wasn't really shown before in her character. But there's also the part where Kala was sent to this country because it's one of the three regional powers, and they were supposed to /ask for help/. So even if Kala doesn't think twice of slaughtering their neighbours army for warp, how are they going to get help now? And even before - needlessly antagonizing their hosts during a diplomatic venture to make more money (when they were guaranteed great returns just doing the trading / using the automatons as craftsmen).

I guess my main issue here is that Kala has personality exactly to the degree that it's convenient to the main character. Any time Calvin wants to do something that Kala shouldn't approve of, it's not even that they argue and he has his way - it's just never brought up.

Anyway that part of the arc is over now, fortunately, so I'm happy to move on.
