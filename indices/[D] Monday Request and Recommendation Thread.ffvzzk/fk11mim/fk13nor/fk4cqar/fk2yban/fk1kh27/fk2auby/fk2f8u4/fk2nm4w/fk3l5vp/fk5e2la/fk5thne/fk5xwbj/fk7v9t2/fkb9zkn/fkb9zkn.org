Remember that magical power is directly granted by being next to huge amounts of death at once. Nobles are already taken out to nice slaughters to get magical power. Kala already has at least 6 breaks (meaning she was next to 10k people dying at once). You would expect some cultural differences in morals, because I very much doubt all these slaughters were purely natural.
