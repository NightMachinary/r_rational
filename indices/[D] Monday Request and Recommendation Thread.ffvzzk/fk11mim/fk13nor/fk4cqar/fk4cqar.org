I read it and enjoyed it as guilty pleasure type reading. It's not terribly rational though. While the main character does use some cool magic exploits and combos, his biggest trick is just using the ridiculously overpowered dupomancy, something that is well known and unrestricted. There's really no excuse for why he came up with these uses but no one else had.
