[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] has a bit of that trope going on. Other characters assume human altruistic/hardworking motives on the OP. But OP is actually an experimental monster in disguise, and actual motivations usually boil down to 'more food' or 'better protection'.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur The Dragon]] Sort of does it occasionally too. The dragon is often doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. Like saving his chief minion, so that minion can pay off his debt. Or killing off an evil necromancer because that necromancer turned his stash of gold into lead. Or fighting off evil/arrogant fairies that want to kill off all other sentient life, because the dragons believe they are the ultimate rulers of the world.
