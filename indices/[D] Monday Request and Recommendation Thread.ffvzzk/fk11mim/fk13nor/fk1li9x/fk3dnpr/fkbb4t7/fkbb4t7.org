If you want to write 'real'-feeling NPCs, then in practice Level 1 Intelligence ends up looking more like cunning or even stubbornness. A character who knows what they /think/ they want, and goes out of their way to get it/refuse to be distracted from it, even if it's a poor long-term strategy - is immediately relatable in a way that 'swallowed-the-dictionary-and-sounds-like-every-other-character' NPC number 15 doesn't.
