I disagree with you but, in the process, agree with you. I think the book is about learning Real, Magical Magic (so, check), but then finding that it was never what you wanted, and you still have all your old problems. The magic is beautifully depicted, but thematically it's just standing in for all the things you wanted as a child, and how they're inevitably (in-novel) going to let you down.
