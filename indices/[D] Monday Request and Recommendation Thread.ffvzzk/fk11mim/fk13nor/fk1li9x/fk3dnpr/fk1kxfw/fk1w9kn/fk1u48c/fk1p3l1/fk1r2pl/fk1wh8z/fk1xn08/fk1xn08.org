I guess it depends on what you mean by "Wizard As Fuck", but my interpretation is something like:

#+begin_quote
  Magic exists. It has Rules. The Rules are incredibly complex, to the point where they're nearly impossible to describe in words. However, by becoming Wizard As Fuck, the main character gains a transcendental understanding of The Rules, and is thus able to Do The Real Magic.
