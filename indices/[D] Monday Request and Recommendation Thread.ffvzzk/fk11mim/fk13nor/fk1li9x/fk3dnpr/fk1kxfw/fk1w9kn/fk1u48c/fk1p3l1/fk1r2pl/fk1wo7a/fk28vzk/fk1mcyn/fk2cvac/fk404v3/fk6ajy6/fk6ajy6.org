Hmm... Not 100% certain I know what you're going for, but I think I would recommend Pratchett's /Discworld/ series. Ironically, not the books about actual wizards, but many others conjure up that sort of mysticism I think you're going for.

In particular, the best fit would be the witch subseries, starting with /Wyrd Sisters/.
