I ask Calibre+FanFicFare to read the mail folder I'm sending update notifications to.

If a novel (or fanfiction) isn't from a site that can send notifications AND be managed by FFF, I tend to just not start reading it (I have to filter my readings somehow and this is one criterion).

For the handful of stories managed by FFF, but without notifications, I have a custom column that tells me approximately how late an update is. When I feel the could be an update, I ask FFF to check.

When stories are updated, the Reading List plugin marks them for upload on my ereader, which then updates the reading progression.
