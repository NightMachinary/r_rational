I've never actually seen A Cold Calculus recommended anywhere online, and it's a real shame, as it has to be the best Code Geass fanfiction I've read.

It follows Euphemia in an (alternate) alternate history in which she eventually becomes the Empress of Britannia. (I'm not spoiling anything, it tells you outright at the beginning that she's the empress by the end.)

It has some great worldbuilding gems that really flesh out the world of Code Geass, and it puts a lot more attention into the politics than the canon series. Easily my third favourite fanfiction of all time.
