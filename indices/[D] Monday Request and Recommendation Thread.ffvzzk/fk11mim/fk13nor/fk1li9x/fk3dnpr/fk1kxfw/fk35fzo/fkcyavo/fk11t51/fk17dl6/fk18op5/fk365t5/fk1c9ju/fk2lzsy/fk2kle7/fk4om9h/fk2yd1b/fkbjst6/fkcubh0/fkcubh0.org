I have a text document with all the things I'm:

- currently reading

- putting on hold

- dropping

- finished

Along with each entry I put the chapter I ended at. And every weekend I just go through my currently reading list and update everything else by hand. I know it's not the most efficient method since it's done manually but it's kinda satisfying seeing things tick up gradually yknow.
