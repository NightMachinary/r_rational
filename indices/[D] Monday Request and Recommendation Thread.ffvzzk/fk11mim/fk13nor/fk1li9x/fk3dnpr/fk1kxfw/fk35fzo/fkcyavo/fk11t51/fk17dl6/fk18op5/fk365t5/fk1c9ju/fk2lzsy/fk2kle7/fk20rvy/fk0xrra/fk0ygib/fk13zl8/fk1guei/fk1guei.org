[[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight/][First Flight]]ðŸ“· Is an excellent read, I particularly like the Kern trees and the worldbuilding around them. Can stand alone perfectly well too. Changeling space program is surprisingly good considering it's a KSP and MLP crossover, a definite cut below, a simpler story with simpler writing but still remarkably good. I would call them both rational adjacent, I liked how in CSP Chrysalis isn't a flat character and actually thinks things through.
