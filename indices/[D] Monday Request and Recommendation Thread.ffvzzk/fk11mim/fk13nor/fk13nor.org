Read Wake of the Ravager that was recommended in last week's thread and I really enjoyed it. Have to disagree with the recommender's question mark of the Harem tag though, the story definitely is harem and becomes increasingly more so as the story goes on.

Any other recommendations for people who enjoyed WotR aside from He Who Fights With Monsters/Delve that others gave in the comments last time?
