I read [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TTDGKP2/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0][Shade's First Rule]] and its sequel over the course of the week, and really enjoyed them.

I did nearly drop the first book because the main character was handed what looks like an obvious idiot ball in the first couple of chapters - he stops and tries to analyze a magical fight where one of the participants is actively trying to kill him, instead of running for safety.

But it turns out that's a genuine character flaw, and one that I feel like most rational characters would have in reality - a lot of the time rational fiction treats thinking as a free action, when it really isn't. You can't afford to spend a couple moments pondering stuff in the middle of a fight, and that lesson is beat into the main character over the course of book 1.

The book also poses a really interesting munchkiny problem: if you're a deity designing a set of classes for your people, how do you sneak power into them in a way that your fellow deities won't notice?
