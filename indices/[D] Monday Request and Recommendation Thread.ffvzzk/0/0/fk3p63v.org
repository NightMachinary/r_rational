I'm about a third of the way into the first book, and see what you mean.

Though I don't think the protagonist's fascination with magic is that well justified.

Dude is 16 years old, in a town where every adult has a class and access to some magic. Even for peasants (Worker class) mundane tasks like lighting a fire have spells.

Yet he's acting like he has *never* seen magic used. Even though his very poorly introduced friend / father figure is a high level mage. Yes, popping off a fireball in the middle of town is irresponsible, but not badgering him to demonstrate /something/ is beyond belief.

Mana is cheap, so that isn't an excuse.

Also, WTF is the protag talking about saying he rarely meets anyone as smart as himself with his 16 Int. He meets a level 70+ worker, with 4 stat points per level, even with two points auto-assigned, that still leaves 140+ available... dropping 10 or 20 into Int at some point is quite likely.

Unless every non-mage is /so dumb/ that they treat Int as a dump stat forever.
