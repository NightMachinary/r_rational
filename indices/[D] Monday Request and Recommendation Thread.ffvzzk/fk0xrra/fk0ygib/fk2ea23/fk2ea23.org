Okay I've got a bunch since Thatguy didn't say anything.

For rwby there's stuff by Coeur Al'aran, although all his stories follow Jaune. Plus his writing can be hit or miss for people. I find his stuff to be more competent than 90% of the stuff on ff.net, so ymmv. I really liked his Forged Destiny and Relic of the Future.

An Exercise in Stupidity is an interesting Gamer story (set in rwby), in that the main character is very decisive and stubborn, and bulldozes his way through pretty much anything. This is hilarious at times because you'd expect him to pay attention to seemingly plot events but no, he just trucks on. His build is also about being as tanky as possible, which I don't see much on system stories.

Biomass Effect is one of my favorite unfinished fanfics. It explores the mass effect universe if the Blacklight virus from Prototype took over humanity and made its entirety a hivemind basically. Lots of really cool biological technology (which is improved and upgraded) and some interesting mechanics behind how you'd have a main character at that point. It's not too rational though, and some decisions can feel explicitly idiot-ball-y.

Man off the Moon is a Mass Effect/Fate:GO crossover, with EMIYA being unleashed on the galaxy. He's every bit the Gary Stu that he should be, and the mystery is pretty well done. Pacing really suffers in the middle but it has picked back up in the last few chapters (on hiatus though...). Also hilarious at times, when EMIYA tries to downplay his feats.

With Strength of Steel Wings has some of the best magic description I've read. It's a harry potter fanfic, with OP Harry. Basically some muggles figure out that wizards exist, and send Harry to be a spy. A lot of magical rituals and tattoo magic, with some absolutely breathtaking descriptions of magic.

There's a bunch of Fate/Stay Night fics that are enjoyable. Most of the ones I liked are about Shirou learning about the Holy Grail War early on, and developing his abilities before it takes place. There's From Fake Dreams (which is very popular and has mixed opinions by the Fate fandom), Fate: Unbalanced Scales, and Path of the King. They do all kinda escalate into Michael bay films, so ymmv.

Unmade is a really nice fanfic of Oregairu, with Hachiman and co. as adults after graduation. Hachiman is a detective with some military experience. The story's about a crime mystery, plus how Hachiman once more comes into contact with his old friends and crushes. It's really cute at times, and the writing is good.

Greg Veder vs The World is a Worm fanfic with Greg getting The Gamer power. It escalates like all gamer stories do, but it's written well enough to be enjoyable. Plus Greg's development is nice to see.

There's an interesting erotica called The Gamer, found on chyoa.com (it's like a text based adventure website). Follow the route written by neo_kenka. It's like an erotica version of The Gamer manhua. I both recommend and un-recommend this. It's interesting in how it explores sapient creatures created by the MC's system, and their dubious existence (are they automatons? do they have free will? Are they philosophical zombies?). There's some sorta deconstruction going on also with the MC's charisma and libido stat(which is ever rising), as well as his role as The Gamer (his origin and purpose). And the mc's build is really cool, it's like a mix between dimensionalism and summoning. Also copious amounts of sex and bodily fluids, hence the un-recommendation. Really interesting if you can get past that though.
