I'm not even talking about the calvinian summoning (because as op as that is, it does have geonosian craziness and Elliot messing with the system as an explanation). Just regular dupomancy for regular old duplicate duplicate white phosphorus or whatever is crazy powerful. Everyone recognizes how useful it is and (off screen) starts using it as soon as he does. Calvin has a high mind stat... for a teenager from a sheep village. Someone else would definitely have thought of that. For consistency the author really ought to have made dupomancy one of elliots special unlock abilities (like the also crazy op shadow boxing).
