I want to anti-rec Gilded Hero. It's technically proficient, but anti-rational and not a really fun read. I hear it called 'realistic' over at RR, but I'd go with 'grimderp' instead.

I'll stick to the first couple thousand words to not spoil anything, (chap 1-6 spoilers) but the story reveals in chapter 1 that it's got a hard system. Like, stat levels, classes/skills you get from stats, etc.. Getting a skill makes you have a huge World of Warcraft style ding with a flash of light and thunder. Skills are big deals with requisite stats, and the early goal is to get a skill.

Aaaand it takes weeks of in-story time before anyone even asks what stats anybody has. I thought it might be a system unique to the MC, but literally everybody on the planet has stats and none of the trainers thought to ask while they were fumbling around trying to get skills.

Not for any reason. The author just seemed to have some scenes they wanted so they ignored the physics of the world so they could have those scenes. That's all.

As far as I can tell, the whole story is like this where there's no verisimilitude and it would take all of 5 minutes of thought for characters to act realistically instead.
