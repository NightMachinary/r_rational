  Harem

Y'know, I've noticed more and more as time goes on that I instinctively skim past cringy harem plots in webfics. This is not the first time. I only realize it when it's pointed out to me. An interesting character...flaw? Trait?

(I was the guy who recced WotR last week.)

Anyhoozles.

I've posted it here before, but I think that the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27993770-born][Dire Saga]] by Andrew Seiple has a vaguely similar tone. Happy-go-lucky murderhobo type vibe (though in this one there's no actual murdering). Good, clean, insane fun. Premise is a fairly typical superhero world in which the protagonist is a debatably mad scientist who just. wants. to uplift. society, but the stupid heroes keep getting in the way. Highly recommend the series. Just don't take it too seriously - it's very over the top, in a self-aware sort of way.
