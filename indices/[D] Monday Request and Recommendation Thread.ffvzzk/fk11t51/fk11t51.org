I recently came across a /very/ long-running Quest called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/grandeur-rising-eastern-fantasy-empire.311224/][Grandeur Rising]], which has been running since 2013 (though it seems to be in a bit of a slump right now.) The prose is pretty workmanlike - no real complaint, but nothing special - but it's a very engaging read for the experience of running and uplifting an empire. It's actually sent me on a bit of a hunt for more good Empire Management quests/stories.

Note that the earlier posts aren't threadmarked - the second post has an index for them. The first threadmarked post being called Turn 41 Part 2 makes it seem like there's one missing, but Part 1 is just the same post without the latter half. (That sent me on a wild goose chase!)
