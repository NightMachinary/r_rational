[[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]]? It's set in fantasy 19th Century Europe with ironclads and airships alongside Lovecraftian monsters and secret orders practising hermetic rituals. Note it's a translated work though (from Chinese) so the word choices are a bit janky.

I definitely agree that industrial/colonial age settings should be more thoroughly explored by writers compared to the thousands of medieval age fantasies we already have. Well, ones that aren't just remakes of Sherlock Holmes, anyways.
