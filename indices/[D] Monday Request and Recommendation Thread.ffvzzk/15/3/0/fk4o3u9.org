I read that for a while, but dropped it at ~80% of where it is now (it was up to date at the time) because it felt like it was getting really very convoluted to the point where I didn't really understand what was happening beyond the absolute surface level and I... just didn't really care enough to try and figure out what was going on? I was also incredibly put off by what happened with Mami - when she started referring to herself in the third person and like a baby, I felt like I'd stumbled into someone's fetish and I really hadn't signed up for that.

Maybe it's better now and I missed a bunch of explanations and straightening out of the plot, but I'm sufficiently put off by the thought of having to go back and figure out what was going on to catch up when I didn't understand the first time around that I don't think I will.

EDIT: The lack of understanding would probably be enough to drop a novel if no answers were forthcoming, but as this is actually a Quest where readers vote on what to do next it was especially frustrating.
