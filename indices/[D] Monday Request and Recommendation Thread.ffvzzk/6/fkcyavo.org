I've really been enjoying "My Hero School Adventure Is Wrong, As Expected"

([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/]])

It is an Oregairu, My Hero Academia fusion fanfic. Both stories are combined very well with lots of interesting quirks. The protagonists quirk 108 skills is interesting and used very creatively. It allows him to copy 108 other quirks at 1/108th of their power.

Anyone have any other My Hero Academia fanfiction that they like? I've been having trouble finding other good MHA fanfic.
