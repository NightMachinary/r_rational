Trauma results from the amygdala forming emotional memories which, for some reason, are poorly regulated- stress dampens regulation of the amygdala for example. Video games are repetitive and much lower in stress than most murder situations.

If you kill someone, you kill them once. If you kill someone in a video game you get to repeat kill them till less bad memories are formed.

I think in real life if you got to kill hundreds of people you could eventually feel better about it but that would be grossly immoral.
