An argument could already be made from the other point of view that we are not quite in a hurry to increase the fidelity of our gun-handlign simulations for instance. I doubt the sales of FPS' would increase if they suddenly all handled like [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnafn6x_1c][Receiver]] so a case can easily be made that near-reality simulation is hardly desired.
