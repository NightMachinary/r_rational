Human bodies are messy, squishy things. If you kill them, they release their bowels. Contact with your fist is nowhere near what it is in a game, it's nowhere near as solid or free; it's always painful. People don't die instantly, either: they cry out in pain, stagger around, clutch at wounds. I would argue that no video game would ever realistically show what killing someone looks like, because it simply wouldn't be fun, except for major sociopaths, and they were already desensitized.
