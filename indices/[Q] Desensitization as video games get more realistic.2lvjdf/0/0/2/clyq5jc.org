The dividing line between fantasy and reality is actually a lot more powerful than most people think. This applies to everything from video games to porn: what people would enjoy in an unrealistic simulation vs what they would enjoy in real life are like flipping a switch.

I don't really get grossed out by gore on a screen: it's just kind of annoying when there's too much of it. So I can play really gory games without issue. Visual depictions of blood and guts can be distasteful, but it's not shocking to me anymore, if it ever was.

But there was a game I played once where a young woman abruptly got electrocuted, and I immediately had to stop playing. Their screams were so realistic, the visuals so visceral, that it put me in a cold sweat, and I was trembling slightly after I walked away from it.

There will always be different buttons people have for what crosses the line from fantasy to reality. Just because we seem to be desensitized doesn't mean we are: it just means what we're seeing is safely compartmentalized into fantasy. If we saw it in real life, that compartment would shatter.
