Of course videogames are going to be programmed to give painful feedback. Look at the popularity of paintball, which leaves welts on the body. There are prototypes out in the world that give painful feedback - and for a certain crowd, that feedback will sell the realism, and be desirable. Haptics is one of the next great frontiers of videogaming, and I think it's fairly obvious that pain is going to be a desirable part of that for a certain subset of people.
