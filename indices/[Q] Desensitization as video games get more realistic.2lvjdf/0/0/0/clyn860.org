But will enemies ever be programmed to release their bowels and bladders? Cry out for their children and wives? It's distasteful for most people (and, again, the people it isn't distasteful for already have problems). If video games ever do get to the point of showing the realistic process of murder, then it won't be a product of video games setting the new standard, it will be video games catching up with a common thing in all media.

Edit: I can see video games, as with all media, conditioning people to enjoy violence. People may connect the process of killing enemies with gaining a rewards (experience, level up, seeing more of the story, money, etc.) and connect that to real life, but I cannot see it being desensitization, as in "not caring." The people who are likely to form a close enough connection to a video game to be emotionally influenced by it are not going to /stop caring/ about the lives of their enemies, and by extension the people around them. They're going to care very much for it.

But again, this brings me back to what I said at the beginning of that statement: "as with all media." Video games are only special in their immediacy; all media has the capacity for conditioning.

Of course, this is all a common response to the idea of video games desensitizing people to violence. To get back to your original point: no, I don't see advancements in video games causing anything more than what they are currently causing in terms of desensitization *or* conditioning, but only because video games are already pretty damn realistic when they want to be.
