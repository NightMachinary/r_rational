  30 years ago when you shot a character, they disappeared. Now, when you shoot them (depending on the game rating), they stagger around, bleed and lay there for however long the game engine requires (and in some engines, they will sit there indefinitely).

A large part of that is due to advances in technology, not just advances in bloodlust.

30 years ago, if you tried to have your characters stagger & bleed out in graphic detail, it wouldn't have been viable.
