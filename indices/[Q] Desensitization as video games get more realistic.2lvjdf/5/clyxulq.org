Should we even care about desensitizing?

From rationalist POV depending on the emotional part of brain (that can be desensitized) to prevent mass murderers seems suboptimal anyway.

Emotions aren't required to know not to kill people, you can rationaly decide not to do it. In fact emotions can be hijacked by ideology/religion and make you kill innocent people, stress can overcome you to stop feeling for others for a moment, and even without external influences emotions can push you to make wrong decisions (save 1 pretty kid of your race - let 10 ugly people of different race die).

So IMHO we should teach people morality depending on their rational brains, not on emotions. And then desensitizing isn't much of a problem.

BTW there was this brilliant Stanis≈Çaw Lem short story about [[http://www.empathogens.com/altruizine/][altruizine]] - substance that turned empathy in people to 11. It made people feel everything others felt so they would be better to each other. End result should be obvious, but it still took me by surprise. Check it out - it's in short stories collection [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cyberiad]] it's one of my favorite books - it's weird fairy-tales/sci-fi mix, but the stories show realistic consequences given the weird universe.

In fact I think Cyberiad is a rationalist book, it even deals with the usual problems (optimizing universe, friendly AIs, simulations within simulations, etc).
