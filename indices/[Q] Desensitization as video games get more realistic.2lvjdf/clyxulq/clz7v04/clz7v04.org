I see what you're saying, I didn't think of it that way. I guess I don't think we can viably reach out and teach ourselves to be rational enough to counter the joy/pleasure psychopaths would receive from murdering people. And of course, for that, it assumes these psychopaths exist in the first place.

Anyway, based on history and even what we see today, it's easier to herd the masses, than it is to try and honestly educate them. Some things will take root, sure, so the average human is smarter now than they were, say, 80 years ago (although that one's debatable, it could easily be just that the average human has more knowledge, and the access to even more knowledge, than one a lifetime ago) but I don't think it's feasible to try and impart a rational mindset on the general populace. I don't think it will take. I feel like simpler, more baseline approaches need to be made.

Simply put, not everyone's smart enough (or cares enough about GETTING smart enough) to be a rationalist :(
