So ok, there's a lack of tactile sensation, as no video game is going to be programmed to give painful feedback (hopefully)

As far as no game having people going through death throes, I don't think it's as unrealistic to have that as you're making it sound. 30 years ago when you shot a character, they disappeared. Now, when you shoot them (depending on the game rating), they stagger around, bleed and lay there for however long the game engine requires (and in some engines, they will sit there indefinitely)
