Slatestarcodex had an article a while back entitled [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/22/social-psychology-is-a-flamethrower/][Social Psychology is a Flamethrower]]. In it, Scott wrote about several examples where you could argue that there is scientific or logical evidence that contradicts a lot of popular opinion in certain areas.

In the first example given of contrary evidence, the author noted a study where violent movies were shown to decrease crime rates. Specifically, for violent movies:

#+begin_quote
  They found violent movies decreased crime 5% or more on their opening weekends, and that each violent movie that comes out probably prevents about 1000 assaults. Further, there's no displacement effect -- the missing crimes don't pop back the following week, they simply never occur.
#+end_quote

A similar effect occurs with games.

This hypothesis is certainly intriguing to me. It would suggest that as substitutes for actually killing people get better and better at allowing us to vicariously experience the act of killing, real and actual killing might decrease instead of increase.

Ultimately, I think more study should probably be done in this area - you can tell 'just so' stories that point in *either direction*, so actual studies that measure the impact of violence in various media in the long term in terms of actual murders prevented or created would probably be the most persuasive.
