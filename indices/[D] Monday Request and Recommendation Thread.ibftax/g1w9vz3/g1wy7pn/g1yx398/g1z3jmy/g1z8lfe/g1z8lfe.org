Interesting.

Well, you can very well arrive before you leave, but you obviously will never be able to see your future self (i.e. avatar) or the consequences of your future self's actions before you teleport (because the game cannot know those).

I was just saying that you cannot "intuitively understand relativity" through the game, because the game engine does not use anything from any theory of relativity. Unlike [[http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/openrelativity/][this thing]], for example.

You can understand orbital mechanics, of course.
