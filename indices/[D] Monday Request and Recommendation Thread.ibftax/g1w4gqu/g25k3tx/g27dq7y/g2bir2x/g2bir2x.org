That seems to explicitly not be the case for Celestial Forge.

OP is holding out for a technological solution, but from chapter 1 leverages his power using his actions to spoof thinker powers using a clever trick. Trigger Events can't be planned against by thinker powers and he continually gets mini-trigger events because of the celestial forge. By tying his upgrades to new power unlocks specifically, thinker's can't predict him because to them it looks like he's going to be waiting forever for a trigger event that never comes. On the downside it means he can't plan in advance and build up for certain things (eg build up a bunch of stuff to beat coil on a certain date)
