I'll recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] a game of thrones timeloop fanfic. It's about Joffrey growing up via the time loop after he dies at his wedding the first time and trying to figure out how to stop the night king. It's 740k words.
