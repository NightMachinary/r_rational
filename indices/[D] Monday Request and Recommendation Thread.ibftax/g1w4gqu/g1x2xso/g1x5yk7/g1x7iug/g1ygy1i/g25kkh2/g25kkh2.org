You might have seen this already, but I'd give a strong recommendation to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU][SAO Abridged]]. It's not a perfect series, but I've found that it puts a lot more thought into character and worldbuilding than the original ever did. Especially when it comes to Kirito's character arc. Not to mention it actually provides a vaguely plausible reason (if in a fitting darkly comedic way) why everyone got locked into the game in the first place.
