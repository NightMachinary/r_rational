A Song for Two Voices [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480]]

It's an explicitly rational fanfic of Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series. Does not require knowledge of the original series (I've never read Valdemar but I have read other Lackey books). Plot takes a few books to get to the rational content. Well written. Tackles moral quandaries head on.

Trigger warnings: lots of emotional trauma including self harm/suicide, depression, anxiety, it's set in a middle-ages/renaissance era so there's some implied/off screen underage sex (the one occasion of actual power imbalance that comes to mind is handled well IMO).

Cons: seems like the MC is constantly in a sick bed/under recovery. OTOH it's actually more realistic than the "I suffered multiple life threatening injuries, but I'm both physically and mentally fine in a couple of hours" type stories. But it can get annoying.

ETA not complete, looks to be finished in another couple of books
