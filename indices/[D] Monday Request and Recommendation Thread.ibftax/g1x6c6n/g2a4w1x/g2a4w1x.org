I liked it so far, though I do wonder where the story will go once the initial heart issue is resolved. There's a big risk that it either drags the initial issue out too long or else winds up merging into a more traditional cultivation story.

I can see places it might go (transhumanist themes, perhaps), but we won't know until it gets there.
