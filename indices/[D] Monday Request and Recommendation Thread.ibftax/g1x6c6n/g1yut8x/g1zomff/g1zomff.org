Haven't read much xianxia, so I don't know what to compare to, but I'd say so. Plot summary: MC has rich parents, but has a disabled soul that can't cultivate; he has to figure out a way around this and get out of an arranged marriage to a girl whose family is now of a status above his own (the marriage was arranged back when he seemed to be a prodigy) without losing his family, or himself, too much face in the process.
