Lol I agree with both you guys as well. I definitely had a phase where I actively hated the story and the author for making Rain commit the same mistake over and over again and expect change. Now I've come to accept it, and read the chapters monthly or bi-monthly. The story is a lot better than some egregious shit that I've read, and I still enjoy Rain's pov chapters. His whole thought process and behavior still feels genuine, if a bit annoying. Except for some, most of the side character chapters /are/ pretty inconsequential, and I skim those.

The issues in the story are many, but there are many good things about it as well. I've decided that I can overlook the issues and still enjoy the story for what it is (much like how so many people can enjoy cookie cutter xianxia and litrpgs I guess?).
