I'm very deep in the sunk cost fallacy and I absolutely agree with you on every critique. I skim most of the chapters at this point, but it does seem like the plot is finally moving again. Still the occasional 8k word chapter that's entirely boring pointless battle scene, animal hugging, or 'being amazed at how cool the MC is', but I think the author is improving again.

Absolutely still wouldn't recommend it, but it's at least paying off a bit now.
