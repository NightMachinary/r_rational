I finished Mother of Learning and I loved the character growth in it and I don't mean power scaling I mean watching the small interactions with Zorian and his sister change over the course of the book. I loved the dances. I loved the interactions with all the classmates I want more. Any recommendations? (I still would like some driving narrative but taking the time for small moments feels right to me)
