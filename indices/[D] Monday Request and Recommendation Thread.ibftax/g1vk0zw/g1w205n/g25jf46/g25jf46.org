  Savage Divinity also ha a lot of slice of life, sometimes to the detriment of its plot

Massively to its detriment.

That said, even if we take it at the author's word, it still isn't a good slice of life.

Slice of life doesn't just mean "mope at home and pet your kitties". Rather, it tends to suggest conflicts that are of a personal, social, or everyday sort. By and large, this isn't really true of Rain or his struggles. His important relationships are, by and large, established, friendly, and fixed. What social struggles he has tend to be either ignored as inconsequential or brushed aside trivially.

What conflicts he does engage with, however, tend to be the sort of high stakes world changing issues that are vastly beyond the scope of any reasonable "slice of life", it's just that they happen very slowly and interspersed by chapter after chapter of largely pointless fluff and reaction.

If someone does want a slice of life Xianxia, however, I'd give a pretty strong recommendation to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]]. It's a magic school xianxia about a street urchin attending a cultivation academy after it is discovered that she has a strong talent for it. There's not really any overarching plot or issue at hand, just the day to day issues of someone thrown out of their depth trying to figure out how to make the best of an unfamiliar situation that offers much greater opportunities than she'd ever imagined, but only if she is resourceful and strong enough to claim them.

The story is pretty neutral on the rational-irrational spectrum. Characters mostly behave in reasonableish ways based on their circumstances and characterization, but it doesn't go out of its way to be especially rational either. The story isn't perfect, but it's pretty solid and a decent recommendation for anyone who finds either xianxia or magic schools interesting as a genre.
