There's no relativity in the game. Everything's classical, likely Newtonian or not even that (the gravity of the planets as mentioned in the video).

This means that the orbital mechanics are no more complex than those of [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/][Kerbal Space Program]] or [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/476530/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth/][Children of a Dead Earth]].

The only "relative" thing mentioned in the video is that the game handles the interactions between two objects in motion (in respect to the game-engine-global coordinates) very well.
