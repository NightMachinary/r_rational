I think WiP might be something of a core feature of most LitRPG - the fact that it's an endless upward grind is in some way part of its charm. It's a format that lends itself well to being never ending.

The only completed LitRPG I can think of offhand that I'd actively recommend is the New Game Minus series by Sarah Lin. It's pretty good, though if you've not read much LitRPG it might be a bit too deconstruction.

"The Laboratory" series by Skyler Grant is Dungeon Core rather than LitRPG, but the two genres are pretty similar, and is very enjoyable and also completed.

"The System Apocalypse" by Tao Wong isn't finished, but it's nine books along and feels like it's wrapping up in the next few books. It's pretty good.
