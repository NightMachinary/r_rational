[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime series]] is the only one that I like without reservations. Not your typical litrpg as it's based on 1.5e DnD rules rather than computer games.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/233241-threadbare][Threadbare trilogy]] is good, but it loses a bit of its charm in the second and third book. Still pretty good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40774974-life-reset][Life Reset series]] has a stupid premise and a weird ending but it's decent enough, particularly in pacing and climax(most litrpg writers are trash at this).
