if you're into litrpg, have you tried asian webnovels? Not rationalist fiction by any means, but.. sovereign of judgement for example is a solid revenge-driven story set in a world that got subsumed by a system of sorts.

There shorter ones like emperor of solo play, seoul's station necromancer which are pretty decent

trashier ones like rebirth of the theif who ruled the world (complete) legendary moonlight sculptor, and overgeared which are literally set in videogames, super long, and meh quality but scratch an itch.

But do check out sovereign of judgement it's pretty good and not excessively long imo..
