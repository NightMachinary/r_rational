/[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/931/fallout-equestria-pink-eyes][Pink Eyes]]/ (Fo:E, doesn't require any knowledge of either of the three canons as far as I remember) is about a friendly, curious foal waking up after the apocalypse. She sets off to find her mom and normally would've been killed in two minutes by many wasteland horrors if not for a protective suit, and more importantly, if not for being made out of very toxic pink gas.

Story with a cute (but /very/ young and na√Øve) protagonist with a hefty dose of body horror, especially in later chapters.

The ending is horrifyingly terrible, but the main body of work is probably my favorite on FimFiction.
