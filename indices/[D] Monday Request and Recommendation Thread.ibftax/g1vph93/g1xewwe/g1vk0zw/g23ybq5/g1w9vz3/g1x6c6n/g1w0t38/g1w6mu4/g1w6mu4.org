I think you are looking for “The son of Man(nis)”

([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/son-of-man-nis-an-asoiaf-si.57501/]])

I'd also recommend “A Farmer's Tale” which is another GOT SI fanfic set before and during the ninepenny Kings war and follows the slice of life-y adventures of an SI turned farmer as he does minor tech uplift and eventually gets elevated to noble status.
