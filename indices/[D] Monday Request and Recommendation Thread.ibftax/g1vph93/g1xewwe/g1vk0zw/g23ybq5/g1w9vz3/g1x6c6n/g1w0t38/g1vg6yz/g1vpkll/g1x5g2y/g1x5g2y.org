You've already read the Vorkosigan Saga, so I can't recommend that.

Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy (heir to the empire, Dark force rising, the last command) is a great read. It was written really early in the EU, so there's some stuff that doesn't align perfectly with later canon, but it's still really excellent. The Hand of Thrawn Duology is also good but not as strong as the first three.

Likewise, the Star Wars Rogue Suadron and Wraith Squadron series were both well done, albeit not as much so.

A Fire Upon the Deep has the premise that the Galaxy is divided into different "zones" by the density of mass, with available technology scaling inversely with the gravity. An Archaelogical expedition accidentally unleashes a UAI from one such extremely advanced civilization.

I'm not 100% sure that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars]] (PMMM Scifi Fanfic) is 100% what you're looking for, but it's really good scifi anyway, plus Magical Girls in Space is 100% aesthetic.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design]] was pretty good as well, albeit more HFY than I usually go for.
