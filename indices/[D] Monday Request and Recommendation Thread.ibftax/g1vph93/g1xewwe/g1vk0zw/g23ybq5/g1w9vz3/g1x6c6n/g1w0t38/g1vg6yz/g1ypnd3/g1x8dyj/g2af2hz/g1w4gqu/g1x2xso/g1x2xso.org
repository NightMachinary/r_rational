[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3591783/chapters/7921653]] (700k): Embers is an AtlA AU fanfic of epic scale, centered largely around Zuko. The worldbuilding is great, Zuku and Iroh are great, the writing quality itself is really solid. It began life as a PoD fic and changed over to an alternate backstory as well when they decided where they were going with it, though, so there's some installment weirdness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]] (700k) Fairy Dance of Death is fucking incredible, despite how poor of a source it draws from. The core idea is "what if (good) Alfheim took the place of Aincrad." Completely hard magic with complete and explicit rules on what it can and cannot do, and thanks to its setting, is able to make it completely believable that these rules aren't completely well known. The writing itself is excellent as well, and the character feel like fundamentally the same people even as the new circumstances and writing makes the more interesting. Seriously AU, obviously.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870721/1/Kallen-Stadtfeld-Countess-of-Britannia]] (323k). Kallen Stadtfeldt is an AU Code Geass fic, with the point of divergence being that Kallen elects to go with her father to Britannia rather than stay with her mother in japan. Good politics, good protagonists, none of the really stupid asspulls like with canon Euphemia.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]] (314k) Harry Potter / DnD. Milo, a low level DnD wizard, finds himself suddenly in the middle of a death eater gathering just a little before the start of the Hogwarts year in book 1. Milo is a delightful protagonist and a great influence on the story. He's just differently Genre Savvy enough to make for a very interesting relationship with the canon plot and world; forex, he's able to easily identify Harry Potter as a protagonist (well, PC) because that's just a thing where he's from, but assumes Fudge must be some powerful magical figure because he's the ruler of an entire nation of wizards. You've probably already seen this reccomended on R/R but it's great and if you haven't that would be a shame.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/]] (390k). Dragon Ball fic set well after canon. Normally I avoid these kind of fics like the plague, but PoptartProdigy is an excellent writer and Kakara has rapidly become one of my favorite fictional characters. Essentially, after Goku and Vegeta pass from old age, a new threat destroys earth, and our protagonist is a descendant of a group of their descendants that managed to escape earth on one of Bulma's spaceships and have been in hiding since.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/]] (880k) Dungeon Keeper Ami is a crossover between Sailor Moon and the Dungeon Keeper games. Sailor Mercury (the titular dungeon keeper Ami) finds herself in another world after a mishap with a Dark Kingdom plan, and finds herself forced by circumstance to become a keeper - one of said series' chief forces of darkness - to avoid suffocating from oxygen deprivation. It's a really well written fic with a believably smart protagonist. Lots of clever magic and physics, and some great worldbuilding. It doesn't require you to be super familiar with Sailor Moon, but my rereads definitely benefitted from me having watched it after getting interested by this fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4193346/chapters/9471504]] (477k). A Familiar of Zero / Overlord (the game) crossover. The premise is that rather than summon bland McProtagonist, Louise instead fails to summon anything, and runs off to try become a hero to stop bringing shame to her family, with less than success. Much like dungeon keeper ami, this is a story about a good person in a situation where they take on the aesthetics and role of evil to accomplish something they couldn't otherwise. It looks at first glance like one of those descent into villainy fics, but it has a very interesting twist on it, namely that she's not on slippery slope. She's been stuck mainlining more evil magic than just about anyone else for as long as she's been alive, it's already done most of the damage it possibly can to get her to this point. More of the jokes will land if you're familiar with ZnT, but as someone with no exposure to it prior to this fic I can say it doesn't require more than cursory knowledge.

Pretty much everything else I'd reccomend from your examples is under 300k but if you've already read most of these I have more in the 100-300k range.
