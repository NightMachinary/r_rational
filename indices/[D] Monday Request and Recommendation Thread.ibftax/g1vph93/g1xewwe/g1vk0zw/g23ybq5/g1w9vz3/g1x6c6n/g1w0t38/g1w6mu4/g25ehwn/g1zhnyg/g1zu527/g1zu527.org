A farmers tale is on fanfiction.net. It's more slice of life in the beginning, and deals with the innovations introduced by the main character and lifestyle of the small folk in the north. We don't really deal with nobles until the end of the first arc when the protagonist has been in Westeros for a couple decades. Conflict for the 1st arc centers around producing goods for winter, trade and dealing with iron born raiders. In the second arc the protagonist is elevated to nobility and we change towards larger scale regional changes, trade with noble houses and the war of the ninepenny kings. Overall it is much more alive of life and smaller scale for the first arc, but progress is usually being made.
