The problem with Xianxia is that typically there is no plot in the first 200k words. In the best case they serve to establish the MC's personality and abilities. Exceptions exist, but are extremely rare.

Is Heart of Cultivation such an exception? The story hasn't even reached 100k words yet - does it already have a plot worth mentioning?
