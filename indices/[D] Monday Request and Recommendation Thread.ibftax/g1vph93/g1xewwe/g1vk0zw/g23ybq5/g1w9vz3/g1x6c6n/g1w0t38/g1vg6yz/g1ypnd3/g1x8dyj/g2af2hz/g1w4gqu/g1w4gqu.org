What are some fanfictions you guys have enjoyed a lot, preferably over 300k words. Doesn't have to be rationalist, just rational enough to be enjoyable. Also preferably not the ones that are well known in this community (HPMOR, Luminosity, some of the well known MLP stuff). Here's a few I've really enjoyed:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] is a worm fanfic with a tinker OC. The power is basically Inspired Inventor lite. Surprisingly, the author has made the protagonist not overpowered within 5 chapters. There's also an SI component, with the protagonist's shard being the SI, but it's pretty well done imo. What I liked was the tech building, pretty good character exploration (of both the protagonist and some other characters), and the building tension as the protagonist gets into deeper shit.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.789109/][Going Native]] is a DC/DBZ crossover with the Frieza Force being in the DC galaxy. It's a self insert into Tarble, who gets taught the hard way how Saiyan life works. The story is about how, slowly, the SI's character gets broken down into the ideal Saiyan, who's ready to genocide whole planets and not blink. There is really good exploration of saiyan life, and how the Frieza Force could work in the DC universe. Some nice galactic politics and powerups too.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13354836/1/Love-in-the-Dark][Love in the Dark]] is an Edelgard/Byleth romance from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. It's cute and a nice comfort read.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12593394/1/RE-We-Defeated-the-Devil-King-But-Now-Our-Daily-Life-is-Compromised][RE: We Defeated the Devil King, But Now Our Daily Life is Compromised]] is a Konosuba fanfic with the premise that Kazuma and co. accidentally defeat the demon king, and now have to live with it. Of course, being their team, they get into more shenanigans. The humor is genuinely good at times, although the character voices can feel a bit samey at times. Also a comfort read.
