If you want a more spoiler-y summary than the above, which sounds a little generic:

The main character's cultivation stalled due to a problem with his heart. He devised a plan to replace his heart with an artificial one, but never went through with it because he felt the risk wasn't worth it. Now that the plot has kicked off and he needs to get stronger, he's actively working on replacing his heart.
