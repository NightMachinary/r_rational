I'm not sure how rational they are, as it's been a while since I've read them and I hadn't discovered Rational Fiction back then, but I'm a big fan of Peter F. Hamilton's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Saga][Commonwealth Saga]].

Starting with [[https://www.amazon.com/Pandoras-Star-Commonwealth-Peter-Hamilton/dp/0345479211][Pandora's Star]] the series is about a far-future multi-planet-civilization humanity where an astronomer discovers a star he's been watching suddenly turns off. Not going nova, or dying in some other way, just on one second and off the next. Eventually an expedition is sent to investigate and something goes horribly wrong, kicking off a great adventure with plenty of interesting characters and a good mix of intrigue and action.
