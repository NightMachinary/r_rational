I'm having trouble finding a fic I used to read every day but lost the bookmark to when I got a new phone. It's a particularly good SI into the world of ASOIF. The main character is the son of Stannis Baratheon. He does a generally decent job of trying to uplift his world and create a sea-focused dominance of the realm to help bolster his father's vasseldom. Can't quite remember the name of it.

​

Any other ASOIF fics are welcome as well. Although I am currently reading Purple Days so no need to recommend that.

​

Any other stories/shows/movies with Lovecraftian Gods or unknown forces like in Purple Days/The Terror/Event Horizon would be great too. Any stories with mythos and gods of strange places are appreciated.
