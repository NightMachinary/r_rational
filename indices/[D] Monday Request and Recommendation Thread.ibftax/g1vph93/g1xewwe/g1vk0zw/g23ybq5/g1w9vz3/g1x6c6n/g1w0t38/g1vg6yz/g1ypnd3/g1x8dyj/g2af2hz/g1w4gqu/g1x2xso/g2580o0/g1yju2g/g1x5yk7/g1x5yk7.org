Would you mind clarifying which of these are completed/regularly updating/on hiatus/abandoned?

I ask because some of them that I am familiar with are either on hiatus (like HP and the D20...I almost want to call this abandoned since I'm skeptical that it will ever be finished even if the author does eventually drop a new chapter) or update VERY rarely (like DB after the end, the most recent april update came nearly 6 months after the previous update, and there is a gap of nearly 2 years from 2017 to 2019 where no updates were made)

I don't mind reading things that are still being regularly updated (even if regular does not mean frequent), but I try to avoid things that update both sporadically AND infrequently or borderline abandoned.
