The litrpg system in the world is such that you level up and gain a class when you do something accordingly. There are a lot of utility classes that don't rely on combat. There is also no exp or stats whatsoever, just levels and skills awarded with level ups. I believe this mechanic allows the non combat classes like innkeeper (literally swept the floor in an abandoned inn, something an innkeeper would do), farmer, blacksmith, manager, diplomat, secretary, singer, dancer, etc to shine. Everyone can gain them and level up in them, it's just about action and will.

Coincidentally, the leveling is related to pushing yourself. This result with most combat class users having lower levels than other classes because most don't push themselves so dangerously against monsters since you literally have a chance to die; they mostly play it safe and level slowly. The other classes can just dedicate or push themselves harder to craft, learn their trade to level up much safer, which means non combat classes mostly level easier.
