I've mentioned it before, but I feel like [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation][Heart of Cultivation]] deserves its own thread more than a lot of works that get posted to this sub. It has a competent, but still believable main character, secondary characters that feel unique, and things overall feel like real thought has been put into them.

But what really makes it a match here is how often the main character solves problems using wits in believable and satisfying ways.

This is the only Xianxia story I didn't give up on. Like most in the genre, it takes a while to build up, but I figure that's a bonus for a lot of people here.

The author mentioned that early bad reviews really hurt its popularity on Royal Road, so I'm hoping you guys enjoy it enough to leave your own. I really don't want this author to get discouraged enough to drop the story.

Edit: I should also mention that the early bad reviews weren't because the story starts out badly. I feel like it has a relatively strong beginning. The author just used some common Xianxia tropes that other people thought were plagiarized from other specific stories, even though this one is very different despite superficial similarities.
