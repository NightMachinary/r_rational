Oh I thought there was a mechanic like that, I'm misremembering it, the teleporting stations flavor text just implies that you arrive before you leave the point of origin and for a brief amount of time matter gets created from nothing.

The things that makes it specially blatant as opposed to kerbal is the scale, things in this game are very close to each other, in one minute you can switch between being mostly influenced by the gravity star to a planet then to a moon. You're constantly reorienting the direction of your thrust to compensate for it.
