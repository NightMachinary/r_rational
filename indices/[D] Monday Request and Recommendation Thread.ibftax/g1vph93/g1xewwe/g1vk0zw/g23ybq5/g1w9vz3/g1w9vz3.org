I'd like to recommend [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/][/The Outer Wilds/]] (not to be confused with /The Outer Worlds./)

I was blown away by this game and believe it is best played completely blind, as it focuses entirely on your personal exploration and discoveries. You, as part of a low-tech space program, navigate your miniature solar system and explore each of the planets not to destroy baddies or collect mcguffins, but to understand the world your species lives in.

Honestly, this is the one game in a thousand that has captured an actual sense of wonder in its mechanics and game-play loop, and if you have any interest in the space exploration genre you owe it to yourself to pick this up and play it as blind as possible.
