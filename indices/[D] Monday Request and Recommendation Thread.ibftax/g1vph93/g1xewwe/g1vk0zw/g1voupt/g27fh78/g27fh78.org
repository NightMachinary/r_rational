Wildbow's latest work, [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]], has much more of these moments than what Wildbow usually writes.

Part of it is probably that they're the first actual /child/ protagonists he ever wrote, with the exception of Twig, where the "children" were an Academy-created experiment used as state-sponsored terrorists rooting out dissenters and rogue scientists. They have actual social and home lives, and their friendship and how it develops is a big focus.
