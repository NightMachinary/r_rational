I'm going to counter rec Savage Divinity, *with prejudice*. It was once decent and promising and I was pretty invested in it, but its quality dropped and dropped until I came to actively hate it. Even then I kept reading for another hundred chapters, thinking that it was on the verge of picking up again. But no, it never did, it became clear the author had abandoned any pretense of advancement of plot or characterization and just decided to drag it out indefinitely. Just thinking back to the the TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORDS I read on how cute a critter is or their adorable little antics or the POV character cuddling them makes me what want to track down the author and *+commit murder suicide+* check for signs of a lobotomy.

I don't normally go this hard, but this story is so bad that the best that can be said about anyone still reading this piece of shit is that they're simultaneously suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as I once was. For someone to actively recommend it... well, I'll leave it unsaid how badly I think that reflects on you.
