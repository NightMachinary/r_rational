Be warned that the Cradle series is also far from finished. In fact I think the author hinted at some point it's only like halfway or so.

You may also enjoy the Vorkosigan Saga, this one is actually done. It's sci-fi but it reads a lot like fantasy, no magic though. The Warrior's Apprentice by Lois McMaster Bujold is a good starting point for the saga.
