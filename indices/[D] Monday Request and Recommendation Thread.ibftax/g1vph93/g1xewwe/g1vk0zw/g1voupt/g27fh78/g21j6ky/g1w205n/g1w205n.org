I'm gonna recommend some stories which have a lot of slice of life and the /small interactions,/ but aren't exactly about magic schools.

Ar'Kendrythist is half slice of life and half action drama. If you can get past the main character's wishy-washy personality for the first few chapters (it takes a while for him to realize the seriousness of his station and act on it), it gets much better. Later on, a lot of the chapters focus on Erick's relationship with the characters around him, which I really liked. It does feature a middle aged man as the main character though, so most of the social interaction happens with people around his age. So not /that/ much magic school drama.

Magic Smithing features an isekai'd character who grows up in a loving household and an overall nice village. There hasn't been much driving plot yet, but the protagonist has been improving her blacksmithing skills. Very slice of life, and for the most part enjoyable.

Savage Divinity also ha a lot of slice of life, sometimes to the detriment of its plot. If you can bear the protagonist's bouts of depression and the harem (which isn't badly done, but might not be for some people), there are many good chapters. It starts off as a wuxia, but changes genres after chapter 500 something, and imo it's better now. It's something long to tide you over.

If you're really really into the small interactions, you can't really go wrong with Jacqueline Carey or Robin Hobb. Be prepared for a lot of tears though.
