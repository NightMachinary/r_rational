[[https://pithserial.com/][Pith]] is fucking awesome and you should read it.

If you want something that feels like a spiritual successor to Worm, (instead of being a meandering actual sequel to Worm, say) this is it.

Ten years ago the +muggles+ humdrums learned the truth - the world had been secretly ruled by an international conspiracy of +wizards+ projectors for centuries. Now, the people of the early 20th century +Britain+ Principality can publicly apply to the premier magical academy in the world! But the number of positions is woefully limited and the chaff, more often than not, falls to the gangs of +London+ Elmidde.

Ana is a girl with no legally applicable job skills in a decaying black market body. If she is to survive the year she will need to find a new one.

Luckily, Principality black ops is always hiring. Unluckily, the new Principality government does not believe that it needs - or has - a black ops division.

On a shoestring budget, this ragtag bunch of half-educated projectors tries to defend the nation against the mob, populists and foreign agents.

And all the while, what little still remains of the world is being slowly but surely devoured by the ocean.
