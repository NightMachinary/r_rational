For anyone who is okay with joining (or just reading) a quest that has already been around for a couple of years and has accumulated 185 chapters, I really want to recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/][Warhammer Fantasy: Divided Loyalties - an Advisor's Quest]].

It doesn't scratch any specific plot itches that are common in the rationalist community (like uplift, magitech, nation optimizing, plotting and counterplotting or what have you), but the world building is superb, I haven't seen any plot holes, and the main character is a quest main character, meaning she doesn't hold obvious idiot balls. On the other hand despite it being a quest the author still manages to have great characterization, themes and just generally enjoyable writing. And most things are decided by dice rolls, meaning that upsets and failures do happen, though we have been quite lucky overall.
