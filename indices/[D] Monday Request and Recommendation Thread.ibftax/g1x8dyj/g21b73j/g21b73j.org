*[[https://xkcd.com/][XKCD]]*. Nerd humour at its finest. Given the early-installment weirdness, click a few 'random strips' to get the gist and see if you like the format before bingeing. Updates M-W-F

*[[https://www.smbc-comics.com/][Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]* / SMBC Comics. Nerdy observational humour, with similar caveats to XKCD. Updates daily.

*[[https://archives.erfworld.com/][Erfworld]]*. The first book is fantastic, the second book great. After that, read til you've had enough. Munchkinny portal fantasy. Discontinued.

*[[https://www.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/prologue/viewer?title_no=1480&episode_no=1][Seed]]* keeps making the rounds around here. Unboxed AI. Updates sundays.

*[[http://freefall.purrsia.com/][Freefall]]*. Longrunning story featuring aliens, AI, and genetic engineering. Generally comedic tone with an overarching storyline. Updates M-W-F.

*[[http://narbonic.com/][Narbonic]]* Mad Science slice-of-life. Completed, with an ongoing kind-of sequel. Genuinely great.

*[[http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/][Girl Genius]]*. Steampunk adventure series. Phil Foglio's other works, like Buck Godot and XXXenophile are worth a look at if you enjoy GG.

*[[https://somethingpositive.net/][Something Positive]]* (ongoing), *[[http://www.queenofwands.net/][Queen of Wands]]* (completed), *[[https://www.girlswithslingshots.com/][Girls With Slingshots]]* (completed) are all generally good slice-of-life works about twenty-to-thirty-somethings with relationship issues, if that's your thing.
