Aside from HPN20 and Fairy Dance of Death, the ones I've found from this sub and enjoyed are [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/threadmarks][Factory Isolation]] from [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/h9i3ew/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fuym0vp/][a couple months ago]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362076/1/Less-Than-Zero][Less Than Zero]] from [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/i76hsw/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g10lw46/][the previous week's thread]], and currently I'm reading their authors' previous works. Also, turns out you can use WebToEpub for SufficientVelocity by using it on the threadmarks.
