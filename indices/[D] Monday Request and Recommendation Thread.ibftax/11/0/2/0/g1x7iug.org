Embers is complete.

Fairy Dance of Death hasn't updated in months, but there is currently work in beta; it tends to release in fairly large chunks. I know it is still in progress, as I saw several thousand words of WIP chapter posted last week on the spacebattles thread.

Kallen Stadtfeld of Britannia hasn't updated in a couple of months, but the author is still active in other works and has expressed that they intend to continue the work.

Natural 20 is probably dead.

The author of Dragon Ball: After the end works in the health industry, so updates are currently rather delayed for obvious reasons. However, I'm not sure what you're talking about with a 2 year gap; there were regular updates all throughout 2017 and 2018.

Dungeon Keeper Ami has weekly status updates; they don't write fast, but they do write, and have been regularly putting out updates to the story since 2009.

Overlady is on Hiatus while Earthscorpion works on a different fic by the name of impurity. They say they intend to get back to it, and they've done so in the past for other stories, but once you finish the current content it's going to be a while for any future ones.
