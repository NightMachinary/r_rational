Yeah, I wanted to like SAO itself but the series kept putting me off; I think the only set I'd recommend fully is GGO, and even then I've seen better.

Progressive has it's own flaws, but is immensely better written than the original go-through of Aincrad and has a lot more space to do it.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-revelation-online.32628/]] Fate/Revelation Online is a great fic if you're willing to read a nasuverse cross; the writing style is unique, but it's not bad and once you get used to it the story is worth it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8903072/1/Halkegenia-Online]] Halkegenia Online is an enormous Familiar of Zero / Sword Art Online crossover. It's set during the Alfheim Arc of SAO and the start of FoZ. Benefits from but does not require knowledge of Familiar of Zero, as the characters of SAO also lack such knowledge. Book three is currently on hiatus but there's over a million words before you get there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10212229/1/SAO-The-Century-Voyage]] The Century Voyage is passable. I think it's a serious step down from the other works listed here but it was a fine way to pass the time on a trip; I don't regret reading it, so if you're still looking for more SAO style content or just don't want a crossover it's here.
