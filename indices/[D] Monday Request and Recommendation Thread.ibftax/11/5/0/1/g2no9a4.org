Yeah, I'll fourth this recc, with the addendum that you should honestly just skip the prologue. My understanding is that the author was trying to set up a cliche "Wrong Boy Who Lived" prologue and then subvert the cliches in the story itself, but IMO it's not worth it. Trying to think how the story might reach the events of the prologue isn't as interesting.
