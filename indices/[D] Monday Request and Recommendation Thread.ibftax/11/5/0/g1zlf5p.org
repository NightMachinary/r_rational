I'll second this rec. I enjoy the world building quite a bit, as far as I can tell all the characters have their own agency and agendas, it shows a realistic progression of how conflicting desires can lead to conflict in a friend group, there are reasonable explanations for some of the horrible things magic can do and shows a very dark side of vows and rituals which explains why more people don't do them. It's not very rational, as some of the plans are very convoluted but reactions to events are realistic and characters have depth beyond reacting what is occurring to them at the moment.

​

Multiple characters make decisions they're not happy about to ensure long term success of their goals and it's one of the few Harry Potter fics I've read with truly gray morality and hard decisions made about characters and events.

​

The first chapter is probably going to be retconned and should be ignored because it starts at the end of fourth year and I think spoils some important plot points. It has you constantly thinking about how the story will get to that point rather than wondering where the story will go next.

​

The author has a sketchy update schedule as a new chapter comes out about once a month (plus or minus a few days, tending towards plus), as he also is writing his own published book series and that tends to take priority over the fic.
