Does anyone have any good dungeon management or dungeon core novels? Will accept anything except fan fiction as long as it's good. Of the few I read, it's an interesting concept, but unfortunately all of the ones I've read aren't that good and always go the same ol' pacifist route which is exceedingly boring.

I'm okay even if it's not completely rational or even rational at all. I'll accept anything that's good.
