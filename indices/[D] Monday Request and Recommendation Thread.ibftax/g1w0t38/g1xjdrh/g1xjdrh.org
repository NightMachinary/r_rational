I've been loving these two crossover fics on SpaceBattles:

--------------

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-is-dead-arthas-menethil-warcraft-in-asoiaf.840089/][The King is Dead]]*

(World of Warcraft/ASoIaF)

Starting premise:

Arthas Menethil from World of Warcraft is reborn as Joffrey's twin.

Blurb:

#+begin_quote
  /The people called him the Pious Prince. His friends claimed he was a Baratheon, and his enemies called him a Lannister. They were all wrong for before any of those things, he was Arthas Menethil, the Damned Prince of Lordaeron, the Betrayer, kinslayer and kingslayer. His sins were legion. Mother have mercy on his soul./
#+end_quote

The author does a great job of delving into the mindset of each character, showing how their actions are shaped by different motivations, stratagems, and moral struggles, etc. Arthas, in particular, is very well written, and the story explores how his desire to atone for his past life inevitably conflicts with the cynical scheming of feudal nobility in Westeros.

Events quickly diverge from ASoIaF canon, with snowball effects building momentum into a fast-paced, gripping plot.

(Worm/ASoIaF)

Starting premise/blurb:

#+begin_quote
  /Taylor and the Chicago Wards are thrown into Westeros while on a mission. Now they must survive./
#+end_quote

The story starts out looking like an an isekai uplift plot, but in my opinion it really starts to shine when the Wards inevitably come into conflict with local governance and must learn to play the game of feudal politics in order to survive. Shard shenanigans serve to disrupt the best laid plots of Lords and Ladies across Westeros.

Along the way, the story examines how modern concepts of 'good' and 'heroism' don't really translate in a feudal system where 'good' meant unwavering fealty to a liege, no matter how cruel and selfish his commands might be.
