The important parts of Arthas' backstory are covered during the course of the fic, and in my opinion the author introduces his PoV so well that you don't need prior familiarity. At most, I'd recommend skimming a few wiki articles to get the basic gist of what the Lich King and Death Knights were in WoW.

In a nutshell:

Arthas was the Prince of the human kingdom of Lordaeron. He trained to be a Paladin of the 'Light' (basically, a generic 'good' deity). His kingdom was attacked by a necromancer who infected the populace with a plague of undeath. Arthas made some choices based on harsh moral calculus in the struggle to save his people, which eventually led him down the slippery slope of morality. He lost his sanity to a cursed blade which had given him the power to defeat the necromancer. In the end, he became that which he fought against: the Lich King - a necromancer of unfathomable power who commanded legions of undead to overrun the living kingdoms.

The Chicago Wards were the team that Skitter joined soon after she started her hero career as 'Weaver'. [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago#The_Wards][The wiki]] has a good list if you'd like to refresh your memory on their powerset. Theo and the rest of the team do have some interesting synergies (as well as foibles) when stuck in a medieval society.

I hope you enjoy the fics!
