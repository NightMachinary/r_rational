I'll second both of [[/u/Wiron2]]'s recs.

Dune is great. High hopes for the incoming movie.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85653.The_Praxis][Dread Empire's Fall]] is also pretty good. Humans get dominated by a zealously theocratic alien species, the Shaa, and become faithful vassals for a few thousand years, together with every other alien species ever discovered. But what happens when the last of the Shaa die? Who will rule the universe?
