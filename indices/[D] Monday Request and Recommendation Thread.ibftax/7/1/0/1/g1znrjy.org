It's a Madoka fanfic, which means that magic is actual physics breaking magic that runs on emotions, but made usable by clarktech from a kardeshev 2+ species known as the incubators in order to stave off the heat death of the universe. Madoka was already a fairly rational story and one of the most Sci-Fi magical girl shows around, but to the stars takes it a step further. In TTS, the conceit is that the events of canon Madoka took place a couple centuries ago, and in the meantime, humanity has climbed it's way to the stars. They have friendly AI, post scarcity economy, FTL, interstellar colonies, etc. However, they're also at war with an alien species with more advanced technolgy; their equalizer is Magical Girls, who the aliens have no known equivalent to.
