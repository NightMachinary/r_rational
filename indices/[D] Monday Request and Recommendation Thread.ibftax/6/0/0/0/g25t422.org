So far I haven't minded the war arc. It makes sense to me that there are a lot of OC characters since this is an era not really explored much in canon (the mad king is in his late teens or early 20's right now) and the POV usually switches between the SI's two sons who have command roles in the war. I do prefer the kingdom building aspects, but it wouldn't make much sense to skip the massive war that is taking place. It also makes sense to me that the author is introducing the SI's kids as main POV characters b/c it makes me think that we could get to see the fallout of the MC's changes in Roberts rebellion as well.
