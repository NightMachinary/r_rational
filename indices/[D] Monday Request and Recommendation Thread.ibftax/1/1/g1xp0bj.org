If you're willing to put up with a so-so translation and standard issue webnovel nonsense, [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-death-mage-who-doesnt-want-a-fourth-time][The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time]] does this. One of the first "neat tricks" the main character develops is literally the ability to sprout multiple heads in order to cast spells faster.

Then he finds a way to pull insects into his body. Most of the time he's an adorable kid, then he starts pulling the Aburame trick of spewing bees everywhere.
