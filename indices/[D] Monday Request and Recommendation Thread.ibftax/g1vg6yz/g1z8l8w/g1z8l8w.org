[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design][Grand Design]] is a completed webserial, and one of the few works on RR that don't seem to be litRPG power fantasies. Hundreds of years after Humanity's cataclysmic disappearance, several alien species have founded a civilization in the ruins of Humanity's space stations. Two women who might be the last remnants of the human Navy search for clues about what - or who - wiped them out. Starts out a bit too /Humanity Fuck Yea/ for my tastes, but it does become a great story about themes like transhumanism and cultural uplifts.
