The problem with hard SF with AI, post-scarcity, trans-humanity etc. is that you basically can't have a typical adventure/war/hero story anymore where a human's actions actually affect the outcome. The AI's are obviously better at e.g. warfare, why not let them do everything? You can write books about philosophical questions, e.g. if you should interfere with more primitive species, etc. (look at "The Culture" novels for that).If you add a "magic" system that only humans can access you have an immediate fix for this problem. So To the Stars has a realistic post-scarcity hard SF setting while still having protagonists with agency that one can relate to. The magical girl setting To the Stars uses is relatively hard as well, so it all fits together well, too.
