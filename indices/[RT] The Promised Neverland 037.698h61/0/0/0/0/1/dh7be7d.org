I don't think so. Mama perceived herself as being trapped in the system the aliens created. She didn't believe there was a way out for her or her charges. So she did her best to give them as good a life as she could. She obviously still did what she felt she had to do, such as breaking Emma's leg, but this chapter really drove home that she was just as much of a victim of the aliens as the kids. She just didn't happen to be eaten. Yet.
