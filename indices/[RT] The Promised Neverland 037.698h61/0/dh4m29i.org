I don't think I've ever had my opinion on a character flipped around so rapidly. I definitely disliked Mama and thought she was selfish and evil. Now...I'm a lot more sympathetic. She's definitely selfish and pragmatic, but I can no longer call her evil. There's nothing evil about doing your best to survive in a situation you know you can't escape from. Especially in the way she did it. Despite how two faced she felt after we learnt the truth about the plantation, she honestly did love her kids. And she did her best to give them the best possible life she could within the system she found herself trapped in. That's what a real parent does.
