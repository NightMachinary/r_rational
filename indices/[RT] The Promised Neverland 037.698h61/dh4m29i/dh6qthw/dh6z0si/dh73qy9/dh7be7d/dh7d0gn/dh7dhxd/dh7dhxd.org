I guess it comes down to your sense of morality at that point. Mama has an implant that lets them track her and monitor her vitals. I presume it also lets them remotely kill her (can't stress enough that this is a presumption) Her scope is very, very limited. She can't have any kids escape, lest she die. And if she dies, well...they get a new Mama and nothing changes, except that the new Mama may not actually love her kids and may treat them worse.

Those kids she "sent to their deaths" would've died anyway. If you pick up a gun and shoot someone across the street, you committed murder. That random passerby could've lived decades more. If you shoot someone dying of cancer and in tremendous pain, you've eased their suffering. So killing someone isn't unilaterally good or evil.

Mama didn't want to send any of those kids off; she had to. And, in the end, when faced with a choice to be spiteful (something any truly evil person would do), she chose to do the right thing and hide the evidence. That shows she cares. Just because she wasn't willing to heroically sacrifice herself by refusing to send kids to their deaths (which would, as I said, accomplish nothing) doesn't make her evil. In the same way that Ray wanting to permanently leave behind the younger kids doesn't make HIM evil.
