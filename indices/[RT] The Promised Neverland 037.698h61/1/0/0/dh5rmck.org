I'm not so sure. If anything, suddenly having to switch Mamas would spoil the remaining goods in the plantation. Seeing as she's had an exemplary record so far, I would expect they keep her around as a lowly subordinate, without any of the wide-reaching privileges and exemptions she's had until now. I also find it likely they'll assign her another "Krone", except this time Isabella is the subordinate.
