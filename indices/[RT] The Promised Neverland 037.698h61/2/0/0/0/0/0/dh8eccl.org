I wasn't exactly certain she jumped for joy to help the alien overlords but I also didn't perceive her as being as unwilling as this last chapter made her out to be. I also thought her love for the kids was a simple facade and not genuine at all, but I see that that's not exactly the case here. So that gave her some major points in my eyes. But I understand that, for others, this may not be the same.
