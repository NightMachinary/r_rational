Aaaand we're out. That sure took a while, but I'll be damned if it wasn't worth it.

So, Ray is Isabella's son. That's interesting, perhaps even natural in retrospect. Though, I'm not sure it matters much, considering how little either of them seemed to care.

The insight into Isabella's past was interesting, too. It sort of confirms Mamas are picked from potential escapees. And in the end, she gave them a slight push along the way? That's reasonable, I suppose, if this really meant the end of her career anyway. Though, she had better dispose of those ropes entirely, or she might be found out as having aided and abetted the escape, however marginally.

As for the children... They deserved a couple of pages of enjoying their newfound freedom, that's for sure. It's just a shame that, between that and Isabella's backstory, there wasn't room for anything about what the world is actually like. That question has hung in the air for a long time now.
