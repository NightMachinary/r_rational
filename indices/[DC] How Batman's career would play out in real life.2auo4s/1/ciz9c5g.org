According to what I've read, There are freelance crimefighters in real life. Most of them are ex-military, and they have a strict arrangement with the police that allows them to operate without causing trouble for each other or the legal system. Some of them do the whole secret identity thing (though it's kinda tenuous, since the police obviously need to know who they really are). They also have to worry about unofficial imitators; the article I read specifically quoted one of them as identifying a couple unsanctioned vigilantes and disavowing association with them and warning people to avoid them*.

So, yeah, in real life, Batman would need to avoid the whole secrecy thing and get official sanctioning. The canonical explanation for why he doesn't is that the Gotham City Police Department is hopelessly corrupt, but someone like Bruce Wane could probably get sanctioning from higher up--the county sheriff, the state governor, the feds whoever--and suddenly the legal system is on his side and he can actually drop criminals off at the courthouse and expect results. His tactics would most likely come under review if criminals complained too much, and he might find himself having to buy his way out of unwanted (but probably necessary) psychiatric attention.

* although this kinda reeks of signalling and tribal politics and ass-covering.

** But it's entirely possible my sources were BS. This was a few years ago, but I might be able to dig them up and figure out where I went hopelessly wrong if necessary.
