There are bigger concerns than how he would conceal his secret identity.

There's no way that one-man crime fighting would work for an ordinary human. Crimes are rare, and if you're responding to the police scanners you're going to be arriving just before them (meaning that you have lots of altercations with them) or just after them (meaning that you can't touch the criminals). Batman would never be able to effectively stop crime on a street level, though he might be able to stop organized crime in some capacity by doing detective work.

Which brings us to the big problem that Batman has no legal authority. If you beat the shit out of some crime boss and drop him on the steps of the courthouse in some grand symbolic act, he's going to walk free unless he's already got a warrant out for his arrest. There are immense legal issues involved in arresting someone, and there's no way that what Batman is doing is constitutional. Seriously, look up the laws for making a citizen's arrest - unless the laws are different in light of Batman or the elements of his rogue's gallery, he's not legally allowed to be a vigilante, which means that it's highly questionable whether anyone he ties up is going to face any meaningful consequence, considering that their rights have been completely trampled on.

And then there are the psychological issues that Batman has ...

I always told myself that if I ever wrote a (possibly spiritual) sequel to my Superman fanfic it would feature Batman as the primary protagonist/antagonist. Possibly a young Green Lantern Batman - though I think maybe I just like the idea of someone intelligent exploring what the ring can do.
