At risk of handwaving, and a little late, but: this would be why Batman is the World's Greatest Detective, no?

(And why most writers note that his Bruce Wayne identity actually prevents more crimes. From a rational perspective, Batman is just a side project that he happens to be personally involved in.)

But to be fair, I think normal criminals are supposed to be more intimidated by the "urban legend" aspect - by the fact, or rumour, that there's a superhero operating in Gotham - rather than actually needing to fight Bats on a regular basis in order to operate. He reserves that for high-impact targets: supervillains and/or mob bosses, basically.
