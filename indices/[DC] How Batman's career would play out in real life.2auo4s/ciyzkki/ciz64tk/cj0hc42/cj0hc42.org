1. Hire mercenaries to take over the criminal underworld. A power vacuum would be bad, but if you can dominate the underworld with masses of well paid soldiers with military weaponry you should be able to massively lessen the violence. Do a batman on major criminals, make an example of them.

2. Hire private investigators and informants to make sure you are the main person bribing the police and local politicians. Subvert them to ignore your gang activity, do a batman on holdouts. Lobby federal politicians to supply them with more money, hire angry young males to swell their ranks.

3. Get an extensive surveillance network of cameras throughout the city with face recognition software so you can quickly bring captured superscience/ super magic to attack any threats.

4. Use police corruption to ensure supervillains get executed in a bloody and painful fashion that serves as an example to the scum in the city.

5. Build an extensive and high quality public transport network to ensure people can get to jobs. Ensure this has a central shut off switch that you control to avoid a Ras Al Ghul scenario. This can also serve to reduce unemployment.

6. End the drug war by lobbying local politicians, it's a meaningless distraction and a good potential revenue source.

7. Try to steal alien or magical tech that allows cheap power, mind control, cheap resources, cheap manufacturing, or cheap transport. Mass produce it if it's safe. Stargate style, barter with every alien for technology.

8. Fund extensive adult and child education stuff so people can do useful stuff. Encourage school systems that encourage the teachers to improve.
