I don't believe I've ever seen something like that, probably because reading about socioeconomic projects wouldn't really make for a compelling narrative fiction, and also because it seems like it would have to include a lot of intensive research. And if you do away with the rubber suit and the bat theme, you're basically just writing about a billionaire philanthropist - him being Bruce Wayne doesn't really help that much.

But I would like to read that kind of thing, even if it was just a series of essays about economics dressed up in dialog form.
