If his goal really is to eliminate violent crime, the biggest deciding factor is just how much wealth he has that is fully and completely at his discretion, and how much more he can partially control with oversight from some board of directors (i.e. personal wealth and "Wayne Enterprises" wealth). A fully rational billionaire with the sole goal of eradicating violent crime would recognize that physically combating the criminals themselves is a terribly ineffective way to discourage the activity compared to correcting the flaws in the socioeconomic system that incentivize it. Basically, as sexy as a billionaire philanthropist playboy crime fighter is, it's not actually all that effective in accomplishing Batman's stated goal if the crime fighter is human (no matter how much martial training and technological toys he has to aid him).

The most rational model for eradicating violent crime I can come up with is as follows. With personal wealth, I would invest in dozens (or hundreds, if the wealth is great enough) of socioeconomic projects designed to "solve" behavioral economics but keep the knowledge secret. Specifically, the goal would be varied scientific experimentation to build a robust, theoretical mathematical framework to predict human activity and decision-making on personal and aggregate scales. Wayne Enterprises then provides an entry point into the current socioeconomic fabric to "tweak" the system over time toward the state the model predicts minimizes violent crime. To counteract the vast expenditure of wealth Wayne Enterprises would have to expend on these tweaks, the model could also be used to concentrate previously impossible amounts of wealth back into the company (which is why it would have to be secret).

Honestly, I don't know if any rational fiction posted on this subreddit has explored some or all of this idea because I shy away from economic fiction. Too many people write too many assumptions into their economic models without realizing it, and thus without justifying them. These assumptions lead to "utopia" scenarios far too easily far too often.
