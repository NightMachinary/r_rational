You could still do it so far as the criteria in the sidebar go. You just need to have a Batman with a very alien values system. He doesn't fight crime in the way that he does because he actually thinks it's going to lead to the greatest reduction in crime, he does it because he takes a great deal of satisfaction in getting psuedo-revenge on his parents' killer. And that puts him into direct values-conflict with most people he might run into.
