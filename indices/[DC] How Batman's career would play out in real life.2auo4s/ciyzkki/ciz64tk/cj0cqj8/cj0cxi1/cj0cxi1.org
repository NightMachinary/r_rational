See, this is an example of what I would describe as the 'boring' end of the spectrum. Obviously a skilled writer might be able to make a great story out of this kind of thing, but it doesn't have the sort of mass appeal of Batman. The challenge is to find a way to justify being a superhero in at least a semi-rational way.
