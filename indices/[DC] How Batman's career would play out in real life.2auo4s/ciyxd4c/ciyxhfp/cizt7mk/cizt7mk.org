#+begin_quote
  Batman's targeting of criminals from all walks of life indicated to him that Batman has a sincere grudge against the underworld, likely because he felt wronged by Gotham's criminal element, and likely suffered a great loss at their hands.

A bit of a leap here, no? Chain of implications "targets everyone equally => hates everyone equally => somebody wronged him" looks plausible, but we are blessed with hindsight. There are lots of alternative explanations: "Batman wants to test his equipment and takes every opportunity to do so", or "Batman wants to eradicate underworld because somebody from White House ordered him to do so", or "Batman is a high-functioning psycho who found a socially acceptable outlet for his need to hurt people", or "Batman optimizes his public image and wants every law-abiding citizen of Gotham City to support him for some reason", or "Batman hates black female jaywalkers the most, but he tries to make the distribution of his targets uniform in order not to give any clues about his motivation to anyone".

(also, by this logic, if Bruce became Batman because Joe Chill killed his parents, isn't he much more likely to target muggers/murderers/killers than drug dealers and burglars? It seems to me that P(E|H) is actually lower than P(E|~H) here.)

(also, how am I supposed to obtain this statistics in the first place? It's not like I could go to every criminal of Gotham, from serial killers to smoking pot teenagers and ask them "hi, how often are you interacting with Bats?". And nobody tracks Batman's deeds --- except Bats himself --- nearly good enough to be able to say who was attacked by vigilante this night)
