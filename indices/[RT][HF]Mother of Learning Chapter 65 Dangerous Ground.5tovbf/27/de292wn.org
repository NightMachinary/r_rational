Chapter 54 thought:

The fact that collecting the 5 key pieces will un-bar the Gate seems odd. If the number one priority is to keep the loop contents from spilling out, and that's why the Gate was barred to begin with, why put in a back door that a Controller can easily bypass?

However, it makes more sense to me if we assume that this was never meant as a failsafe emergency exit at all. The loop was supposed to collapse when the Controller left. I think that what's actually happening is, the Keyholder is supposed to un-bar the Gate /for the next loop in 400 years' time/. And Zorian's question was simply, "How can we un-bar the Gate?"

If the Guardian had been sapient, it would have told ZZ, "You can't leave." But since it's not sapient, and since the fact that the Keyholder prepares for loop initiation is not restricted knowledge, the Guardian simply answered their question, inadvertently giving them a way to bypass its cardinal rule.
