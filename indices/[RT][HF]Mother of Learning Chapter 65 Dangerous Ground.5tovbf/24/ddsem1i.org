I just had a thought related to chapter 55: what if they can get the Guardian to help Zorian find a way to escape without harming the original?

I know that Zorian was worried the Guardian would try to stop him looping or something. But remember, the Guardian is supposed to avoid killing diverged copies. It gets to turn a blind eye when the Controller chooses to include someone, but in this case, Zorian diverged because of the Guardian's own mistake (pulling him in with a damaged copy of the marker), so arguably it has a duty of care. It won't want to give him the original's body, fine, but it ought to cooperate with some other mechanism for getting him to the real world.
