I /thought/ that Zorian's idea of sending a simulacrum to Koth so he could use the Black Rooms was flawed. Sure enough.

If they can manage to release the primordial into the loop and keep it there during a reset, that's almost certainly the end of the thing (although, if there is a reliable and safe method of primordial disposal, why wasn't it used originally instead of imprisoning them?).
