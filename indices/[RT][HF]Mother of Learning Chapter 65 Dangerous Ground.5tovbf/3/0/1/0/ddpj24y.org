They /seem/ to be /a/ source of mana.

From Chapter 59:

  Finally, he walked over to the Hole and spent some time peering into its fathomless depths, idly wondering whether the primordial's prison was placed here because of the Hole or if the Hole was the product of the prison being placed here.
#+end_quote

There is definitely a strong connection between powerful mana wells and primordials, but it hasn't been confirmed that Panaxeth is producing the mana coming from the Hole.

The primary source of mana in the world (besides the mana automatically produced by people's souls) has never been confirmed either, though according to the Ikosian creation myth it is the "heart of the World Dragon, from whose body the entire world was fashioned."
