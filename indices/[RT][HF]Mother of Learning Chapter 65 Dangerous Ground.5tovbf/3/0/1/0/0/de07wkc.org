I somewhat doubt that the Primordials are the source of mana, from what I understand there isn't anything particularly threatening about Panaxeth specifically. He's a primordial but he isn't the biggest or the baddest, just another primordial except with a fleshwarping theme.

Considering that the mana well by the mage academy is apparently the only rank 9 mana well in the world and that's a big deal, I would expect the primordial living there to be similarly powerful however there hasn't been anything to suggest this is the case
