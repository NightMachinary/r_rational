Er, I should have specified:

The prison would be an A-B bubble, as it intersects the temporal reference frames of both dimensions A and B.

Accessing any A-B-type dimensions would create a temporal conflict due to the time dilatation that would have to be reconciled between the normal and loop dimension.

However, this analogy may be incorrect if Zorian can successfully access the primordial's pocket dimension by wrapping it in a second pocket dimension:

The sovereign gate restarted when the primordial summoning occurred---it has a fail-safe. If that fail-safe is indeed to prevent conflicting time references, then a loop pocket dimension B1 with a time dilatation of B that wraps around a primordial A-B dimension with a time dilatation of A would not bypass the fail-safe.

Wow, I feel like that explanation is going to be confusing to read. Sorry :P

If time dilatation conflicts are somehow not an issue for the sovereign gate, however, then my guess is that wrapping a primordial A-B dimension in a pocket dimension /should/ allow Zorian to tunnel into non-loop dimension relatively easily.

I say relatively easily because if Zorian learns how to wrap a primordial dimension in a secondary pocket dimension, then learns how to tunnel into the primordial dimension, then my guess is that tunneling into the non-loop dimension will already be a subset of what he learned.
