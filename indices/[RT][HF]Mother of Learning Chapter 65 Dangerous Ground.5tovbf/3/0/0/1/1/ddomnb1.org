  Perhaps he also thinks primordial prisons are somehow exceptional

They are, in some way: breaching one triggered a loop reset. So there's /something/ different about those prisons. Apparently the Maker either didn't want the primordial to get into the loop, or didn't want anything from the loop to reach the prison. Or both. Either one would tend to suggest that the prison is unique, not copied.
