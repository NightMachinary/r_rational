I don't think that it's clear yet whether or not the primordial and its prison are duplicated by the loop.

Presumably other pocket dimension contents, like Silverlake's house, are cloned. Things would get pretty weird otherwise (eg entering and leaving the temporal acceleration). And there's no indication that her comings and goings are treated as a loop breach, so presumably they are considered to be part of the loop.

We can presume that the Maker knew lots about the primordials and their prisons. So it's possible that they have special rules. And if there are special rules to keep primordials contained, then that means primordials are a threat to even a pocket dimension. Which tends to support the idea that the Maker would /not/ have the Gate create thousands of copies of them and then attempt to dispose of them each time; instead, it would just continue the strategy of keeping them contained, by destroying the pocket universe and thus the bridge when there is a danger of escape.

But it's only speculation.
