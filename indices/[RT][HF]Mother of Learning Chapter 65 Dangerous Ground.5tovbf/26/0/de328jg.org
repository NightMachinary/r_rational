Yes. The simulacrum is made out of ectoplasm, and will have clothes identical to the ones original wore at the time of its creation, made out of same stuff. They cannot be taken off, though the simulacrum can don additional stuff on top of them. The items 'copied' by the spell are really only mimicked - they are cosmetic only, and do not possess any magic or inner workings that the originals had. Simulacrum guns and grenades will not fire, and magic items will no longer have their supernatural traits. So no, it would not give any false alarms to Zorian.
