  he already did grow to ~40
#+end_quote

Not really. He's only been in the loop for a few years, not nearly enough to max out his reserves. He hit 35 magic missiles a while back, but that was almost certainly because he's become more efficient. His reserves were probably between 2 and 3 times their original state, is my guess.

Zach's mana reserves are not normal. Unresolved plot thread.
