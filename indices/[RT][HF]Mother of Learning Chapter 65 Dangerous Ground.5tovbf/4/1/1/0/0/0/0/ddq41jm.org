I they should spend a couple restarts trying to recreate that situation.

I would expect doing so to be very difficult, as RR is gone, as are the aranea who were aggressively interfering with the invasion, which means it's impossible to retrace that loop the way it happened originally.

In fact, the entire pretext for Zorian using the coin on was entirely dependent on RR and the aranea. The reason QI and company only showed up in the dance hall in the first place was because Red Robe was searching for Zach so as to learn who the other time loopers were.

  Unlike the lich and the vampire girl, who did their best to look dignified and imposing, Red Robe (which is how Zorian promptly named him in his head) walked carefully and scanned the shocked crowd with interest, his cowled head swinging left and right in search of something. Or someone, as it turned out: the moment his eyes locked onto Zach he immediately stopped and spoke.
