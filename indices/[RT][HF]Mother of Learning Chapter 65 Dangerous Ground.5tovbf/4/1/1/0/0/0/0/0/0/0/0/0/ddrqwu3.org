Um...getting government help just to craft some bullets seems unnecessary for someone who has built armies of telepathically-controlled combat golems carrying magical and chemical incendiaries, dispeller grenades, and all manner of other explosives.

All he needs is someone who can cast soul spells - which is something you would /not/ want to advertise to the authorities.
