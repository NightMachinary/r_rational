From your own quote, we see that guns can be enchanted for increased accuracy.

If the gun is magically silenced, though (or magically propelled to begin with), and you shoot QI while his back is turned, you should be able to surprise him enough to stop him dodging. No doubt his mana sense is well trained, but not omniscient; when Zorian threw the coin, he didn't realise it was magical in time to avoid it. So I doubt he can dodge an unexpected bullet, even subsonic.

I'm guessing you mean increased travel time?

  especially for a cannon ball
#+end_quote

Yeah, this seems sub-optimal. Cannonballs are meant to deliver heavy impacts to large, easily-hit targets. In this case, the target is highly agile and essentially immune to bludgeoning damage. We don't need a powerful impact, just contact.

All in all, I think that it's feasible to snipe QI. Both the gun and the bullet seem quite possible to construct, and if they can catch him with shields down, I don't think he'll be able to react fast enough. Consider the end of chapter 59, where Zorian spotted him just watching the battle; that would be an opening right there.
