How so?

They have never beaten him before. Even with an army of mages helping, the best they managed was to stall until he had other priorities to deal with. Sure, they might be able to do better next time - or they might accelerate his "let's kill Zorian first" idea.

Trying to trick him with the coin means making him think that they're harmless, which means they have to be largely defenceless - a big risk. How are they even going to set up a situation where he'll be present without going into killing mode?
