If a gateway were opened that linked the loop dimension and the real dimension, then /maybe/ it'd work? But I would not expect recalling directly across dimensions to work.

Who knows, though! To be fair, the recall ability of bonded souls must require some form of dimensionalism if it's distance agnostic, and it's probably relatively mana efficient due to its specificity of targets. Even if the concept cannot be directly utilized by Zorian to punch through to the real dimension, maybe it can still indirectly be useful seeing as real Zorian and loop Zorian have very similar souls.
