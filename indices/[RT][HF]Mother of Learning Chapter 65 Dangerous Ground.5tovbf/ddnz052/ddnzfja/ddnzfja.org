That method of disposing primordials assumes that their pocket-dimensional prisons put them somewhere outside both the real world and the time-loop world, somehow connecting to both at the same time (i.e., the primordials and prisons aren't themselves duplicated in the time-loop world).

I came up with an idea similar to Zorian's a few chapters ago--using the dimensional break to move between the loop and the real world. I discarded the idea because it seemed unlikely that there's only /one/ Panaxeth prison which is anchored in two separate worlds, but I guess nobody103 thinks it's plausible.
