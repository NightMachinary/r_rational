These are very good points. I suppose if pocket dimensions weren't duplicated, Zorian and Zach could just exit the time loop via Silverlake's house. That would be far too convenient.

Since this is the case, I'm very unclear on what Zorian's logic is re:Primordial prisons. Perhaps he also thinks primordial prisons are somehow exceptional when it comes to pocket dimensions within the loop. Maybe the reason why the loop automatically terminates when the primordial is summoned is because the gods can't actually destroy a world with a primordial in it (since this would involve destroying the primordial, which they apparently can't do). Successfully letting a primordial into the copy world might stop the looping mechanism altogether.
