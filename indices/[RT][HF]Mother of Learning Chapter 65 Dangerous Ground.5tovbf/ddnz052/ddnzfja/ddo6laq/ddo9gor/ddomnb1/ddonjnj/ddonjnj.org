A model that supports this is to think of each dimension as a bubble, which I'll give a letter to.

The real world is the bubble A. The loop is a separate bubble B, that connects to bubble A at one point..

Pocket dimensions are tiny bubbles attached to their main bubble. Non-loop pocket dimensions are A1, A2, etc. Loop pocket dimensions are B1, etc. These tiny bubbles only interface with one main dimension, so only one speed of time needs to be observed.

However, a primordial's dimension interfaces with both the non-loop and loop dimensions. Thus, when the primordial's dimension is accessed, the sovereign gate senses a new connection to the non-loop dimension and ends the loop to break that connection.
