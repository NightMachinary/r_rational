  We can presume that the Maker knew lots about the Primordials and their prisons.

Actually, we can't presume that. The Maker clearly didn't even have a solid grounding in soul magic. We can tell this because the Sovereign Gate's UI has no idea how to deal with multiple Controllers, and seems to think that having multiple controllers is impossible. At the very least, the Maker didn't know about the soul fusing curse. Even though they were capable of creating a hereditary soul marker for controlling the gate, they didn't know that it would be possible to use mechanics in the loop to bug the system and didn't bother creating any contingencies for them.

This is why I think it's more likely that the Maker just made the gate force end the loop because they didn't know what else to do about that kind of disaster. They didn't know how to re-bind a Primordial, and since they were already creating and destroying a massive pocket dimension anyway, why not just push the ultimate panic button? It's the simplest solution when you don't know what else to do.
