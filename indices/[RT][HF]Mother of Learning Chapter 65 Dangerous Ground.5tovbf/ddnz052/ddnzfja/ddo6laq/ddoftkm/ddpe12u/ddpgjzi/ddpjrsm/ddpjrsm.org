Even expert programmers---even teams expert programmers with subteams dedicated to finding errors---make products with bugs.

The type of errors we're seeing definitely seem mortal to me, but certainly do not, in my eyes, disqualify the creator from being a world-class master in the relevant fields.

Mastery does not mean perfect. Mastery just means capable of incredible feats requiring incredible skill---and that description leaves plenty of room for oversight and error. The sovereign gate definitely qualifies.
