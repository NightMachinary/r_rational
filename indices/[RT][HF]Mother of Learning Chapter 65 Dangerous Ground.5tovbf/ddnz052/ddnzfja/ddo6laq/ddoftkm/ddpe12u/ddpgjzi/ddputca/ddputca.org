You also have to take into consideration the fact that this is an artifact that has existed for thousands of years. Like Zorian said, the mechanism of the loop was created following some assumptions that simply are true anymore. The gate hadn't been activated for several cycles, according to the Serpent, so it's possible the maker decided it shouldn't be used anymore because human magic had advanced to the point where they could breach it, but also didn't bother to remove or destroy the Gate. We don't know why the Gods went silent, maybe the majority of them decided it was time to leave mortals alone and overruled anyone who went "okay, let me just remove this incredibly powerful artifact that mortal magic might mess with in a few centuries". Thus the Maker would be unable to interfere when his old project was no longer up to modern standards of security. Just a wild theory of course.
