Sure, all of that is true. But their overconfidence means that they, at the very least, had no business creating an artifact of this power. The system has failed not once, but twice, in the same loop instance. Obviously when Zorian was permanently included, but also when Veyers managed to escape without ending the looping. If two such errors, both of which should have been impossible according to the Maker's understanding of magic, happened in the same loop instance, what does that say about the relative frequency of errors in the loop, especially when one considers that a fully charged loop should last hundreds of subjective years?

The thing which created the Gate was clearly far from omniscient, and made numerous errors in the process. This implies that they were mortal, in my mind. If they were a god, they weren't the kind of deity I'd be interested in worshipping.
