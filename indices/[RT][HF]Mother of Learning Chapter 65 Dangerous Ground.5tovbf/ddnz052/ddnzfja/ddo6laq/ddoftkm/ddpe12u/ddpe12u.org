  The Maker clearly didn't even have a solid grounding in soul magic

Seriously? Every soul mage who has taken a look at the soul marker was awed at how well crafted it was. The loop has mechanisms for detection of soul damage (to the point where wrenching it out of the controller's body is enough to trigger it) and it did protect Zach from damage by the soul meld. The addition of Zorian to the loop was a fluke that is most likely irreproducible, and the Guardian not understanding the presence of more than one controller just shows that the Maker was a little too confident in their knowledge of soul magic and was certain that there couldn't be two controllers.
