Yeah, but I'm not sure how helpful it would be. At the very least he'll know of its historical value, if not its magical importance, and he'll want it back. Especially if they show up, grab it, and run; that's a huge tip-off to him that the crown is very significant (important enough for very powerful and skilled mages to take the time and risk to challenge /him/, in the middle of the invasion, just to obtain it).

So they would probably end up having to kill him somehow anyway.
