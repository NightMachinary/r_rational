  They have to figure out a way to beat him

In the meantime, though, while they search for the other keys, they're developing useful skills.

For example, Zach is developing his soul defences, so next time, QI's "panic button" wave won't disable him.

Zorian is becoming accustomed to his simulacra, learning their abilities, limitations, and politics. Next time, when the battle starts, there'll be up to four of him dominating unshielded enemies to cause havoc. He could probably even send one ahead to the ritual platform.

They're still trying to reach Silverlake, who is likely to have some impressive stuff to teach them if they can actually earn her respect. Depending on what pocket dimensions can do, they may or may not be fantastic tools for ambushes and "procurement" jobs.

They'll fight QI again, no doubt, but it makes sense to me that they're first targeting the less dangerous keys.
