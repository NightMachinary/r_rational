Are they actually contacting a spirit of they gate that is completely undetectable when not in use or are they creating a temporary one each time they perform the ritual? Maybe the gates are inert because the network's central control system went offline for some reason, and they are just temporarily animating their gate and the destination node.

Should the gate really be somewhere without sufficient ambient mana to power it? Perhaps there was once a large well nearby, but it has been diverted to somewhere else.
