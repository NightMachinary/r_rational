Flash-bangs might be an additional thing to try, however this spider is extremely resilient.

Nuking an enemy relies on the enemy being susceptible to the nuke. Buffing oneself to fly so as to not vibrate the ground or dampening air flow to limit air current sensitivity don't target the enemy and so do not rely on the enemy's susceptibility to damage.

Seeing as how they're trying to take the spider egg intact, nullifying tremor sense and air current sense may provide a second or so of surprise that could cinch the fight for them
