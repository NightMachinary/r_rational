Well, they're mages, so regardless of the strategy, it's likely to involve them casting spells, so susceptibility to the spider's magic sense is a given.

The question is, can they render some of the other special senses of the spider ineffective? If so, that might provide a useful advantage; I'd rather fight a partially blind grey hunter than one in full possession of its senses.

So, flight nullifies tremor sense and an overcharged sound dampening spell dulls hearing and the spider's air current sense. They're pre-battle buffs. If they make it harder for the spider to react to the situation (I grant you, that's an important "if"), then why not?
