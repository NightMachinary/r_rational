  Presumably the area under effect would be perfused with mana.

Agreed, both the air sense and mana sense would be able to detect a dead zone.

And holding a large volume of air motionless seems to me like it would require quite a lot of energy. Air is about 1.2kg per cubic meter, so for a cylinder with 50m radius and 5m height (which is probably too small), you'd be holding nearly /50 tons/ of air. Against whatever internal and external pressures are acting on it. Sounds infeasible.

  Simply cast a large area of effect spell to lower the temperature

Freezing spells have indeed played an important role in the spider's defeat before. I suspect, however, that it's not as easy as that. Just lowering the overall temperature might slightly slow it down, but I don't know that it will make much difference while the spider is on the warpath. And directly targeting it is insanely hard, because Matrix-style dodging plus high magic resistance. The previous occasion that we know about, the spider was hit with a freezing spell after going berserk, meaning that it didn't try to dodge - but that happened because they already incinerated the eggs.
