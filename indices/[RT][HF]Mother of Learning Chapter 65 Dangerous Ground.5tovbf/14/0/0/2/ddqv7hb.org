The problem I see here is that due to the grey hunter's superb magic sense it might be possible for the grey hunter to deem the area as a trap and thus remove itself from the area. Presumably the area under effect would be perfused with mana.

So in order to confuse it's physical senses by using magic you'd either have to have such a large area of effect that the grey hunter can't possibly escape in time or you'd have to overload its magic sense. Maybe the latter can be achieved by evaporating tons of crystallized mana.

So flash bangs in the form of extreme ambient mana perfusion, ground tremors, and turbulent air.

I think one thing Z&Z are overlooking is simple biology. Spiders are cold blooded and become less active in the cold. Even warm blooded animals don't function as well in the cold. Simply cast a large area of effect spell to lower the temperature such that the eggs are still intact but that biological reactions take longer to propagate. Think stiffer muscles, slower propagation of neuronal signals, etc.
