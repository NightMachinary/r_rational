I'm not the author, but he has confirmed on his blog that yes, a lich could make a simulacrum - or, for that matter, a fully- functional second body. However, it would be very dangerous to do so, because the copy would have all of the necromantic skills and self-preservation instincts of the original, so it could and quite possibly would try to take over.

Zorian's simulacrum was homogenous despite giving the appearance of humanity. I'm guessing clothes are all part of the illusion. Although QI doesn't wear them anyway, just armor.

And I doubt that a homogenous ectoplasm construct could fool the marker into thinking it's a magical artifact.
