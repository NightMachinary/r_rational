So, the Bakura gates are simpler than thought. They basically just consist of spellcasters making a gate together like Zorian and his copy did to Koth. The spellcasters are probably artificial and can contact each other in some way, probably similar to the telepathic relays (bigger range?).

They work like phones and you need a phone number to contact another gate. The Aranae know the number, but not enough about how the machine works, so they are trying to input a phone number while wearing a boxing glove. Very hard to do, but it will succeed if you try often enough.

It surprises me that they need so much crystalised mana to open the gate. Wouldn't ancient mages want the gates to be built somewhere they could cheaply open them?
