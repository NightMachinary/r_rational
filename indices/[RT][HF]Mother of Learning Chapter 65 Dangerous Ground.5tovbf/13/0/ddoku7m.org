If they're really artificial spellcasters then that means it's possible to create a soul. I suppose it's not surprising, since normal biological reproduction does it, but hopefully the souls don't mind being trapped in a Bakora gate forever.

Maybe it's not a "proper" soul, so it requires an external mana source to cast and maintain its gate spell.
