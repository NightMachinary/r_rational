It's underappreciated how nice some simple formatting makes everything.

I agree that the inability to kill the primordials may be the nail in the coffin---it's unlikely they and their pocket dimensions are created and destroyed every loop if killing them in the first place was impossible.

And I would very much like a follow-up on the dating life of Zorian's simulacra. I really love the character development chapters, although I believe the author is trying to balance the pacing, so it's always a hard call.
