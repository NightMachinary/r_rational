Essentially, what you're saying is . . .

The sovereign gate is an elaborate illusion, and by illusion, I mean a magical and purely graphic/haptic interface that models the world---a literal computer simulation.

Rather than rebuilding the world atom-for-atom, it just models the world graphically/hapticly. This approach would require significantly less mana to do, especially because the area you would need to time dilate would not need to be bigger than a freaking laundry closet.

The marked soul would /feel/ like it's interacting with real stuff, thus giving realistic training for a fraction of the mana cost.
