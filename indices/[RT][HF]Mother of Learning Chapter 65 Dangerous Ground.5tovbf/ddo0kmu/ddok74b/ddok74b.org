Oh... The Sovereign Gate is a computer!

This is all a computer simulation.

Sovereign gate has this fancy AI that your soul can hook into. Then it simulates the world, but it can't handle simulating gods or stuff.

User gets better at magic, because it interacts with the admins soul and magical power is about information, which the soul can get there, and the computer is so fast multiple time loops can happen instantly until it runs out of power.

The computer can simulate souls and hook any real soul to a simulated soul, which is how Zorian got there. It can also save the data back to the real soul, which is what Z&Z are trying to do.

Probably not the first to think about this. There was the talk about ADMIN keys and stuff after all, when they touched the gate.

Time looping really is impossible. But they bypassed that by having blazing fast virtual reality that can feed you back what you learned.

That's also how the black room operates. It's just very very slow compared to that and the area is very very limited.

EDIT: black room can't operate like that, could be real time magic, but is probably a trick of some kind as it's closed off the world for the time.
