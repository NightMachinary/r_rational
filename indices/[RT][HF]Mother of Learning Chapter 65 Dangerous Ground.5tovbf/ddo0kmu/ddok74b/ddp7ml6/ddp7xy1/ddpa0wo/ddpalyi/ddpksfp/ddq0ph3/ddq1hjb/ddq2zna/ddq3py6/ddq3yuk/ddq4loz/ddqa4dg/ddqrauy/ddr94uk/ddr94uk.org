  regardless of the difficulty, it's already being done. as I mentioned, the marker already does this.

I'm not sure what you mean. We already know that the Guardian cannot identify souls in their entirety; it only recognizes whether or not the soul carries the marker.

  "Guardian, how many people are you talking with right now?"

  "Only the Controller can access this place," the guardian placidly answered."

The Guardian doesn't even seem to recognize that there are different souls present---only that when souls tried to access the Gate, those souls had the marker.

Yes, indeed some drone strikes are now carried out by physical recognition. But it took decades and a large army of researchers to figure that out and it's still imperfect---and in this magical setting, the recognition would involve deep, deep soul probes to make complicated equivalency judgments based on complex criteria.

Compare that with attaching a soul marker, which might take a master soul mage a few seconds to do. In fact, Zorian casually alludes to the process when thinking about how Sudomir grants entry to his mansion.
