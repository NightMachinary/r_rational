  I'd argue that a powerful soul mage such as the Maker can, too

Are you saying that hundreds or thousands of computer programmers with years, even decades of experience working on a problem over the course of decades are equivalent to one or even a small group of soul mages working in secret?

Remember too that face recognition is an incredibly simple problem when compared against soul recognition, as souls are even more complex.

And on top of that, soul recognition isn't the point of the Sovereign Gate. The point is to accomplish the unbelievable feat of recreating an entire planet in all its detail, recreate all the bodies, all the souls, store it in a pocket dimension, temporally accelerate that dimension by a factor of . . . what's 1000 years / 1 second? About /ten billion/. And then destroy and recreate the world and everything hundreds or thousands of times. That's already super difficult.

Then, add the difficult feat of soul recognition, which would be significantly more complex than facial recognition, which was already very difficulty. I see no reason to go to all that trouble to prevent an edge case scenario of the controller encountering an enemy that would mangle the controller's soul in a very specific way, especially when putting a little marker on a soul is so much simpler and accomplishes the task more efficiently, except in certain extreme and possibly unforeseen cases.

To top it off, in normal circumstances, the controller would be well-trained in basic soul magic to begin with---which would not only allow the controller to access the switches on the marker as a fail-safe, but would also give the controller basic soul defenses. Not only that, but we already know that the loop resets if it senses Zach's soul getting tampered with---but in the case of QI's fateful spell, that fail-safe did not occur quickly enough.

It seems to me that the Maker put a decent number of safe guards in place. This is just a very strange scenario where Zach (if he actually is the original controller) was unexpectedly ill-prepared to use the Sovereign Gate.

What's more is that the Maker had the good sense of not allowing the loop to collapse if a controller exited. It's possible that the program instead checks if a controller exists inside the loop before collapsing everything. In this sense, the Gate may be working perfectly: Although soul shenanigans happened, the controller(s) are still alive within the loop and are able to try to find the Keys or maybe some other way out.

Also, I believe the Sovereign Gate is over a thousand years old. In that time, maybe some exotic spells were created that the Maker did not anticipate. We can't expect a piece of hardware to account for all subsequent advances a thousand or more years down the line; even with all our technology, we can barely account for the advances of the next five or ten years.
