then at least answer this. how does the marker know its host soul is the Controller? it has to identify the soul somehow and said soul is also changing and growing. I already pointed to a problem with a marker that grows with the soul since Zorian and Zach's marker would diverge enough that the ritual to find said marker should've failed to find Zach's.

also, at this point in time, since we really don't have the information to conclude definitively, that you think soul identification is difficult is only a conjecture/your opinion. what makes you think souls are so unidentifiable? just because they're complex? you do not know if souls have anything that would be usable as a unique identifier. there's nothing that says each soul can't have a unique, unchanging portion that the marker (or any soul sight/scan) can't use to identify souls. souls are also aren't so complex that they can't be understood at all either. otherwise soul scans wouldn't be possible and identifying foreign soul matter would also be impossible. I believe identifying souls is roughly at the same lvl of difficulty as facial recognition. heck, Zorian can recognize different minds, including differentiating individuals of foreign species and I'm sure we can both agree the mind is very complex

putting things another way. if the gods created souls to be used as records, why wouldn't they build in a method of identification?

and yes, I'd say that the mage(s) is equivalent or surpasses that of our world's programmers. they are vaaaaaastly powerful. the marker is way too sophisticated for anything less than very indepth knowledge and understanding of souls. who's to say they didn't have as much time either? the more difficult/powerful the looping process and the more powerful/resourceful the Maker, the more likely the Maker is able to do something like identifying souls imo

in any case, there's a glaring contradiction with the theory that the loop is a simulation. if nothing in the simulation's real then there's no ethical issue with wiping everything and no reason to set a 1 month limit on loops
