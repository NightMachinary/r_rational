we've already agreed that the Guardian doesn't do what it wasn't programmed to do even if a sentient person would be able to do very easily. so just because the Guardian refuses to acknowledge that there are in fact 2 Controllers (via soul check) in front of him doesn't mean he is incapable of doing so if programmed for it (the major question is if it's possible to program this rather than if the Guardian is programmed with this). just as you agreed that the Guardian can't necessarily be able to check that there are indeed 2 Markers present. the marker is definitely checkable but the Guardian simply wasn't programmed to check that (just defaults to its knowledge that there is only 1 and thus doesn't bother checking). thus, just because it hasn't shown to do so doesn't mean it can't do so.

if we're following the analogy that we can identify faces (even partially obscured) and we've been able to program AIs that can do the same (arguably better than us), and that soul recognition by sentient beings (including humans, not just gods) is comparably easy to us identifying faces, I've already argued that they can make something that can identify souls via AI as well. pretty sure the looping mechanism has way more than enough processing power for that

maybe the Guardian indeed does not have the programming to identify souls. that doesn't matter. I've been putting the onus of identification on the marker anyways since that's the thing that has shown the possibility of having soul identification built in (and the main question is, how difficult is it to identify souls rather than can the Guardian do so). in the case of the marker locking down a portion of the soul, that has a few issues. it's very susceptible to failing if that portion is ever dmged. so if a soul attack happened or if an experiment on self (enhancements rituals) fail badly, you just killed the loop. there's also the case of Zorian's copy of the marker. we can assume one of two methods this happened. the two souls mixed a bit before separating (think dissolved) or portions of their souls were spliced. for Zorian's marker not to reject him, he'd have to have a soul portion equivalent to the locked portion in Zach's. however, in the former case, that portion of Zach's soul would have to mix with Zorians and thus would have changed, thus should make the marker invalid. in the latter, Zorian would now have the locked soul portion and should be the only one looping. since this is the case, I'll assert that the marker is identifying the soul holistically

and sidenote: I have done coding before. mostly java
