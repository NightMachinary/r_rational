You can't just check if simulated soul matches with the real soul. If you have learned anything, it's not a 100% match.

Sure, some magic could check for some damage. Maybe it /does/ have some of that, but not enough of that has happened?

But as I said, not saving simply wouldn't be enough. If Zorian went through the loop without remembering last one, it would be just like the last one. Except ofc for the fact that there are other loopers now.

The thing is, the maker of the loop didn't probably mean the thing for reckless shit like taking on liches. There is no reason you should have such soul damage. It's not developed with ultimate security in mind and everything thought out, we know that already.

The one real mistake on my text was the black rooms, might be real time magic there, they do use the food and stuff they take there.
