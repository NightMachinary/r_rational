I didn't understand what you were implying by identification. Maybe the marker was a dirty hack, but it allows the admin to push some buttons on the go. Settings travels with you.

In the end the original gets overwritten by the version that has learned stuff. Why would it go agaimst something? Updating parts would imply enough knowledge, that's why it is total.

edit: Just checking if the person is the same that came in isn't enough to check for damage. If you look for 100% match, you'll automatically fail. Learning makes changes to you. You aren't the same person you were a year ago. So you'd have to check for bigger differences. It wouldn't be exact enough I think.
