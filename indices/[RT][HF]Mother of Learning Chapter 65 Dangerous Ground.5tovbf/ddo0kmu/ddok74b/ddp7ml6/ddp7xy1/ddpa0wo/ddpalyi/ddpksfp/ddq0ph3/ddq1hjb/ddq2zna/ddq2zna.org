Identifiable enough to check if it's somewhat the same person. Probably not identifiable enough to just read the data from it and modify stuff like how strong it is magically and what it has learned.

AlphaGo Go software can beat the best professionals. We can't check how it "thinks", it's a black box that can output some things so it can say stuff like what it thinks is the best move, but not necessarily why.

It had to be taught by showing it bunch of games. Pretty much what is happening to Zorian. To gods souls might be like our blackbox AI to us.
