The Guardian only checks for an active Marker. and/or if something directly contradicts the information it has, it'll default to that information without bothering to check if said info is wrong. so in that example, it knows there should only be one Controller and only the Controller can talk to it so it automatically responds that there's only one Controller, without even bothering to check that there are indeed 2 Markers present. it probably can't even answer how many Markers are present, and there's no denying that is possible to check, right? plus, the point is that the marker is able to identify the host soul to prevent copy

the Maker is knowledgeable and powerful enough to understand and manipulate souls however it wants. my pt anyways is that it should be possible to holistically identify unique souls, even algorithmically. if we succeeded (mostly) in such an endeavor with faces, I'd argue that a powerful soul mage such as the Maker can, too. even easier if the Maker was a god, one involved in "inventing" the soul in the first place
