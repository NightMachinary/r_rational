  that you think soul identification is difficult is only a conjecture/your opinion. what makes you think souls are so unidentifiable? just because they're complex? you do not know if souls have anything that would be usable as a unique identifier
#+end_quote

You're right, it's somewhat conjecture, but it's also an educated guess based on observation of how the Guardian has been portrayed, but I'll get to that. First i want to clarify that I don't mean to say that souls are unrecognizable. I believe that it depends on who/what is doing the recognizing.

For example, I'm assuming that for sentient beings that can perceive souls well enough, identifying a soul is as easy as recognizing a face. This means that since the gods are sentient and would be able to easily recognize a soul, they wouldn't need something like an ID number to identify a unique or matching souls. On the other hand, maybe gods are so beyond us that we all look the same, so an identifier /would/ be useful. What's more, an ID number might also make the mass storage of souls in some kind of afterlife databank more organized and easier to work with---like an indexing system used by a library.

So, that's recognizability for sentient beings. However, recognition for [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI][weak artificial intelligence]]---like what we've seen of the Guardian---is another matter. The statements I am making about how markers work is based on the observation that the Guardian---at least for the actions we've seen it do---does not seem to be able to distinguish between souls. On the contrary, it seems like it only responds to the presence of the marker. This inability to distinguish between souls is why the loop was able to accidentally include more than one Controller. It seems to me that the mark is all that is being looked at when determining who is allowed to loop and who is allowed to access the basic functions of the Sovereign Gate. Otherwise, why did the Sovereign Gate allow a second and third person, both of whom have different souls from the original Controller, to enter the loop? Because of this, if souls do have unique IDs, at the very least we know that the Sovereign Gate is not looking or is unable to look at these IDs to determine who loops and who can use the Gate.

I'm also not saying that the Sovereign Gate is totally unable to recognize souls or their IDs---I'm just saying that it isn't recognizing that information to perform the functions we've seen so far. Maybe when presented with the Keys, higher functions become available and some of those functions can recognize souls. However, the functions we have seen so far seem to operate merely on the presence or absence of a controller marker---probably because the process of attaching and checking for a marker is faster and simpler.

On that note, the SoulKill spell seems to place a "Do not copy" marker on souls.
