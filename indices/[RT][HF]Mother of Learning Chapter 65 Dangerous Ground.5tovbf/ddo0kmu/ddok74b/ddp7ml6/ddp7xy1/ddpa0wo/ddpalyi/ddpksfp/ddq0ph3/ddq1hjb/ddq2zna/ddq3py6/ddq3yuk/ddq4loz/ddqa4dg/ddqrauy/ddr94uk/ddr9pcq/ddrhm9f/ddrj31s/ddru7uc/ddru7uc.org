  souls are also aren't so complex that they can't be understood at all either. otherwise soul scans wouldn't be possible and identifying foreign soul matter would also be impossible

Well, we can both agree that astoundingly complex things can be examined, recognized, and understood at least in part.

The body is very complex, but I can tell if someone is bleeding, is missing an eye, has a pulse, etc.

But my mind is doing the recognition. My mind is an incredibly complex machine with astoundingly powerful pattern recognition and simulation software, i.e. imagination, running on it.

So, Zorian might be able to recognize a mind, but that kind of capability is /really/ hard to give to an object. It takes a lot of programming---programming that would allow the Sovereign Gate to recognize that two or more souls all have been incorrectly marked as Controllers. The Sovereign Gate doesn't seem to be able to figure that out, so I don't think it has same recognition software as a person.
