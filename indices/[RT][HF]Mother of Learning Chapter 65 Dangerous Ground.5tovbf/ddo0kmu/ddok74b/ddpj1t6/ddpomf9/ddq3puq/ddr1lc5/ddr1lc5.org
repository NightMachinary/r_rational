That might be enough for a computer to /extrapolate what would happen/ to a Controller, but it wouldn't be enough to give a Controller a completely immersive experience indistinguishable from reality. You might be able to operate a simulator with heuristics, but first you have to build a simulator that models all the relevant physics. And in this case, that means modelling enough detail for things like alchemy, electricity and /psychology/ to keep working normally.
