His simulacra are all mind mages of significant ability.

He can convey speech and he can read minds.

He can delete memories and fudge senses.

These abilities don't mean he implant memories wholesale like a movie. Remember how long it took him to learn how to interpret the memory packet? If I recall correctly, it wasn't merely hard to read the memory packet because it was given to him by an aranea. There was also the difficulty of successfully opening a memory packet without damaging the information.

And mind you, this took a lot of training for someone who had already spent years learning mind magic and is a natural mind mage to begin with.

I may be totally wrong and maybe he can implant movie-esque memories into people's heads, but I feel that's stretching it. And I should also mention that he had to train his kind to be able to store high-fidelity memories in the first place---which is not skill that even Zach seems to share.

I doubt so-and-so ritual master will be able to do all that, or would be happy with Zorian blatantly implanting memory packets in their mind. Anyone he hires is essentially a stranger.

But I hope I'm wrong about it because it would be very convenient for him to simply go around hiring prominent ritual specialists, implanting all their minds with a perfect memory of the Silent Adepts ritual.
