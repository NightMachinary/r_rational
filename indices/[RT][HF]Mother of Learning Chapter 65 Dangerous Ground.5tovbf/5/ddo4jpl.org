Zorian should take the Bakora Gate activation ritual to some experts he knows.

The aranea have more practical experience with opening the Gate, but I doubt that they're soul magic specialists. Being secretive and lacking hands, they'd have an even harder time making soul sight potions than humans do, if they even know how, and their smaller natural mana reserves would make enhancements less affordable. So I suspect that none of them have soul sight.

Kael and/or Alanic may be able to offer some valuable advice about why the Gate activation ritual is so hit-and-miss, and how to fix it.
