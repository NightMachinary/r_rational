This chapter is awesome, can't wait to see what they find with regards to the gate.

Unrelated to this chapter, but I was wondering why Witches used things like enhancements if their cost is so high. It's possible the reason mind magic lowers Zorians mana reserves significantly is because enhancements don't inhibit the growth of the reserves. Since Zorian was young and had yet to grow it seemed like his reserves were below average, but if not for the mind magic ability it might have been closer to his brothers! That's maybe why he can cast expensive spells like the gate spell and keep simulacrums. It's so simple and obvious but I never thought of it like that until now...
