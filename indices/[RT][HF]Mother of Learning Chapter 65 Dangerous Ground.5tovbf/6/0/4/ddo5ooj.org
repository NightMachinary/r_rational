I hadn't noticed that comment before, Zorian's case just keeps getting better for himself. If he makes full use of the black rooms, Zorian should be able to achieve max reserves before they leave the loop. If he's really lucky, upon leaving the loop he might even be able to get the doubled capacity that Zach has.

With how low-cost mind magic abilities are, he might even be more dangerous than Zach in combat against non-Mind Blanked opponents. You can even argue that he already is in certain situations, like when there's easily controlled monsters brought in against him.
