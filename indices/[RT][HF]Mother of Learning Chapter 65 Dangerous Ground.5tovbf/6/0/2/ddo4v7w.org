Your assumption that Zorian thinks that his mana reserve quadrupled (or is it quintupled?) is flawed. Zorian thinks so because he can fire that much missile. That means, what he can perceive is his disposable mana, not his entire mana capacity. Moreover, mana reserve grows organically; you don't suddenly jump from magnitude 8 to 16. In one instance he said his reserve is 12 (or so).
