It was mentioned very early on that as a rule of thumb, mages reach 4 times their starting point. Starting point is referred to as their "magnitude", and is widely variable; Zorian's is 8, which is at the lower end of average, while a few mages exceed 20, but have significant difficulty with shaping as a result (pre-loop Zach, with control equivalent to magnitude 25, struggled at school). Taiven mentioned knowing someone who was magnitude 15, but became a skilled illusionist; she regarded this as a significant achievement for someone with magnitude that large.
