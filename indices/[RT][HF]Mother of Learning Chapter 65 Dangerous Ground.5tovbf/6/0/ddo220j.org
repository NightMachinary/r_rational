Yes, the author has confirmed that.

For example, Zorian is magnitude 8; let's say that his mind magic costs him 2 points, so he would normally be 10. In that case, he'll eventually grow to 38 = (4 * 10) - 2, not 32 = 4 * (10 - 2). Although his increased magic missile skill makes it infeasible to measure that.
