From Ch 23:

  [The basic shielding spells that mages like to use will pretty much ruin your ability to use empathy on them. Too much interference. Detecting them, on the other hand, becomes even easier. Any mind-affecting spells make a mind 'noisier' to a psychic, even defensive ones. Especially defensive ones, now that I think of it. Well, except for that one infamous spell called 'Mind Blank' that actually causes a mind to disconnect from the Great Web, making a person completely undetectable to mind sensing and utterly immune to mind-affecting magic. Pretty terrifying stuff, that.]
