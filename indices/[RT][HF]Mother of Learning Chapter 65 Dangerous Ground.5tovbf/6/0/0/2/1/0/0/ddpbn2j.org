Maxing reserves doesn't seem to be difficult, just a slow matter of casting magic frequently for about 10-20 years.

Depending on the permanent enhancement type, (ritual vs blood magic?) it might be passed on to their descendants, and too high a mana cost would make them stillborn/inconceivable. Inherited abilities are at minimum cost, and acquired ones have varied efficiency compared to their actual cost. I'm guessing an inherently 2 cost ability might end up needing anywhere from 2.5-6 from the reserves if it is an acquired ability, with the higher end being it done badly. Actually, maybe blood magic is minimum cost too, I can't remember for sure and can't remember where exactly nobody103 mentioned these things. The wordpress page's comments?

There's also a risk of permanent soul damage, again depending on the quality of the enhancement ritual.

But I agree, Zach, and to a far lesser extent, Zorian would benefit from enhancement rituals, but I kinda doubt it will go down that route too much. It would be interesting if Zach decided he needed 40 or so improvements to up their success rate upon leaving the loop.
