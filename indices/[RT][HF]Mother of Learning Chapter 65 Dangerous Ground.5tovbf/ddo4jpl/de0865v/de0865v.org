It might be entirely possible that the Bakora gate activation problem isn't a problem at all. I imagine that the gates aren't designed to be used by spiders, I imagine they were created by ancient (probably human) mages, it's be kind of funny if all it took was a human to attempt to contact the gate and it would work fine. Though I doubt one of Zorian's problems are going to disappear just like that
