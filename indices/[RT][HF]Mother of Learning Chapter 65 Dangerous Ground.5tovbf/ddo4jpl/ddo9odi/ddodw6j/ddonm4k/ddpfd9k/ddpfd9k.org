It makes a big difference if, say, you're losing a fight and need to escape, or call in reinforcements. It makes a big difference to the total number of trips you can manage in a day. It would surely make a difference to the kind of courier fees you could charge.

And there's also the fact that it would be one spell for one aranea, instead of potentially magically exhausting 15 of them.
