Okay, I've had a day to mull over this chapter. Here are some thoughts:

*Immortal Eleven Theory*

  ...I heard there are people who gained great powers by binding the blood of primordials to themselves

All this talk about the ancient blood of primordials has got me thinking. If the blood of Panaxeth can be used to give people shapeshifting abilities, what sort of properties do the bloods of other primordials have? In the worldbuilding blog [[/u/nobody103]] recently mentioned that the Immortal Eleven “are a group of eleven mages that created and drank a potion of eternal youth,” but he seemed reluctant to talk about them any further. I wonder if the basis for the Immortal Eleven's “potion” was actually the blood of another primordial (besides Panaxeth). Maybe when Zach and Zorian get around to visiting the other elementals, they will find that they are not the first humans seeking such information.

Maybe, if the other elementals are unwilling to further cooperate with humans, they end up seeking out the Immortal Eleven for the location of another prison?

This is, of course, all highly speculative.

*Primordial Prisons for Loop Escape*

After some discussion with people here, I think it's unlikely that the primordial prisons are duplicated in the copy world. They are instead anchored to both the real world and copy world simultaneously.

Some compelling evidence for this conclusion is that the gods (who presumably built the Sovereign Gate) seem incapable of destroying the primordials (which is why they're imprisoned). This is likely why the time loop is designed to terminate when a primordial is summoned. Destroying the copy world with a primordial roaming in it requires destroying the primordial in particular, which the gods (and by extension, the Gate) simply can't do. I think Zach and Zorian will need to be extra careful while investigating the prisons. I think tricking the Gate into allowing a primordial into the copy world could break the looping mechanism. This would be extra bad since if they're killed in this scenario, it's effectively game over for them.

*Second Date with Akoja*

I'm disappointed that [[/u/nobody103]] didn't talk about the followup date that Zorian agreed to so that he could “give her employment materials.” Everybody seems to have forgotten about it already...
