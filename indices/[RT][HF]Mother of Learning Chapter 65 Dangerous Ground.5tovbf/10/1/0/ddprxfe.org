Ooh, this is an interesting idea.

The only mention of the Immortal Eleven in the story proper (so far as I can tell), is Taiven discussing Oganj in Chapter 16:

#+begin_quote
  And I heard he killed two of the Immortal Eleven too.

This made me think that the Immortal Eleven were a well-known group, with public identities. This comment also directly followed Kael's anecdote of Oganj annihilating an army sent to subjugate him, which made me think that the two who died were attached to said army, and that the Immortal Eleven had government ties. This could be me reading too much into a passing comment though. It is more than possible that not all members of the Immortal Eleven revealed themselves to the public, or that Silverlake has multiple identities (likely).

I guess we'll just have to wait and see, presuming the story ends up incorporating them at all.
