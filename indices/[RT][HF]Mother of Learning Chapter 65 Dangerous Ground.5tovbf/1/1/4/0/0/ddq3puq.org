It's unclear how the magic works, but advanced heuristics might ease the processing power difficulties of such a model.

To give an example, the US Air Force recently developed an AI that consistently out-class top pilots, even when the AI is handicapped. To accomplish this feat, it was unnecessary to for the computer to model neurons arranged as well-trained brain; only the emergent phenomena were needed: piloting ability, strategic planning, etc.

Maybe this advanced illusion uses heuristics to bypass modeling atomic and subatomic interactions perfectly.

I mean, the Sovereign Gate is already able to perform a planetary scan and recreate details and information that would not necessarily have be accessible to the Maker. Maybe this scan allows a high-fidelity illusion to be constructed.
