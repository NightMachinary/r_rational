The degree to which the simulation is indistinguishable really depends on the strength of the simulation. I say this because whether our own universe is a simulation is a question being explored by a few of today's scientists.

Like you say, certain quirks would be expected to show up if a reality were actually a simulation, but in a high-end simulation, these quirks would mostly show up in extreme cases that are computationally prohibitive and/or where heuristics give results that are /good enough/. So, these scientists are investigating certain fringe phenomena such as gamma ray bursts, which are ultra-high energy events.

If the Sovereign Gate were engineered by gods, it could have been a high-end simulation --- had the Guardian not specifically ruled out that possibility.
