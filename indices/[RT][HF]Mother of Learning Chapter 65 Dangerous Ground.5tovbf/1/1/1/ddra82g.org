oh, and probably the strongest evidence to contradict a simulation is the one month limit. the Guardian has stated that the whole reason one month was set is because mass killing of souls is unethical but killing a copy is tolerable. one month is within tolerance of a copy soul being "the same" as the original as there's not enough divergence to claim they're different. but if it's all a simulation, none of the simulated souls are actual, real souls. then there should be no ethical issues at all in wiping it out, is there?
