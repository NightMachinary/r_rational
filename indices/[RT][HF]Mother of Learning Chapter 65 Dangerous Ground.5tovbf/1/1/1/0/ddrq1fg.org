Yeah, there's definitely the opinion that if an AI is advanced enough to make it indistinguishable in behavior from a person, then it is a person in all important ways. Turning it off is equivalent, or at least is nearly equivalent, to killing a person, and that should give us just as much pause.

I'm glad this theory was proposed and explored by you guys. It led to some interesting places.
