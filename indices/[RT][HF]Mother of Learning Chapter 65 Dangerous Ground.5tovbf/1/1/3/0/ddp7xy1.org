Only if you want to lose the damage too. It doesn't reload the "real" soul every time and save stuff back to it. It copies your soul when you start and only overwrites the original if you "exit" before the system crumbles. It can only save the whole state, not just what you learned and stuff.

Technically it /could/ have been built to notice when the soul is too damaged to save and use a backup of the soul instead, but it apparently wasn't. Though if you don't remember the last reset, you would just do same things again.
