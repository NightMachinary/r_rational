I guess you just assumed that the simulated soul can't physically leave the loop at all since the simulation is just that. a simulation and thus not real. but still, I obviously didn't mean a data swap? first, the process you described is effectively the same as overwriting except with the added action of rewriting the simulated soul to become what the real soul originally was. what's the point of that added step? plus I already explained what I meant explicitly. physically switching the positions of the simulated soul and the real soul. so the simulated soul now resides in the real body while the real soul is in simulated loop (and thus wiped/killed)

the soul is also not just information. there's life force/mana and there's also production of and processing of mana. and this last part is also an important part that grows

let's take another approach to your computer scenario. let's take it to the logical extreme. if the simulated is not real at all, then there's absolutely and utterly no way for loop!Zorian to escape at all. ever. his only option is to overwrite Zach's soul but that'd require sacrificing Zach.

the other extreme. if it's all a pure computer simulation, then to some extent the computer must be performing all calculations for every action. in that case, it should be quite simple to rewind to the exact moment before any and all soul dmg. at the very least, it'd be easy/obvious to include this function: if the soul takes too much dmg, record time into loop this occurs. reload the soul from the start of the loop. allow soul to repeat exact loop up to point where they suffered soul dmg. force restart early right before the time recorded

why's identifying souls important? that was what I was arguing for the whole time and you were denying the whole time. the marker currently always identifies its host soul to check if it should be working. so there's already no denying that the Creator (or the computer in your scenario) can identify souls. and I was arguing it'd be safer and more foolproof to compare the real soul to the host soul rather than simply checking the host soul
