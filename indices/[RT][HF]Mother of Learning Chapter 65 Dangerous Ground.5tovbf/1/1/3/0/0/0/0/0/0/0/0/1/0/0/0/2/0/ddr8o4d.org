how else would the marker identify the correct host if not identity? it seems to be checking the soul holistically. if not, it'd imply at least 1 of two things. the Maker knows enough about souls to identify and target "unchangeable" parts of the soul, the part that the markers are checking for "is controller" (this also then implies that such a part is unique, and thus easily used for identity). or the Maker can force certain parts to never change, which also implies a degree of understanding (no negative consequences and such).
