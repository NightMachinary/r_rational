The guardian confirmed that the controller's real soul participates in the simulation, so it is updated in real time.

We can still answer your question about updating the original, though, because that's what Zorian will have to do: The pre-loop soul is thrown out and the new one replaces it. Or if Zorian can physically leave the loop, he also has the awkward option of just letting pre-loop Zorian live.
