sry, I took a different approach. this time I meant when the restart happens, the system checks if the simulated soul matches with the real soul. if it passes the check, then save the simulated soul. rather than free pass simply for having a marker. this is also a good method to make sure the soul wasn't utterly damaged. should be possible given what we know.

1. souls can be differentiated if souls really are records for the gods

2. souls can be checked for dmg. there's many different things that imply such, with soul bonding, soul magic/sight, soul scans, etc.

but yea, basically I don't think simulated looper soul holds water
