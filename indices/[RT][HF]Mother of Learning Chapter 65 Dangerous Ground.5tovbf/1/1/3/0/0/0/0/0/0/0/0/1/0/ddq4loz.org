as I said, I changed the question/counterpoint to your scenario with a different approach. so I wasn't referring to dmg check past my first comment

a swap would mean killing the original and putting the simulated into the original body and that is what's against the basis of the loop, thus this is probably not what you were going for.

and as I mentioned, there's ways to check for the identity of a soul even after changes. I was never asking for a 100% exact confirmation. hence why the marker works in the story and is pointless to copy but also doesn't backfire and reject the intended Controller one second later when the soul grows/changes. this identification process already exists

if the real soul is overwritten with the simulated soul, why even have this extra degree of separation? why not just send in the real soul (which basically makes your computer simulation scenario effectively the same as the story's current hypothesized scenario)? as you mentioned, the loop wasn't built with ultimate safety in mind nor (in your opinion) made with fighting OP liches in mind so it shouldn't be an issue. you could say it's for that safety in the off chance that the soul is dmged too greatly, the loop can abort with 0 changes to the real soul (ALL progress aborted) but eh. as you mentioned, it's pointless to revert to a previous copy of the simulated soul since it'll just repeat so an abort is the only option in that case

and imo, if the Creator is at a good enough lvl with soul magic to overwrite souls, he's capable of identifying souls
