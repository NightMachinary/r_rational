? that's all I was asking for, no? enough for identity check. safer looping check than simply having a marker. not sure what you're getting at with modification. this does bring up another question: what happens at the end? is real soul "updated" with the simulated soul, swapped out, or what? swapped out goes against the basis of the loop and why Controller gets to leave. updated implies the Creator knows enough about Soul magic to do such a thing and that all your issues with identifying and modding the soul to be invalid imo

and I don't think their gods, as flawed as they might be, are on the same lvl of understanding as us with AlphaGo. there's probably not enough information to really debate this tho
