  it should be quite simple to rewind to the exact moment before any and all soul dmg

Backing up the previous loop's copy of Zach's soul to use as a replacement in case of soul damage would be entirely feasible.

However, rewinding is more complicated. This depends on how the simulation is run. It's more likely that a simulation as complex as this is inherently chaotic and cannot be rewound.

And if the simulation throws away information from previous loops except for information belonging to marked "souls" (garbage collection in programming terms, which saves memory usage), then rewinding would be impossible even if the simulation were deterministic.
