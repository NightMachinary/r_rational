  a swap would mean killing the original and putting the simulated into the original body and that is what's against the basis of the loop, thus this is probably not what you were going for.

It kinda is... If content of the soul is just information, there should not be a problem with 1:1 rewrite of the information in the soul. So there should not be a problem with a rewrite that is like the original, but has learned stuff either. It doesn't swap the soul, it swaps the contents. The devil is in the details I guess. It's also possible that soul is not 100% information, but the relevant parts are and that's what is used here so that not whole soul gets rewritten. Ofc one can argue there are ethical problems.

  if the real soul is overwritten with the simulated soul, why even have this extra degree of separation? why not just send in the real soul (which basically makes your computer simulation scenario effectively the same as the story's current hypothesized scenario)?
#+end_quote

Because you can not. It's a computer. It can't handle souls. It can communicate with them and can handle information. It gets the information from the souls and plays with them and can then output the information back to the souls.

  he's capable of identifying souls

I'm really not sure where you are going with this. I'll take time to reread this whole thing and think.
