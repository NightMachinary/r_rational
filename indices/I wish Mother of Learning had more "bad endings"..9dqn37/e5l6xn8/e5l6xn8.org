I wish Mother of Learning had more dialogue.

It's hard to get into characters when the author's writing diary-style in 3rd person: "Just like that, another five restarts had passed."

Don't get me wrong here, I enjoy the series, but it is what it is. Z & Z were in hard mode from the get-go with Red Robe active and Zorian's paranoia in full swing; but because of the mechanics of their time-loop existence, it wasn't really logically possible to escalate to a Bad End after RR escaped. They had the drop on everyone, they had the choice to engage, and the author chose to gloss over the emotional consequences of their choices in that diary-style kind of way.

Rational protagonists can suffer emotional consequences to their actions. Humans are fallible. You can do everything right and still end up in the wrong. And that can fuck a person up; and when a person's fucked up, irrationality can be a rational outcome for their character.

It wouldn't have been a reach for Zorian to suffer emotionally after the Aranea were 'soulkilled', or at a bunch of other climactic points in the series, but the author chose to gloss over it. We're never really *in the moment* with Zorian the way we might be in a 1st person narrative like The Practical Guide to Evil, because a paragraph or two down we always get a - Break - with a time-skip and a new scene.

So tl;dr, I agree with you in spirit, but I attribute it to the author's writing style.
