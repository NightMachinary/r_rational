The author set it up like that as well. That they had a lot of fun in the beginning, some serious issues with various problems, and now they're basically jaded as **** because they've seen everything gradually. The human mind becomes jaded to most things, and that's one of the reasons why this is such a great story. He took Zorian, a workaholic, and showed what a guy like that could do when he had tons of restarts to a month, as well as a friend that is basically a jock that worked himself slowly up from zero to hero. To me it makes perfect sense, and I suspect it's one of the themes of the story. A slow build, seeing how they work their butts off to get to the point where they're powerful, but not yet overpowered. It'll be interesting to see how they'll handle entering the real world again where they can suddenly die
