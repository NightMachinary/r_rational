They did; The Cyorian aranea colony got 'soulkilled' and Zorian was sent into hiding. Later on we find they were only ejected from the loop, but at the time, the threat was real. The way I see it: He did everything flawlessly, Stopping the invasion and QI in one of the most badass moments of the book. Even so, right afterwards he gets royally screwed over.

I agree with you though, that the time loop is a great place to give Zorian lots of bad endings, and the author could've put in more 'safe but painful' failures in, say, a wasted month. At this point, it would be unreasonable to put in, since we're at the climax and failures here would be looked down upon.
