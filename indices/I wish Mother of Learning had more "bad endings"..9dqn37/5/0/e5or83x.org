Fate/Stay Night's focus on worldbuilding is just as good as or better than MoL's, /despite/ having a large romantic focus. And it's bad endings put the main character through insane levels of emotional pressure/unexpected death, which hasn't happened to Zorian in ages. His level of emotional detachment most certainly takes away from the story.
