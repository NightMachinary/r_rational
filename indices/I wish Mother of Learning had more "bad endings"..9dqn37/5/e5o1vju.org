To be honest we have seen these things in the first few months, but the thing in MOL is that they grow with each restart and actually have some form of control now. They actually took great risk in giving a temporary marker to so many, and silverlake is the worst possible result so it kinda goes that way. And also this is not a jap. style light/visual novel like those you mention. Not to degrade them , but they are mostly shounen / wish fullfillment tropes and dont necessary have a hard focus on world building like MOL. The style of writing is also completly different, and that is great.
