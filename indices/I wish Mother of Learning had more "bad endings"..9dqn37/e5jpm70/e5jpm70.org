They have plenty of bad endings. They have one every month.

They're in a time loop. They get killed regularly. It doesn't matter because it's a time loop and nothing that happens to them is comparable to the reality of the situation they and everyone else in the pocket universe are in.

A little more "To hell with you, Zorian, could you next time NOT tell me I'm going to die in... 23 days please" might be nice, but damn, how much existential horror do you want?
