I thought the point of rational fiction was that the people involved don't act like idiots? Or at least, beyond common IRL idiocy. They've had literal years to deal with this by now and while Zach may have had a breakdown early on we didn't see.... why would Zorian panic more than the 8 months he took at the start? He didn't particularly care about anyone, and magic was an actual physical real thing so it wasn't like his worldview was shattered.

I can understand Zorian failing and wanting to see that, but it's either QI slaughtering the city and the primordial not being unleashed or the primordial murdering most of the continent. That's not quite worthy of another 3 week long delay in my opinion...
