The Dire series is currently one of my all time favorite super hero series. It features a protagonist that is usually rational, in that she always acts in what she believes to be a manner that furthers her interests. Whether those interests are achieving long-term goals of world optimization or appearing to be a laughably maniacal supervillain who CRUSHES ALL WHO DARE STAND BEFORE DIRE, she's consistent.

Granted, there are some flaws, some intentional blind spots, etc, but over all...it's just such. A fun. Read.

I haven't read Hell, yet, but I am super excited to do so, and highly, /highly/ recommend the series.

In direct comparison with Threadbare: I enjoyed the Dire series faaaar more.

EDIT: I enjoyed Threadbare as well, but not as much. Threadbare has some flavor inconsistencies that bothered me.
