I couldn't really get in to threadbare. I was frequently bothered in the first few chapters by what I saw as difficulty in execution in regards to a character that was just born. The protagonist would frequently make conclusions or act on knowledge that it should not have been able to reasonably attain from a blank slate.

I kept thinking to myself "But, how could it have known that?" or "That's not a realistic assumption to make without outside knowledge."

It would not have been as bad if the problem was more consistent. At time the author did what I'd consider a good job, showing that they thought things through. Other times it appeared more hasty as if the author didn't pause to think whether or not what was written actually made any sense.

That said, I might pick it back up sometime because I was enjoying the series despite this issue. I just couldn't get past it at the time I first tried reading the story.
