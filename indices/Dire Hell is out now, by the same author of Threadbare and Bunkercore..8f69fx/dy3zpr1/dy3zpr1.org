I thought the beginning of threadbare was a fun idea, executed...adequately. Gave up about half through as it tried to broaden its scope and cast. Anyway, I bought the first book of the Dire series and am 30% of the way through the first novel. It's mediocre so far. The main character is intriguing but the rest are fairly bland, very little has happened plot wise and I'm currently enduring some cliche â€˜let's guard our prisoners with zero competence and forethought' nonsense.
