Depends what country you're in. Assuming you live in the West it should be not too hard and without anywhere near the risk of death of childbirth, you can always fly to another country to pick up a kid. None the less the cost of a new life and all that entails has to slated against the parents desire to have a kid.

The fact that many barren people manage it who are otherwise not rich or rational or have some other positive means the ceiling on this can't be that high

Plus I have a feeling that you won't be using a surrogate even though you value your wife's life more than anyone else which makes me doubt the clarity of your thought.
