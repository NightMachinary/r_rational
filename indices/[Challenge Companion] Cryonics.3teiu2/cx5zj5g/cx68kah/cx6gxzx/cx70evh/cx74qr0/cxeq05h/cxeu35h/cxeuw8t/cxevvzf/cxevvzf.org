From the article:

  Women with insurance pay out of pocket an average of $3,400, according to a survey by Childbirth Connection, one of the groups behind the maternity costs report.

If you're suggesting that I use the value prior to insurance ... well, let's say that I want to install more energy efficient lighting in my house. I look at the cost and see that it's not worth the energy savings. Then I find that there's a government rebate that cuts the costs in half. Do you think it's rational to skip over doing a new cost-benefit analysis with that rebate in mind? After all, the government (and thus society) is revealing its own preferences by offering the rebate.

Or more to the point, if a birth costs $30,000 but I only have to pay for a fraction of it ... why would I pretend that I have to pay the full cost when I don't?

Blame the society that sets up these incentives if you want, but all you can blame me for is taking a rational look at my incentives.
