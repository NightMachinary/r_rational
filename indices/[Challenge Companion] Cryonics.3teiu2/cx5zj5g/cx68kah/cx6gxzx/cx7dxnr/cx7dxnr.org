I don't think I've had a reason to, thus far; in the case that I'm treating as the default, people are having children with 1) enough resources to raise them into adults, 2) the prediction that the children will be able to become productive members of society, and 3) an assumption of their own mortality. Ah, and narrowing it further 4) the intention of not having more than two children total. In other situations I might be doubtful of the policy taken (some cases more than others), but generally would not act to generate unnecessary hostility to myself through unnecessary criticism, preferring that meaningful approaches to population control be attempted on a wider scale. Regarding 3), note the desire to keep one's own genetic/memetic information in existence and the issues if underestimating how long biological immortality would take to develop. (That is, the risk of one's line (or humanity in the general case) dying out if not having children and then dying of old age anyway.) To summarise, having children is (at present, and mostly any situation where humans have finite lifespan) fairly easy to justify, within certain limits. If there are plentiful resources on Earth to both cure the sick and for people to have children, then both can be done. If it comes down to an either/or triage situation, then prioritising one's desire to have a(nother) baby over a stranger's life is ethically questionable, though there are circumstances in which it could be justified. Edit: As a note, 'stopping humanity from dying out' is an example of a valid justification for not pouring all baby-making resources of one mortal generation into health care for that generation.
