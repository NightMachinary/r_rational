Thaw a middle-aged survivor for what? For fun? Most people who can afford to be cryopreserved die at standard life expectancy. People in their 70's are unlikely to want to go back to work in order to live anywhere above subsistence... and, with the re-training they'd require, few people would be willing to hire them.

Let me ballpark something:

Right now the average lifetime earnings of an individual high school graduate in the US is $1.2 million and the poverty line for a single person is $13,550. Each additional person in the household adds $4780 to that assessment. I don't think $1130 per month is a bad guess at bare basement requirements housing, food, clothing, utilities, and health care and I would agree that, as things stand, housing is the biggest chunk of that so an additional $400 per month for everything else (including a bit of additional space and furniture in the home) isn't insane.

The average American household is 2.58 people, so $13,550 + $4780 + ($4780 x .58) ALL divided by 2.58 = $8179.22 per person per year.

$8179.22 x 120 = $981,506. Having a child would leave the average American with a little more than $200,000 or $2000 a year with which to pay their non-poverty expenses during the 100 or so years they're not living with their parents.

A couple could pool their earnings towards a single child and have $14,000 left over per year together: $7000 per year apiece.

Which assumes they can pay for their child in installments rather than as a lump sum. People tend to earn more money as they age, so the majority of that earning potential is in their adult years rather than their teens, 20s and 30s when (biologically) it's best to have children.

If they actually have to pay the whole million at once, they'll have to live like paupers well into their forties and probably have the child using a surrogate womb and a cryopreserved embryo from their twenties.

If the money can be paid in installments, what happens if parents lose their ability (or desire) to continue paying such a steep price year after year? What if they quit their jobs? Who forces them to pay?

Again, this is just a ballpark so the numbers are almost certainly somewhat inaccurate, but the principle stands. I can /imagine/ an authoritarian nightmare in which your mandatory reversible sterilization plan works, but I don't think I'd like to live there... "in the interest of human rights" or not.
