  What sort of society has to exist in order that raising children is more difficult and less desired than raising the dead?
#+end_quote

A society where in the interests of human rights, every person is guaranteed from birth a basic cost of living stipend that assures no person will go without food, housing, healthcare, or other necessities - a stipend provided from a trust fund that must be paid in full by the prospective parents before their time-of-puberty-mandated surgical sterilization is authorized for temporary reversal.

No human legally born after that mandate ever lacked for the basic needs of life, and none needed to find employment, though many still did to earn enough to pay for their own child, or to afford a slightly less shitty apartment. As humanity's population diminished on the backs of people who didn't care to or weren't able to afford the cost of living for their children, wealth condensed in the smaller remaining pool of people who were driven to succeed and reproduce and take jobs in order to afford children of their own.

And thus, it was their genes and moral values that propagated into the next generation, producing more hard-working people who now could not have their drive to succeed quelled simply by being born with a shitty hand and unable to secure the basic needs of life. Of course, some people didn't want their own biological children, and paying an entire life expectancy is troublesome. What to do if you can only afford sixty years of stipend instead of a hundred twenty?

Pay a diminished stipend, and thaw a middle-aged cryonic survivor.
