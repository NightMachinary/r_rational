One of the arguments I've heard (from cryonicists) is that you might get revived as a novelty or source of history. That seems like it's ripe for a short story, though I doubt that I could write it as anything but a tragedy or horror story.

I think a lot of the people who advocate for cryonics are the same sort of people who think that being tortured indefinitely is better than death (which is a legitimate position to hold, but not one that I agree with).
