There are numerous differences, such as that person's specialized knowledge, living people who would value thawing, and contractual obligations of the policy. There is also the major obstacle of thawing, which is currently unboundedly more expensive than the return gained, due to current impossibility. When thawing becomes cheap enough, I would say it might become necessary to thaw corpsicles (once they are guaranteed to not die longer-term of complications and their various reasons for being frozen in the first place, in other words, when the treatment of those conditions are themselves cheap enough).
