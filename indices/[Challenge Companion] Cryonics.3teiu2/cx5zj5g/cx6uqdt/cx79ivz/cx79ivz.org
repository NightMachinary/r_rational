I am, at this very moment, ignoring the suffering of tens if not hundreds of millions of people whose screams I cannot hear. 15,000 people are born every hour, and 690 of them will die before the age of five.

Even if I felt like I had to help every single one of them on moral grounds, the corpses in freezers would still be last in line. They can wait. That's what they do best.

In fact, I'll go so far as to argue that it may be amoral to resurrect them. What if the freezing or thawing process is not 100% effective and, as a general rule, causes the equivalent of a stroke? Do we wait until we can replace those memories and functions with functional ones? Are we allowed to make those sorts of changes without their consent?

If we figure out how to reanimate the dead but haven't yet solved the problem of aging, a return to life may do irreparable damage to their brains just because they'll start getting older again. Should we resurrect them now, or wait until we can provide them with a perfect body? Or should we wait until we can simply upload their consciousness to a shared virtual reality? Should we "wake" them up to ask, even if there's a chance it will do additional damage now?

Is it legally acceptable to make an Em using their brain pattern and get permission from that simulation? Is it amoral to delete that Em afterwards?

If Ems can be made does the moral imperative to resurrect the meat brain go away?

What does "human rights" even mean?
