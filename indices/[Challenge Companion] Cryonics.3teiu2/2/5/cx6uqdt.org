Since my story prompt response was picked apart, I'll just drop back on the humanist reason to thaw someone.

#+begin_quote
  I'm full of sour grapes when it comes to pulling people up off a cliff, so the urge to write a short and depressing science fiction story about it is pretty tepid.

  That said, I love bald speculation.

  What is a human mind worth? There are billions of them available right now, and while producing new ones is energy and time intensive, people have been doing it casually and more-or-less by default for hundreds of thousands of years. There's such a glut of supply that demand only enters the equation in the rarest of circumstances. Outside of close friends, family, or (extremely rarely) loyal followers... who would want to pull up an adult hanging off a cliff (probably a fatal drop) when there's an enormous stock of children available instead? They're cuter and their brains have a lot more natural potential for neural plasticity.

  Writing prompt: What sort of society has to exist in order that raising children is more difficult and less desired than raising the cliffhangers?

  So far as I can tell it requires the same sort of economic situations that encourages slavery. Regular citizens are unwilling to work a particular class of job or in a particular location. They and their children have the ability to refuse subsistence wages, possibly because an equivalent lifestyle is available to them from the state.

  Which means that even a post-scarcity dystopia isn't going to raise the cliffhangers unless there's no other source of cheap labor: A legally oppressed caste, illegal immigrants, foreigners overseas, robots.

  What would ever make it more worthwhile to spend effort raising the cliffhanger than to spend those same resources enriching the lives of the living and their progeny?

So, different question.

How immoral do you have to be to watch someone struggle, trapped in a freezer, and not unlock the damn door for them? Is it better if they're gagged and paralyzed so they can't scream? Is it better if the death by freezing is happening slower, so you have more time to think about it?
