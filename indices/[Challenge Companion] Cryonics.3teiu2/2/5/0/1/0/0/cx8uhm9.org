Who knows. It just seems like an important distinction to make. I'm way more averse to already existing (even if inactive) intelligent minds being destroyed, than I'm to them never coming into being in the first place. In other words, while I'm quite fine with people not having children, not reviving the corpsicle, given the opportunity, seems like a pretty shady thing to do.
