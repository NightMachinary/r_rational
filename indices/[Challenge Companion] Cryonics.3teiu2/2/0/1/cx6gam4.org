  What is a human mind worth? There are billions of them available right now, and while producing new ones is energy and time intensive, people have been doing it casually and more-or-less by default for hundreds of thousands of years. There's such a glut of supply that demand only enters the equation in the rarest of circumstances. Outside of close friends, family, or (extretime mely rarely) loyal followers... who would want to revive a sick adult damaged by age (probably to the point of death) when there's an enormous stock of children available instead? They're cuter and their brains have a lot more natural potential for neural plasticity.
