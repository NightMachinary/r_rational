We're actually experiencing the centenary of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishi#Walking_into_the_modern_world][just such a tragedy.]] As the War Nerd put it, they made him into a museum diorama while he was still alive.

How rare cases like Ishi's were makes it clear how little demand there is for such novel historical curiosities.
