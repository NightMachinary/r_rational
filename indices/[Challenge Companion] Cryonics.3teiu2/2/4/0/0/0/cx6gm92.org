Without critcism I think your viewpoint is ignoring [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor][Hanlon's Razor]] Anyone who stops to think about it prefers an environment where intelligence is the selective pressure for the environment (ceritus parabus <and I'm not sure if tit for tat, vs modeling makes this true as modeling ability goes up, b/c do the stakes for a defection win go up too, and in what shape: n n^k N^m?> ), but simply as humans we are hard-wired against such a situation and a totalitarian environment with a high cost of procreation will be subverted ~with~ /by/ those who see the high profit to be gained by circumventing procreation restrictions: i.e. steam engine time.
