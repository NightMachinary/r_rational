Once it is a proven biological possibility (that is, once somebody has been brought back to life from cryopreservation) I'm sure that it will be much more popular and organizations like the sort you describe will be a going concern. Unfortunately, as the world conquers death, there will be fewer and fewer people who still die... and they'll likely be the poor and unloved rather than the rich and connected.

So, again, why raise people from the past that nobody cares about instead of focusing medical attention on people dying in the present?
