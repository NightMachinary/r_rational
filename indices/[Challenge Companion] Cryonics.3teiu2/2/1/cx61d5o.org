  What sort of society has to exist in order that raising children is more difficult and less desired than raising the dead?
#+end_quote

For 'less desired', then you don't need /all/ of society to be part of the resurrection decision-making process. Instead, a small group of people, each of whom is hoping to eventually be resurrected after their own deaths, may suffice to provide motivation to resurrect every corpsicle in their care.
