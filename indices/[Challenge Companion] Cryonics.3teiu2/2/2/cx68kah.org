Prompted speculation: Ethically/Morally speaking (depending on system), healing/helping a sick person is a positive act, if not an ethical/moral imperative. Creating new lives from scratch, by contrast, has to be justified. Once a cryonically frozen body is a patient that you can heal, there are ethical/moral reasons to improve that patient's quality of existence which don't come into play when talking about potential lives not created during menstruation.
