  Fucking adopt, people.

Have you ever looked into what's involved with adoption? The incentives are stacked against it. It's time-consuming, it's expensive, there's invasive probing into your background, and there's a great deal of uncertainty involved. You can get some of the money back through a federal tax credit, assuming that your MAGI is low enough, but even with that you're asking someone to take a number of hits in the name of altruism, which is always a tough thing to ask. That's without even taking into account the fact that some people have biological children as a value all by itself, above and beyond merely raising children.
