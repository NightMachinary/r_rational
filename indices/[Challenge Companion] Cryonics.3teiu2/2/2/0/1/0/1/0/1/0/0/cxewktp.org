I was talking about the surrogacy for your own link. I put in that you want to be your own egg donor and yes to everything else. Again that's for US based surrogacy.

Regarding the other stuff, yes I agree you do not have high incentive to care about the cost of a new child on the world, I do not expect many people to be altruistic enough to care about that, however I do my duty as a citizen of the world to mention it. I think there is some social pressure to avoid costing the government hence living off of welfare is frowned upon.

I have real trouble finding total risk of medical complications from pregnancy which you would think would exist already from people who advocated adoption or have the thought that the world is overpopulated.

#+begin_quote
  In the immediate postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.[1][2] Long term health problems (persisting after 6 months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.[3] Severe complications of pregnancy are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US[4] and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada [5]

But what about child complications? They could be undesirable in ways you can select via adoption, at the very least adopted children will by viable. Then there's another 1.5% chance of getting more than one baby. Then what if you want multiple children? Adopting one and birthing another doesn't seem like the perfect solution when you can adopt siblings for a lot cheaper.

Obviously if your wife is perfect child rearing age then if you're going to do it you should go for it and actually IIRC I think you already said you went for it, but still.

While I may not act in my daily life as rational as I would like I think pregnancy due to its decision scale is something you can apply a $800m self evaluation too.

Let's say you and your wife want to avoid long term health problems. Give it a 30% chance. Assuming all births are otherwise perfect and the child is desirable and lives until adoption age (with a reasonable outlook for the future) and we go to a fairly cheap place for surrogacy but not like India cheap say $30k.

So to avoid long term health complications you're not only looking at a value of $100k (what a nice number), BUT, there are two of you, so you half that to $50k (assuming you both value your wife equally). Are you willing to pay $50k to avoid long term complications? (Ignoring all the costs of actually being pregnant, like physical deformation, etc)

And that's me with five minutes of googling on a subject that determines not only my partners future but mine as well for the next few years.
