I meant social cost of a child in terms of output devoted on that. Another child means less time devoted to the rest of children in class etc. Adopted children you move around. Surrogacy is just as bad in that case. That's perhaps more an argument for why the government should give money for adoption but people do care somewhat about society even if it is just social pressure.

Also that's a remarkably lower risk that I had found when I was researching though I do think you have to consider further complications than just death. I imagine surrogacy has insurance for failed births whereas the emotional cost of that on your wife is likely to be huge. I'm on my phone or I'd be quoting sources (will be at computer soon) but what I read some time ago was 10% under 35 and 25% until 45 irrc for miscarriages.

The surrogacy costs I found were far cheaper too, easily under $10k if you go abroad.
