  Plus I have a feeling that you won't be using a surrogate even though you value your wife's life more than anyone else which makes me doubt the clarity of your thought.

The CDC gives the [[http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pmss.html][pregnancy related mortality ratio]] as 12.5 deaths per 100,000 live births for white women. (It's even less for women who are young and physically fit.) That means that childbirth carries a 0.0125% chance of death. The cost of surrogacy [[http://www.circlesurrogacy.com/costs][is something like $100,000]]. If I'm unwilling to pay $100,000 for a 0.0125% reduction in the chance of death for my wife, that would mean that I value her life at less than $800 million, which I think is true (especially given that I demonstrably value my own life less than that).

  None the less the cost of a new life and all that entails has to slated against the parents desire to have a kid.

I don't know exactly what you're talking about here, but you haven't given me any numbers to work with either way. After insurance, the average cost of childbirth is [[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/health/american-way-of-birth-costliest-in-the-world.html?pagewanted=all][$3,400]].
