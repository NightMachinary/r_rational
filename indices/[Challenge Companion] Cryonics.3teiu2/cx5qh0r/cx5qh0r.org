It might require a little digging to get one's hands on since there seems to be no legitimate place to read it online (maybe it's on Kindle?), but the Transmetropolitan issue #8 story "Another Cold Morning" is a pretty fantastic exploration of the sociological impact of reviving cryonically-preserved persons in a world that doesn't care about them. The (un)lucky souls are essentially refugees from the past, unwanted, unloved, and unuseful to modern (trans)humanity.

Highly recommend.
