It /can/ be evaluated /somewhat/ scientifically, just at a step or two removed from seeing whether it actually works. To take analogy of a soda company selling great-tasting soda to people who cannot taste it a bit further, the executives within the company can choose to devote their time and money to the theoretical basis for taste, they can employ people who have expertise in the field of chemical analysis, etc. They wouldn't /actually/ know how it tastes, but they might be able to do some cogent analysis and come to an approximation.

/Or/ they could see that the only real income that this provides them with is from people who are willing to /also/ undertake the self-education necessary to understand their theoretical results, which means that while they might get closer to "good flavor" it doesn't really get them good income. They can spend money on research which they then use in marketing, or they can just (more efficiently) spend money on marketing.

The company might do this without knowing that they're doing it, or they might do it with the full knowledge that far future outcomes don't really matter for the health of their organization or the security of their jobs. That's a very realistic failure mode for any organization that's divorced from feedback of its products.

(I recommend reading Mike Darwin's articles on the subject, including the one that I linked above. He was President of Alcor for about five years and Research Director for something like ten years.)
