As you imply, there are present day immigrants and refugees (unwanted, unloved, and unuseful). They figure out how to live productively in more technologically-advanced societies than the ones from which they came. A few of them thrive. The vast majority believe their lives are better than they would have been if they hadn't moved.

The story Warren Ellis tells is essentially a common immigrant's story, a tale older than writing.
