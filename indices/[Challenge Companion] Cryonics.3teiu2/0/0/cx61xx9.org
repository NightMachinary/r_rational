The second part of that last parenthetical sentence is just as crucial as the first (for more on that, though, I recommend assessing the variety of arrival conditions listed by [[http://www.cryonics.org/case-reports/][The Cryonics Institute]].)

Most of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies#1650_to_1699][world's oldest companies]] either serve a local public need (restaurants, banks, hotels) are family owned (passed from generation to generation) or are operated by religious institutions. Cryonics organizations do not currently meet any of these requirements.

Worse, they operate best under Ponzi conditions: Paying long term, incremental costs with fund injections in the present. [[http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/CostOfCryonics.html][ALCOR's own assessment]] of their economics is chaotic and unstable.

A long economic collapse which ends the fund influx, or a few weeks of civil disturbances which disrupt electric power, and even theoretically perfect crypreservation will fail. Our past is full of such disasters, why should our future be any different?
