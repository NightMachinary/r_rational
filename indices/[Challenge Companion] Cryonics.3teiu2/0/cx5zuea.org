I read [[http://chronopause.com/chronopause.com/index.php/2011/05/29/a-visit-to-alcor/index.html][A Visit to Alcor]] by Mike Darwin a week or so ago, which is pretty (ahem) chilling, even if it's four years old. I think the strongest takeaway I had was that cryonics in its current form is not at all feedback driven. If I wanted to buy a television, I would go look at reviews on Amazon, talk to my friends, or listen what experts had to say. If I want to buy a soda, I not only have the FDA to guard against the worst issues, but there's feedback at every single level from manufacture to distribution to me, the consumer. This isn't to say that feedback-driven structures are perfect, especially those that are profit motivated, but compare this to cryonics and you'll see that there's virtually zero feedback, mostly because there's little way to evaluate results. If the cryopreservation fails catastrophically, the patient is still frozen and there is no feedback (and the cryopreservation organization has every incentive not to relay negative information to prospective patients).

I would cynically expect an organization with no feedback mechanisms to become better at /selling/ their product than /providing/ their product. In other words, if people were somehow buying soda for its taste /without being able to taste it/, I would expect soda manufacturers to put lots of money into convincing people that their soda tasted great instead of putting money into actually changing the taste of their soda. It's the same reason vaporware happens; a startup focuses on getting investment by producing ever-better presentations rather than making the actual product. This also helps explain why the TSA engages in security theater rather than actual security. Darwin makes the argument that cryonics must necessarily be a different sort of organization given this lack of feedback, because if they're chasing profit (or status) improvements to process are inefficient.

(This is an especially concerning failure mode given that the argument in favor of cryonics is derived from "shut up and multiply". Many of the chained probabilities revolve around the cryonics organization's ability to properly do their job and to persist into the future.)
