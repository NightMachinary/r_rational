I don't have a policy. While I think that cryonics can work in principle, the advice I was given was, "break down the chained probabilities then shut up and multiply". When I did that, it didn't seem like it was worth the money (even assuming as low as $25 per month). But I'm also not a big believer in the Singularity, so my probabilities for successful revival are much lower than they'd be if I believed perfect nanotechnology was just around the corner.
