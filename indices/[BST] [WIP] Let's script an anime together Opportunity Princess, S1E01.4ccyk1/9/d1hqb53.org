Comments on formating, spelling, typos etc:

- The script indicates changes of scene with a new line, but that's rather hard to make out on reddit. So in the future, maybe mark the changes of scene differently, somehow?

Typos, in an arbitrary order:

- "A guard one the wall" -> on the wall
- "It flares up and vanishes as she does." -> (Not technically a typo, but this sentence has multiple meanings.)
- "Sirau is twisting her fingers" -> Sirua
- "May I speak to you in private a moment?" -> for a moment
- "Onii" refers to elder brothers, but that has already been pointed out.

Other stuff:

- "A long blast, three short blasts, nine quick blasts" -> What's the supposed difference between a short blast and a quick blast?
- There's both a "Sirua Queen-sama" and a "Queen Sirua-sama".
- "Whatever the Princess summoned, it should have had summoning sickness!" -> A /very/ gamey term, so it might not fit the anime medium. (Besides, nowadays there are tons of fantasy stories that are /actually/ RPGs with stats and everything, so this term could imply that this is an RPG setting.)
- "One gold." and all the currency discussions: Also gamey, though not problematically so.
