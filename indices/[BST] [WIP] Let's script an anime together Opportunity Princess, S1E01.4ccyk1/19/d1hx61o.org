Interesting idea, I'd love if the entire multiverse was inside David's mind (good alias btw), David could be a physicist/creative writer, he wrote Sirua's story, how she took over the kingdom and overthrew her father. He wrote various short stories, about the fairy world, the demon world, etc. He stopped writing but the world somehow moved on, more than 20 years later, by invoking "that which is above you" she summoned a copy of David's mind to that fantasy world, he still has all his memories of what he's created, only now the world has changed from the last time he touched it.

Like the others have said, despite my love for anime, it would be better to stay away from all the anime style and just stick with a normal animation.
