  Toyori watches the circle complete itself, as she wraps a bandage around her hand. Then she looks up at the crowd. Toyori: "I've had a sudden inspiration, so I'm changing my plans! Everyone, I'd like you to clear the room."

  The Chief Magician Enio puts his hands over his golden goggles, double-facepalming.

  Sirua, her fists clenched: "To...yo...ri..."

  Toyori: "Well, even if you don't leave..." Toyori starts to take off her shirt.

  Prince Kunuba: "What are you doing, onee-sama!?"

  Toyori reveals her first under-layer of clothing as people gasp and turn away, or stare. Toyori: "I'm going to summon an incubus and subdue him. I guess people can watch if they want."

Sirua: "I don't think so, young lady. You're going to summon something useful, respectable, and friendly - and if you do, I will consider giving you your birthday present early."

Toyori: "I'm serious mother. And don't worry anyhow, I'm planning on summoning something very... friendly."

Toyori attempts to waggle her eyebrows salaciously while continuing to remove layers. The guards are trying to look anywhere else. Well. Most of the guards.

Sirua: "I'm serious too. And if you think I'm going to let you make your mistake in privacy, you have another thing coming, daughter. Yes Kunabu, you may leave."

Kunabu bolts. Enio attempts to follow.

Sirua: "Come back here, Chief Magician."

Enio sighs and turns back, covering his eyes.

Tayuri: "Motherrrrrrrr!"

Sirua: "Tayuri Lonfan, I brought you into this world and you don't have anything I haven't seen a hundred times. Now summon a familiar that doesn't want your soul, so that we can go home and eat cake."
