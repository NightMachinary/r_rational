Sounds like a fun project! I'm curious how it will develop.

Various comments:

- Script length: How long do you estimate this episode would be, in anime form? I know episodes are typically 20-30 min long, but I have no idea how long this one would become.

Plot discussion:

- I love the whole "Toyori alarm" thing. That's a great way of characterising her by proxy.
- What does the regular summoning spell do? The ritual says to "bring forth my friend", and Toyori's ritual eventually calls for the same. At the very least, the Spirit from Earth shouldn't be immediately antagonistic to Toyori. Whether the spell summoned a /potential/ friend, the /best/ potential friend, or whatever, remains an open question.

Plot suggestions:

- Our anime protagonist has summoned a Spirit from Earth. What makes them special or interesting? A conceivable spectrum: from specific skills or worldviews (he could be a martial artist, a detective, or others) to general human knowledge (though fantasy-lands-get-industrialised has been overdone, so at the very least, the laws of physics in that world should be sufficiently different that human knowledge can't be applied 1:1) to genre-savvy (great, but can be overdone), all the way to e.g. "Everything is 2D?!".
- Similarly, if the Spirit is based on the wisdom of the crowd Ã  la the HPMoR finale, maybe its "superpower" is a peculiar kind of intelligence, agency, or willpower.
- I approve of the I-don't-want-to-rule plot, and of the acknowledgement that with power comes responsibility. That said, how will that conflict eventually be concluded? Is Toyori's kingdom endangered, and she must take the crown or lose everyone she cares for? Does she then find a way to make ruling fun without abusing her power in the wrong ways? Or is she successful in shirking her responsibilities and taking her destiny in her own hands? Can she gain freedom without regretting it?
