Going through your discussion cues:

1. If you're asking what /I/ would do, I would probably immediately try to get back to Earth. You don't see that often - usually a summoned creature just goes, "Oh, okay, now I'm here, guess I'll fight that guy over there for you." If I were summoned, I would only cooperate on the condition that my summoner work to send me back home. Even unto the point of my death, I think. I would probably call the arrangement "slavery" too, and harp on about Enlightenment values, which are probably foreign to Toyori and likely to yield some comedic interactions.

2. I don't watch that much anime. But as a general comment on anime/manga/comic books/modern action movies, I like to see things set up and actually properly pay off. This seems obvious but is rare in practice. Your Azkaban arc would be an instance where this was actually accomplished. The writer/director Chris Nolan also seems to manage to do this in most of his films.

3. I'm not sure if I have a sufficiently precise read on Toyori's character or world to extrapolate the course of the story. But If I'm extrapolating wildly, I'd say that Toyori escapes the city with the help of her new Familiar, while having to make some kind of Faustian deal with him in order to secure his assistance. While evading her mother's troops, she comes up against some kind of Big Bad, who may or may not be intimately tied to The Magic System. During this time she assembles a cast of eccentric allies/harem. Through low-level conflicts with various orcs and revenants as well as mock-battles with Yodas, we learn enough about The Magic System to understand the eventual mechanics of advanced combat, which will obviously include extremely subtle loopholes uniquely exploitable by a clever Earthling mentality. Throughout all of this she develops a complex "adversarially cooperative" relationship with her Familiar, whose motives are gradually shifting as he better understands the world he's been summoned into and its potentialities. Some kind of highly detailed climax occurs involving dozens of elements I can't possibly concoct on-the-fly and resolves such that everyone gets their just desserts. The details of the ending depend on the details of Toyori's character development.
