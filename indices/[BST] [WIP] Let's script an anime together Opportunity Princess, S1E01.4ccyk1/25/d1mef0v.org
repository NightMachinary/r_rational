Here comes part two. Well I've re-red script, and started to re-read HPMOR I can't avoid notice that beginning HPMOR looks quite brilliant compare to the script as it currently is. I though for once that this script is not supposed to be rational fiction is more like a joke where reader supposed to find rationality things by himself in almost perfectly ordinary fantasy scenario, but there actually are some hints. And I've got so many thoughts.

*"I don't expect to hear any spell leaving your lips except the..."*\\
Given the Mother is not much stupid and knows her daughter well enough including that she is not going to summon something "lesser" did she actually expected this work...? Did she actually expect that her expectations repeated several times with stern enough voice will somehow shift Toyori's intentions? I can agree that starting with "I know that I'm not in a position" it looks like a slightly better attempt to reach some mutual understanding but I'm still not sure what goal she actually work towards.\\
In Queen's place I would avoid speaking anything annoying, and in worst case try to listen to Toyori's plans to review them and help her avoid stupid mistakes more experienced "me" can notice, since I can't actually ensure my own plan by force. I also may try some trade (which can be hard if this familiar is whole life level important thing) or give some really realistic explanation why my choice is just destined to be her familiar and will be a good combo for her personal talents even if it does not look impressive by itself. And I would discuss that long before ritual so immediately before ritual just some subtle technical details can be repeated.\\
So there can be few explanations:\\
1. Queen really is not that clever or rational (and probably Taka-kun is in many ways more intelligent and perceptive) so she do not actually question how her words will improve probability of desired outcome and just speaks whatever seems to be fitting regardless how important situation is, which is kind of normal for people but I would like to see a some more reason from magical Queen. (May be not on "I calculated that subtle hint I gave you at the start of first episode will be enough to produce positive outcome at the end of second episode" level, but at least sufficiently more than average Earth human.)\\
2. Queen actually thinks that one who tends to make risky choices does not actually fit to be ruler so she finds kind of acceptable if Toyori makes something stupid and kill herself with magic or actually will escape successfully.\\
3. It is some kind of "test" so only ones who can work against authority can summon something powerful and dangerous. So she actually just checking that Toyori will not actually listen to her advice and looks for disobedience as for positive outcome.\\
I actually like that last one explanation, I would like to see more situations where people who supposed to be wise and respectable (e.g. magic teacher) demonstrate some kind of not so smart behavior which actually, instead of being actual stupidity or plot-hole, is intended to be test if there is anyone (one of students in example) who able to notice that something going wrong and point that out.

I wonder about summoning supposed to be possibly disastrous being hint that she actually summoned some sort of *AI* and it has something to do with it's spirit form.

I wonder if *golden goggles* are some sort of hint that magic has something to do with mad science. Why actually they are so important to be mentioned more than once? Well that spell was mentioned one obvious math fact right before I lost understanding what is it all about. I even start thinking that guess about simulationism is right and she summoned something from most original universe.

I'm not sure if *"As You Know"* trope isn't a bit overused. (Now I'm thinking it's probably not really.) (Probably one reason HPMOR was so good is cause there was no need to explain every detail to a person who already know HP.) I think it's the one that should be avoided completely when we can give dozen visual hints in single frame. Instead of awkward and not so much informative "I was lucky to live, and there were still consequences. It was incredibly unwise of me." Queen can say something like "you know my story" and let viewer draw his own conclusion based on face expression, intonations and how scary Taka-kun looks. "the circles are locked" can be shown as some sort of barrier later, barrier can bear some magical symbols or even direct description of his properties written with some sort of "magical" alphabet.\\
And also how exactly circle is locked if they can see or speak through it until later stages? Doesn't it mean that at least light and sound can pass, so it's possible to interfere with ritual through laser-like magic or tech and sound which can also be effective in various ways. But it also can be dangerous to interfere if it makes outcome unpredictable, but most probably bad. I also curious what happens if we blow up castle where locked circle is, with something explosive, will it destroy circle, or will it somehow continue to be locked and undamaged without rest of the building.\\
Also can it be something more personal and nonstandard instead of beautiful lacework? I dunno, her favorite anime themed arts or something like that.

As already has been noticed. Using information we know, like that there is a magician, so magic is not limited to a summoning ritual which can be performed once in a lifetime only by royals, it seems completely improbable that there are no any magic or creatures that are very good in *searching people*. Though Toyori could probably perform some tricks to hide her smell and avoid magical detection. Probably it will be to boring to explain every detail but I would like to see some hints how she avoids every possible way of magical and not-so-magical detection. More precisely I would probably like to see her playing something like "don't step on lava" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_lava_(game)]] [[https://www.facebook.com/MagicFreebies/videos/10153222503304472/]] but when she actually can be magically detected if step on a wrong place.\\
And still I think it is very probable that she will be captured again quite fast, if Queen actually wants it.

There are *so many questions* about economics, politics, culture, beliefs, magic that should be considered if we want the world to be consistent and they are also the same questions I will try to research in a position of summoned spirit. How people magic and griffins happen to be in one world? Well we know where people come from in our world. How do griffins fly? I can see probable scenarios:\\
1. It's some kind of parallel universe (like Everett world) where people evolved the same way it happens in our world. It most probably means that history was completely the same as ours until about last ten thousands years or it is starting to be improbable that people will look the same as in our world (if they really do look the same). In this case griffins or any magical creatures were either summoned from other worlds or engineered here.\\
2. It's also possible that it a very different world and people traveled or were summoned there a while ago from our world. In this case for example it's possible that Toyori planned to summon something powerful from there if our land is idealized in legends.\\
3. Also humans and mythical creatures can be easily explained if it is some sort of matrix or other way artificially created world.

*More about things I would like to see:*\\
I would like to see some really special world with significant cultural difference or at least non-trivial similarities, I'm started thinking about which theme can be used, on Earth Eagles and Lions a things which often considered to be royal, in fantasy things like griffins, unicorns and dragons are expected, I would like to see something at least slightly different (may be crows in stead of eagles cause words crow and crown are similar or unicorns, but pink and invisible) or something totally unexpected. (What about cows? Holy Chao! I just realized that words cow and crown are somewhat similar in English an in Russian both) Still I wonder if something about style and themes already been planned.\\
Evil Queen trope can be humored. It is quite reasonable if spirit from earth will conclude that there is Evil Queen present when he know that they are hiding from guard who acts according to Queen's orders. I wonder if it's already planned.
