1) Finkelstein can be a hedge fund manager or similar. 2) The magic of the world can currently hinge on a crude barter system. 3) The Finkelstein advantage is the ability to create more sophisticated financial instruments within the magical system. (starting perhaps with currency?) 4) The removing limits part of the summons refers to free markets/unrestricted capitalism. 5) Personally I love this if it starts well then goes horribly south due to its unbridled nature -- he should be more dangerous than the insect demon. a) if you introduce a separate villain, however (e.g. a really weird version of the brother, who has been planning even deeper than her, but set-up here I think), than Finkelstein can function as heroically.
