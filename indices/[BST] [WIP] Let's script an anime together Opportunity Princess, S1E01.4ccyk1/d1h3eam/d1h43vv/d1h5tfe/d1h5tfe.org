It's got to be *David Monroe*, of course.

- Passes as normal earth name, good for non-ingroup-watchers
- Maybe 'David Monroe' was /one of us!/ (Or maybe just picked a name - ambiguity is key here)
- Does HPMoR exist in the universe-like-ours? Fans will speculate like mad!
- Bonus points if he later goes by "Tom", or signs something "QQ" as an obviously-an-alias
