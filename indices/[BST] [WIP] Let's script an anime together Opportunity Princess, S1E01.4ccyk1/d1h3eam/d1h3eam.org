Okay, so first of all Reddit is a horrible format for feedback and annotations. May I suggest Google Docs?

Furthermore, so far the basic setup seems fairly similar to Familiar of Zero (your standard "random person from our world summoned to a fantasy universe"), so I'd look to that for subversion potential. (Challenge Mode: de-emphasize physics and chemistry knowledge, it's too easy - but how? Maybe truly alien rules of physics?)

  Sirua: <She was fourteen!>
#+end_quote

Subtle bit: for how long exactly has she been planning this?

Interesting question: does the person she summon still match the template of "Lesser Fae of Empathy"? What constraints, exactly, does that template define, and how do they apply to a human? /Why the fuck is there a meta-engine of magic that takes commands in spoken language/? Is this a /Ra/ scenario? The debris of a singularity? The /success/ of a singularity? An insular archipelago of opt-outers? And what's the 1-2, 2-4, 3-6 sequence mean? Wait -

  The vantage point of infinity sees all things below itself, because infinity can be contained within infinity."
#+end_quote

DID SHE JUST INVOKE SIMULATIONISM? Shit, is this confirmed as post-transcendence verse? The vantage point of infinity exists.. so that means entropy is defeated? Is that even possible?

  Toyori: "Great eye that sees all things as beneath it, I address my words to *that which is above you*. Even knowing that I do not know the meaning of my speech, I request you accept my instruction."
#+end_quote

Okay, "that which is above you" implies there's an oversight controller/AI/God for this world and then there's a /meta/-God that handles arbitration. I think this points fairly strongly at an Archipelago-style universe. I like the "Even knowing" bit. Whoever told them this sequence /meant/ for it to be used by those who don't understand it.

Hm. David is from our plane - is he a transhumanist? Because if not, there's an easy source of drama from the fact that he's obviously a copy. On the other hand, might be too easy. Maybe be dramatic for Toyori, like she's trying to keep it from him, but a relief for him because it means he didn't just disappear.

So the place I would go with the setting is that this is post-singularity, post-transcendence, Archipelago-type setting, but a universe that has been post-transcendence for so long that it's grown /ossified/; there's a central AI and you could in theory just ask it things, but that sort of capability is so corrosive to any kind of constraint-based human society that there's sprung up this sort of system of ritualistic engagement, worlds nested within worlds, to limit exposure to the ultimate power of DWIM - allow a society to function where there's scarcity leading to interesting stories, despite the fact that it's fundamentally artificial. And I think the key is to /never ever spell this out/ - don't even hint. Stay for the entire story within the narrative framework of the characters. It's a literary [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof][zero-knowledge proof]] - knowing a deep background fact makes things derived from it seem more structured, even if you never reveal the reason for the structure.

Bits that jumped out at me that I'd do differently:

#+begin_quote
  In one hand, she holds a small cute creature whose head she occasionally pets with the other hand.
#+end_quote

Set this up harder. Make the cute creature out to be the team-pet-to-be. Give it big ears. Give it a /name/.

#+begin_quote
  Sirua turns around, and whips her finger to point at the guards. "She's gone! Sound the Toyori alarm!"
#+end_quote

"She's gone! Sound the alarm!" And then reveal that there's a special Toyori alarm through delayed visual gags, guards opening sealed orders with a painting and description of Toyori, etc. It's a bit on-the-nose.

  Taka's voice: <Would you bet your soul on that?>
#+end_quote

The character of Sirua is a bit single-note in this conversation. This exchange offers an opportunity to build some more depth into her.

Taka's voice: <Would you bet your soul on that?>

Sirua leans against the wall. Her face, twisted with worry, relaxes into a weary half-smile. She's showing her age.

Sirua, quietly but fondly: <Stop trying to get my soul, Taka-kun.>

:pause:

:music picks up a low beat:

Kunabu: "There's one more obvious place."

#+begin_quote
  Toyori: "What's your name?"
#+end_quote

Setup: the wall of the room contains a large mirror. (It's an old trope, but it works. And it's plausible for a brothel.)

Toyori: "What's your name?"

Camera pans right, to Toyori in mirror. (No dramatic zoom, a simple sideways pan.) Toyori's eyes open.

Toyori's voice in a lower register: "David Finkelstein."
