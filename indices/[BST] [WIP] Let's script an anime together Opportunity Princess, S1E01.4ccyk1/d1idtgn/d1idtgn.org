About the name of the Spirit from Earth: Obviously it's supposed to be Japanese name if it is anime script with all this kun and sama thing, or may be even name that only sounds like Japanese being made up by someone who knows about Japanese names only from anime in which case later it can be revealed to be just one more alias. Also in a position of this spirit I would definitely insist on using some sort of nickname to call me, cause there is a good time to change name, when there are no any documents or people who remember old one.

More about being in "David Finkelstein's" position: I just thought how it can overlap with lucid dreaming practice and I think it may give some fun outcomes. First I may think that I am sleeping, i may try to perform my standard protocol for lucid dreams starting with some typical reality check and then take some action I planned while being awake. Of course there is hard to tell physical reality and dream apart by experiment if anything that happens in reality usually can be reproduced in dreams and experimenter will not be able tell the difference by himself. But there are methods that usually works like trying to push fingers through any solid surface or fly. But I may skip this step cause it's obviously that I am sleeping when some weird stuff like being summoned to another world happens. You know, dreaming about things like that is much more likely than actually being summoned, so the last hypothesis about being summoned for real just does not even worth a time to consider. I will not fall for that "but it feels so realistic" thing again. Well actually dream and reality just feels different so I probably will be able to tell the difference if I will be summoned with my own body, but being spirit in other body probably feels enough different from normal awaken state to be mistaken for some unusual dream state similar to out-of-body experience. The planned action may include attempt to transform own body to wolf form or summoning Princess Luna to guide me into further learning of lucid dreams. So here is it: if I will be able to take over summoner's body, Toyori will have to observe me trying to push her fingers through wall and then summon Luna probably with some weird orders to reality/subconsciousness spoken aloud before she will get any reasonable conversation with me, cause I don't usually care about current "decorations" when I realize that I am dreaming.

But there one more thing, being in some unusual body feels extremely awkward so before taking any further actions I most probably will try to transform the body into mine through summoning "healing energy" which usually works in dreams. Unlike reality check and other stuff, this trick does not need taking control over body cause it based on visualization and does not demand any gestures or even speaking. Second moment that even through it will not transform or heal body in real world it will still feels like some energy being summoned, and I can't be sure how it will work with being summoned spirit thing, but probably Toyori will feel it too, even if in this new world it is still just autosuggestion and has nothing to do with mana or ki or any other kind of energy real magic in this world works with. So even if it is just autosuggestion Toyori may start thinking that probably some kind of energy really was summoned like many people on our Earth think that all this energy/mana/ki is real even through lack of objective evidence that it works beyond placebo effect. And this mess with fake magic and real magic in one world may be fun concept to play with.

Second thought I will come up with after I will gave up on "it's just a dream" idea or at least will agree that this dream is one extremely hard to directly manipulate with, is probably about me having some heavy multiple personality disorder, cause such weird disorders still more likely to happen in real world than being actually summoned in spirit form.

I can probably speak a lot about what strategies will I try after I will accept the reality as it is, but I already written too mach and did not yet come up with something smart or original.

And if I will be summoned while keeping memory about what I already red in script I will probably start with that "David Finkelstein" and then explain that it's not actually my name but there is a small chance that it's last step I know which leads to happy end Eliezer probably had already planned.

And two more things. I still want to see how guard will handle "And try not to have everyone know I said that." instruction. In my imagination it just sounded like:\\
-Check all stables! Queen's order!\\
-Check all taverns! Queen's order!\\
-Stop, check brothels first! Q... order of a person who preferred to remain anonymous.\\
And i still wonder why summon human's spirit when you can summon powerful demon in flesh, either something went terribly wrong or summoned person knows something useful like some important science and technology stuff useful in this world or knows a lot about generic fantasy worlds or this world in particular, in this case summoning of "The Author" may be enough reasonable and ambitious to fit into Toyori's character. In this case "it's a copy" idea may be important if Eliezer (or any of us) is not going to mysteriously dissapear. I also thought about " She did not want to be a princess with all this terrible power and responsibility, she wanted to be an ordinary girl, so she summoned ordinary human as familiar" but it does not fit that well.

Please help me fix if there is something too wrong with my English, I'm quite afraid it can be hard to understand large comments written with my English skill level. -_-
