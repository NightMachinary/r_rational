  And what's the 1-2, 2-4, 3-6 sequence mean? Wait -

    The vantage point of infinity sees all things below itself, because infinity can be contained within infinity."

My first thought was that it was an example of "infinity containing infinity". There are infinitely many integers, and infinitely many /even/ integers. And, fun fact, you can make a one-to-one mapping between them: map n to 2n, e.g. 1 maps to 2, 2 maps to 4, 3-6, 4-8, 5-10, .... This is a common example of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set][countably infinite set]].

There are also sets you can't do this to, which you can think of as bigger infinities. If Toyori had summoned Georg Cantor somehow, I'd worry that shit was about to get real.
