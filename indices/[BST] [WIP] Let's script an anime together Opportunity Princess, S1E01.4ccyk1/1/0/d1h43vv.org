We want to avoid making this fanfiction to prevent copyright issues.

"Napoleon Bonaparte" is good for an alias-recognized-as-alias, as is "David Smith". But if in Ep02 we want to have Toyori try to bind David to serve her, and then fail after "David" reveals that "David Finkelstein" was an alias, then for maximum effect it should be an instantly recognizable Earth name but not an instantly recognizable Earth alias.
