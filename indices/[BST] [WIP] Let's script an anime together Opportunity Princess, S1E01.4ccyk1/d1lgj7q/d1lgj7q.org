Potential way I could see this playing out: Show starts off as a medieval-ish fantasy (like Familiar of Zero). Discussions about other dimensions and the nature of the hyper-dimensional topography pop up in world building here and there. Eventually the plot is interrupted as it becomes clear that the "Safe Mode Disabled" summoning spell caused something to go very, very wrong. Perhaps the addressed godlike entity in her summoning spell was given more power/access to our universe, or She Broke Something in the local reality. Story gets derailed into a wilder romp between dimensions and the like, vaguely along the same lines as Time Braid.
