I quite liked it.

 

*First, some general notes:*

 

- I agree with the other commenters who say that Japanese honorifics seem unnecessary here. (also, I thought onee-sama was only used by girls to address other girls. Did you maybe mean onee-san? /edit:nevermind, I was wrong on this/)

- The beginning is quite static (standing, talking characters) and the dialogue comes off as very [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow][As-You-Know-Bob.]] It might help to share the infodump between Sirua and Toyori.

For example, instead of:

#+begin_quote
  Sirua: "You're really, actually, not going to summon anything else."

  Toyori: "Mother..."

  Sirua: "I know that I'm not in a position to speak after what I summoned when I came of age. Now, I'm not going to say it turned out badly, especially while Taka-kun is listening to us."
#+end_quote

You could have:

#+begin_quote
  Sirua: "You're really, actually, not going to summon anything else."

  Toyori : Yeah, like you can talk, after what happened when YOU came of age.

  Sirua : Don't disrespect me, child. And don't imply it turned out badly, especially while Taka-kun is listening to us.
#+end_quote

- It's a pretty short script for an entire episode.

 

*Line-by-line notes:*

 

#+begin_quote
  Sirua: "But I only did that because I needed to overthrow your grandpa. I was lucky to live, and there were still consequences. It was incredibly unwise of me."  
#+end_quote

You can ditch « and there were still consequences », especially if you're not going to spell out the consequences for now. It clutters the sentence.

You could write:

#+begin_quote
  “I only did that because I needed to overthrow your grandpa. It was incredibly unwise of me. I was lucky to live. “
#+end_quote

(I put “lucky to live” last because that way there's a crescendo effect.)

 

#+begin_quote
  Toyori: "I've had a sudden inspiration, so I'm changing my plans! Everyone, I'd like you to clear the room."
#+end_quote

Ditch « I've had a sudden inspiration. »

On my first read-through I wasn't sure if Toyori had planned this or if it was really a spur-of --the-moment thing. Make it clear with indications of tone and facial expression.

 

#+begin_quote
  Toyori starts to take off her shirt.
#+end_quote

“Otherwordly-royalty clothes” and “robes” are composed of shirts?

#+begin_quote
  Toyori reveals her first under-layer of clothing as people gasp and turn away, or stare. Toyori: "I'm going to summon an incubus and subdue him. I guess people can watch if they want."

  Sirua: "CLEAR THE ROOM! GUARDS! EVERYONE OUT!"
#+end_quote

 

I don't know who the intended final audience is, but many people don't know what an incubus is and are going to be confused by the unfamiliar word. You should make it clear right away that something dirty is supposed to happen so that the audience understands Sirua's extreme reaction (she could be removing her movement-restricting first layer of clothing in order to fight the creature). Something as simple as replacing “subdue” with “mount” or “give my virginity to” or “f uck” or “rape” or... well, you get the idea.

 

#+begin_quote
  she now stands in her underclothes within the emptied great room
#+end_quote

Why would her mother agree to leave her daughter, heir to the throne, alone with a sex demon? Couldn't that be potentially dangerous? Why didn't she tell to one or two bodyguards to stay with Toyori -- maybe covering their eyes or looking really intently at the ceiling while she did her thing?

 

#+begin_quote
  Guard, nervously: "No."
#+end_quote

No, who? No, my queen! Show some respect! ;)

 

#+begin_quote
  Toyori, blinking hard: "I... all I have on me is five silver and four copper..."
#+end_quote

I thought she had a purse full of gold? Is she conning the old lady?

 

*Loose ends that need answers in further episodes*

 

- How did Toyori trick the Chief Architect?
- Why did Sirua overthrow the last king? How did Taka help her?
- What is the purpose of a familiar in this world?
- Who is coming to see “Nimi-chan”? How does Toyori know where Rana works?
- What is Toyori's plan? What is she going to do with her life if she doesn't want to rule?
- Is the summoned earthling trapped in Toyori's mind or is he/she still living his life on Earth and magically communicating with the princess?

And of course:

- How is Toyori going to escape the brothel search?

I guess that the earthling is going to help Toyori using his/her knowledge of our world. To speculate further I would need the OP to answer some of the above questions, as of now I have no idea what he envisioned world-wise and plot-wise (well, I have /some/ ideas, but they're all half-baked.)

If it was MY brain-baby, I would probably make the earthling a clever female Asian 20-something (to make her relate to Toyori) and give her opposite values (in Toyori's place she would have put her own desires aside and become queen, because she thinks intelligence and dedication trump reliability anytime). Being trapped in Toyori's head, she has no choice but to help her escape her royal fate if she wants to be set free one day.
