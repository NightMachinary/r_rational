Magic can be programming when it's a way to use some sufficiently advanced technology like in Scrapped Princess, and in this case spells and magic circles can be reasonable but programming don't usually needs sacrificing cute little creatures. This aspect represented by objects gives more magic as psychology vibe when you need certain symbols to affect some part of your own mind, like in dreams where sleeping person theoretically controls everything but practically it can be tricky to do something too unordinary. Though some trading with spirits concept may be also in play but I wonder what kind of spirits who can transport people between dimensions may need such type of goods.
