Sure, but why wouldn't someone have a familiar with such a useful power in all of the palace staff, or even on retainer from the broader kingdom? Unless the ability to summon is exceedingly rare, which goes back into the questions of who can do it.

It's not like it would just be used for capturing wayward princess, you could use it to track down criminals, find kidnap victims, and depending on how the tracking works (need a lock of hair vs their name vs have to have met them before) find people in an age without cell phones or internet.
