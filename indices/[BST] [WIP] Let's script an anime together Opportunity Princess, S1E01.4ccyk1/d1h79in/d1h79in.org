Any reason to make this an anime script, as opposed to animation that stylistically and thematically resembles anime? Writing a script with words that most Western voice actors can't pronounce seems like a failure mode, to me. Unless you're going for writing it in a manner that will be more easily translated into Japanese? If the latter, I'd go for using a Japanese physicist as the alias or first name, and having Taka call Shirua Shirua-sama in order to make their banter humorous.

On a substantive level, the Earthian should be genre-savvy if the audience for this is Japanese people, and ignorant of the genre if the audience is Western. Their first actions, then, would be: asking questions to discern whether this new world holds up to genre conventions, or asking what happened and why Toyori selected for someone like them, respectively. Both would ask for her goals.

As for general plot: with the help of the physicist or familiar, Toyori unravels the workings of her plane, succeeding in dimension hopping in the finale of season one.

She's had previous contact before, somehow; perhaps her friend gave the instructions? There might be collusion, for reasons to be explored in season two.
