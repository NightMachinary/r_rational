I don't watch much anime. Thoughts:

What else do summoning circles do? If you can summon a sentient creature, it should be possible to summon other things like fire or large rocks. Does the summoning always link to a particular other plane, or can it link to its own plane (opening up portals).

If Toyori is summoning a particular friend, it opens up the question of how they ended up communicating in the first place. Unless there's some accidental cross-world shenanigans going on that will be elaborated, then that means that the other friend has the ability to communicate across worlds. And it probably isn't limited to just the other friend.

Sorcery, Mana, ki, youki. So at the very least there's magical energy, spells, and nonhuman characters. What do the nonhumans want?

Why did Sirua forget the secret passage? Obviously if it's important enough to wipe her own memory, there's some extremely important reason to build a tunnel out of the summoning room, but what could it be? Or actually, Kyori probably impersonated Sirua. But then it means she's been planning it for a damn long time. If she's that patient and planning, there are probably other contingencies she has set up.

Someone coming to meet her. Again, how did they meet? How did she plan all this under her mom's nose?

Toyori cares enough about her mysterious contact that she wants ??? to know what happened to her, even if she fails.

In David Finkelstein's position, I would... Well, if she specifically summoned David, then it means that they've had contact before. It's reasonable to assume that he knows some of whatever is going on. But why would Toyori summon him? Probably because Toyori thinks that summoning David is the best way to achieve her goals. Which don't end in her ruling. She doesn't want power. What does Toyori want? Sex. And what else? Well, she's smart. She grew up watching her mom be miserable about ruling the kingdom. She's probably had “civic responsibility” drilled in her head pretty far. She specifically tried to foist it off on her brother, so she at least cares about making sure that the job is done right. But where else would she pick up a strong goal? And it can't be something stupid like Gryphon riding, because this is supposed to be an awesome anime, and she would have to easily hide it because her mom's model of her motivations consists of “Sex and not having a bunch of responsibilities”. And whatever she's planning outside the city has to be on the downlow for a while to prevent recapture. So we need a strong goal that isn't going to cause blatant massive action (at least until she's strong enough to prevent recapture). The main characters introduced have to show up again.

Let's recap. Strong goal, moderately hideable, entangles main characters that didn't escape, produces awesome anime, ideally shouldn't be something too predictable and standard, summoning David is the best way to meet this goal, doesn't involve ruling. Look to the title. Opportunity Princess. Granting opportunities to others? Finding opportunities for herself?

Anyways, whatever her motivation is, my actions as David would probably be roughly aligned with it since she specifically bothered to summon me. If someone goes to great lengths to find someone, there's probably a common purpose behind it. Maybe there could be a big dramatic moment where either David or Toyori change their goal/motivation. So her motivation now doesn't need to be something befitting of a main character.

I don't watch enough anime to have things that I've wanted to see happen but that don't happen. Not aware enough of the relevant tropes.
