  I'm actually a little tired of not being able to profit from my writing work; it's constraining. I've given away a lot already and would like to keep some.

Aren't you selling that "Summoned Hero" light novel on Amazon already?

I'm not against the idea of a rational anime, but why, exactly, are you scripting an anime? Those are expensive as all get out to produce.

Why not just do another original novel?
