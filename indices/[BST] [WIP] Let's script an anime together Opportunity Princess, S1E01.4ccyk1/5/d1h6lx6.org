Brainstorming is usually against the [[/r/rational]] rules, but we'll allow this series with a couple of conditions:

- "Profits will be split in a split that I'd arbitrarily decide on later" is a recipe for disaster - you NEED clarity up front. I suggest using the CC-BY-SA-NC license, and any profits go to a charity of your choice. I think this is compatible with your goals [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]], but please confirm or take this elsewhere :/

  I really don't want [[/r/rational]] to get dragged into the problems this could cause otherwise.

- Please, please, please use a better platform for collaborative editing and comments than Reddit. Happy to have regular discussion and brainstorming, but the drafts don't belong here. (same rule as our regular contests)
