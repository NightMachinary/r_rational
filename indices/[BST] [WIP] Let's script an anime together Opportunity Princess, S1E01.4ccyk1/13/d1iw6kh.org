I strongly enjoyed seeing guards and other npcs exhibit intelligence.

I would have liked if the summoning scene better if it had some sort of hint at what kind of entity the princess was attempting to summon. They way I interpreted it was that she just turned off all safety precautions and said summon my friend. I would have liked a little more directed summoning, ex: "Summon the friend I would want if I knew what I wanted and was much more clever." or "Summon the teacher who can teach me to be the person I will need to be to summon the friend that I will need in 7 years time to save the world."

I felt like the episode was missing any reference or hint toward a Big Bad. There was no evil kingdom or evil demon that was threatening the land. It makes the clever gambit of summoning a possibly dangerous and powerful entity and evading the queen feel less epic.
