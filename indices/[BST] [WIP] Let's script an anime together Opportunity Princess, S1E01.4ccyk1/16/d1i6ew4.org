First thing that popped out at me:

After all these years, why hasn't Sirua hired a mage to use their summoning and acquire a creature that can magically track people down? Surely among all the realms of elementals, spirits, demons, fae, and whatever else, there must be something that can allow the Queen to magically locate her daughter. And the obvious thing to do is to not let her daughter know such a thing has been done until she needs to utilize it in a true emergency. Or, don't do the summoning just yet, and now that Toyori seems truly missing, immediately order a magic user who has a summoning available and on stand-by for just such a circumstance.

Other than that, well written and enjoyable. I feel like I don't have enough info on the world/characters to begin editing/optimizing yet, but I'll keep an eye on it. My main questions so far revolve around the summoning ritual, who can use it, how the society functions with such a powerful and varied bit of magic. How rare are magic users? Can even non-magic users make use of the summoning spell to have fairly weak or specialized familiars? That would make for an interesting world.

Looking forward to another chapter.
