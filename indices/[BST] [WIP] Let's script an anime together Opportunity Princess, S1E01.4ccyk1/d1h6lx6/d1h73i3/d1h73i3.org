Okay then. In that case, the actual anime script belongs to me and all profits pertaining thereto, to be disposed of as I wish. Everyone else on the planet has an unlimited non-exclusive license to use the characters and world for derivative works, including for commercial purposes, as is standard with all my works.

I'm actually a little tired of not being able to profit from my writing work; it's constraining. I've given away a lot already and would like to keep some.

Also, you know there's a [BST] tag listed in the sidebar, right?
