Why do we have a [BST] tag in the sidebar if brainstorming is against the rules? (And are there any examples of that being enforced?) Also, I'd hate for this to be way less likely to be continued as result of trying to formalize it too much while it still exists in such a nebulous state.

I don't know how one would formalize the profit split at this stage, while we have no idea how many people will participate and at what level of engagement.
