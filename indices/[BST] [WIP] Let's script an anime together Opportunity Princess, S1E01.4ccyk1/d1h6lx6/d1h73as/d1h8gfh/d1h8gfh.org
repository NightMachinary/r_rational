Just above the tags, we have

#+begin_quote
  Do not post scenarios for discussion, requests for someone to write a story, or brainstorming threads. Authors get one exemption after each published chapter or equivalent.
#+end_quote

I'll add a reference to this by the tag itself though.

There are examples of this being enforced, but only mods can see removed posts... so I guess the 'usually' phrase will mean something very different to most readers. I intended it only as a flag that this post is /not/ going to get removed!
