Ha! I've been working on a thermonuclear magical girl story, so I think I can contribute to this one.

The first thing I did was get a sheet of paper and number it 1 to 13. Then split each of those into Part A and Part B. You have opening and ending credits here, but no break in the middle. I would give some consideration to the actual Opening and Ending, like how /City of Angles/ had its own super stylish intro to get you in the mood for each chapter. I think that sort of thing is criminally underused in text, anyway.

This post is just over 4k words. I suspect this is too short. Cut it in half and it would be 2k words; a quick google search reveals the average reading speed is 200 words per minute. I know this is an extremely flimsy estimate, and fight scenes and such will require more prose-per-moment than most scenes, but I would guess that a full episode would clock around five thousand words to not feel too slow. Less than that and we're heading for padding land. I myself only took like six or seven minutes to read that entire episode, which isn't enough.

Personally, this only feels like a the first half of an episode. I would still want a thorough introduction of our familiar and the first round of interactions and running gags between the two of them, and then they escape the city somehow at the end of the episode. If we only have thirteen episodes, we can't afford to squander any time in the Tutorial Area.

I think it's strange that you want us to make use of the visual elements but made the familiar's actual presence extremely unflashy.

  Toyori: "What's your name?" Toyori's eyes open. Toyori's voice in a lower register: "David Finkelstein."

That is so not going to cut it. We need a hologram or mental projection pronto, and a separate physical body secured by the fourth or fifth episode. This method has other problems too. Making the characters share vocal chords means they can't talk over each other or rush, which limits our options and should be avoided. Telepathy is a hacky way to go but it will serve for now.

Okay, now for plot and worldbuilding. A quick rule of thumb when writing a novel is to take the climax you were going to write and move it to the middle, then write an even cooler climax for the actual ending. So let's assume the big climax of linking the magical and normal realms is now our midpoint and the real ending is the saving of both with the other. Cool. We'll need an antagonist of some kind and a formal magic system, but we're getting somewhere.

So the story looks like:

1.  Toyori and David are introduced, then escape the city.

2.  Toyori and David bond while overcoming some kind of obstacle.

3.  Evil wizard is gonna conquer realms by mashing them together, like lego and duplo.

4.  ?

5.  Wizard starts exploiting the link between worlds to endanger them.

6.  David cleverly sacrifices himself to move the portal to his homeworld.

7.  Toyori the loss of her friend, but reunites with the real David.

8.  Both worlds were saved for a time, but their connection could become a blessing or a curse.

9.  ?

10. ?

11. Love confession.

12. ?

13. Normal and magic realms get saved. The end.
