I don't think it's secret hidden Winnum Roke.

The entire chapter was all about how hard the power is to manage. You can't ask it for honest people you have to ask it for <X>. It has unexpected limitations and will give you things you aren't asking for.

I suspect that instead of Winnum Roke, Nic just poorly phrased his request.

Regarding Dizzy, maybe it's just that she likes him back that's getting to him? Learning about a girl having a crush on me would make think about her a lot back when I was that age. Dizzy's been actively paying an interest to Nic, and a few chapters ago was talking about how much she thought about him etc.. It seems like natural relationship development to me.
