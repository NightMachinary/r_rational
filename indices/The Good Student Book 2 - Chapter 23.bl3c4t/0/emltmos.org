There are a few different directions this could take, but I suspect that Winnum Roke is still up to shenanigans. We've seen that she's very capable at masking her presence/making people think they've dealt with her (e.g. how she handled the archmage) and she's likely tied to Gweur.

Also, does anyone else think that something is up with Nic's feelings toward Dizzy? His responses to thinking of her seem more exaggerated than ever, and this seems like it's in the realm of what Roke is capable of (minor physical changes to Nic's body).
