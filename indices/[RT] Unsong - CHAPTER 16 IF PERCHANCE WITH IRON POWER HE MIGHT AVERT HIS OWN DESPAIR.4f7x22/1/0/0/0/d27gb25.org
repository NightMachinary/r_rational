I think so. It's hard to say. Scott [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/25/predictions-for-2016/][only gave 50% probability]] that he would not miss any Unsong updates this year. And yet in his 2015 predictions, he gave 60% probability that "I will not finish [project]", and he judged that prediction incorrect.

I think the best hypothesis at the moment is that he has a complete first draft that his close friends have read, but that he's editing it into completed form week-by-week.
