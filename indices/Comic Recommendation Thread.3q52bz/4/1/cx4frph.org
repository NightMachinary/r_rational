Liar Game: while they never explicitly spell it out, I really like that the female protagonist wins many game through the power of [[#s][]], which no-one less idealistic could do. She still needs the male protagonist to unleash that power in clever plans, but neither could he win without her.

Shame that she has to drag that idiot ball for so long though.
