For the ridiculous repertoire of bizarre facial expressions and the amazing dialogue (not to mention the self-awareness and hilarious action sequences), my current favorite webcomic is Paranatural.

The manga Liar Game, which focuses on game theory in the setting of, well, actual games. That the participants are forced to attend, after being roped in by the first round where they were either put into huge debt or blackmailed based on how they won. The protagonist is extremely off-putting at the beginning, but the other main character is awesome enough to offset it until the protagonist grows into herself as a competitor, which does happen.

The MSPA comic All Night Laundry. Incredibly well done, more than slightly creepy, and with a lot of mysteries to be unraveled.

That's all I've got off the top of my head, and I'd link them if I wasn't on mobile.
