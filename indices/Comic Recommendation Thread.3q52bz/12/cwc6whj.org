Not particularly rational, but... the One Punch Man manga has an entertaining story with a fantastically funny premise and characters. I recommend the more recent version with refined art over the terrible webcomic art the story was originally told with. Yusuke Murata's art is amazingly high quality; it's gorgeous, the manga would be worth recommending on the strength of the art alone.
