I'll tentatively put out "El Goonish Shive", if "one of the male protagonists has the power to turn into a girl" isn't a put-off for you. [[http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1061]["Bringing Silly Back"]] is a decent place to start. Kind of like Sluggy Freelance, in the genre of "bunch of normal characters who gradually through the story acquire superpowers form different sources". Unlike Sluggy, the plot is a little more tightly bound together.

[[http://grrlpowercomic.com/]["Grrl Power"]] is a superhero comic that is very self-aware of the superhero genre, but not to the point of parody. Character driven, not combat driven. Very funny. Not particularly dramatic, but learning the universe, characters, and settling in is plenty interesting to keep me reading. Humor gets an "A", clever use of powers gets a "B+". Characters are smart, but the author hasn't tried to break the universe yet.
