SFP buys in too much to internet feminism for me to take it seriously. I have some problems with the characterization and dialogue after issue 5 starts. But I haven't read 1-3 recently, so I might have problems with them as well.

Feral's arc (issue 3) was the best one, in my opinion. It made me cry.
