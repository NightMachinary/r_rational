Before he got tasered and kidnapped, we find out that he has a conscience, his parents and friends were killed and/or dead, and that in the end he's fundamentally trying to do what he thinks is right based on his ethical convictions, at least in part - so, you know, he's basically shown to be much like most of the other relevant characters in the comic.

Now, he is hoisted on his own petard to not make you feel too bad about him, I suppose. But I think he was given sufficient fleshing out to be a sympathetic character, or that's how I perceived him, anyway.
