Yeah, I just caught up. I think it's stayed roughly as good as the Feral arc, honestly. Which is to say, really really good.

I agree that the moonshadow stuff is more feminism-charged than the other stuff the comic covers, but I don't think it's as if the comic went out of its way to unabashedly push an "internet-feminist"-y stance. They made Furnace, who was in part the embodiment of anti-false rape accusations, a sympathetic character, and made sure to deliberately acknowledge male rape victims. It all seemed fairly reasonable and balanced to me, or at least enough so that it didn't leave me behind.

The breakdown on 157 was pretty good too, and really built upon the ongoing exploration of the particular themes of ethics and social responsibility that the comic covers and was so well done in the Feral arc. I mean, the comic has a little bit of tell not show going about it when it does this, both with Feral, the current arc, and other moments, but in general it's striking a chord with me and I think it works pretty well.
