[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance][Sluggy Freelance]] is the best comic on the web in my opinion. Very good art (a bit rough for a while in the start, but gets better fast) perfect mix of sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, and drama. It's also super old, more than 15 years (it was one of the first webcomics), and huge (daily updates for much of its run, currently updating 5 days a week). Which means a huge archive which I think is awesome.

Has slowly shifted from comedy (From "The Slug Files": [[http://www.sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/980320]["Muldy! Watch out for that raccoon!" SWERVE! "Look out! Baby Duck!" SWERVE! "Look out! The only man who knows the truth behind the conspiracy!" WHAM! SPLAT! "Doesn't that just figure."]]) to high drama -- check out the 4U City [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/100322][Green]], [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/100510][Blue]], and [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/110214][Red]] arcs and their [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/weekly/090803][setup]] for a great tense and well written sci-fi thriller in a setting almost reminiscent of the game Paranoia, but IMO done better.

Second best comic on the web is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt][Gunnerkregg Court]]. Really cool art and great writing.

Third best comic on the web is Schlock Mercenary. Nifty sci-fi with some cool rationalist elements, but sometimes a bit slow moving for my tastes. The author also does cool book and movie reviews.
