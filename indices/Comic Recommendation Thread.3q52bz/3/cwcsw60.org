*Superman: Red Son* is my favorite Superman comic (the pitch is that Superman's spaceship lands in Soviet Russia instead of Kansas).

*[[http://www.shigabooks.com/?page=001][Demon]]* started out as being very much the sort of thing [[/r/rational]] would love, but has sort of descended into madness. I don't know, it's weird. Consider this a half recommendation?

*[[http://english.bouletcorp.com/][The Bouletcorp]]* does a lot of really neat long-form comics. It's definitely one for RSS though, since he tends to drop a big chunk every few weeks rather than being on any sort of schedule.

*Y: The Last Man* was good, and was part of that genre of "some big thing happens, here is the result", though the ending was a bit weak. It's finished, so it's got that going for it.
