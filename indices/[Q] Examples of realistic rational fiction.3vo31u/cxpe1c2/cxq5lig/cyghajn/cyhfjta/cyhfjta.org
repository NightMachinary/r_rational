A drama could be about many things i think, could be about a family handling a child being diagnosed with cancer for example. I don't see any issue with making that setting rational.

It will definitely be difficult to write a realistic world unification rational fic where a single character based on it's abilities optimize the world entirely. but you could write about someone trying to do that by for example running for presidency or somesuch.
