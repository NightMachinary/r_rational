  But how would that really prevent writing good rational detective stories for example? or a drama? horror? thriller?

Small scale is certainly possible, that is true. I'm not sure what drama is exactly as a genre, but it sounds a lot like it depends on miscommunication.

  if you believe the world works some way and you wrote a story that way, even if you miss interpreted the political power balance in some country

The problem there is not even getting everything correct, it's simply the complexity that would arise when the entire world is the scope of your story. Significant Digits manages to do well to make the world-optimization subplot satisfactory, but it's using gross simplifications, because the politics and machinations themselves are not what the story is about. Neither is realism the case in Death Note; the only efforts of the UN are to create a very tiny detective force in Japan with a memorable cast of characters and direct relation to the protagonist's father, big surprise. Making a realistic story /about/ world optimization would be incredibly difficult.
