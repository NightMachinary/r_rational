I feel like either i am missing something or what you are saying comes with extra assumptions about the nature of rational and\or realistic fiction.

I mean, sure the things you write will make it kind of impossible to write realistic rational fiction where the MC conquers the world without understanding the full power structure of the world. But how would that really prevent writing good rational detective stories for example? or a drama? horror? thriller? all of those are possible without breaking the list on the right of this sub..

having said all of that, even if you did attempt to write a rational realistic story where the MC unites earth under some actual central government, neither the "realistic" nor the "rational" aspects demand that every single thing you say will be scientifically proven. if you believe the world works some way and you wrote a story that way, even if you miss interpreted the political power balance in some country, or the cause for economic issues in another, it still will be fine. the point of rational fiction is that you won't make things conveniently happen for your story to progress. meaning less literary shortcuts. and realistic fiction is about stories that could happen in real life, meaning no invented world mechanics.
