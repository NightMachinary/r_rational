  But basically, fiction is simplified, because it was created by a human brain, and human brains cannot GM for reality.

No, fiction is simplified because "human brains" (by which you mean "authors") have an extremely limited space (either in time, or pages) in which to tell a compelling storyline, and things like hard-line realism interfere with that.

Plus, audiences often don't accept hard-line realism as realistic.
