I like to think that a good example of a realistic rational fiction would be the television series The Wire. There are many actors in the system, all of them with realistic values and all of them proceed to fulfill their values in a reasonably rational manner, given the constraints of their ability / resources and the conflicting values of other actors. And of course everything goes to shit and it's impossible to really blame anyone for it because that's the complexity of real life.
