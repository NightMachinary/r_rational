Are you seriously saying that human brains (by which I mean "human brains") /can/ GM for reality? I'd like to see you try.

But basically all you're adding here is that the readers are human brains as well. Yes, the medium is inherently limited, but that doesn't keep a /subjective experience/ from being told in rather fine detail. You're not writing up the workings of setting mechanics in third-person omniscient, you're depicting events that characters sense and how they interpret and react to them. The mechanics of the setting are intrinsic to the plot, they're not what's being detailed save through the observable effects. No, hard-line realism does not interfere with the space in which a story is told (No more than the complexity of the real world interferes with the narrative you can make of your own life).

As for what the readers accept, that has every problem inherent with deciding what reality is in the first place, and is yet another reason why those who can write contemporary rational fiction should be implementing instead of just writing about it.
