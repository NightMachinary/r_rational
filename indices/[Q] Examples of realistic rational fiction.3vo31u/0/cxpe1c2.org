The problem with realistic rational fiction set in the now is that the people who are able to write it are much better suited using that ability elsewhere.

Reality is complicated. It's hard and costly to figure out what information you're missing that you need. Experiments are not nice and neat, [[/u/eaturbrainz]] made a point about how SF&F is much more /accessible/ to the experimenter. I've complained quite a bit, either internally or externally, about the assumptions that characters in stories are able to make about the results of their experiments, simply because the author didn't think of all the other hypotheses that could explain the character's observations. But basically, fiction is simplified, because it was created by a human brain, and human brains cannot GM for reality.

SF&F has simple rules on the level of toy models, like a spherical cow in a vacuum. Rational stories are able to deal with those. But look at some of these guidelines on the sidebar:

  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

The social aspect is a nightmare. There are over seven billion people on Earth, and all sorts of groups, government agencies, companies, interest groups, that are trying to affect us in some way. The cash flows are ludicrously complex. We don't even know whether the economy is over- or undervaluing certain classes of stocks, because markets are social and depend on assumptions en masse.

So, reality is complicated. The reason rational fiction does not try to deal with reality is because of this. A rational protagonist that is not given some special systems to study and abilities to exploit, be they fantastic or science fictional, then has to deal with application of rationality to the mundane, which is what the author is supposed to be doing in the first place. Without a special system, they aren't able to accurately describe the effects the character would have on the world around them. Without special abilities, the character is powerless compared to any other of their peers. The rational thing to do in reality happens, to /some/ extent, all around us. When people gain a special cause, like maximizing Islam, or maximizing global QALYs, then interesting behavior occurs, but without a comparative advantage in something to the rest of the world, interesting things do not happen. Real life happens.

So, the reasons are one, but it has two expressions. First, the system that is available for study is the same as in reality, and thus hard to realistically experiment on and fairly boring (why not magic!), and the abilities provided are limited to those in reality, which is not much of an obstacle but then limits interesting stories to people with lots of money and/or very little governmental oversight.
