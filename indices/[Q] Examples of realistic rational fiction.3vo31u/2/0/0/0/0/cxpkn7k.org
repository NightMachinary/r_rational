No, fucking /everything/ up /all at the same time/ is pretty difficult. Problem is, fucking up one substantial thing still has quite a lot of personal cost.

Like, the primary reason we /don't/ have a society that can easily be destroyed from the inside by one fuck-up is because those kinds of social structures die in embryo /because they suck/. /But/, our societies and structures haven't been optimized /in particular/ for robustness to individual mistakes.

Or actually, I can think of a few that /are/, but they have their other-side-of-the-coin, too: if you engineer the US government to be extremely robust against the personal ideologies of ambitious legislators, then it's extremely robust against the personal ideologies of /good/ ambitious legislators.

Reality doesn't have a built-in alignment system, so it's hard to build human structures that measure alignment well-enough to make themselves /more/ useful to Good than to Evil (and for purposes of this post, assume Good and Evil hold their usual D&D definitions, because why not).
