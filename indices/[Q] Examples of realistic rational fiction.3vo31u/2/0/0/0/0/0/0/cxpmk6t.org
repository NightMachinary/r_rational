  there are more groups that are against your utility function than are for it, so it's easier to find utility functions against yours that have low-hanging fruit in their implementations.

Really? I mean, I guess I don't understand precisely what you mean by "your utility function" (yours? Mine? LW as a group?), but considering you were mentioning "humanity's survival", I would figure that almost all people very likely prefer that there are some people in existence as opposed to none. They would usually even prefer that they, personally, be alive rather than dead.

"Let's kill everyone" doesn't seem to be anyone's "utility function", just the effect of certain actions some people are intent on taking (like global warming and all that).

  Although those in charge of that group may not be implementing those things because their own goals are different from the professed goals of the group, which would be why you have many different ideological revolutions that just happen to benefit one charismatic leader's lifestyle.

This is seriously way vague.
