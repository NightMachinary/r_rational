I don't know what the general [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s stance on it is, but I think [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/][House of Cards]] isn't far removed from a realistic rational fiction. The characters are motivated by (more or less) realistic ambitions and I don't think the way in which they go about achieving those is in any shape or form orthogonal to the Characteristics of RF.
