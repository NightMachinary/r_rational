First, I said some possibility, merely pointing out its existence. Second, I'm not talking about any predictions in particular, which are indeed extremely unlikely due to conjunction. I'm talking about the marginal probability of humanity's extinction, across all conditions.

Indeed, not only am I talking about the marginal probability, I am talking about the perceived marginal probability. A majority of people do not go about with a likelihood judged greater than zero that society as they know it might be destroyed, let alone the extinction of humanity. They take everyday life for granted.

...Not that I find it particularly worth considering at the moment. But people don't acknowledge the possibility, because that sort of thing is reserved for science fiction, religious nuts, and conspiracy theorists.
