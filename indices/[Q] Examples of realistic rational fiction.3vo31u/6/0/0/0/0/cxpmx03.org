  Indeed, not only am I talking about the marginal probability, I am talking about the perceived marginal probability. A majority of people do not go about with a likelihood judged greater than zero that society as they know it might be destroyed, let alone the extinction of humanity. They take everyday life for granted.

Ok, and now I'm /not/ being /all that/ contrarian anymore, but what about, for instance, Fox News viewers, or Daily Mail readers? It seems that the /real/ problem with talking about extinction risks is /precisely/ that manipulative douchebag organizations make /every/ effort to convince common people on the streets that WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE ANY DAY NOW basically all the time, thus rendering scientists or technologists talking about extinction risks nigh-unbelievable until you actually /teach people/ the difference between "journalists" and professional scientists.

  ...Not that I find it particularly worth considering at the moment.

WAHOO!

(I don't consider myself educated enough about extinction risks to have an opinion besides, "OH FUCK GLOBAL WARMING but at least goal-oriented AI may be more difficult than previously supposed for good or ill BUT GLOBAL WARMING IS ALREADY HAPPENING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TAKE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES DECADES AGO.")

  But people don't acknowledge the possibility, because that sort of thing is reserved for science fiction, religious nuts, and conspiracy theorists.

True though.
