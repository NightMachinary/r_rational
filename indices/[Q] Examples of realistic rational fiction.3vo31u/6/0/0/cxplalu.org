  All we know is that there are some properties that the future is likely to have, and that there are some possibilities that contravene what most people take for granted, like humanity's continued survival.

Is this /really/ true? I've heard at least some people (including some SF&F authors and "futurists") argue, with somewhat good evidence, that predictions of the End Times are /extremely/ frequent throughout human history, and that the prior probability we should allocate to any /particular/ such prediction is thus correspondingly low.
