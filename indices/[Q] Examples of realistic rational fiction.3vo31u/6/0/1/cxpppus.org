  That is what intelligence is for

You seem very particular about the distinction between reason and intelligence.

  long-term predictions are not something we're able to do, even with rationality

I think you may be misunderstanding me, just as when I say "evidence", I do not mean "proof", likewise when I say "prediction", I do not mean "prophesy". It is very strange that you admit the definition of intelligence as a predictive aparatus, but you do not admit that that then makes long-term forecasts a function of intelligence.
