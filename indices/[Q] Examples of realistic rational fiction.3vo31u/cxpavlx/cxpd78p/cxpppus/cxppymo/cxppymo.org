Long-term predictions at the level of detail of a story are many-zeroes impossible, intelligence or not. Long-term plans require maintenance, because otherwise chaotic divergence occurs. The space of possibilities in the future is combinatorially curved. Conjoining many probable conditions results in an infinitesimally probable outcome.

We can only speak in terms of marginal probabilities.
