#+begin_quote
  Modern rationalism is essentially equivalent to futurism
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  but because predicting the future is basically what reason is for
#+end_quote

That is what /intelligence/ is for, and long-term predictions are not something we're able to do, even with rationality. All we know is that there are some properties that the future is likely to have, and that there are some possibilities that contravene what most people take for granted, like humanity's continued survival.

#+begin_quote
  A theory is only as good as the predictions it makes. No matter what, if it cannot predict the future, it is not useful.
#+end_quote

Non sequitur.

#+begin_quote
  It's natural, then, that rationalists would have minds full of arresting visions of strange futures.
#+end_quote

No, it's natural because the extant culture is tied to futurist and transhumanist culture, where people are brought to rationality through SF&F and SF&F lovers like EY.
