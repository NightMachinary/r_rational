One reason ratfic is rarely set in the present: Modern rationalism is essentially equivalent to futurism, not just because most modern rationalists happen to be interested in futurism, but because predicting the future is basically what reason is for. A theory is only as good as the predictions it makes. No matter what, if it cannot predict the future, it is not useful. It's natural, then, that rationalists would have minds full of arresting visions of strange futures.
