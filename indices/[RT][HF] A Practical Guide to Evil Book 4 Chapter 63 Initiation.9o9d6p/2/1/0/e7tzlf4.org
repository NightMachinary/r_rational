  That's assuming she hasn't managed to sneak back doors into the oaths though.

That seems like a fairly huge assumption. If we've had two things hammered into our heads, it's that Akua is master manipulator and can't be trusted. And then this chapter went out of its way to remind us that she's very good with legalese.

#+begin_quote
  the fact that they have such a dynamic is cause for concern.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that line was included more to show how literally every time Akua is brought up it's her not being taken seriously as a threat. (Except for that one time at the end, where Cat aknowledges the danger and proceeds to give Akua more tools,).

Part (a) was something of a reach, but the mistreatment of Akua is something of a trend at this point in more serious ways, and the "chained monster escapes and eats it's master" is something worth bringing up in this context anyway.

  her large say in Cat's decisions is mostly a function of her being who Cat has that has any interest or experience with it
#+end_quote

But to do this is to make the assumption that having Akua involved isn't going to be a liability - and Cat's been pretty darned clear prior to this that Akua is a liability who will inevitably stab her in the back.

If the only way to make the Drow - the race of traitorous, exponentially growing monsters - work is to /trust Akua/... it's probably not a great long term idea.

And it's not like Cat doesn't have other options, to her knowledge. Hell, she shot down a bunch of them not too long ago in large part /because Akua suggested those options/.
