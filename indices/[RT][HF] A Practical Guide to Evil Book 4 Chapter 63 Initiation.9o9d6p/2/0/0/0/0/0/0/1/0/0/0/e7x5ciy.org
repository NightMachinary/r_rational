*Sworn to the Sovereign of Moonless Nights.

I think that distinction has been covered enough by others.

  if you don't think she sat down with Archer to scrutinize every words of the oath.
#+end_quote

There's literally no indication that Archer was brought into this. Nadda. But that's sort of besides the point, because the big issue here is that Akua has been noted to be far better than either of them at manipulation of people and fine print.

Do you really think that Akua is not capable of slipping something in? Do you think that she /wouldn't/?

On the meta level, foyou think that giving Akua power and responsibility is going to result in Cat getting off scott free?

  but as soon as they break free of that they're going back to old patterns.
#+end_quote

Yes. I see you have grasped the issue here.

The problem is one part the Drow suck, one part they're going to become real powerful real fast, and one part Akua has been trusted to conceive and then implement the binding that prevent the first two issue from compounding.
