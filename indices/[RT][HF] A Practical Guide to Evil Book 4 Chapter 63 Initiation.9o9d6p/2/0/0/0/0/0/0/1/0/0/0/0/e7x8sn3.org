You have it backward; read the hint from the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9o9d6p/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_63/e7vop1k/][WOG]] in this very thread

  Do you really think that Akua is not capable of slipping something in?

Not when under so much scrutiny. Cat is /magically/ illiterate; she is not illiterate in Lower Miezan. And Akua wouldn't attempt a betrayal unless she is certain that it will succeeds.

Not really, Cat is not adding much to the Night; she is just redistributing it around.
