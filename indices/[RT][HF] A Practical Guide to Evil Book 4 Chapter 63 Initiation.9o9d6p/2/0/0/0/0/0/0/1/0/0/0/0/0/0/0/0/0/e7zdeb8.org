Sorry, are you suggesting that Cat's goal is to cause chaos? Citations needed.

Cat gave us her reasons for wanting the Drow:

#+begin_quote
  Procer would be occupied with the Dead King for the foreseeable future, but there was no guarantee part of the crusader host would not try Callowan borders again if it saw weakness. The Dominion still had two armies on the field, and the League's intentions were opaque to me. My instinct had been that the Tyrant of Helike and his madman of a Hierarch would be taking a swing at the Principate, but that'd been while it was still the dominant force on the board. With Keter on the march, the League might be feeling adventurous enough to aim for other territories. And that was without even considering Malicia, who sure as Hells wouldn't let me bind the wounds of Callow in peace.

  ...

  “It was one thing to put all our coin on the Army of Callow when we had the leash on the Dead King, however laughably feeble that leash was,” I replied. “It's another when Malicia's the one who let him out, on unknown terms. There will be battles, Hakram, and there's only so many Callowans of fighting fit. Only so many we can afford to lose.

If you want that clarified: she's worried about the possibility of being invaded, and she can't lose too many men.

Just as a reminder, there are huge logistical issues with Praes attacking Callow, in terms of food, manpower, coin, an ongoing war with Ashur, and general Praesi dickishness. If you want to dispute this, I can probably go find the quotes later on. The Dominion and Procer have bigger fish to fry, as far as cat's concerned. And she's already admitted that she has no clue what the Tyrant is up to. So again - Hedging against the risk of losing too many men from the /possibility/ of being invaded.

  Drow army is that something.

Again, there are alternatives. Again, I listed a bunch above. Again, you've ignored it.

Cat has other plenty of other options than the Drow. She's talked about them. She has plenty of options of handling the Drow in a different manner. I have lifted a narrow selection of these.

Before she left for the Everdark it was pointed out that backing herself into a corner where Akua was her only diplomacy expert was a bad idea. This was before magically binding oaths, status granting minions, and the forming of death squads was added to the mix.

  The issue is that you don't see her situation as dire, so you don't think she should be taking these risks.

Not at all - Callow's fucked. I was arguing for this a while back. You and I actually discussed this at the time.

What I'm arguing is that the Drow and Akua are unlikely to make things any better.

Taking the disloyal, backstabbing society of slavers, murders and rapists with the potential for accelerated growth, making them more powerful with a magical source connected to treachery and dickishness (which you've been hesitant to use in case of story repercussions), and then trusting your traitorous underling (who's smarter than you are) to manage the situation through a combination of magical bindings, extra-powerful minions and death squads they've suggested does not seem like a strategic decision.

On the story level, the evil army bound with magic is probably going to betray you, as is the evil second. On the practical probably end badly, for obvious reasons.

If things go even slightly badly, then Callow is done for. It's not even the fun sort of chaos that Cat thrives in.
