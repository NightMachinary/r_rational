  If changing the name can affect things, why not include "and have ever bore" for completeness?

  Here she uses "me" to refer to herself but everywhere else it's Sovereign of... (SOTMN).

Those are actually good points, the second in particular was something I missed when going over the chapter. Amended the text accordingly.

The rest of what you argue is a bit of stretch. First off, you're assuming that the oaths binding drow to the SOMN instead of Catherine in particular is a bug instead of a feature. It isn't. Second, you're assuming that a precaution as basic as an identity check wouldn't be taken before people are allowed to bid. Third, your entire argument about rules being amended in the future is essentially irrelevant since they're bound to take her orders regardless, something already ensured by oath. Fourth, your hypothetical with Masego is absurd since several things you describe - punching old ladies, messing with private property - would be illegal, and so covered by the last part of the same oath you quoted. I'll also point out that for it to even slightly hold up you had to nix the obvious solution (use of her authority to make things illegal) and assume she'd be enough of an idiot to not use her legal rights to imprison a threat to the kingdom. It's fine if you want to poke holes in the oaths, frankly I'm not a legal scholar of any sort so I could use the help, but at this point you're kind of making your own flaws so you can point them out.
