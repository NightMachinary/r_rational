shoddy oaths

#+begin_quote
  under this name and any name you will ever bear I bind you by these oaths
#+end_quote

If changing the name can affect things, why not include "and have ever bore" for completeness?

#+begin_quote
  “You will never slay nor harm nor hinder any in my service, or dwelling within Callow, save in your own defence or the pursuit of my laws,”
#+end_quote

Here she uses "me" to refer to herself but everywhere else it's Sovereign of... (SOTMN). Seems like if you are going to make a set of secure oaths that will last for a century, you should make it more reliable in this regard. For example, you could split the oath into several parts.

First, specify that Oathtaker in the text of the oath uniquely refers to Cat with two dozen identifiers so the whole set couldn't be stolen from her by someone taking her mantle, or her changing title or name or current profession, or what not. If done properly, it should make cat the "holder" of the contract no matter what kind of shenanigans happen. An example could be something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Oathtaker refers to me, Catherine Foundling, ruler of Callow at the time this contract is signed, current holder of the SOTMN title, person currently in front of the Oathgiver, previously human female, with a penchant for not checking what the hell I am doing with very powerful magic
#+end_quote

This isn't a reliable descriptor here as I am not going to spend half an hour ironing out all the details, but the point would be to specify Cat uniquely in several different ways so that if you subvert just one of those ways you still wouldn't count as the contract holder. For example, if Ubua stole SOTMN title, she still wouldn't have been the ruler of Callow at the time of contract being signed, and would either be left with inactive oaths or would need to resort to time travel.

Second, specify who is taking the oath, with a similar set of two dozen identifiers. As a hypothetical example, what happens if it's not Sekoran there in front of her, but some other drow pretending to be Sekoran? Would it even be bound /at all/ in the current set of oaths, given that their name is /not/ Sekoran?

Third, specify what the oaths are (don't kill civvies, obey liesse accords, etc). Doesn't really matter what those oaths are, as long as they aren't shoddy.

Fourth, specify how, if at all, this set of oaths can be changed. It sure seems useful to have an ability to impose conditional oaths on your soldiers when it is necessary without the whole ritual with the cup and the knife. It also seems sensible that you might want to pull back an oath which is good in general for a very specific circumstance. For example:

#+begin_quote
  “You will never slay nor harm nor hinder any in my service, or dwelling within Callow, save in your own defence or the pursuit of my laws,”
#+end_quote

Suppose that Masego (in Cat's service) goes suddenly insane from demon corruption, and starts running around towns wrecking various havoc. Switching chickens for turkeys, beating up old ladies, dropping cats into pots of milk, all sorts of stuff. You'd like to be able to say "go find whomever is doing this, break their legs and bring them here so we can ask what is up with that". We'll also specify that for whatever reason Cat can't pass a law saying "that is illegal", perhaps because each time it's a new thing, and can't fire whomever is causing havoc, perhaps because they don't know who is.

In this highly unusual circumstance it'd make sense to temporarily peel off a very good general oath in regards to this insane individual. Current set of oaths doesn't allow for it. Having a clause for how that can be done seems sensible.

However, some oaths (e.g. don't try to usurp my title) could be considered too dangerous to be allowed to be changed at all, lest a Hero exploit that, so you could specify which parts of the oathtaking could be changed and which couldn't. Similarily, you could add clauses for how Cat could temporarily cede control over the general drow management to Ubua, in a circumstance like in the Battle of the Camps where Cat was out of order for a couple days, and how much that control would be ceded.
