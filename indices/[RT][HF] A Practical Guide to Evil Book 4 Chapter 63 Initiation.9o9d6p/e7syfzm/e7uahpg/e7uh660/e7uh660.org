I dispute this. I'm going to go with the example of having Akua help out with the Drow, because I think that's the most egregious mistake here, but Cat's not making binary choices here - the possibility space for problem solving is huge.

There were a bunch of alternatives /to being involved with the Drow at all/ (let alone having Akua handle the idea and execution for binding the Drow) laid out in chapter 55. Cat rejected them because she didn't like the risk-reward ratios and/or she didn't want to get involved with Black and/or didn't want to treat with the Hierarch or the Chain of Hunger.

But apparently it's /better/ to get involved with the Drow? The traitorous bastards with the potential for exponential growth? The one's who can't be trusted without using Winter powers, which Cat has hereto been hesitant to use in case of narrative backlash, backed up by oaths crafted by a lawyer who she knows is out to get her? Oaths that have already had big obvious loopholes pointed out in them? There are several distinct layers of bad ideas going on here.

You have to measure the other options against this one, and this one doesn't look particularly great.

And then there's the fact that her original goal was to have the Dead King invade Procer to take the heat of her. This was the victory condition she laid out. Now, the Dead King is about to invade Procer and take the heat off of Cat. Yes, it's because of a deal with Malicia, but that's a thing that's happening. If Cat wants this army to deal with Procer - as she has described her motive - Procer's mostly dealt with. The other threats are a series of maybes where any potential invader would have their own logistical issues. Are these issues pressing enough to justify handing a ton of power and responsibility to Akua?

On top of that, if she weigh it up and decides that yes, she really does need an army, Cat has decided to hand out Winter titles, and we've seen first hand how powerful even the weakest of those are. Cat can just put those titles to use somewhere where betrayal isn't a seeming inevitability.

She has justifications for treating with the Drow, yes, but they're somewhat flimsy motives when dealing with the Drow involves setting herself up for betrayal during literally every part of the process and going along with almost all of Akua's requests for more power. Cat will be extraordinarily lucky if this doesn't blow up in her face entirely. And if it /does/ blow up in her face, well, then she's got a plague of mass-murdering, raping, slaving monsters in her background who grow stronger with every kill. That's a hell of a downside for questionable gain, and she's not doing much to contain the risk, as pointed out above.

But let's say that yes, she needs the army and yes, she's not going to go for any of the alternatives. There's still a bunch of different ways to approach this.

Cat hasn't made so much as a token effort to limit Akua's involvement here. If she's going to use these oaths to bind the Drow into her service, and the service of the Liesse Accords, then she has a range of options like trying to acquire an expert to help look through the fineprint (remember, she has minions with fast travel enabled). Yes, this will take more time, but she's not in such a huge rush that she can't afford to take basic precautions with binding the untrustworthy individuals who are going to compse the background of her military. I mean, she could spend more time going through the clauses with Archer. The loopholes pointed out here in the comments are hardly obscure technicalities that couldn't be caught by someone motivated enough to have a cursory look for them.

Giving power to Akua implies that it's a better choice than not giving it to Akua - and Cat's been pretty clear that the Diabolist it a traitor in waiting who is not to be trusted. Giving her own minions and a role in shaping and implementing critical policies is hard to see as an action that's more of an asset than a liability.
