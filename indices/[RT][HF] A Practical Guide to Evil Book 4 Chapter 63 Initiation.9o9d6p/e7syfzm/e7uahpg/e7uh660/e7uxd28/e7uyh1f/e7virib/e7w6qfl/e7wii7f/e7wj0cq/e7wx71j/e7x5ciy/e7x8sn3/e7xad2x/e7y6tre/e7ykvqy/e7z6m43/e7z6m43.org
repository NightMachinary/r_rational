You're completely misreading the character of Cat if you think she's trying to reduce uncertainty; she is doing the opposite. The Black Knight himself said this just 3 chapters ago:

#+begin_quote
  She thrives in chaotic situations. It's led her to the bad habit of creating them knowing it improves her chances of victory even if it significantly increases collateral damage as well.
#+end_quote

And she's doing this because Malicia will straight up out plan her unless she does something totally unexpected, and that Drow army is that something.

The issue is that you don't see her situation as dire, so you don't think she should be taking these risks.
