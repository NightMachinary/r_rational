You haven't said anything that I didn't already know. The Drow's oaths are to Cat, not Akua, and you're treating Cat like a complete idiot if you don't think she sat down with Archer to scrutinize every words of the oath.

The Drows are currently being forced to cooperate by the oaths, but as soon as they break free of that they're going back to old patterns. They're not going to magically improve their civilization because the very nature of the Night itself makes that impossible.
