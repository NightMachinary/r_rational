We've been given two reasons. One, they're terribly boxed in.

  Those enterprising souls were not known for having a lot of success in those depredations. Ages ago, before the Golden Bloom had been seized by the elves, the now-broken kingdom of the Deoraithe had occasionally been troubled by them. Now, though? The surface paths led them into three dead ends: the Kingdom of the Dead, the Golden Bloom and the Chain of Hunger. None of these were known to be welcoming locales to outsiders. Once every few decades it was said a cunning and careful warband managed to slip through dwarven tunnels or other secret paths to reach northern Procer -- or much more rarely, northern Callow -- but even fewer of those who made it there succeeding at returning home.

Two, they're a race of traitorous backstabbers: (who can't cooperate):

  “That lot outside is bottom-feeders, Diabolist,” I murmured. “And still they were capable of a trick most Named wouldn't sneer at. There's something wrong here. If their lower ranks are this strong there's no way they'd be a ruin of an empire as they supposedly are.”

  “Unless,” Akua said calmly, “that very power is the cause of ruin.”

  My brow rose. That was possible, yes. Were they all fighting of this Night so ferociously they'd broken their own realm?

(There are a half dozen other quotes supporting this, but I'll leave it there.)

Guess which to problems mobilising the Drow outside of the Everdark solves? But nah, we'll just /trust Akua to handle it/.

Most Mighty apparently stay in the ruins of their civilisation, killing each other and their lessers. We have no knowledge that any Mighty haven't escaped. The threat isn't that one or two get out and sow havoc, the threat is that their civilisation as a whole can play catch up incredibly quick and become a danger on or above anything else on the surface. At which point Callow's in a hell of a lot of trouble if they slip their leash and start doing what Drow do. But Akua had some really great ideas on how to make this work, so it's all going to be fine. Right?
