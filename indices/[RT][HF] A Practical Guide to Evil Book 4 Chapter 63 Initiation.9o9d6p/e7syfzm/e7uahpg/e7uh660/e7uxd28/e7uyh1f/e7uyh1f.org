Her reasons for not trusting Black are that he manipulated her when they killed Akua (note that Cat would have lost terribly against Akua without Black's plan) and for destroying the array (which is a decision she later agreed with, if for different reasons, and she applied the same logic with the Crusade). Neither of these things hold up against /bringing a plauge of exponentially growing Drow into Callow and relying on Akua to prevent them killing everyone/.

Neither do most of Cat's other options.

The Drow, it has been made abundantly clear, aren't going to fall in line from Cat's strength alone. And even if they did, Cat can't be everywhere.

And even aside from all this, /trusting Akua to help write up the contract and manage death squads is a really bad idea/.

If a strategy doesn't work unless you're trusting Akua to make it work, then you have to question whether you should be implementing said strategy at all. You need to look at what the other options are again.
