Akua's competent enough that she's going to end up in charge of something, purely by necessity, and arguably having her in charge of the oath-bound force, whose essential loyalties aren't necessary is less dangerous than giving her some non-oath bound contingent which she might subvert. That's assuming she hasn't managed to sneak back doors into the oaths though.

The "genteel horror" line struck me as more in-group playful ribbing than genuine taunting the monster, although of course the fact that they have such a dynamic is cause for concern.

I think her large say in Cat's decisions is mostly a function of her being who Cat has that has any interest or experience with it. I can't see Archer caring what goes into the oaths. Adjutant easily gets this much delegation and responsibility, as does arguably Thief but they aren't here.
