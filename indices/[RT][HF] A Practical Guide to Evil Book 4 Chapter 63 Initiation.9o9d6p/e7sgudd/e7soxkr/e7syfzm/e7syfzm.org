So for all the talk that Akua is incredibly dangerous and someone that Cat needs to keep on a leash... Cat's doing a fairly terrible job of keeping Akua leashed.

I grabbed most of the times the Diabolist was mentioned in the last 2 chapters, and the picture painted is one of Akua getting what is effectively almost complete trust. Just look at all of this:

#+begin_quote
  That was one way to call the gathering throng of the desperate and the ambitious Akua was keeping an eye on.
#+end_quote

Akua's in charge of keeping an eye on the Drow.

#+begin_quote
   I said. “Ivah will stay with you. We're moving in on the Berelun camp after Akua's people pick up the bodies for an auction.”
#+end_quote

Akua has "people" now.

#+begin_quote
  I'd been inclined to just cut them loose, but Akua had talked me out of it. 
#+end_quote

I thought the policy was to avoid listening to Akua on general principle?

#+begin_quote
  Akua had been inclined to limit bidding rights to the dzulu so that a warrior class would be created quickly, but I'd been of a different opinion. 
#+end_quote

Akua gets a say in the policy of how Callow's soon to be main military force is formed.

#+begin_quote
  We'd crafted the system with our time constraints in mind.

  It'd been Diabolist's idea.
#+end_quote

She also gets to form the basis of said military. Hmmmm.

#+begin_quote
  shunting off the alienation into the others who drew on the stuff of my mantle -- Diabolist, as always
#+end_quote

Yep. This won't have horrible consequences.

......

#+begin_quote
  “One hundred and sixty years, subjected to the full breadth of lesser and greater oaths,” Akua said
#+end_quote

Leave the Diabolist to handle PR with the Drow. Somewhat innocuous, but there's concerns expressed later that Akua might gain too much influence amongst the Drow, so maybe try to limit her contact?

#+begin_quote
  I glanced at the shade and nodded. She'd helped me with both the ritual and the wording of the oaths, putting her extensive experience with diabolism to slightly more acceptable use.
#+end_quote

....Sure. let the Butcher of Liesse, master manipulator, and expert of fine print draft the oaths that will bind your main fighting force into place. No way that blows up on you.

#+begin_quote
  Her continued genteel horror was always good for a laugh.
#+end_quote

I mean, (a) mistreating your pet monster is a good way to ensure said pet gets free and kills you, according to story logic; and (b) this shows a pretty nonchalant attitude towards one of the most dangerous threats to team Woe.

#+begin_quote
  “Diabolist,” I evenly said. “Report.”

  She sat at my side without need for an invitation.
#+end_quote

Again, what happened to not trusting her on general principle? Not too long ago she wouldn't have been given this much slack and now Akua is being invited into Cat's planning more than her actual loyal teammates.

#+begin_quote
  I was disinclined to let Akua Sahelian head what would effectively be my equivalent of the Jacks down here, but I might not have another choice. 
#+end_quote

..... Sure Cat. Give the Diabolist a death squad. This is a great idea that will have no reprecussions.

#+begin_quote
  “I'll see if I can spare an ispe, but that's unlikely until Lotow,” 
#+end_quote

Literally two seconds ago you described how this was a bad idea and would let Akua "sink deeper hook into the rest of the Drow"!!!

#+begin_quote
  Keeping Diabolist useful without giving her too much power was ever a delicate balancing act.
#+end_quote

Self awareness = 0.

These two chapters alone she's arguably delegated more power and responsibility to Akua than any other single member of the World has been given.

Akua sits in on policy discussions and makes suggestions that Cat implements, and this coming right after a set of interludes talking about how the Woe don't get enough of a say in what they're doing

She gave the idea on how to bind and incredibly dangerous fighting force, and then was given permission to help implement said bindings.

She gets given tasks to undertake on her own, and will apparently soon receive her own death squad and powered-up lieutenant, even while Cat considers how this will let her solidify her hold over Callow's main fighting force.
