The way Cat is seemingly so oblivious to Ubua manipulating all of this, and the way she's basically calling the shots AND convincing Cat into things she disapproves of, makes me wonder if shunting Winter off to Diabolist is having some unintentional and unconscious effects. As Ubua gets more Wintery, perhaps she's able to more easily influence Cat? She's becoming more of the true Sovereign of Winter than Cat is.

Either way, I think we can all agree that the oaths were a good idea in theory and a terrible idea in practice, simply because she's letting Ubua run the show.

Also, I think we can all agree that Archer is hilarious.

Finally, in case anyone missed this in the comments:

  ATTN: ALL READERS

  Hey all,

  RL friend of ErraticErrata here. A few others and I were debating Guide characters recently, and it dawned on us that there is truly no other way of settling any debate than by the laws of Bellerophon, Peerless Jewel of Freedom.

  That's right -- we're organizing a PGTE Character Contest!

  Mostly because we're curious as to which characters The-People-Who-Can-Do-No-Wrong (that's you) prefer. Getting to hear your opinion of each character is valuable, so don't hesitate to share!

  Before you ask, we did manage to talk EE into letting us do this, and with only a minimal number of threats.

  -- The contest will start with next Monday's chapter (October 22).-- One match per chapter -- the link to the poll will be in EE's first comment in response to the chapter. We'll also publish it on PGTE's subreddit if you don't read any of the comments. Like the one you're reading right now. I'm helpful.-- It will be a series of head-to-head matches between 32 PGTE characters. Just vote for your favourite!

  We promise lies, violence, more lies, and even the clenching and unclenching of fists. Or maybe none of that and just a series of polls. We're still figuring it out.

  I'll publish the bracket on Wednesday, so stay tuned!
