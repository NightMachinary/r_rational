The closest thing to a GLARINGLY OBVIOUS PROBLEM is the insistent terminology on "Sovereign of the Moonless Nights" rather than "Catherine." But honestly that's so obvious that Cat had to have caught it, which I think indicates that either SOTMN is more essential to who she is than her name, it's more secure as an identifier, or she intends others to be able to bear that specific title.
