We've never actually seen anyone try to break an oath with a Fae before. And these drow are making oaths with cat's blood involved, I.e. winter. These oath breakers appear akin to the Peter Pettigrew style ones where the power they've borrowed turns on them when they break their oath to the source of the power.

In the stories, it seems like breaking an oath with a Fae doesn't necessarily have instant backlash and this makes sense when there are no slivers of power involved in every oath (say larat and cat's oath or even Ivah and Cat's first oath). Given the similarities between our stories and the guideverse, breaking an oath with a fairy usually gives them power over you, in the case of the drow, the slivers of power instantly kill their hosts.

I state this because I think the Pilgrim made his deal with the queen in callow and while this is not as serious as the greater oaths made with Winter, him absconding still falls on the spectrum of reneging on his deal. Which means Cat will not have absolute power over him, but the Pilgrim will be seriously nerfed in his next encounter with Cat.

Also, it seems odd that they can make oaths they don't understand. Are the accords and the meaning of the oaths explained properly to the drow? It reminds me of software TOS which might as well be in Crepescular for all I know. Given the nature of oaths, they can only be what the parties knowingly consent to. If anything, akua might have interfered with the oaths at the translation stage and the drow think they are making a different bargain
