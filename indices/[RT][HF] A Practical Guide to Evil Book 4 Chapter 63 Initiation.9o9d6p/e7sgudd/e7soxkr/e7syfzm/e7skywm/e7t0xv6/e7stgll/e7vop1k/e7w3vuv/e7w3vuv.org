  First off, you're assuming that the oaths binding drow to the SOMN instead of Catherine in particular is a bug instead of a feature. It isn't.
#+end_quote

To what, let Ubua use them when Cat is out? Or to later make SOMN a hereditary title that Cat could give to someone else? Those are about the only things I could think of here. Leaving Ubua a clear path to using the drow really seems like a bug to me, but maybe I am missing some amazing exploit that'd make it all worth it. I suppose we'll find out eventually, so no reason for you to spoiler your own story.

  Second, you're assuming that a precaution as basic as an identity check wouldn't be taken before people are allowed to bid.
#+end_quote

Bah. You make such checks at every point you can, assuming it costs you nothing, like here. No reason to leave holes for enemies to exploit.

  Third, your entire argument about rules being amended in the future is essentially irrelevant since they're bound to take her orders regardless, something already ensured by oath.
#+end_quote

And if she orders them to do something contrary to one of the oaths they just gave? Like, burn down a house in Callow, or some such. I am assuming that "pursuit of its laws" refers to actually legaly passed laws, and not just whatever whim Cat has at the moment, so presumably that'd go contrary to the oath? Sure seems like having a way to lift an oath would be nice. Long-term orders probably work as a substitute for additions to the original oath, though I feel like "order" is lower priority than an "oath".

  Fourth, your hypothetical with Masego is absurd since several things you describe - punching old ladies, messing with private property - would be illegal, and so covered by the last part of the same oath you quoted.
#+end_quote

Eh, that is fair. The idea I was getting at with the hypothetical was that someone could feasibly be doing something you don't want them doing which is nonetheless legal. How about a better hypothetical?

Say there is a Hero with mindrape-like powers a-la Speaking. You know he planted suggestions in the mind of one of your subjects in some location, but you do not know who the plant is. Plant himself is honestly unaware of being a double agent, because suggestions are subtle and aren't activated yet, so they can't even be said to be comitting treason. Suggestion is to do something perfectly legal like (e.g. light a fireplace at home at 19 hours, drink a cup of water at 8 am, eat a chicken for dinner, whatever), so even when it activates they would not be violating any laws. However, this legal action would be helping the hero in some way, perhaps by letting them activate a ritual. Now, what you /want/ is to leave an agent on the scene with an order like "look around, find out who the plant is, and then prevent them from doing whatever it is they were supposed to be doing" (we can postulate that suggestion is detectable once it activates, their eyes light up or something). However, the plant is a citizen, they won't be violating any laws, and you can't even say "lighting fireplaces at 19 o clock is illegal for the next week" because you don't know any details about what it is they have to do. So, how do you give an order here?
