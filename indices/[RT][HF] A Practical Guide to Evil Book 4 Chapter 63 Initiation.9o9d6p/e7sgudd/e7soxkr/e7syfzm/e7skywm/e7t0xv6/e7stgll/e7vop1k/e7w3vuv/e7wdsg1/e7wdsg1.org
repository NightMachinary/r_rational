  And if she orders them to do something contrary to one of the oaths they just gave? Like, burn down a house in Callow, or some such. I am assuming that "pursuit of its laws" refers to actually legaly passed laws, and not just whatever whim Cat has at the moment, so presumably that'd go contrary to the oath? Sure seems like having a way to lift an oath would be nice. Long-term orders probably work as a substitute for additions to the original oath, though I feel like "order" is lower priority than an "oath".

Callow's not a democracy, as the ruling queen Catherine can pass a royal decree and pretty much remedy that instantly. And the trade of Night-for-oaths would be much less attractive if additional oaths could be added at any time - that would, rightly, be seen as extremely easy to exploit. It's one thing to make those oaths if they're a known quantity, another if Catherine can add another at a whim. What would prevent her from just enslaving them if she felt like it? Orders for a limited timespan are much more agreeable, and for the long-term issues she has her greater oaths.

As for your last paragraph, why would she use the drow specifically in that situation? It's not like she wouldn't have other options. The oath-takers don't have to be the perfect tool for every context, just the ones she wants to use them in. Besides, even in your theoretical the order could simply be 'subdue the hero-touched plant when you see the sign'. Which assuming the hero meant to do Callow harm by using the citizen as a pawn, wouldn't break the oath as they'd be breaking the laws by cooperating, however unwillingly, with a plot against Callow.
