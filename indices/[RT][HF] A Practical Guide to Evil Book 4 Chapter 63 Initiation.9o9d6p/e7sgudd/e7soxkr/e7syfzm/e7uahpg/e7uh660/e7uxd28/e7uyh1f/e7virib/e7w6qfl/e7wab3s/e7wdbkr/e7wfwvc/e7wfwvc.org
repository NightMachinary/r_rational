Rather important details in my opinion.

If we do not know the shape of the growth of the Night, then we cannot claim to know the consequences of it.

In any case, I feel that you are willfully ignoring what Ivah told Cat in the last chapter.\\
It has reached a point where it must seek ever bigger concentrations of Night, if it is to meaningfully grow in power.

We also know, that even though, Ivah and their warband, sought to add to the Night, they did not do so as powerful drow. Which carries implications as to how much is added with any given kill.

If the amount could follow an exponential growth, one would think that the stronger drow would have organized raids, to exploit this, and return home to claim a superior position.

Yet, we have not heard of this.\\
It is true that they have been boxed in by other powers, but Cat mentions that the rare raiding party has been observed, yet they aren't a threat.

From this I would conclude that the amount added is only worth considering if one has very little.

For though their empire is a ruin, a dark age does not stop people from following their own incentives. I would even say that that was why their empire fell.

You reference those sections to make your point, but miss alternative explanations.\\
We have too little information to go on, and ought to wait for more.

Ps. Sorry for the rambling structure, gotta get some sleep.
