You still haven't said anything that I didn't already know. Of course Akua is a threat, and of course the Drows are a threat. But are they a bigger threat than the alternatives? That's the issue here. Are they worse than the Wildhunts, whom Cat expects to betray her with very high certainty? Or the High Lords? Or the Faes nobles again?
