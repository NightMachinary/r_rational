Again, we've been told what the Night is and how they can aquire it. Do you dispute these explanations, the only one's we've been given on how the Night works?

If all the Drow can reach the point of Ivah before diminishing returns set in, then shit, I don't know what to tell you. Sounds like a victory condition to me. And much of the danger is in /lateral/ growth. rounding out skills and powers and backing it up with superhuman physiques.

And the Drow are ineffective for two main reasons that we know of. One is that they're located in what must be one of the shittiest pieces of real estates out there:

  The only people who knew their locations for sure were the drow who still used them, sending roving bands of raiders and slavers to the surface.

  Those enterprising souls were not known for having a lot of success in those depredations. Ages ago, before the Golden Bloom had been seized by the elves, the now-broken kingdom of the Deoraithe had occasionally been troubled by them. Now, though? The surface paths led them into three dead ends: the Kingdom of the Dead, the Golden Bloom and the Chain of Hunger. None of these were known to be welcoming locales to outsiders. Once every few decades it was said a cunning and careful warband managed to slip through dwarven tunnels or other secret paths to reach northern Procer -- or much more rarely, northern Callow -- but even fewer of those who made it there succeeding at returning home.

They get one chance every few decades to sneak out into the world - not a whole lot of oppurtinty to showcase there. And the one's heading out are the dregs of society, who are going to have a hard time getting the ball rolling, this is because of Reason Two:

On a societal level, they're turned endlessly inwards, because that's how Sve has built the society. the actual movers and shakers, the one's who could start the ball rolling, spend their time murdering each other and treating their lessers like Cattle. Remeber, Ivah and co. were sent out into the Burning Lands only after they have lost power.

  “None of us are drow, Lately Queen,” it said. “Had we returned in glory, perhaps once more, but this is disgrace heaped upon disgrace.”

  .....

  “That lot outside is bottom-feeders, Diabolist,” I murmured. “And still they were capable of a trick most Named wouldn't sneer at. There's something wrong here. If their lower ranks are this strong there's no way they'd be a ruin of an empire as they supposedly are.” “Unless,” Akua said calmly, “that very power is the cause of ruin.”

  My brow rose. That was possible, yes. Were they all fighting of this Night so ferociously they'd broken their own realm?

So there's not much opportunity to collect power, and no-one in a position to do it. Notably, turning them into an army and putting them on Callow fixes these issues.

All that said, we do know that some Drow sent out into the world become Mighty - going out and killing non-Drow works. That's what was going on with Ivah's band when we first met them. They'd been sent out into the Burning Land with an opportunity to rise up from nothing and gain power. That they failed doesn't mean it's an impossibility, but that they tried means they think it can work. And everything since then points in the same direction.

The Drow's civilisation is set to play catch up incredibly quick. Let's be generous and say that they stop growing when they reach the level of the other players, so instead of a race of superhumans who steadily grow more and more omnicompetent, you /just/ have a power on par with Procer or Callow or what have you. Does that seem reasonable?

It's still a gigantic issue, because it's still /the Drow/ held back by /Akua/. Loyalty is not a thing in either of these two. If this is Callow's military power, then Callow is going to destroyed sooner or later..
