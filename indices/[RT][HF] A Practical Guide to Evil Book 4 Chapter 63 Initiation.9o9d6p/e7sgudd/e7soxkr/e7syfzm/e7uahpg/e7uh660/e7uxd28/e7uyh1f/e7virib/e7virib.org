I think you're wrong about the Drow's growth rate and thus their possible long term threat, unless by "exponential growth" you mean that all population growth is naturally exponential, which would apply equally to say, Callowan cows.

Within the Drow, killing for Night is zero-sum, the group as a whole loses nothing but neither does it gain. Even if the Drow can learn via Night by killing non-Drow, the Secrets they learn will likely not involve any higher-level Night tricks, it'll be stuff like "literacy" and maybe "pike-holding." Not to be underestimated of course, but these are skills large fractions of the non-Drow population already possess. And a Secret is only useful to learn once. You can't kill two peasants to learn "double literacy," which means that Drow's power growth should asymptotically approach some fixed value rather than blowing up.
