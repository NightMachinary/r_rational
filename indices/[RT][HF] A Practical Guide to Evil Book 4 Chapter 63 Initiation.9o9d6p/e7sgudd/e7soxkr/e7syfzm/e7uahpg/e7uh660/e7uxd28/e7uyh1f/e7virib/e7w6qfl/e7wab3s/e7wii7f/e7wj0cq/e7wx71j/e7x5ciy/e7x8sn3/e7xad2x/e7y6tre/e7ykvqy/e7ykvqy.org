The short answer is yes, there are other options that Cat should be looking at, for a bunch of reasons I've listed earlier on. A big one is this - Cat wants this army as a hedge against uncertainty. If having the army (and having Akua play a big role with the army) introduces more uncertainty than it solves, you have to question whether it's serving it's purpose. Bare minimum, you have to look at other ways of going about going things.

I also gave a non-exhaustive list alternatives at every level of decision making further up in this very comment chain, and you've ignored or forgotten the most viable of them. Feel free to scroll back up and look at them again, if you want - I'm not going to type them out again.
