I'd actually missed that WOG, thanks for pointing it out. But even taking out that specific example...

We know that Akua's extraordinarily good with legalese - on account of being Praesi and the Diabolist - and that Cat is quite inexperienced- to the point that she thought Akua might be needed to help her (remember, we've seen Cat's skillset, and a lawyer she is not).

Akua's relative advantage in manipulation and loophoes is something that's been emphasised to us.

In general I think that Akua's expertise is something better off treated as a threat rather than an opportunity when it comes to such important things as securing the military force of Callow - I can't imagine any would be overly surprised if it turned out /Akua *did/ poison this proverbial well - and that relaxing the general policy of don't-trust-Akua to the point of letting her help invent and execute policies is an issue when she's set to inevitably betray Cat based on her history, personality, and story role.

Certainly here are issues with giving her powerful seconds that she requested in order to exert more control over the faction she just helped write up oaths for, or death squads to command with a degree of autonomy.

As to adding to the Night - the mechanics of that have been described to us. Even if we say that no Night is added to during service to Cat, an incredibly bold claim, it's still a looming threat if the monstrous slave army rebels. But that never happens in stories, right? Especially when they've been secured with the help of a treacherous underling?
