What I mean by "exponential" is how the Drow can leverage murder into learning stronger and stronger Secrets. Kill a master swordsman, and they've got a stronger chance of killing. mage. Kill a mage, and they've got a better chance of killing a weaker named (which, presumably, is where things like "the Secret of Many lives comes from). Etc.

Amongst the Drow killing is zero-sum, and that's one of the main things holding them back. Their restricted access to fresh blood - boxed in by the elves, the ratlings, the dead and the dwarves- is a large part of why they've both stagnated as a society and as a threat level. Let them out into the rest of the continent and that changes.

And there's no question as to whether a Drow can learn Secrets from non-Drow. That was one of the first things we learnt:

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

Also, killing multiple peasants /is/ a good thing - it lets Drow more thoroughly master a skill, depending on what aspects their victim was good at (shitty example - where one swordsman might be good at offence, another might be specialised in defence):

#+begin_quote
  “Spear and blade and bow,” Ivah said. “Dimas harvested many, to learn them whole. It was great accomplishment.”
#+end_quote

Which is fairly terrifying, actually. They don't even need to kill a master swordsman or what-have-you to get the ball rowing. Armies of low-to-moderately skilled peasants is enough, as long as those peasants aren't /uniformly/ skilled (which people, as a rule, aren't).
