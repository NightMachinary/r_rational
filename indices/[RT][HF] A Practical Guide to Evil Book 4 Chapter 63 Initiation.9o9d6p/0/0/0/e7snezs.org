I'm thinking that's exactly why the full oaths is to the Sovereign and not to Cat. Back when Akua was controlling Cat's body, she was subject to all the oaths that Cat swore to. Conversely this means that as long as she controls the construct, she is Cat for purposes of oaths to "I". Given that the Sovereign is the full mantle itself and not the construct, I'm thinking that it works differently for oaths to the Sovereign.
