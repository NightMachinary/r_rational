I don't think the shards have much of an effect on her power. I don't think she actually needs to use shards of winter anyway since Oaths, in general on Calernia, work for everyone. Just one of those magically laws. The titles actually increase her power since it increases the size of her court. Unfortunately this is exactly the direction the Dead King wants her to go and, until recently, the opposite direction she wanted to head.
