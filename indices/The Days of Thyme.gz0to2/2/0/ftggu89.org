Its not a sequel. /Sins/ is paused, /Thyme/ will for now be used for worldbuilding and later /Sins/ is supposed to finish. Its not clear wether these two are concurrent in-world or not.

/Sins/ starts out with a bit of progressive sex stuff but later these parts take a really small role over the whole awesome dungeon fighting.
