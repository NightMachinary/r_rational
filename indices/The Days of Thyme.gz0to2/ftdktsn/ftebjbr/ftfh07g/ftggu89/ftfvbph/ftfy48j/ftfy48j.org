Just to be clear, I meant angst in its actual definition, not as a colloquial synonym for edgy teen stuff or doom n gloom. But specifically, it's the philosophy of sex masqueraded as litRPG. It's just weird and anxiety-inducing for me. I still read it but it's something I have to be in the mood for.
