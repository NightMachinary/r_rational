One explanation: The "modern" magical community contains state-sponsored education, so every modern witch and wizard knows enough to defend themselves from an angry mob of Muggles. This, however, was not always the case: For a long time, magic was something you figured out on your own or from a single knowledgable master. Because HP magic is basically "know a word", most people would live and die with just enough knowledge to be dangerous, but not enough to evade a clever, focused organization of Muggles. In that case, it's in everyone's best interests to maintain a masquerade and collect knowledge. Over the timescales involved, this becomes tradition, and precisely /because/ of the force a magical authority can bring to bear, violating said tradition is much more costly than just going with it.

Not rational, but humans really aren't at times.
