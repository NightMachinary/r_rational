Well I sort of based my thought on the decree Voldemort got passed in Deathly Hallows, making attendance compulsory for everyone that was eligible. Why would he bother passing that if only a few people didn't attend normally?

Also I was thinking more along the lines of Muggleborns - I mean, /I/ wouldn't be in a hurry to send my kid off to a school I can't even see. Plus even among purebloods it's not really taken for granted that one would receive a Hogwarts letter - my memory is fuzzy but I think Neville was rather relieved when he got his.
