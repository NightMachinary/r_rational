He probably did it because of the small size of the wizarding world in Britain. Assuming that about 300 people attend Hogwarts, the total population is between 3000-6000 depending on other factors. Just a few families would be enough to be a serious challenge to him.

Neville was relieved to show accidental magic. He was under the impression that he was a squib, and the accidental magic proved that he was not. Getting his letter proved to others that he was not a squib either.

As for muggleborns, we are never shown what happens when they refuse a Hogwarts letter. There are some fanfictions in which "magic is bound" but canonically speaking this is impossible. So there are three options: some other kind of school, memory erasure or being legally forced to attend Hogwarts.
