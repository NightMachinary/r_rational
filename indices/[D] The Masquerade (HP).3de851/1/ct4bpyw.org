Reasons to keep separate ... there aren't many. A muggle isn't a threat to a wizard of any skill, given the spells they have available. My normal assumption with the Masquerade is that it's defensive in nature, but in the Harry Potter world, that's just not the case. They're no risk of a muggle sneaking into a wizard's house at night and killing them. Wizards don't have to worry about muggles using poisons either. Wizards can literally make a charm so that muggles don't notice them, never mind having to have defensive measures. Wizards can just teleport away if there's any threat, or destroy the muggle in any number of ways (including assuming direct control, modifying their memories, etc.).

So to make it work, we need to assume that wizards aren't spending that much in the way of keeping the Masquerade going. That means that they can have more marginal reasons for the separation. Maybe wizards just don't have any use for muggles; muggles can't really do anything that magic can't do better, cheaper, and faster. Walling off the magical world from the mundane one is just the most efficient way of not having to deal with muggles.

As for how they'd do it, the muggles are going to do most of the work for them. If a muggle sees a man running through the streets with a sword, the first thought is something along the lines of cosplay, prank, etc. If a muggle sees a man disappear into thin air, they're usually going to think it was a trick of the light, and most of them aren't going to /tell/ anyone (and if they do, the person they tell isn't going to believe them). So conformity and biases do 90% of the work. Anti-muggle fields cover another 5%. Wizards don't often interact with muggle society anyway, so there's not that much to cover up. But when there /is/ something to cover up, that's where the Ministry sends someone in to modify some memories.
