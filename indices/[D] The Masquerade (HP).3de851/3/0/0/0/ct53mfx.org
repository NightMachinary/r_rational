Needing a smaller amount of things is pointless unless they actually use a smaller amount of things. There were characters that were portrayed as wealthy, and characters that were portrayed as poor. This would be impossible in a post-scarcity society.

As for how much better at making things they are, that's completely irrelevant. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage][Comparative advantage]] is everything. How much bigger is the word economy than what you personally produce? Yet you trade with them constantly.

For a concrete example, there are 17 Sickles in a Galleon, but muggles currently value gold about 76 times as much as silver. You could make a lot of money by trading silver to wizards for gold and trading the gold to muggles back for silver.
