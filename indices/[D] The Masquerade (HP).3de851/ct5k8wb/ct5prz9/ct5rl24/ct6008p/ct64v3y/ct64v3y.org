Well, you could see "magic" as a sort of wave/energy similar to nuclear energy, which interferes with/cancels out much of the electromagnetic spectrum. So yeah, the more delicate electronics and appliances would be left completely out of whack if introduced into a magical field. I mean, you don't even need energy on the scale of an atomic bomb/nuclear power plant (though in magical terms Hogwarts may actually generate that much) - strong AC magnetic fields are enough to completely wipe a hard drive, and a mere power surge can leave many devices unusable.

In that context, those "cherry-picked" technologies make quite a lot of sense. Traditional steam locomotives have very few parts heavily reliant on a carefully-controlled stream of electrical energy, and so are safer for a train that runs between places with high concentrations of magic (and likely has several powerful spells placed on it, to escape Muggle notice). In addition, magic itself can substitute for those parts that would have to go. I think the same is true of Wizarding radio - it probably doesn't use radio waves but rather transmits information via some point on the magical energy spectrum (Harry and co. don't pick up any Muggle stations with the wizarding wireless set, and if their radio stations used the radio spectrum Muggle equipment would have picked them up at some point, what with satellites and all).

I really don't see the problem with having newspapers (movable-type printing has been around since the eleventh century, and printing presses since the 15th - neither have anything to do with electronics). Black and white photography is similarly a non-issue, since visible light is more or less immune to everything else on the electromagnetic spectrum and passive magical fields have no demonstrated effect on vision. All photography really does is "trap" or record the reflected light from an object - something a dark box with a pinhole can do, so there's nothing particularly fancy about it. Given that the photographs and portraits literally move around and have personalities, I think it's safe to say that like their radios, magical cameras have very little to do with cameras as we know them anyway.
