  In addition, magic itself can substitute for those parts that would have to go. I think the same is true of Wizarding radio - it probably doesn't use radio waves but rather transmits information via some point on the magical energy spectrum

That's the whole point. Magic can emulate or adapt electronics or other technologies, but only in those specific places where the author wants it. So you can have wizarding wireless stations, but no wizarding walkie talkies, for example (Sirius has that mirror, but it's treated as an unique artifact, and even it is shoved aside as to not interfere with the plot). And no wizarding bugging devices (if I remember correctly, this whole point about magic as EMP was brought up to remove electronic bugs from the consideration). Photography, newspapers? Sure, no electronics in those. Pens, pencils, paper? Nope, too boring (although the author treats parchment as if it was paper, I've read that parchment is supposed to be different, e.g. you can't easily tear or crumble it).
