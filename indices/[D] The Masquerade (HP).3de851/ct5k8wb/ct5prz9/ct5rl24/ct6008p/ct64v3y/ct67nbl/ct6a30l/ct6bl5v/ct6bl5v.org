  Also why do you think the mirror is treated as a unique artifact? Sirius most certainly didn't create it and Aberforth knew at once what it was.

Because Sirus talks about it like it was a one-of thing the Marauders had, like the map? And because we don't see others like that? HPMOR addresses this, but we're talking about canon.

  And what do you mean, wizards don't have bugging devices? Did you miss the part where Voldemort was able to place a Taboo on his name throughout Britain, and Harry and co. could be located within seconds of saying it?

Okay, you have a point here, the Ministry seems to have a means of magical surveillance that would've made NSA proud. There's no mention of more targeted surveillance (except Harry's visions), but I suppose you can cover it with our heroes' ignorance.

  And ballpoint/fountain pens were developed because quills were just not efficient (for Muggles, that is). Again, why would a society that has voice-to-text and autocorrecting quills need to update to anything else?

Sure, they have enchanted quills that are better than ordinary pens, but students and professors mostly scribble with ordinary quills. Enchanted quills appear as rare novelties, and the first time it's treated in a malevolent light (Rita's "slander" quill). I would have no problem with this if at least self-inking enchantment was shown to be standard, than you can say that it's just an elaborate form-factor for a fountain pen, and it's okay. But as it's stands it's just stupidity for the sake of "atmosphere".

Anyway, my point is this. Sure, you can cover absence of any specific technology with "we have a spell for that" with varying degrees of stretching. But why is that they "have a spell for that" for one thing, but mimic Muggle technology (at least on the surface) for another closely related thing? That's what I call cherry picking. You take tech that you like and put it into your story. Why not other tech? Oh, it's magic, it interferes with technology. Why not with this technology, then? Oh, it's magical analogs. Why not magical analogs for other things, then? Oh, they have spells for that.
