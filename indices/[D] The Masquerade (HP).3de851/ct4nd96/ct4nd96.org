I think the canon HP explanation is that Muggles have nothing to /offer/ wizards - well, they didn't; there are one or two bits of modern technology that are mildly interesting. On the other hand, wizards have a ton to offer Muggles; so they'd be constantly /trying/ to trade, or take help by force, which is fairly annoying.

The analogy of the Third World comes to mind, I guess, or maybe vagrancy laws. People begging for help all the time, when we don't want to provide it, just /get in the way/.

(And, from a slightly altruistic perspective, the inexplicable inequality /was/ messing up Muggle society.)
