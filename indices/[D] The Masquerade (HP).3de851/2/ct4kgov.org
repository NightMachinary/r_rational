Canon HP notes that witch burning was ineffective since the magic user would cast a flamefreezing charm then pretend to burn. Secrecy is held in place largely through memory charms and faking explanations for things too big to cover up (for example, dragons eating wilderness hikers or Pettigrew blowing a dozen people by puncturing a gas pipe).

HPMoR gives plenty of reasons why a fully developed wizard should not be afraid of muggles as they should be of other wizards, namely the ability to apparate out of danger and Avada Kadavra if necessary. However, muggles do have threats that should make wizards wary, such as sniper rifles and explosions, i.e. anything that does not allow the wizard time to react to the threat.

So a rational magical community would have probably been working on protection from firearms for the past 400 years. I would imagine shields a la /Dune/ stopping any projectiles at lethal speeds. Fred and George made shield hats in book 6, so it's possible to enchant clothing and other wearable objects with some (semi-)permanent protective charm.

So I would say given mostly rational actors, it's really up to the wizards whether or not implement the statute of secrecy. And if they do choose to create a masquerade, it's not for their own safety. The reason Hagrid advances (in book 1) is that muggles would hassle wizards to help them, but that doesn't hold water as there are magical spells designed to distract muggles or hide wizards from interference.

I believe the reason JKR gives for the statute of secrecy is that the wizarding world didn't want wizards interfering with muggles, treating them as subhuman (subwizard?) or animals. The backstory is that the Malfoys made their fortune pre-statute through mutually beneficial arrangements with royalty and nobles of the time. Then after statute, they switched to advocating pureblood ideology (which is supposed to preserve their advantages of wealth and power for reasons I have forgotten), looking down at interactions with muggles or at most using them as an exploitable resource.
