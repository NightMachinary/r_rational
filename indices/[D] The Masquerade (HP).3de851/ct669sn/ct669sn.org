Yes, there are historical reasons.

One, not every witch or wizard attends Hogwarts even in the present day. So not everyone knows the spells and charms we take for granted in canon, even now. I imagine this would be even worse in a time with a high illiteracy rate; at least homeschooled magical folk today can buy the books and study them.

Two, not every witch or wizard is as powerful as the ones we're used to. Harry has almost prodigious levels of raw talent/power - he can cast a fully corporeal Patronus capable of driving off almost a hundred Dementors at thirteen. The staff at Hogwarts can be assumed to be at the very top of their field, with evidence - Snape was inventing spells and improving potions while still a teenager himself, McGonagall has performed some incredible transfigurations and is an Animagus, Dumbledore is Dumbledore, etc. Hermione studies everything within reach. And so on, and so forth - but there are weaker, stupider, less talented people around. Just look at Crabbe and Goyle. Or even Harry's constant struggle with Transfiguration.

Three, magical folk depend heavily on their wands and there has only recently been reform in wand production (by the current Ollivander). Prior to his strict adherence to dragon heartstring, phoenix feather and unicorn hair, people used whatever magical item they could come across. Those items made for weaker wands. Also, Ollivander is the one who went all anal-retentive on their asses about the wand choosing the wizard; even in the present day some families still pass on wands to children that may not be suited for them (see Ron getting Charlie's wand, for instance). Speaking of Ron, wands themselves are quite fragile. They're, well, sticks. And they can be snapped. As has been shown, a broken wand is potentially disastrous for its owner. The long and short of it is that witches and wizards have been walking around with weak, temperamental wands for centuries (it's also worth noting that wands aren't suited to every kind of spellwork).

Four, some magic is just not accessible to everyone. Not everyone can Apparate without splinching. Not everyone has the focus and intent to successfully cast an Unforgivable. Not everyone can master nonverbal and/or wandless magic, or even learn enough of it to be significantly useful in a fight. Speaking of fights, not everyone has the physical reflexes to duel successfully - some people just have slow reaction times. Et cetera.

In conclusion, while the characters we see in the books would likely be able to get themselves out of any Muggle-related scrape, there is a [significant] portion of the wizarding population that's still very vulnerable to Muggle attack. In fact, most characters in the books would be helpless (magically-wise) if they were by chance caught without their wands, and as a Muggle myself I daresay we're intelligent enough to figure out that we do /not/ go for the magic guys when they have their super sticks in hand. Also there's the fact that betrayal does not always come in the hands of a raging lynch mob.

There is also the fact that wizarding society simply might not want to involve itself with Muggle politics, which would contribute to the sustenance of the masquerade. I mean, if they broke the International Statute of Secrecy now and came out like "Hi guys, we exist" they wouldn't run into serious persecution since we're mostly so chill about that sort of thing now. But holy cow would militaries everywhere bust a collective nut at the thought of that kind of power. They'd be forced to cooperate (and likely be dissected, experimented on and more or less treated like lab rats) or enter into a war they can't sustain. Never mind the inexorable shifting of the power balance: four hundred years ago magical folk might have been in the top class of society when it came to knowledge and effective influence, but man have those tables turned.
