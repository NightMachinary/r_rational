Yes, it's squibs I was thinking of. Squib seems to be a highly relative term, just like special needs children fall in a vast spectrum. Filch for instance seems capable of /some/ magic to be able to see/work in Hogwarts. And apart from Nagini, the basilisk and maybe Fawkes, Mrs Norris is the only creature in the series I'd refer to as a /familiar/. But I doubt Filch got a letter...

Plus there are children like Ariana, whom I doubt would ever have gotten a Hogwarts letter though she clearly was capable of magic. Or even Lupin (and by extension the other kids Fenrir Greyback must have Turned, and possibly even Greyback himself) - it's heavily implied that Dumbledore accepting Lupin was an unprecedented thing. The risks of having a lycanthrope at a school can possibly be extended to kids with other highly contagious/transmittable magical diseases, and that's not counting the fact that some parents would prefer to keep a sickly child close rather than send them away for ten months of the year.

Also, so many parents keep threatening to pull their kids out of Hogwarts, and there's no indication the other schools would just randomly accept a influx of non-first year students. Even Molly threatens Ron with withdrawal at one point (though she /was/ angry as all hell) and the Weasleys definitely can't afford to send a kid overseas for school. Plus there are extenuating circumstances (i.e. the return of the paranoid,. histrionic psychopath of doom) but several kids actually leave Hogwarts in the latter books when their parents/family are killed. There's also the famous and mysterious disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks. So it doesn't seem that attendance at Hogwarts is compulsory even after enrolling.

Which brings us to Muggleborns and Voldemort's decree. I personally think he had it issued to make sure the Death Eaters could snap up /all/ the young Muggleborns (Harry even reflects on the poor eleven-year-olds heading to torture and death instead of the magical education they were promised). But having the decree issued and presumably magically enforced is only logical if there are enough normally non-attending Muggleborns that it would be easier to gather them in one place than to pick them off in their homes at leisure. And the very fact that a decree had to be issued indicates that yes, canonically you [normally] can't force anyone to attend. Even memory erasure doesn't remove the Muggleborn's magic, which would presumably continue to act up like Harry's did until they met with a lynch mob, a fanatical sect, or, worst of all - the YouTube comment section.
