Canonically, there is an innate power difference between various wizards - some wizards are stronger than others. But when it comes to squibs, it seems that there is not:

"...Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he [Minister Fudge] added, looking left and right along the bench where he sat. “Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly. (from Book 5, The Hearing)

From this piece of evidence, it seems that squibs are not the same as muggles. They are simply those who can see and hear magical things but are incapable of actually doing any magic. So there is no reason to expect that there are degrees of squibs. It would appear from the text elsewhere that there is a significant difference between the weakest wizard and a squib. (I admit that such seemings are not explicitly stated, but the issue itself is not directly addressed anyway.)

Ariana and werewolf children are good examples of kids with magic that do not attend Hogwarts. But I would expect that the number of such children in a population of 3000-6000 is quite low.

It is possible, of course, that there are large populations of muggleborns that do not attend Hogwarts. But since wizardry is genetically inherited, that seems unlikely. I will admit that it is possible though.

Your argument against compulsory schooling seems compelling. The point against memory erasure seems good as well. (Remember that Tom Riddle was able to control his "accidental" magic. So even if their memory were erased, they might be able to demonstrate it later and break the statute of secrecy.)

The final possibility, that Hogwarts letters appear only to some, seems to have problems though. If I have actual accidental magic, but receive no Hogwarts letter, then why wouldn't I try to use the magic I have in the muggle world. If the statute is such a problem, then I would probably arrange to permanently break it. (That is completely truthful too, if I had magical powers and the locals refused to teach me, then I would break whatever prevented that.)

All of that said, I do not think that Hogwarts actually excludes anyone (canonically). Not only did Rowling say that they gave letters to all magicals within their territory, but the books imply that as well. The problems with muggleborn parents are both a separate issue and an unaddressed issue.
