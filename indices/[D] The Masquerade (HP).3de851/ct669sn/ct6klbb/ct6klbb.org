A minor point here. According to canon, almost everyone did attend Hogwarts. So although there were some homeschoolers, they were very rare. (I think Rowling did this to mirror the muggle situation in Britain.)

I think that your other points are worth noting though. You also provide a good reason for the magical world to remain secret.
