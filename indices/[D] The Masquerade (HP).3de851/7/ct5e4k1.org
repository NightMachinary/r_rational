I think it is rational to be cautious of angry mobs, given human nature. Also, I think the human nature to form angry mobs is, on some level, adaptive for one's selfish gain, though usually not moral nor optimal.

Take a small village, populated by mostly rational, mostly selfish people. One of them has magic, and hence has more power than the rest. Given said magician is a selfish human, all the others have reason to fear him. Thus, the mob activity can often be "rational".
