See, the problem is that you're expecting magical versions of tech to be 1-to-1 the same as their Muggle counterparts. Technology doesn't develop in a vacuum; it develops according to need.

So yes, you can have wizarding wireless stations because much like our radio, it's a low-cost highly effective way of disseminating information to a large group at once. But why would walkie-talkies /specifically/ be developed when Protean Charms and the like have existed for centuries? Also why do you think the mirror is treated as a unique artifact? Sirius most certainly didn't create it and Aberforth knew at once what it was. All this is leaving out the fact that our protagonist is in school and knows nothing about 95% of the wizarding world, and we only see what he sees.

And what do you mean, wizards don't have bugging devices? Did you miss the part where Voldemort was able to place a Taboo on his name throughout Britain, and Harry and co. could be located within seconds of saying it? Oh I see, you're expecting a physical device. Which brings me back to the point about technology and need - why would a society that can eavesdrop, track, etc with a wave of a wand develop bugging devices that can malfunction/be found/be destroyed? Never mind the fact that Rita Skeeter /was/ bugging her, in a manner of speaking.

And ballpoint/fountain pens were developed because quills were just not efficient (for Muggles, that is). Again, why would a society that has voice-to-text and autocorrecting quills need to update to anything else? And for the record, there are many types of parchment. Paper parchment is, well, paper. It's made of wood pulp, just like regular paper. Even animal parchment will tear and crease and revert to just skin if you don't handle it properly (and I can't recall any instances of parchment not behaving like parchment in the books, do you have any specific instances?). Though magic would likely bypass said flaws, again eliminating the need to develop paper.

It's important to bear in mind that the wizarding world completely withdrew from the Muggle at the tail end of the seventeenth century, so you need to actively justify the presence of anything developed after that time. Take the pen/quill point for instance - quills were still in popular use well into the eighteenth and possibly early nineteenth centuries (the U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed with quills, for instance), so why would the pen as we know it have crossed over into a society that had even better quills than we did?

Now Rowling necessarily thought of all of this in these terms when she sat down to write Philosopher's Stone. But it does fit into the narrative she created, so there /is/ a possibility that she did. Beyond that, at the very least the books can be fitted around a more or less sound logical frame, technology-wise.
