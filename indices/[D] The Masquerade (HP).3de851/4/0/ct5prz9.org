Oddly enough, there is no particular explanation given for why electronics do not work in high magic areas. (Note that mere magic is not enough, high magic areas are required.) My speculation is that the problem with electronics is not a necessary consequence of high magic use, but an unintended consequence of the particular spells used in "high magic areas".
