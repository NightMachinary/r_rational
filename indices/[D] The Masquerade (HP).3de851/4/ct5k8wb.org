It seems that for most of human history, wizards did not maintain a separation or a masquerade. We have innumerable historical accounts of magicians, witches, holy men, etc doing magical things. It's only been in the past 100-200 years that these have disappeared. So the real question is: What Changed Recently?

An important clue: high-tech stuff doesn't work around wizards. Harry had to rely on a fancy mechanical watch. It seems like most things that involve electricity, and certainly anything that involves circuitry, just shuts down entirely. How much of our world nowadays depends on high-tech gadgets? People with pacemakers depend on them for life. Everyone I know carries around a supercomputer in their pocket. The entire modern economy would grind to a halt without modern computers. I recall hearing a tech expert at a convention relating how in the late 70s (early 80s?) he was arguing Moore's Law with someone and he said "That's all well and good, but what the hell would anyone do with computer chips that small and cheap? Put them in our door knobs?" He then pulled out the keycard to his hotel room and said "Turns out, we did just that."

Wizards may have removed themselves from society as technology got going as a /favor/ to the muggles, so they could continue to progress and raise themselves higher. Perhaps even at the request of, or in cooperation with, the muggle authorities. Much like The Matrix, The Masquerade may be a fundamentally Friendly action.
