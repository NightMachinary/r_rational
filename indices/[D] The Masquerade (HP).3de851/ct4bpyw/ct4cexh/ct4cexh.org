The explanation I am most familiar with, is that while a Trained wizard is immune to muggle violence, children are not. Consider a muggle born magical child in 14th century England. Accidental magic is viewed as consorting with demons, and the child is burned at the stake before they are old enough to get their Hogwarts letter. By convincing the muggles that magic does not exist, the accidental magic is written off as weird coincidences and largely ignored.
