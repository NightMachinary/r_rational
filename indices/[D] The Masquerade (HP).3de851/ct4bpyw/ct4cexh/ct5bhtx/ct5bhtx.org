That actually would be fairly rare. Historically speaking, accidental magic might be viewed as demonic possession. But the solution was not death. It was an exorcism. (Which was done by the church, not local mobs.)

Most of the time, witch hunting was done by locals to attack those they suspected to be using black magic. (Everyone at the time practiced magical rituals, but black magic was the attempt to harm others and was therefore worthy of death.) There are some historians who think that this was done to target non-conforming members of the community. Others believe that it was used to settle grudges.
