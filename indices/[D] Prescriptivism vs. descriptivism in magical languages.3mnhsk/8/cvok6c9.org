I think the normal thing in most fantasy is that the language that can be used to cast spells is the language that was made at the creation of the universe, that it is woven into the natural laws of the universe. The effects of a given series of words is as definite as are the effects of gravity.

Basically the creator-deity (or deities) wrote an interpreter for a programming language into the natural laws of the universe. It (he/she/they) may then have used said interpreter to create the rest of the universe.

In these situations, in order to change the effect of a word, you would need to alter the natural laws of the universe.

This is related to the ideas of things like [[http://dnd4.wikia.com/wiki/Supernal][Supernal]], truenames, 'Let there be light', etc.

It is easy to imagine writing a 'universal translator' into the interpreter so that regular people could use magic in any language with which they are familiar. In that case the quality of the universal translator would determine the answers to your questions.

Assuming it were a perfect universal translator, it would take into account regional dialects, and would understand what a person was saying as long as they didn't make any mistakes. It wouldn't matter how the Oxford English Dictionary defined a word, but instead local usages would take precedent. Specifically those usages which the speaker had actually been exposed to.

Potentially it could just read their mind and discover the /intentions/ behind what they're saying. Or it could scan the structure of their mind to figure out how /they/ would interpret what they were saying.
