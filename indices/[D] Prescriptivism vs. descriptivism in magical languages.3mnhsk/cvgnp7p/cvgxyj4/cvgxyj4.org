Huh, if people with particular mental landscapes are better "inventing" and understanding spells than others, then over the course of generations you could have a very strange culture which was influenced by the most successful spell-creators.

Also by the subtle influence of "Magic", wizards are predisposed to stick with whatever works just like finding a complete, working spell instead of learning to improve on what they first create since there was no process of improvement in the wizarding world.
