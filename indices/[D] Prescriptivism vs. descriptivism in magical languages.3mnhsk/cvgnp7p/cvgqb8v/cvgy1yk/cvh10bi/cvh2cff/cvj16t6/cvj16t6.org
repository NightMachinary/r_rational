If we limit it by knowledge, that means we can potentially 'double up' spells. So we have a triplet of (belief about the spell, wand motion, words)->effect. So OogeleyBoogely(3,1,1) could trigger effects of: Bats. Explosion. Turn lead into a monkey. But no others, so as long as we remain low density on the valid triplets, we can still achieve a very big space of effects. Though I would then wonder what would happen if two wizards learned two different versions of the spell and met each other.
