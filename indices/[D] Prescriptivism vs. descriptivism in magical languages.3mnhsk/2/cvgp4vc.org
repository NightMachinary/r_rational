It depends on how the equivalent of the relevant magical language interpreter has been programmed. Any of these options are possible. You could even have purely consistent and logical rules which resulted in apparent inconsistent results because of the existence of multiple interpreters behind the scenes, and each spell invoking a particular interpreter under specific circumstances.

Such circumstances could be a mishmash of layered and half-baked rules. You might have certain spells which are tied irrevocably to a specific interpreter - perhaps one which hasn't been updated for centuries but still exists as an invokable magical pattern. You might have spells which used to be tied to an old interpreter but have been reattached to a more modern one, subtly changing the spell results in particular ways (particularly during edge cases). You might have spells which cast a certain seeking pattern into the ether when invoked, and which use the first interpreter which responds and matches the pattern (which itself may or may not have been programmed in a fragile manner).

I'm imagining a metawizard who creates a new interpreter layer which responds to all spell requests and by default passes them to the interpreter they would normally go to, but records the details transparently, and is also able (under the metawizard's control) to do other things, like redirect the spell energy to the wrong interpreter or use a built-in interpreter to create completely different spell effects (or store the energy, or backfire it). Such a metawizard might have to be fought using nonmagical tactics, or using only ancient spells which contained their own protointerpreters or wrote directly to the bare ether.
