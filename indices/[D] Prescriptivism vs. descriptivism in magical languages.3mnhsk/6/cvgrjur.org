This is essentially how magic works in a *H* /(arry)/ *P* /(otter)/ *Lovecraft* crossover fic that I'm /sort of/ writing, and never intend to publish.

In the story, Cthulhu was rising early, and Nyarlathotep tricked some ancient Phoenician sailors into landing on R'lyeh and binding him into a prison Nyarlathotep built for them. Then they renamed the continent 'Atlantis' and started utilising the obedience-compelling nature of the prison to make Cthulhu do stuff for them. An incantation is just a sentence in atlantean telling Cthulhu what to do.

Of course, because Nyarlathotep never does anything out of the goodness of his (does he even /have/ a heart?) the real purpose of the whole thing was to drain enough of Cthulhu's power that R'lyeh would sink again, which, of course, killed all the atlanteans who couldn't escape in time.

But getting back on topic, most of the atlantean language is lost, because there was never an atlantean rosetta stone, and 99+% of their relics were on R'lyeh. It would be entirely possible for a witch or wizard to cast a spell that raises the dead, turns back aging, or permanently transfigures something into food. /If/ they knew the right words/grammar to ask for it. (Although, there /are/ actually spells that permanently transfigure other objects known to modern mages, but attempts to merge these incantation structures with the spell to temporarily transfigure something into food have failed because food items are in a different noun-group and follow different grammatical syntax.)

The atlantean language used in incantations is the language the atlanteans taught Cthulhu, updating as it evolved, until R'lyeh sank, at which point no one could access Cthulhu's prison to let him understand newer versions of the language.
