I think this is really decided by the precise mechanism of how the language interacts with the world.

One possible model is that the words act some sort of "code words" which tell the World what to effect - basically like a programming language. Another is that the words act as mental "trigger words" for the spellcaster him/herself to magically make changes to reality. The former would make the language descriptive, reliant on the exact words that the magic system would take, and the latter prescriptive, changing to whatever the individual spellcaster ends up using because only the /intent/ will matter. (Both probably involve mana or some other phlebotinum as a limiting factor. Also, these are most likely just the extreme ends of a spectrum, with in-betweens that I'm not considering at the moment - one off the top of my head is the "magic program" that I described above, except with some kind of backdoor built in that lets certain people or things change the words that the system accepts, which would make the language entirely dependent on those "certain people or things".)

So with that in mind, the characteristics of the descriptive system would be: the language would be defined by whoever or whatever built the magic system; it is unlikely to evolve further, unless it possesses subsystems that allow for conscious change (and whoever has control of those subsystems could certainly exploit it to their own ends); and there may or may not be different words for the same effect, which again depends on whoever or whatever built the magic system. (For example, some kind of creator god made the magic system and taught it to different races to see which one could conquer the other, but taught them different sets of vocabulary for mostly the same effects because the god knew there were people savvy enough to listen and predict what spells the opposing spellcasters are using.) Pronunciation would matter to the extent that the World is sure what the spellcaster is asking for; punctuation and spelling might matter less if it's just a spell being vocalized, but will most certainly matter if it's a spell cast from some written medium. And thus it is in this kind of world that "susuration" works when spoken but not written.

(I'm going to take this opportunity to bring up one of my favourite fanfics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]] (Sword Art Online fanfic) by Catsy, since it has the most fleshed-out example of the "descriptive" kind of magic system I'm talking about.)

By the way, when I mention the "World" here, I guess you could call it kind of like a "server" that generates reality - that's the analogy I have for it, anyway, though it also might possibly be a god flat-out. It may even be human culture itself, or the collective human will - in which case an incantation must be /recognized by other humans, in both correct formation/pronunciation and expected result/, to be able to work, and only through a change in this collective will could a previous entry in its dictionary be mutated...but that's getting away from the "extreme end" example I was talking about before.

On the other hand, the vocabulary in a prescriptive system of magic would be initially defined by tradition. (Though in this kind of system, the very fact that language is favoured as the instrument to dictate magic might become a matter of coincidence. It's not any less likely that holding/wearing certain items, or making blinking gestures even, would help manipulate mana or whatever phlebotinum is being used in the right way. Maybe whoever first used magic in this kind of world used a word from his native tongue to focus his intention. Or maybe this person just thought yelling something would help, which ended up later being transformed into a concrete word that other people used.) Afterwords, and assuming people in-universe /don't/ realize the nature of this type of system, the "official" words may change over centuries as it goes through successive generations of teachers and differing accents, until in the end they end up with something completely different from what they were at first (until the people in-universe /do/ realize the nature of this type of system, at any rate). In this case, pronunciation, punctuation, etc. won't matter so long as the intent is there, so words could be replaced all the time, including poor "susurration".

But I think I should point out that a system leaning heavily on this side of the spectrum most likely won't develop runes, glyphs, and the like. There would be no meaning in shaped ink on paper if something about the World can't ascertain that /the shapes itself/ were intended for magical effects. A society based around this system would most likely skip the squiggles and go straight into Enchanted Magical Item territory, not Items with Magical Runes Carved On Them.

In the end, yeah, a given magic system in a work could go either way or anywhere in-between so long as it doesn't contradict itself. But the nature of its use will always be an indicator to the nature of its self.

Phew, wrote quite a bit. I hope I didn't meander too much.
