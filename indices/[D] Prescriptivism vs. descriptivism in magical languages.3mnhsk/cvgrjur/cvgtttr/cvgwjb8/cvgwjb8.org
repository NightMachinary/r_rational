Also, when I say /a/ fic, I actually mean a few:

*Luna Lovegood and the Mountains of Madness*

The year before she's due to start hogwarts, Luna, Xenophillius, and her friend Ginny Weasley go on holiday. And by "holiday", Ginny didn't realise that Luna meant a year long expidition to the antarctic in search of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. Or as they're better known: Elder Things.

*Ginny Weasley and the Chamber of Yig*

It isn't /Tom Riddle's/ Diary that Lucius Malfoy slips into Ginny's Cauldron before her first year at Hogwarts, it's /Abdul Alhazred's/.

*Sirius Black and the Prisoners of Azathoth*

Deep in the darkest bowels of Azkaban, Sirius Black discovers a plot to wake the demon sultan and release the convicts from their hell by ending reality. With the help of a mysterious egyptian wizard, Sirius races to escape and warn the outside world.

*Gabrielle Delacour and the Shadow Over Hogsmede*

After Fleur fails to rescue her during the second task of the tri-wizard tournament, Gabrielle decides she'll just have to rescue /herself/. But why, if this is a deep one village, isn't she the only human here?

*Harry Potter and the Nice Relaxing Year Where He Only Had To Fight Voldemort Instead of FUCKING Old Ones*

Oh wait, nevermind. Umbridge looks unusually toad-like. I see where /this/ is going...
