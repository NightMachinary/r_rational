If I understand it correctly, the combinations don't specify the effects in any sense, they're just symbolic. So if we're using the "magic as computer programming" metaphor, the incantation+gesture combination is more like =Mobilicorpus()=, a call to a function which contains something more complex and fully specified. Based on how it works in HPMOR, I think there are also parameters that get fed into the spell as well, so ...

#+begin_quote
  =Avadakedavra(user.emotionalState, wand.vector)=
#+end_quote

Probably not actually =wand.vector= though, because wandless casting is possible.

(I have a 55,000 word story stuck in draft where this is basically how things work; it gets kicked into high gear when someone discovers a method of accessing the base language where you actually /can/ fully specify your own spells instead of using the "known spells" like Fireball or Fox Form that were baked in as handy shortcuts.)
