I'm pretty sure yes, because you can use the incantation to specify a specific spell just like how you can name precisely one animal species out of millions with only it's name. The gesture is used to modify the spell based on the current situation to specify the direction to cast the spell, how strong the effects should be, or duration of the spell, and other possible context-dependent effects.

All you're doing is picking one spell out of a pool of possible spells, not defining and producing a wholly new spell from scratch.
