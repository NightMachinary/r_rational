My secret model of how it works in HPMOR is that there are countless objective spellword-gesture combinations and a magically driven intuition for seeking them out, and people find what they're looking for in parts of the magical space resembling their own mental language. Since the possible incantation-gesture combinations are universal, a single person whose mind sought out the "Mobilicorpus" incantation can tell others about it too regardless of native language.
