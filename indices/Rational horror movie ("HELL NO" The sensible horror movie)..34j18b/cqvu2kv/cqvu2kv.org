It was an amusing and moderately clever video. However, the premise of this "movie" runs into trouble once you throw a wrench into their clever little plans.

Want to drive off and go somewhere else? Sorry, your tires were mysteriously slashed. And you only have 1 spare, it doesn't matter how smart you are there's only so much room in the car.

Carlos skips out on the trip, but the girls head to the mental asylum anyway.

Video tape that kills you when you watch it? Sounds fun for a laugh, after all everyone knows something like that couldn't possibly be real. Only someone very superstitious or someone who knew they were in a horror movie would say no if someone pressured them about it.

Using a rocket launcher to destroy the monster could easily backfire if you haven't been trained in the use of one.

And so on.
