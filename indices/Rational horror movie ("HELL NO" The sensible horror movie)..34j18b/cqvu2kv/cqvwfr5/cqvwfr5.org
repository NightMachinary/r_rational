Yeah, considering that I totally picked up a copy of the "cursed video" from outside a record store (with handy flyer WARNING me that it was cursed) a couple months before The Ring came out, and then put real effort into acquiring a second cursed video supposedly made for the sequel... IRL fear of a cursed videotape is pretty low here.

(Amusing sidenote: I ended up not having anything to fear from the tape. I inadvertently made a copy and showed it to several other people during the first week. The guy who ran the world's biggest Ring/Ringu fansite lived about 30 minutes away and came over to get a copy as soon as I told him about it.)
