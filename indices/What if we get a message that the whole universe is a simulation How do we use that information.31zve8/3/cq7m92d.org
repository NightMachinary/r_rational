If we just get words in the sky saying "This is a simulation"? That tells us nothing that philosophers haven't already speculated about for a long time. It will confirm one particular theory true, but we've already got quite a lot of literature on what happens if we are in a simulation, so... all we know is that /this/ already-formed hypothesis is right and /that/ one is wrong, it's only a few bits of information.

All right, there's a little bit more than that - it tells us that God learned to speak English, that we've been noticed, that the universe doesn't exist solely for the benefit of stars or electrons or even Martian bacteria but for /us/. Which is good to know. Alternatively, it tells us that we're not in a simulation, just the victims of the world's greatest prank.

But if you're going to tell me I'm in a simulation, I'd appreciate some practical data too, like the API keys.
