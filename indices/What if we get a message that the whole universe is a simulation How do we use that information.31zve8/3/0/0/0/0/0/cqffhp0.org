Other people corroborating my senses would certianly help, but I'd also have to deal with the fact that it is /only by my senses/ that I know other people sense the same thing.

- I could be hallucinating them agreeing that's in the sky
- They could be lying that that's in the sky
- They could also be hallucinating (which is worthy of investigation, I agree

Not saying I could never come to believe it, but... extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and /spectacularly unreasonable/ claims require /spectacularly unreasonable/ evidence.

Looking at this from the other direction: suppose it was possible for your own sensory input to be falsified and for everyone in the world to lie and say their sensory input agreed with you. What would it take for a rational mind to be sufficiently skeptical in this situation?
