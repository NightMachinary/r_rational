How can you take advantage of a simulation, other than through the means we've already been attempting to take advantage of the world? After all, even if this world was a simulation, it's been playing by very consistent rules so far. Knowing it's a simulation won't change that. In fact, knowing that it's a simulation would just make me worried, because that would mean we have some rather evil gods on our hands who are apathetic at best.
