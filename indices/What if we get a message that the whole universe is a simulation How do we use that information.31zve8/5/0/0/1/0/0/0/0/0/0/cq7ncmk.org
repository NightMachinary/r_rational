One thing about our current society is that as technology has progressed and we've become wealthier, we've been less and less tolerant of questionable human rights practices. Presumably a society capable of running emulations like the one we would be in is far above us from a technological standpoint, and wealthier societies tend to care more about ethical issues. Many psychology studies that were considered fine 75 years ago would never pass an ethics board today.

Given that running simulations is so obviously rife with moral conundrums, it seems logical to me at least that they would perform some kind of cost-benefit analysis to determine if running the simulation is allowable.

The fact that it's likely a technologically advanced, wealthy society running the simulation seems like at least weak evidence that a cost-benefit analysis was performed at some point in time before beginning the simulation, and if it passed a cost-benefit analysis, the suffering likely exists for a reason.

(Although I'll fully admit the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/][typical mind fallacy]] I just engaged in)
