I am a person who thinks animals also have substantial moral weight, so that particular line of reasoning is not compelling.

And also, even if you could perhaps justify our moral suffering if they had a good reason for it, that doesn't change the fact that, regardless of how inconseqential we seem to them, our moral weight is not zero. If they can easily change our circumstance for the better but don't bother, then that is still evil.
