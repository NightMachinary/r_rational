so then if the simulators have moral values similar to yours, then they would agree with you. If the simulators moral values are similar to the 96.8% of people who do eat meat, then I would expect the simulators to be fairly dismissive of our own moral weight.

Without knowing the purpose of the simulation, it's hard for us to say if they can easily change our circumstances. Perhaps changing our circumstances would void the purpose of the simulation, and lead to them shutting the entire thing down.

Now I'm not saying it's the case they couldn't change the circumstances. I'm saying we don't know their incentives, we don't know their limitations, and we don't know how similar or different their moral reasoning is from ours. With those 3, huge knowledge gaps, we can't say with any high degree of certainty that they are/aren't evil, or that they do/don't place moral weight on our existence.
