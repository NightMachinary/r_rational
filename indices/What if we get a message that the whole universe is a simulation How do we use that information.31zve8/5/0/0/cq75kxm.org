What ideas? How do you think you'd try to exploit a simulation that looks just like the world as it is now.

A game designer is evil if they have sapient life in their games that they don't treat as well as possible. If our world is a simulation, then it is many orders of magnitude more complex than anything a typical game designer could create, and the comparison doesn't really follow.
