I'm not sure I can agree with your assessment of evil. I can't categorically reject it either, but I would feel more comfortable with apathetic as a likelier reality. With no ability to interact with the creator of the simulation, we would have no way to assess their attitude.

For all we know, the creator is an incompetent, and broke something an unfathomable time ago in our simulation. They've spent the last several billion years of our subjective time learning and trying to fix it, progressively making our lives better...

In that scenario, I'd say they could be considered something of a hero to us, since they didn't just scratch everything and start over.
