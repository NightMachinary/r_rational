Yes, if this world were a simulation that someone created, my first guess would that they would be apathetic towards us instead of actively malevolent. But that still makes their actions fall clearly under the category of "evil."

And I suppose it's slimly possible that a simulation could just have gotten out of its creators hands rather than being intentionally made with cruel elements, but that seems like a fairly unlikely scenario.
