Typically the goals upon finding out everything is a sim is to abuse the system: to attack it to either escape the simulation to underlying reality, or to make the simulation better in whatever way you define that, typically resulting in either victory and the end of the story, or problems arising followed by conquest of the problems and either return of status quo or the victory as above. See examples: Yudkowsky's That Alien Message, Vinge's The Cookie Monster, Chalker's Well of Souls books, the Matrix movies, the game Star Ocean 3, a lot of [[http://qntm.org][qntm]]'s stuff, some of Greg Egan's stuff, and a whole host of others I am not thinking of at the moment.
