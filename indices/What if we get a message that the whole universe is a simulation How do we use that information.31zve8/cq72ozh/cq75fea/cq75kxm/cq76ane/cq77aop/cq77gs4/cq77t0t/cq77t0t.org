As much as people talk about Philosopher Zombies, the odds of them actually existing does not seem very high.

Perhaps our moral weight is insignificant in comparison, but in that case the overlookers of the simulation would be so far advanced from us that I can't possibly fathom what purpose they would have for such a simulation in the first place that could possibly justify their actions. And even if our suffering is relatively insignificant, it's still an immense amount of suffering, and they should be able to know this. So they still wind up being either immoral or amoral.
