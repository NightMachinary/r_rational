Given how much moral weight mankind as a whole give animals (think boiling lobsters, factory farming), I'm not really convinced you can make the generalization that intelligence or the ability to suffer automatically grants us having moral weight.

Keep in mind that if we're in a simulation, the gap between the simulators and us is likely greater, perhaps FAR greater, than the difference between us and much of what we eat.
