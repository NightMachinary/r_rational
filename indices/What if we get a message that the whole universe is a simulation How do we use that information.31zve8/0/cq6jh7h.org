From Accelerando: "He slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on the latest on the tensor-mode gravitational waves in the cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be waste heat generated by irreversible computational processes back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe being merely the data left behind by a really huge calculation). And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: According to the more conservative cosmologists, an alien superpower -- maybe a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning civilizations -- is running a timing channel attack on the computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to break through to whatever's underneath."
