I'm reminded of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo][this video]] by Veritasium. When trying to figure out how something unknown works or if it is true, you should try to disprove what you believe.

Now, what we are given from the letter is that there are 3 things that were programmed to behave weirdly. Those 3 things are human consciousness depending on a brain, some "logical paradoxes", and quantum uncertainty. Naturally in order to prove that we are not in a simulation, we should attempt to disprove one or more of these beliefs. We could create an artificial consciousness or discover what causes the observation effect in quantum measurements. I'm not sure what logical paradoxes are supposed to exist but they are usually some kind of argument which is not really something that exists per say. We can't really prove we are in a simulation with these however.

I guess convincing evidence that we're in a simulation would have to be some kind of action that violated our commonly known laws of physics, like the moon suddenly appearing on the opposite side of the earth but with no observable physical manipulation. Maybe having some law of mathematics rewritten to where it no longer makes sense and creates some kind of paradox. I think the only way to prove that we are in a simulation is to show that the simulation is alterable in some way, otherwise it can also be explained simply by "that's how things work".
