I don't remembe if this is in "Influence" or not, but look up price anchoring and (separately) perceived value. tl;dr: have a low, middle, and high price and people will tend to choose the middle. Have a high price and people will perceive you as more luxurious/ valuable (oversimplification, obviosuly). Real thing, though -- it's hard / impossible to sell software to a big company if it costs $19.99. They want something that costs four digits, even if it's the same thing. Part of this is how their budgets and payment systems work, but part is also just the perceived value.
