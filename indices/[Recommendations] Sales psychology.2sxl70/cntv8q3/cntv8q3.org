Are you selling online or in meatspace?

If you're selling online, the most brilliant sales trick I ever saw worked like this (I don't remember the web site, sadly):

It's an auction site with a twist. You buy virtual bid tokens, and you spend one token every time you bid. Things start with ridiculously low prices -- $1 for an iPad -- and they have a short sell time, maybe an hour. Here's the trick: in the last ten seconds, any bid resets the clock to ten seconds. This takes advantage of sniping -- everyone who tries to snipe will end up re-bidding to get the thing, usually much higher than the price would otherwise go. The fact that you're paying a bid token -- something that directly translates to money but feels like not-money -- also jacks up how much people spend.

Combine that with the "auction a dollar" trick where people are obligated to pay their bids even if they don't win and you could rake in the money. It's a little bit evil, though.
