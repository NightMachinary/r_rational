The .99 thing at the end of prices is a simple matter of psychology. Individual pennies are worth so little these days that it's almost criminally stupid to keep them in circulation, at least in the US. Because they are worth so little, people ignore them, only noticing the dollar amounts.

So, if you sell something for 4.99, and someone else sells it for 5.00, the average consumer will buy from you. If you are selling in cyberspace, you can likely charge a little premium on top of shipping that they won't even notice, because they never see that the other guy actually charges less to ship the item. In brick and mortar space, you can probably get away with a few extra pennies here and there on other peripheral products associated with your item.

Now - variations on the 0.99 psychology. Some retailers use the pennies part of the cost for subtle signaling of special properties of an item that the interested buyer can't know without being on the inside. For instance ending in 0.92 might mean it's an open-box item. 0.49 might indicate a display item with damage. 0.79 might mean a discontinued item. These price variants are likely to draw the eye of a customer, not because they care about a few pennies, but because it looks different. The customer then asks the employee about the price, because it's usually a deal, and the employee now has an opportunity to dispose of a product that the store wants gone.

Yes, I used to work in Bricks and Mortar retail, in the last millennium.
