The Reckoners books are good fun, but a large chunk of the second one, the metaphysics underlying powers and their connection to Epics' psychology, and the ultimate conflict and its resolution, feel heavily taken off Worm. Especially the rushed-feeling final battle at the end of the third book, which leans heavily on the protagonist having a uniquely powerful will, and is almost play-by-play the ending of Worm, except "and then the villain realized that humanity was great, and gave in".
