I'd really like a list of good audiobooks from audible, specifically with good narrators. I've been trying to listen to Dune and Men at Arms but the audio quality is awful. Id prefer science fiction but high fantasy is okay too.

Additionally, Id enjoy some more off the radar reads like Sufficiently Advanced Magic, the Lightbringer series, and anything similar to Sanderson novels.
