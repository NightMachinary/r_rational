Author recommendation: Daniel Abraham (Aka, M.L.N. Hanover and half of James S.A. Corey).

In general, he writes almost-rational stories, with some selfish, idealistic, uninformed, etc. characters that /create/ problems despite the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. For example (vague enough to avoid spoilers), a character meddles with forces beyond his comprehension and nearly causes an extinction-level catastrophe. The characterization and worldbuilding is good enough that everything seems inevitable in hindsight and theoretically predictable, but it still managed to surprise me with twists and turns I didn't see coming.

Another thing that sets his writing apart is that time passes and things change. I can't nail down why the changes in the Expanse, the Long Price Quartet and The Dagger and the Coin feel more real and impactful than the ones in Harry Potter, The Wheel of Time, The Dresden Files, The Belgariad, and the Amber books, but the difference is night and day. The stories are set in a living world that reacts to world-changing events /as if the world has changed/. It seems like each book in a series shifts genres a bit to show this as well.

For specific book/series recommendations:

The Long Price Quartet (starting with A Shadow in Summer): High fantasy setting, with one empire controlling /Andat/, which are bound philosophical principles (eg. Stone-made-Soft or Removing-the-Part-that-Continues) that serve as both industrial tools (stone pottery, de-seeding cotton and abortions) and nuclear-level deterrents (melting a continent, ecological catastrophe). The first book covers an attempted invasion (by political means) of that magic-wielding empire, and a couple of characters on each side.

The Expanse (starting with Leviathan Wakes): Space opera that respects F = ma and other standard physics and economics (e.g. Terraforming Mars will take centuries of concentrated effort by millions of people). The setting has three main factions: Earth, with billions of people, Mars, with millions of experts at everything, and the (Asteroid-)Belters, who live on the fringes of society. There are cultural clashes, conspiracies, miscommunications, etc. that complicate the plot, and also talking problems through that preempts conflicts. The first book is mystery-like, with a murdered girl and an attack on a freighter being the driving ideas for the main characters.

The Dagger and the Coin (starting with The Dragon's Path): Fantasy set in a mostly post-magic world. There are different races of humanity (elf-like, otter-like, bug-like, underground specialized, etc.), indestructible roads between cities, and a few (very minor) mages, but everyday life doesn't contain any magic. It starts with three threads: a fairly standard war, with an incompetent and vengeful pawn who dabbles in philosophy is put in charge of a conquered city and proceeds to royally fuck everything up, an apostate from the (secret) Church of the Spider Goddess, who have the power to detect lies, and also anyone who hears them believe what they say, and a banker's apprentice who needs to navigate a warzone.

The Black Sun's Daughter (starting with Unclean Spirits): is urban fantasy, focusing on Jayne, a woman who inherited her uncles responsibilities as basically a demon hunter after his death. She doesn't have the training, and his allies (who she also inherited) aren't nearly as good as he was, so they're having trouble accomplishing their goals. I haven't read past the first book yet, but I'm planning to after I catch up with other things. I think it's probably the worst fit for me and this sub, but still a good book (and probably series).
