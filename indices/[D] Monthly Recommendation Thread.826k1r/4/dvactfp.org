I recommend [[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind/chapter/184920/chapter-001][The Daily Grind]] a story about an IT guy finding an alternate dimension in his office that only opens for a few minutes a week (but has weird time stretching inside). Really well-written and competent characters that try to figure out what is going on and an interesting world that feels computer generated but landed in the uncanny valley.

There are only 29 chapters so far, but the author is posting a new one every 3-4 days.
