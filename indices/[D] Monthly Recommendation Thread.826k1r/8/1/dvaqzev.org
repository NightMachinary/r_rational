  The Maretian - a crossover between My Little Ponies and the book The Martian by Andy Weir. Don't read if you haven't read The Martian yet since there are heavy spoilers for the book's plot. It's a very well done plotline of ponies and humans juggling surviving together on the hostile planet, Mars, and handling a first-contact scenario.

Thanks so much for recommending this! I already loved CSP and to hear that there's new content on the order of 100k words is fantastic.
