[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/KeitAi][Keit-Ai!]] - an unusual romance where the boy and the girl reveals their deepest, darkest secrets to equip each other with the weapons needed to conquer the hearts of their alternate-version selves from their respective parallel dimensions.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian][The Maretian]] - a crossover between /My Little Ponies/ and the book /The Martian/ by Andy Weir. Don't read if you haven't read /The Martian/ yet since there are heavy spoilers for the book's plot. It's a very well done plotline of ponies and humans juggling surviving together on the hostile planet, Mars, and handling a first-contact scenario.

It's a sequel to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program][Changeling Space Program]], but that's only to cover how the ponies managed to develop space flight and isn't necessary reading for reading /The Maretian/. Great read with Queen Chrysalis as the protagonist who is hellbent on reaching the moon first to gain ever-lasting power and conquer Equestria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11575324/1/Silver][Silver]] - a RWBY fanfic where Juane is the protagonist who came up with the audacious idea of creating weapons out of Aura. The story is about team JNPR rather than just Juane having major character development and comes up with novel ideas about how Aura works. A good amount is having Juane and others do a lot of figuring out the rules of Aura that is somewhat similar to the early chapters of HPMOR where Harry was testing the rules of magic. It's unrealistic how often they're right when a lot of hypothesis testing is usually failure rather than success.

Hmmmm.....I use calibre library to catalog and store my digital books. This gives me the option to create and share a list of the books in my library. While it may seem useless, I have a library that is specifically for books I can download off the Internet and if I give the list to others, then other people can find all of the free books/stories I have chosen to download off the Internet. Would anyone be interested? If there is anyone else also uses calibre, I would be interested in other people's book catalog as well.
