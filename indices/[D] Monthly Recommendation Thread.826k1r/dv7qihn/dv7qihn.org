Podcasts with people talking about their disagreements, and really trying to get to the heart of where they disagree. [[https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/][Intelligence Squared]] is the closest one I'm aware of, but they often move on just when I feel like they're zeroing in on the actual disagreement.

Other things that are kind of close to what I'm looking for:

[[http://www.dylanmarron.com/podcast/][Conversations with people who hate me]]: It's a really good podcast for the question “how can you have civil conversation with someone very different than yourself,” but I'm looking for “Now that civility has been established, let's proceed to talk about the actual issue.”

[[http://www.atheist-experience.com/][The Atheist Experience]]: A call-in show show mostly centered around theists calling in to talk about the “Is there a God?” question. I would say It's around 50% atheists asking questions, or voicing their appreciation for the show, 40% theists bringing the same 3 arguments, and 10% actually interesting conversations.

[[http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman][Judge John Hodgman]]: 2 people having a personal dispute agree to have it decided by the judge of this podcast. I like this podcast because, with the wide variety of people they have on, it's a good way of exploring the [[https://xkcd.com/1095/][fractally nested human subcultures]]. It's not quite what I'm looking for with the request, though, because there's rarely much emotional weight to the disagreement, and, to get on the podcast in the first place necessitates that the two people have reached a point where further conversations between themselves is no longer useful.
