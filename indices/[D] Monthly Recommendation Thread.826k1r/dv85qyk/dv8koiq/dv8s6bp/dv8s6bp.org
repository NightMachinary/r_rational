Seconding the Legion audiobooks, especially the second one since the first is too short even if it's better at introducing the premise. Sanderson can even do Dan Brown-esque thrillers right. I've only /read/ the first Reckoners book, but it's pretty awesome and manages to be dark in a fun pulpy way without feeling too grim or too silly.
