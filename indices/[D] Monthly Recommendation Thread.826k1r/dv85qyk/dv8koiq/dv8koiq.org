If you want good audio quality, stay away from Terry Pratchett, at least anything narrated by Nigel Planar. They really ought to run all those though some high quality audio cleanup and mastering. But those are the only really bad ones I've yet listened to.

Interestingly, the first voice actor I would recommend, Scott Brick, is also featured in Dune. But most of his stuff has decent quality. I've listened to him in a few Michael Crichton novels recently, like Jurassic Park (awesome novel, one of the best technothrillers ever, independently of the movie).

The Martian is very well narrated, to the point that it's worth a listen even if you've read the book. And it's my favorite novel, so there's that.

You can get the entire 70 ish hour Sherlock Holmes collection as narrated by Stephen Fry for a single credit. His rendition of Harry Potter are also worth a listen, although his tone fits the first couple of books better than the last.

This is a niche one, but you're a Halo fan, there's a short story collection called Halle Evolutions, that include two shorts narrated by the voice actors of the Master Chief and Cortana respectively. In general, I can recommend all the Halo novels if you haven't read them, expect The Flood which is just a novelization of the first game.

You mention Brandon Sanderson, but a lot of people only know his Cosmere stuff. If you haven't read them, the Reckoners trilogy is amazing. And I can also recommend Legion, which is hardcore competence porn in a good way. But if you're like me and have read literally everything he ever wrote already, check out Powder Mage. They're basically Brandon Sanderson novels, but written by a student of his, Brian McClellan. That description isn't quite fair to McClellan, but it's the quickest way to recommend them to someone already familiar with Sanderson

Old Mans war is very enjoyable and has a good narrator. Clean sci fi fun. Not much to say about that.

Reamde is a great one if you're into technothrillers. It's a long ride, but very action packed and framed around well researched contemporary tech
