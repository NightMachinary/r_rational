Just to recommend a story that feels related: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/split-worm-fic.24539/][Split]]: A story in which Taylor has the ability to copy the combined mind and power of other parahumans on touch. The story is heavily psychology-focused, with an emphasis on the internal conflicts Taylor has been the multiple minds and memory-sets she possesses, and does an excellent job exploring the psychology of Taylor's power and other psychology-based powers that come into play. Also has Taylor opening up to an actual psychologist and introduces a psychology through the story.
