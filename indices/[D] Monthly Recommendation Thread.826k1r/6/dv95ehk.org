A meta-reccomendation:

I've recently discovered the app [[https://meet.libbyapp.com/][Libby]] which allows me to check out the works present at my local library as e-books. I've already gone through /Blade Runner/ and went about halfway through a few other books I was interested in but ultimately didn't feel like finishing.

The app doesn't work for every library's catalogue (only one of my two library cards functioned) but if it works for yours, it's an incredibly useful tool. It works on android, IOS, and Windows.
