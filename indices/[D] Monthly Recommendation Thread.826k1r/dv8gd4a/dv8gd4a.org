Hm, not that much read this month.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain][The Elephant In The Brain]] (non-fiction) was good, though at times the writing felt forced. Still, worth a read.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle][We have always lived in the castle]] I felt was very good, but probably not if you're looking for the 'rational' aspects. While the characters are very well crafted, they're... exaggerations? And the setting is far from rational, built clearly to faciliate the thought experiment. Call it a character study.

Read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7139892-under-heaven][Under Heaven]] again, all [[/r/rational]] readers should read at least one Guy Gavriel Kay book and decide if that's their style :P

Attempted [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25328003-the-war-of-undoing][The War Of Undoing]] but DNF. Setting's somewhat interesting, but the prose is uninspired, and each character in the main trio is so frustratingly flawed it's difficult to cheer for them. May come back to this later.
