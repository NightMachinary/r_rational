Reading the entire Ultimate Spider-Man run in one go is probably one of the best comic experiences of my life.

Peter Parker starts out 15 years old, much younger than in the regular universe, and he actually grows and matures as time goes. He has a 150+ comic character arc! It's amazing. Not only that, he accumulates a lot of scars and baggage, causing him to lash out sometimes, to act erratically, to have PTSD-like symptoms even, just like you would expect a crime fighting teenager to have.

The secondary characters are also very well executed, particularly Mary Jane, Aunt May, Gwen Stacy, and Kitty Pride.

A *lot* of the characterization and setting from Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2 and Spider-man homecoming comes from the Ultimate Spider-man run.

The entire run is(in order):

- Ultimate Spider-Man #1 - 46
- Ultimate Six #1-7
- Ultimate Spider-Man #47-133
- Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem #1-2\\
- Ultimate Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #1-15
- Ultimate Spider-Man #150-160 (yes, it reverts to the original numbering)
- Ultimate Comics Fallout #1-6.
