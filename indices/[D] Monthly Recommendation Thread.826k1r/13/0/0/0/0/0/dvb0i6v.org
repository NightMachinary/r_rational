One thing I thought he left out is how different the action is in the movie. Characters act more like pulp heroes who can throw and take a lot of punches, while action in the comic is much more subdued and emphasizes single powerful moves like firing a gun for an instant kill.

In the debate over the climax, I'm all in with Linkara's side. I don't care if the comic version is way sillier, superheroes are an inherently silly genre no matter how dark and gritty the story is. The weirdness of it gave it more shock value to me and the political reaction sounds a bit more logical in the comic.
