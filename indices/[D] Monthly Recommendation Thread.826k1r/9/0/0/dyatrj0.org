I finished reading it a few days ago and it was pretty good! I really enjoyed it and pretty much finished it in like two days. The time loop was well done and very interesting, the whole thing about Sakura having different versions of herself in her mind was neat (kinda reminded me of Cristal Society/Legion). I don't know how much of it is canon since I never finished shippuden, but the whole thing about the demons and the gods was great and quite trippy.

It was a bit too pornographic for my tastes at first, well not really but I guess since this was in the Naruto universe I didn't expect it to be so mature... you get what I mean. Eventually it grew on me and I started appreciating how honest it is, but yeah. Great fic nonetheless but it's a bit harder to recommend than something like Mother of Learning.
