I have preferences for scheming protagonist with ambitions and realistic depiction of politics. My recommendation list reflect that:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10457949/1/Living-an-Indoctrinated-Dream][Living an Indoctrinated Dream]] - one of the main antagonists in Mass Effect series, Illusive Man wakes up after his death before humanity first contact, and promptly gets to business of manipulating everybody in preparations for the Reapers. The best thing about this fic is that everything happens on truly galactic scale starting with carefully calculated batarian genocide to the recreation of Prothean Empire(sic!). It's also has best depiction of how various governments work and upward of 1mm words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12241700/1/Mass-Divergence][Mass Divergence]] - turns out author of "To the Stars" has another fic under different account - crossover of Mass Effect and "To the Stars".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316196/1/Loyalty][Loyalty]] - Naruto fanfic about girl who was strongarmed into becoming a spy against her village. Fic contains lots of betrayal, moral doubts and other deliciousness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4109686/1/Taking-Sights][Taking Sights]] (Evangelion fanfic) - magnificent bastard Gendo Ikari wakes up after Third Impact in past and discovers that his wife, for whom he literally burned the whole world, sacrificed herself to prevent all that he has done. So he sets out to save the world and take care of his kids in most underhanded and ruthless way possible. Fanfic is unfortunately dead but has about 150K words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji][Thousand Shinji]] (Evangelion and Warhammer crossover, complete) - "Shinji is his father's son, and with a little mentoring from an unlikely source, he will learn the ways of plotting and scheming, along with a few other useful skills. Gendo is so screwed. And so is everyone else."
