Still kinda new to rational fics, for some reason I have always enjoyed when people fuck around with time. I enjoyed those aspects in MoL and HPMOR, any other recommended rat fics out there where messing with time is a crucial part of the story? I don't mind plot holes or stuff that would break the universe that much. I also read Everyone is a Returnee under the recommendation of someone from here in some thread a few weeks ago (thanks whoever you are!), and even though it isn't very rational (or at least not rationalist?) it still is within the ballpark of what I want/might enjoy.
