Right, so last month's rec thread spawned a chain of me reading Culture-crossovers that culminated in me reading a Worm-Culture fanfic and really liking it, despite the fact that I've tried reading Worm before and never been able to actually get through it; the premise, characters, and world are really interesting, but Wildbow's writing /stresses me the fuck out/ between how obvious it is that the characters' decisions will lead to terribleness and how the narrative relentlessly progresses with no time to breathe.

The conclusion I have drawn is that is I really like Worm when Wildbow isn't writing it. Not having familiarity with canon meant I had to rely a fair bit on the Worm wikia to check who people/concepts were that fanfic authors elided, but it was a price I didn't mind paying. And so I am going to share my favorite fanfics here, so people who are in similar boats may have the opportunity to enjoy the parahuman world like I did.

Listing this first because it's most similar to canon. Taylor decides to try out with the Wards instead of going on a solo patrol, her name gets leaked, and Bakuda murders her father. From this dark point of divergence comes a really gripping story that actually felt much more hopeful to me than canon-Worm. Legacy is probably a deadfic, but still worth reading for the first two books.

Really fun; relies a bit much on OCs, but I deeply enjoyed the Piggot characterization. Recursive fanfic from /Internship/, which I am sorry to say I cannot really recommend; the /Deputy/ saga is much better-written.

- /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894][Ring-Maker]]/ is the story of an alt-power Taylor: a Tinker who forges items out of the history of Middle-Earth. I don't actually know what to say about this, I like it so much; just read it.
