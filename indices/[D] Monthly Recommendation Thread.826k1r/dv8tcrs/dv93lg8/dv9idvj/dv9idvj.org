Re Watchmen: Best superhero story ever, awesome even if you hate graphic novels and superheros in general. The movie is also surprisingly good and faithful to the book (much better than you would expect for Hollywood-comic-movies). Watch it after you read the book; especially the villain's plan is done much better in the movie, imho (I know, heresy...).

Obligatory rec for V for Vendetta (the book was kinda butchered by the movie, so don't run away for possibly hating the movie).

Also plus one for Superman: Red son, even if you're not into superman (but it clearly does not reach Alan Moore level of awesome).
