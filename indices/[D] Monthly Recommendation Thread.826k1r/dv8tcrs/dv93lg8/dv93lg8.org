Watchmen is the Citizen Kane of comics, so make sure you get around to reading it at some point. With that out of the way, I recommend JLA/Avengers for an epic melding of mythologies that you can easily understand even without getting the references but makes you want to go read the old comics to learn more.

My favorite “typical comic” I've read so far is JLA: Tower of Babel, which reminds me of my favorite Doctor Who episodes with David Tennent. Great story all around that has more emotional and intellectual depth than you'd think. I've enjoyed Grant Morrison's work in general, though his stories can get pretty surreal at times.

I love the out of continuity stories All Star Superman and Superman: Red Son, but they won't be as enjoyable if you don't already love Superman. The story that made me fall in love with the character was the animated film Superman vs The Elite, an adaptation of What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way? written by the same author that kind of improved on the comic.

The Killing Joke is my favorite Batman story so far, aside from Barbara being forced into the role of the victim who suffers tragedy for the sake of other characters' development. The Court of Owls storyline is the next one on my list to read, which I've heard is amazing. Of the older comics I've read, I've liked the ones by Chuck Dixon the most.

If you want to start following current comics, the [[http://www.comicbookherald.com/reading-dc-comics/dc-rebirth-reading-order/][DC Rebirth]] is a good jumping on point that I read using [[http://readcomiconline.to/][this website]]. I don't know Marvel as well, though I've heard great things about recent Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.

If you want comedic reviews of bad comics, not unlike The Nostalgia Critic, I recommend checking out Atop The Fourth Wall. All Star Batman & Robin is my favorite (you won't get the running joke about Batman hating rock & roll) along with the Youngblood comics. His style of analysis is what got me into comics.
