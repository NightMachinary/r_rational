The six Titus Crow books:

[[https://archive.org/details/tituscrowburrowe00luml][/The Burrowers Beneath/ and /The Transition of Titus Crow/]]

[[https://archive.org/details/tituscrow00bria][/The Clock of Dreams/ and /Spawn of the Winds/]]

[[https://archive.org/details/tituscrowburrowe03luml][/In the Moons of Borea/ and /Elysia/]]

As an aside, once you borrow a book from the internet archive, most books have the option to download a DRM-protected PDF that'll open in [[https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html][Adobe Digital Editions]] and then expire 2 weeks after you checked out the book.

I'm not making any suggestions, I'm just making a factual statement which is not meant to be taken as an endorsement of any particular course of action; it is incredibly easy to Google the words "pdf drm removal" and find a program which allows you to remove the digital rights management technology from the PDF and keep it permanently (and open it with whatever PDF reader you normally use rather than Digital Editions).

Another fact: Doing such a thing and only borrowing a book for the 5 minutes necessary to convert it and then returning it immediately significantly increases the turnover rate and gives more people the opportunity to read the book. Joining the waitlist for a checked-out book with only a single person ahead of you on the waitlist means you could have to wait for up to a month for the book to become available again, by which time you could have forgotten you were waiting for a book and then miss your 24-hour window to borrow it.

Another fact: Artificial scarcity is stupid.

As for the books I recommended, they're horror/adventure books based on the Lovecraft mythos, but the main character has a clock the size of a coffin which is /bigger on the inside/ which allows him to /travel through the multiverse/. The characters also fight back against the Cthulhuian monsters, instead of just sort of puttering around like the characters in Lovecraft's stories. The writing is pulpish, you can definitely tell it was written in the '70s in emulation of older writing styles. It's like someone stuck Lovecraft, Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Doctor Who into a blender. The story itself is pretty over-the-top, especially later in the series. It's great fun.
