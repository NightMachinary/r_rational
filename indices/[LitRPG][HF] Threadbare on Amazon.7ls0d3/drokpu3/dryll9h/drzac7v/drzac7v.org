I meant it a bit less literally. In LitRPGs the goal of the protagonist is often to seek power for itself, or to hold so much power that no one can control them anymore. In Threadbare, the only reason he's adventuring in the first place is because he loves his little girl and wants her back. I admit, it will be an awesome twist if he ends up the King instead of Celia.
