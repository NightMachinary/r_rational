It's not necessarily that they're unwelcome /per se/, they're just really low value for everyone else on the subreddit. I've removed it, since you've gotten your answer, which is usually what I do in this situation so that the post doesn't just linger in the subreddit. In the future, it would probably be better to ask on either the Monday thread or the Friday thread, or better, in the Discord linked in the sidebar.
