I'd guess something like a god, but not a personal, anthropomorphic god. It seems that Viejo and the rest are angel-esque emanations of the colours based on allusions to the Bible and Quran, referring to powers as "virtures", etc., pre-existing the empowered children but not necessarily aware of their greater whole beyond the vague allusions to rules and goals they have to follow.
