Somehow, I was unaware of this podcast's existence until now. (I think I might have accidentally conflated it with 'The Bayesian Conspiracy'.) But I've just added it to my subscription list, and downloaded the backlog to listen through in order.

I've finished at least one story I meant to be RatFic, am currently pushing forward on another, cancelled one, have another on temporary hiatus, and have yet another in the plotting stage... so I /think/ I could count as a 'rational writer'. Depending on one's definitions. That said, I tend to do poorly with live text-chats, let alone voice; but if you want to exchange some asynchronous text-based emails (I'm DataPacRat at gmail), or the equivalent, some portion of which would get read on your show, I wouldn't object.
