I think one of the most common forms of "writer's block" comes about when a person has an idea for a story, but lacks the confidence to execute it. They become attached to an idea that they've built up in their mind, and they're afraid that once they begin writing, the story that manifests in their word processor won't be as good as the version of the story that existed in their head. So rather than actually writing the story and risk tainting hypothetical perfection, they continue to fantasize about it.

This is how you sometimes wind up with people who have been "working on" a novel for months or even years, but never even written a single page of prose. In the end, you just have to be willing to write that imperfect first draft.
