Special thanks to [[/u/Eaglejarl]] for joining us to discuss the dreaded writer's block, including ways to avoid and get through it!

We're planning other guest episodes in the future, so if you're a rational writer and I haven't reached out to you, send me a message if you're interested in joining us sometime!
