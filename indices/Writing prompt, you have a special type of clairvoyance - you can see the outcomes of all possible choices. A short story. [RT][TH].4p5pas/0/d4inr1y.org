If you can see the outcomes of all possible choices for several years into the future, everything is already solved. Even things that can't be solved in *N* years can have *N* years of results fed into a separate branch (with some overhead for integrating that knowledge).

Not to mention that you don't actually have to cure cancer or whatever. You could set up an experiment to selectively mutate your cells with precise values that lead to you becoming an immortal demigod.

I mean, the search space for even half a year is a truly ridiculous size. If you can examine it in "real time" you're able to solve virtually any problem the human race would ever need to solve.

Cracking a file encrypted with a trillion-bit key? You don't even have to write any code, just find the path that has you correctly decrypting it.

Better than a quantum computer, you're the nexus of a quantum reality. If there exists a possible future contingent on your actions within the time constraint, you can bring it about.

Something as comparatively simple as becoming dictator of the world is small potatoes, frankly.

You could start by transitioning the world to a post-scarcity economy with practical fusion reactors, asteroid mining, and extraplanetary food production; create a friendly AI (guaranteed friendly for at least *N* years, at least); solve the creation of artificial organs and the treatment of every known disease (not to mention discovering and solving plenty of unknown ones); and set humanity on its exponential expansion across the galaxy.

In fact, your biggest concerns are probably going to be to do with managing your own mental state. Seeing the future in such detail will almost inevitably warp your value system. You may choose to trust that this is making you wiser, steering you towards some idealised version of your value system that you don't already have (i.e. filling in the blanks of your underspecified morality), but it's just as likely that your future beliefs would seem abhorrent to your past self.

And how would you tell the difference? Future you will believe their beliefs are correct just as you believe yours are, regardless of whether those two sets are compatible.
