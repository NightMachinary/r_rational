Huh. I suppose that would be one way to make it predictable and thus useful (theoretically; I'm not sure that people /actually/ can exert /that/ much control over how much they value things).

Personally I was going with the assumption I state above, that values are only a certain amount controllable; a lifelong pacifist still has a biological inheritance that says to them 'isn't it great to beat down your enemies?'. So I was thinking, the interest would come in figuring out how to reason about the measurements you're getting.
