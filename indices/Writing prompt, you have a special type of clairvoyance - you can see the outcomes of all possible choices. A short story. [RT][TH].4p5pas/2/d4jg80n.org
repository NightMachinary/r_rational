I think being able to just see choices, without outcomes, would be more interesting. Getting a good constraint on it might be hard, though.

Maybe : if you think of a subject, you get a list of choices you could make relating to that in the next 5 seconds. All of the choices satisfy at least one of your values (you don't know which), and you can tell accurately /how much/ satisfaction will result. However, the amount of satisfaction is determined by measuring the future satisfaction of each of your values and taking the maximum of these, rather than calculating the average, sum, or median.

Is it possible to use this power for actual good, given that it in effect has an alien value system (real you generally doesn't value one thing to the exclusion of all else)?
