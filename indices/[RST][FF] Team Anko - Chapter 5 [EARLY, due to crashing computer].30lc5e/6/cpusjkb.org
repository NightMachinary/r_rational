Nice chapter. The exploration of Anko's backstory this release was interesting; hearing her flunk out and being a worse student than Naruto in the Academy came as a real surprise. As did the horrors of Orochimaru's training.

I loved the 'wha?' reaction all three genin had to hearing Anko's been carrying around mission funds they could've been using instead of personal cash for buying stuff.
