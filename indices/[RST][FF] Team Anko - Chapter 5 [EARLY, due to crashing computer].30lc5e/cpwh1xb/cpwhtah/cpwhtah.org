  Right now it feels slow to me. You carefully and comprehensively explained a lot of backstory so far. However, the main characters are not committed to a big story yet.

This is actually a romance story, but I see where you're coming from. My plan had been: clearly establish the desire for a relationship, clearly establish the character problems that make it non-trivial, and establish the shared experiences that will pull the protagonists together (Specifically, being thrown together for a long period of time on an important and dangerous mission out in the wilderness away from parental chaperones.)

Do you have suggestions on a better way to have handled it?
