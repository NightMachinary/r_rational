Thank you, that's really helpful. I've actually listened to a bunch of Writing Excuses in the past; I've enjoyed it, but not found it that helpful in many cases, because it's short and there's a fair amount of vagueness (EDIT: by this I mean "too high level") in the discussion. Maybe I've just listened to the wrong episodes though; I'll go try the ones you pointed out.
