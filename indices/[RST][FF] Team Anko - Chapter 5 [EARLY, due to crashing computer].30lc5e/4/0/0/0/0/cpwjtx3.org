Anko set a timelimit of 3 days for the provisioning. Time never felt scarce though. That could have been more tense, but it was an arbitrary limit anyways. There is no time pressure whatsoever on Anko herself as far as I remember.

All danger so far is tell not show. We have never seen samurai winning against ninja. All threats have been navigated around. Everything works according to the plan. Compare Worm, where there is also a lot of planning (offscreen), but then everything goes haywire anyways. Worm overuses this imho. However, Naruto overachieving the Poker task is the other extreme. Idea in the casino: Suddenly "Everybody stay calm! We have a cheater here!". 20 samurai surround the room. Naruto is about to create some shadow clones. Hinata/Anko signs him to wait. The samurai capture someone else. Result: We have seen Samurai in action and know better how dangerous they are. Even more awesome by our main characters. We learned that all plans might require improvisation, which makes future planning more interesting. You could even end that chapter in between for a cliffhanger.

Another idea: Have someone follow them as the leave the village. Makes covering the tracks more urgent. There is the mystery why they are followed and by whom. It requires some denouement later, though. Maybe it was just someone Anko hired for the lulz ... eh ... for teaching.
