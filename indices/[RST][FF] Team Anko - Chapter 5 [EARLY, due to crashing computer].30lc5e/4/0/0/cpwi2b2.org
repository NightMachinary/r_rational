You could try to increase the tension by hinting at future problems building up.

The most bland hinting is a prophecy, but afaik no prophecies in Naruto.

You could do short cut somewhere else. This implies the reader knows more than the characters, but you can keep it vague. Ideas: Some HyÅ«ga notices and follows them; Land of Lightning/Sound/Waterfall sending some ninjas into the buffer zone; Fire Daimyo/Hokage gets info about additional dangers for their mission; Orochimaru starts a search for Anko; Someone in the casino noticed their cheating and is sending Samurai after them; Their disguise during equipment-buying was not as successful as they thought.

A whole second story line is probably not fitting for your story. I noticed this in other stories. Whenever some main character has a long and boring talk, somewhere else some exciting things are happening or at least a cliffhanger to keep the tension.
