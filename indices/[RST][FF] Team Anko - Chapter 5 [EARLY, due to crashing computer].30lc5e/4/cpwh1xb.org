Right now it feels slow to me. You carefully and comprehensively explained a lot of backstory so far. However, the main characters are not committed to a big story yet.

Is the story about the route to the Republic? Anko's team could drop out of the action after their mapping job as well. Is it about Hinata's abuse and the related clan politics? Then this mapping mission seems to drag on too much.

In the sense of wise reading, these are my current thoughts. However, this is the first time I am reading a fanfic "live". I usually read them when they are finished, so I do not have to wait for the next chapter.
