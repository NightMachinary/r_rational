Well, Anko's lewdness can be derived from her character, considering we really don't see her in casual settings in the series. The most casual we get is when she's the proctor (in which she cuts Naruto, drapes herself over him and licks him) Every other time we encounter her (that I can recall) it's in fairly serious situations, so we wouldn't notice if she was actually lewd. However, her standard ninja attire is a mesh body suit, a skirt and a trenchcoat. Now, in looking at pictures of her, it's ambiguous whether she's naked or not under it. There isn't any other clothing drawn under the suit. You would see the dividing line of fabric vs skin if there was. So it's safe to assume she's just wearing that. And a woman who's standard ninja attire is that? She's clearly trying to make some sort of statement in that area. She's not going to dress like that and be super-professional.
