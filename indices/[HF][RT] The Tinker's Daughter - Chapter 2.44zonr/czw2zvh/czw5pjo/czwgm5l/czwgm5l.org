The illogical part being where they leave the girl alive and free. Also letting the Robbot free and unharmed. Unless their plan is to observe and learn of course.

Also regarding 3 rubicks for thinking, would it be possible to hide them with a layer of regular metal and allow greater processing power?

As for the lack of emotional response in face of death, I feel my views are limited on that mater. No one of importance to me died. The closest I got was one of my aunts, and my reactions were slight reminders of her not being with us anymore, anytime I would be in her neighbourhood.

"No more cookies at Aunties place" or "Aunt is gone" or "Auntie is dead"

So dont listen too much to my thoughts on feelings.
