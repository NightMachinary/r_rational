This all reads great and has a nice plot to go, the downsides I see so far are:

1.Lack of sufficient emotional response by protag.

1. Illogical plan by agents of murder.

2. Survival plan is going a little too easy, the dinner job was pure luck.

This all indicates either some plan by forces that be for protag, or your choice to skip the rebound parts and go on to plot and powerup. Or something else entirely. Or just accident. Or I am reading too much into this.

Rob is great, character definition and behavior is also great, but character descriptions are bit weak, how does Jess look like, how does Rob look like? 3 legs? 3 arms? humanoid build, tall, short, stocky, caricature-ish?

Its possible I overlooked descriptions, so pls forgive. Feel free to repeat character appearance, in context to actions or similar though.
