  Rob was described in this chapter as a coatrack (spine) with a big box on top (head), three nested Rubik's cubes in the middle (body), and a spot just below the body where three legs go down and three arms of varying sizes go up. looks back I thought I had described Jess at the beginning but apparently I did not. Oops; that's quite an oversight. I'll add it in next chapter and probably retcon it into chapter 1 as well. Thanks for pointing that out.

Oh, this reminded me: I felt that the description of the race itself wasn't clear enough, and had to read it twice to be able to understand what had happened. Was it only my problem?
