  Illogical plan by agents of murder.

What about it do you feel was illogical?

  Its possible I overlooked descriptions, so pls forgive. Feel free to repeat character appearance, in context to actions or similar though.

Rob was described in this chapter as a coatrack (spine) with a big box on top (head), three nested Rubik's cubes in the middle (body), and a spot just below the body where three legs go down and three arms of varying sizes go up.

/looks back/ I thought I had described Jess at the beginning but apparently I did not. Oops; that's quite an oversight. I'll add it in next chapter and probably retcon it into chapter 1 as well. Thanks for pointing that out.

  1.Lack of sufficient emotional response by protag.

This is a weakness of my writing style that I'm aware of and trying to focus on more. I tend to have an external view of events and don't get inside the characters' heads. I'll have more of it next chapter.
