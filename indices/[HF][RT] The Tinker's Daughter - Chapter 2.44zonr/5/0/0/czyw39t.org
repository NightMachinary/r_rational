The explanation regarding Rob's variable intelligence for sure, although I have a small doubt: since he has gone into a general purpose build that has limited his capability in various fields, how come he still has the advanced visual processing required to accurately throw heavy objects around so that they land exactly where he wants them to?

Aside from that, I like how you characterized the protagonist. In the betting situation she behaved at the beginning in the same way a normal girl her age would have, with only later on taking control of her emotions and taking a more rational approach with visible difficulty.

Definitely curious to see how this project continues. It could indeed become a good enough story to overshadow your previous magnum opus.
