  I think my favorite part this chapter was when Rob "accidentally" knocks the block of wood and we begin to see exactly how the race is going to go >:-).

Thanks. This battle was actually an interesting thing to write. I kept trying to plan it out and getting nowhere. Then I just started writing and it unfolded in front of me. It was very satisfying.

  Interested to see how you're going to deal with losing her father and entire home. I kind of expected it to hit in the morning, but people deal with things differently and there is clearly something going on with mana that we're not privy to yet.

The mana thing isn't messing with her emotions -- mana is just energy that you get by eliminating potential world-states. Jess is just doing everything she can to keep from thinking about it.

That's the Watsonian answer, anyway. Doylist, I tend to get focused on events and forget to do emotional response; it's a failing that I'm working on.
