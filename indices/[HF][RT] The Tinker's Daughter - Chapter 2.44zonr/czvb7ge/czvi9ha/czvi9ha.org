I'm glad you liked it. And yes, I was thinking about Robot Wars and Junkyard Wars when I wrote it. I remember hearing from one of those shows that the dominant bodyplan had become 'wedge shaped rammers intending to flip the opponent over' -- this might have had some impact on the chapter. :>

As to the probability stuff -- pretty much what [[/u/xamueljones]] said.
