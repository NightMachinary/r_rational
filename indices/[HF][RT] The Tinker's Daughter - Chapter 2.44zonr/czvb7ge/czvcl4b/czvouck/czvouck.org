Ahh! I somehow overlooked the 50:1 shift, and misunderstood what they were talking about! For some reason I thought they were trying to convince her not to bet on Rob, when upon rereading they were trying to convince her to take Rob out of the race altogether (the 'slot' for the race, not for betting).

--And, yes, the effect on others makes sense if it's being compared to 'if there's a more competent robot using the same slot'.

Thank you both!
