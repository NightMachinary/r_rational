It's been a while for me, but think of betting odds as probability mass. If the odds of one racers goes up, then the odds of all the other racers must go down to compensate. Since the odds on Rob winning went from 30:1 to 50:1, then all of the other mechs must be seen as more likely to win with lowers odds adjusted, which means they have a smaller pay-out in that scenario. If a 'better' mech was used instead of Rob, then their mechs are perceived as being less likely to win with a larger pay-out when they win.

I don't know where you read that the other mechs are less likely to win just because she put money on Rob, it's not anywhere in the chapter that I can find.
