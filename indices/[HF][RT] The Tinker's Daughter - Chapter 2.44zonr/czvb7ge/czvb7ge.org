Cathartic! The television series 'Robot Wars' comes to mind.

May I ask about the 'cramping the ratings'/'screwing up the odds' concept? If the odds are changing to treat the other robots as being less likely to win since she put money on Rob, meaning that the payoff is bigger if a non-Rob robot does win (which could be at least partly paid for by the money she unsuccessfully put on Rob), why should people counting on(/assuming) a non-Rob robot winning be unhappy about the change to the odds?
