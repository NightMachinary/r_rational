Well, he did drop a heavy sheet of metal on top of Yanno's mech. He was trying not to specifically take out any of the mechs with direct strikes, because then it would be clear in people's minds that he had deliberately attacked. This was all just him being clumsy, right? The fact that he caused the destruction of every other mech on the field (aside from the hopper)...well, that's just luck, right? Much like a Jackie Chan battle.
