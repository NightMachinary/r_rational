  Maybe I'm imagining him throwing much more, and much heavier, rubble around than he actually is, then.

It wasn't as heavy as you'd think; his lifting arm is stronger than a human, but not by a lot. His mid arm is about average human strength, and his fine arm is quite weak but very dextrous.

  My thought was that he was throwing enough around that I'd expect at least one direct hit, and the lack thereof would be evidence toward him actively aiming away from his opponents.
#+end_quote

Not that much, no. Probably ~10-12 pieces total.
