Maybe I'm imagining him throwing much more, and much heavier, rubble around than he actually is, then. My thought was that he was throwing enough around that I'd expect at least one direct hit, and the lack thereof would be evidence toward him actively aiming /away/ from his opponents.

And, yes, I agree that "That's just luck, right?" is a pretty reasonable conclusion for the onlookers right now. I'd give the grad students the least bad chance, and then only if they start getting suspicious for other reasons.
