Wow. Rob is smart. /Really/ smart. Maybe even /too/ smart, to be honest to him. He's, what, ten or twenty times the mass of any other robot on the field? Every single one of the opponents was disabled by pathological environmental obstacles placed by his throws. I'd be hard pressed to do that myself, even if I were strong enough to do it. It's very surprising that not even one of his targets was killed just by being hit by being hit by something heavy moving fast. Maybe Rob's intellectual bent is showing through? "I refuse to dirty my hands with something as crude as a thrown rock. My methods will be more refined. Unless it's that guy's mech. /That/ I'm going to beat to death with my bare feet." :P

That said, I doubt anybody's going to come up with that suspicion. That'd be so far outside their hypothesis space that it's not even funny.

Good story. :D
