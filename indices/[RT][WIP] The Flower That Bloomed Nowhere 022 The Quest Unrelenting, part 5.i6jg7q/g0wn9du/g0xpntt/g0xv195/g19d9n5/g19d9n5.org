Unwrapping a really awful present is a great way to put it, and it's a big part why I'm enjoying the story. I did a re-read to remember the stuff I read months ago, gonna take a stab at figuring some things out.

The method for becoming an arcanist (specifically, becoming able to use the Power) involves another person dying. Bardiya says that he couldn't cast because he hadn't gone through a recognition ceremony, and his circumstances suggest that the ceremony is a hard requirement and not a tradition.

Maybe the recognition part of the ceremony means more than just "recognized as an arcanist"? Could the ceremony involve an intentional prosognostic event?

Also, I wonder if this is a /secret/ to the general population. We don't get to know what Ptolema's question was going to be, but what if it was something along the lines of "Is she an arcanist?" or "Is she in the know?". Mehit isn't an arcanist, but since she's Lilith's mother, she might have had to been given an explanation.

Utsu's acclimation log seems to be a standard item, even if she isn't using it as intended. Maybe the recognition ceremony involves somehow supplanting or (metaphorically) consuming another person? Utsu's litany is possibly how she answered those prompts before her recognition ceremony. Post-ceremony, the typical usage of the log would be to track how much association you have with those statements, to make sure the original person is still in control, with expected answers being on the high range instead of the low range.

Utsu seems to be using it the opposite way, keeping track of a vestige in hopes that it can be one day resscurected. Which would mean that our narrator isn't the original Utsu, but the person who has supplanted her. So who is the narrator if that's the case?

My best guess is that Utsu's grandfather tried to copy either himself or a dead loved one over to Utsu's body, with the help of Samium's Egomancy.

I'm leaning towards himself, although a version of himself that's more like the core of the person as opposed to a perfect copy complete with memories. The narrator thinks of Utsu's grandfather as a seperate person, and that the relation between the two of them is weird. A successor fits that much more cleanly than a perfect copy.

I'm having trouble figuring out how much of Utsu's situation is because of whatever her grandfather did, and how much is because of the recognition ceremony. The most straightforward guess would be that her grandfather's actions caused the ceremony to go wrong, leaving the wrong ego in charge of the body instead of the original Utsu?

I think the thing that's confusing me is that there are multiple layers to this. Thinking about it in terms of what Ran knows, Utsu's grandfather did /something/ to Utsu, and so she decided to work with Utsu to get invited into the Order so that they could do /something/ (and that /something/ isn't finding Samium since they didn't know he was there until recently).

But Ran (and everyone else) don't know the whole truth. So what's the difference between what Ran thinks happened and what actually happened, and what's the difference between why Ran thinks they're here and why they're actually here? Not confident enough to guess on that yet.

That's all I've got for now. I'm satisfied with the broad strokes but I think I'm still missing an important portion. I had a lot of fun (and stayed up way too late) getting my thoughts in order about this. For what it's worth, I've always appreciated putting together the slow trickle of information so I'm glad you wrote it this way.

Some other thoughts on the story:

Why is Utsu's grandfather's name blacked out? Utsu can see the name just fine, so it doesn't seem like a mental block. Unless it's a mental block that also blocks you realizing that something is wrong?

Who left the note in Utsu's book? Nindar could have just told Utsu his concerns if it were him. Sacnicte is the obvious guess, but I don't think there's a way to rule out anyone yet.

It's impossible to say without a wider sample, but the class has more conditional or even missing resistances that I would have guessed, especially considering that militaries can be picky enough to turn away even soldiers with less than perfect resistances. Utsu's compromised neurological resistance makes sense but there are at least four with less than solid M and two with less than solid A. As far as I can tell we haven't learned why any of those characters might have less than AMN resistances, but thinking about it that's probably pretty personal business that Utsu wouldn't know or ask about.

Also, resistances and how they work in combat is a pretty cool system.

It was a bit odd reading a discussion about meritists now that the context has been removed. I would have been fine if I hadn't read the info from the previous version, but now I'm going in with half-remembered details I can't go back and check. Honestly I still think you made the right call in removing it though.

Overall, the tension is nice and high and I'm very interested in seeing where all of this goes.
