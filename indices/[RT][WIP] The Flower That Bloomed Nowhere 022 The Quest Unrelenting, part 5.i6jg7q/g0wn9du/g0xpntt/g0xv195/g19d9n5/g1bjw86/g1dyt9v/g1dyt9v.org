    and so she decided to work with Utsu to get invited into the Order so that they could do something (and that something isn't finding Samium since they didn't know he was there until recently).

  Could you elaborate a little bit on the conclusion you've drawn here? I ask because it makes me worried I might've made a mistake or created an unintentional impression through the process of doing the edits, since you're taking something here as a given that wasn't intended by me to be.

I'm not quite taking the above as a given, just more thinking out loud. It does seem likely to me though.

In the conversation Utsu and Ran have in the cafe, Ran mentions that it's funny that her first reaction to getting invited to the Order was being annoyed, and how she'd forgotten why she wanted to get into the class in the first place. She also talks about how the thing they're working towards got dropped into her lap. I read that as their goal was to become renowned as healers to the point where they could get invited to join the Order as members, so they could do whatever it is they're trying to do. Their class getting invited to do presentations just happened to be a massive shortcut to that goal.

In Autonoe's letter (that is sent after the class is invited), it says that Samium is in the care of the Order. Ran and Utsu have been planning this for years, so they can't have been trying to get into the Order just because of this letter.

I definitely ignored some other possibilites though. They could have already known Samium was with the Order and the letter was confirmation, or maybe they just wanted to get information about Samium from the Order. Or it could just be that the goal has actually been getting something from Samium the whole time. The invite to the Order was just another thing they had to do for the class, and the lucky break was finding out that Samium was there.

  I could upload the removed content, if you were just curious. There's nothing in there that would compromise the story.

Yeah I wouldn't mind re-reading it if you wouldn't mind throwing it in a paste bin.
