  I was confused why Lilith called Su a 'murderer' - the implication being that all arcanists are - why?

This is something that's probably possible to guess at this point, but only if you've been paying pretty close attention to a bunch of specific details in the story. Likewise for the whole sequence with Su at the end of the chapter.

I'm kinda second-guessing myself a bit in my original choice to not outright explain parts of the worldbuilding and the main dilemma of the protagonist, but instead have it be revealed slowly over the course of the first arc. My hope was that it would add to the intrigue of the mystery - which really starts from the very first chapter - and preserve a lot of pacing and tonal buildup that would be lost otherwise. I wanted to capture the feeling of slowly unwrapping a really awful present.

I'm not sure how well it's worked, though?
