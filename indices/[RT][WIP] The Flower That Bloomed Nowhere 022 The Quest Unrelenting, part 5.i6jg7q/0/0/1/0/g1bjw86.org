Wow, this is really in-depth speculation! It's obvious you've thought about the story a lot. I'm very flattered by your interest!

I feel like this deserves a more extensive reply, but obviously, I can't say too much at this point given the content of the post. However, to address a few things specifically:

#+begin_quote
  and so she decided to work with Utsu to get invited into the Order so that they could do something (and that something isn't finding Samium since they didn't know he was there until recently).
#+end_quote

Could you elaborate a little bit on the conclusion you've drawn here? I ask because it makes me worried I might've made a mistake or created an unintentional impression through the process of doing the edits, since you're taking something here as a given that wasn't intended by me to be.

#+begin_quote
  Why is Utsu's grandfather's name blacked out? Utsu can see the name just fine, so it doesn't seem like a mental block. Unless it's a mental block that also blocks you realizing that something is wrong?
#+end_quote

I'll clarify this one, since I thought it was made clear by the narration, but I guess it's a little too vague. Utsushikome is deliberately withholding the name from the reader/refusing to acknowledge it, despite the fact that she and the other characters can see it just fine.

  It was a bit odd reading a discussion about meritists now that the context has been removed. I would have been fine if I hadn't read the info from the previous version, but now I'm going in with half-remembered details I can't go back and check. Honestly I still think you made the right call in removing it though.
#+end_quote

It was a bit of a tough call to remove it - the problem with a story in a limited setting like this is that there's a lot of exposition that /needs/ to happen by certain beats in the narrative, or else they'll just fall flat due to the reader not understanding the terminology or context, but only so much space for them. I really wanted to have the basics of political terminology in this setting clarified by the time of this chapter, but there wasn't really a point that I could do it where it didn't feel clunky or slow the story down, which is why I ended up removing that section.

My hope is that people will be willing to just accept only understanding the broad strokes of this part as it is now until further expansion is given later. I'm sorry that the change messed up the experience for you personally, though! Editing a serial is always something done for new readers then ends up being sort of at the expense of the old, which sucks - it's one of the main reasons I hemmed and hawed over changing the stuff I did.

I could upload the removed content, if you were just curious. There's nothing in there that would compromise the story.
