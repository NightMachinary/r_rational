I was bothered a bit by the Marty Stu-ishness of the protagonist, so I read the web novel because, well, how can such a consistent universe have such a glaring flaw? And I was satisfied to see the web novel doing a bang up job of showing more of his faults and uncertainties and methods than the series, though at the expense of NOT being able to see everyone else's scheming.
