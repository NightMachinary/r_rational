I did actually find the post to be compelling. The OP very clearly is passionate about Nirvana in Fire, and went to great lengths to allow people to easily begin watching or reading. If I was interested in actually watching the show, I would have found the political structure and relationship guides to be immensely helpful. Political intrigues aren't my thing and I had no interest in watching, but it wasn't hard for me to skip past the guides to the outro.

Besides, since I'm not going to watch or read NiF, I'm no longer the target audience of the post. The irrelevance of the long list of the cast and rank structure isn't meant to for me at that point.
