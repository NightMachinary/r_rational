Great, great story. Recommended. The TV series is superb. The webnovel requires a lot more patience; I'd recommend people go to the TV series, not the webnovel.

This story is "smart character with a cunning plan, versus a genuinely huge problem." /Count of Monte Cristo/ with more brains, more scheming, and gorgeous ancient Chinese settings.

It's not a true Fair Play Intrigue. There are a few unreasonable pieces of good luck for the protagonist, and a few times where he gets an Idiot Ball so things will be more dramatic. But /much/ of the story is fair-play rational. (Fair play among the characters, that is. As the viewer you're not told everything important right off. Part of the story appeal is watching the secrets unfold and seeing how it all fits together.)

Great, smart, high-stakes fun.
