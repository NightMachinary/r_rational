Let me take this opportunity to ask: besides NIF (which I've already watched---seconding its recommendation!), what are some of the most rational live-action TV shows out of Asia, such as you might find on Viki? Not necessarily rational in absolute terms; just the top "least irrational" entries in the category.

Double points for it being a romance and managing to entirely avoid irrationality-driven romantic conflict. (My SO watches a lot of romantic dramas, and I'd love to find one we could both enjoy.)
