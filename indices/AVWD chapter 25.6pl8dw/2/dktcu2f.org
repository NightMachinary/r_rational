A very interesting take on an issue I'd never thought about! It somewhat reminds me of the conundrum people have with rape babies (those who feel that fetuses are legitimate humans anyway)

On the one hand, it definitely sucks that your mind was cloned/you were penetrated without your consent.

On the other hand, pushing the abort button on that new life sucks too!
