  Is the "Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperium" distinction of kinds of status something you believe and are trying to transmit, or just something you've made Erika believe?

It's a model of social power that seems useful in a descriptive sense. I think there are natural "joints" between power from status/law/personal power, for example, and so the Roman's framework makes sense to me.

  I feel oddly called out :P

Hopefully Erika put some of that worry to rest ;)
