/sigh/

Previously at the end of the last chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Red!"

Beginning of current chapter: "Ugh, it's not a Red chapter. Who cares about Blue? I just want to get to Red already!"

End of current chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Blue!"

Beginning of the next chapter: "Ugh, it's not a Blue chapter. Who cares about Leaf? I just want to get to Blue already!"

End of the next chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Leaf!"

Having three protagonists is doing wonders for your story with the interweaving natures of Blue's, Red's, and Leaf's coming-of-age journey/self-discovery, but at the end of every chapter, I'm tormented with the /need/ to find out what happens next to that person and have to wait at least 3 chapters to find out!
