All fixed, though I think I'm going to plant a grammar flag on this one:

#+begin_quote
  mix of negative emotions chase -> chases
#+end_quote

Ontologically it's not one thing, the word "mix" just makes it seem like it is. It's not like a physical mixture of things into a single liquid or paste, it's multiple things occurring at once.
