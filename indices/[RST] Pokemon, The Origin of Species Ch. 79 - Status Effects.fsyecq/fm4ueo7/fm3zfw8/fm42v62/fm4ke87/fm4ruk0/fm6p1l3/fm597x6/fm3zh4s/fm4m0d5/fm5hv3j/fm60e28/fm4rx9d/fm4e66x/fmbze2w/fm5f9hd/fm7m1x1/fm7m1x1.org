Status eh?\\
Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperius.\\
Can't say those concepts feel very intuitive to me. But I don't deal with status much. This memeplex made sense to me, when I read it thru it all ages ago:\\

Forgot almost all about it, though.\\
Potestas maps to ascribed status.\\
Auctoritas possibly maps to achieved status?\\
But I don't see how Imperius maps to Embodied status.\\
Though the ascribed/achieved/emboided trio is explicitly a model for male status, so not something that would work for Erika ðŸ¤”

I think a Champion challenging a Professor would also not work for the same reason, the Champion doesn't have any Imperius in the academic realm.
