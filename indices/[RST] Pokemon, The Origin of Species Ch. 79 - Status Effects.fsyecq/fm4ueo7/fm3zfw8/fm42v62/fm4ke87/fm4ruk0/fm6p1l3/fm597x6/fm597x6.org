  At 29 she's the youngest member in the Indigo League, and he remembers being star-struck by her the last time they met.

This is playing a bit of a ruckus with my mental model of gym leaders' ages, though. Wasn't it said in one of Mewtwo's chapters that Sabrina was a teenager when he awakened, and that now that ten years have passed she is in her twenties? I remember it being something like "A lot has changed in the last ten years, some people have gone and some new arrived ...... Sabrina has changed too, she is now a gym leader and has grown from being a teenager and is now in her twenties." Then, How can Erika be 29 and the youngest?

Also, a bit of a side note, but, What about Bugsy? Johto's leaders are part of the Indigo League too, aren't they?
