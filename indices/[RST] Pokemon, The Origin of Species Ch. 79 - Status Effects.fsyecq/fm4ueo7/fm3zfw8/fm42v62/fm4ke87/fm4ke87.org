  He'd missed his chance at a vulpix yesterday, but got a houndour just before they broke for camp instead, which he's definitely satisfied with.

Is this a nod to version exclusivity in the games? Very cheeky, if so!

Also, I was racking my brain trying to think of what the new pokemon could be, and was definitely thrown off by Blue and co.'s guesses. But then I finally thought of porygon, which would make total sense. Blue's list of prizes lines up with the games, so it would make sense for porygon to be the big prize. And it fits Silph's claim of stolen goods, as they invented porygon. If my guess is correct, I'm very interested in seeing how it plays into the story, as it's one of my favorite 'mons!
