Caught up in chapters recently and I can see that I'm going to experience withdrawal symptoms every month. Have to say that this story became remarkably good from what I considered to be shaky beginnings.

There seems to be a deliberate tension in this chapter between the strict and the permissive that I found very effective. I was expecting hippies and got lectured on Roman civil ideas about power by a kimono-wearing Japanese Pokemon gym leader who makes her own possibly mind-altering bayleef tea. Hope she keeps being oddly normal.

[[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]], Do you think you can find time to make a concise list of the main influences (of any kind) on this story, especially on the main characters? I remember Dawkins being quoted by Red. I get the feeling that many of the ideas presented so far have gone over my head because I'm unfamiliar with the cultures and people behind them.
