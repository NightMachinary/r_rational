Really good chapter! I like the way it seems to be going in this gym; Erika's laying out the ulterior motives in the conversation and then talking Blue around to a mutually beneficial arrangement was super interesting, as is our seeing more of Blue's attempts to avoid being, well, the rival character who stomps you down. I'll gladly look forward to next month!
