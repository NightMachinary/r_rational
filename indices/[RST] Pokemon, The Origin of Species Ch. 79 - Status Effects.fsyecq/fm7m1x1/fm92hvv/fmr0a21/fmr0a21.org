I've been reading through Ashes of the Past recently (not very rational, but a fun ride), and Giovanni [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7262793/43/Ashes-of-the-Past][suggests]] a classification of eight powers, which he names after Pokemon moves, eg "Superpower" is the ability to compel through force, "Hidden Power" refers to influence through company ownership, "Secret Power" is favours owed and goodwill, etc.
