I liked the exploration of status and Erika's perspective on growing things for mutual benefit. I can't really invest into any of Blue's companions, except maybe Elaine. They're NPCs. It feels less like Blue is leading them and more like he's the cool kid in his group. Overall, I still look forward to Red's arc and the Mewtwo interludes the most.
