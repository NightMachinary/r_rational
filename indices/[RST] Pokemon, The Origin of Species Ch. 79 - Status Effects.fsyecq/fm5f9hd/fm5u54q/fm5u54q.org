I'm pretty sure it would be a big scandal for a gym leader to drug a visitor and challenger.

And looking at the wording of their agreement, I don't think it's binding on anyone else. He said that, "Everyone on my group can get in on it," and he certainly viewed that as a great opportunity for them, but if someone said, "No, I'm just going to face the gym like normal," then nothing stops that and Erika would still keep Blue in an advisory role.
