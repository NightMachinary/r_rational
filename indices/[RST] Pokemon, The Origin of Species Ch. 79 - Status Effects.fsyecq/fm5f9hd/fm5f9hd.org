I can't help but feel like him accepting the deal without talking to the group is a mistake. Like for sure the group is arguably "his" but it feels like an over commitment of his uhh authority? i'm not sure what the word would be. But like he has de facto leadership, but i'm not sure that he has or explicitly has the kind of authority over the group to make this kind of long term commitment in the entire group's name.

Like he outright states that he doesn't know parts of the group that well and that he is to a certain degree alienated(?) distanced(?) something by the fact that he's the trainer leader of a group of trainers. There's a conversation about not overstepping the bounds of your authority and that moment feels like he may have.

Also do we see Erika drink from the bayleef tea? It would be kind of a multi-level reference that she was "causing a status effect" on Blue while negotiating and that i'm not sure if Blue himself was wary enough about it, while it's not as egregious as doing the same for say Koga the poison master it is kind of hard for us to not make the leap of Gym and Gym Leader doing drugs to mildly drugging someone while negotiating.
