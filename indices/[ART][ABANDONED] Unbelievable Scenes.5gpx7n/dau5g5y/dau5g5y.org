Adapted from [[https://qntm.org/unbelievable][Unbelievable Scenes]], by Sam Hughes.

Drawn about four years ago. Thought I lost it in a computer reinstall, but was glad I found them in an external hard drive. I'm proud of the first few pages, but the rest lose much of that quality. And also cut exactly zero words. Not the best adaptation.

Learned about all-caps comic-writing, though.
