It's the first chapter of [[https://qntm.org/unbelievable][Fine Structure]], graphically illustrated by that guy who posted it. A completed semi-rational (internally consistent with intelligent characters, but not specifically written to be in this genre) serial. It has its flaws, but I really liked it. Would recommend you check it out.
