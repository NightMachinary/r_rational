This probably isn't the place, since it isn't really written fiction, but if anyone is interested in giving input to a DnD 5e setting with rationalist elements, shoot me a PM or something? The quick TL;DR is that in a very grimdark world, walled-off cities (ala /Tales of Vesperia/ or /The Caves of Steel/) exist by pushing spells like /Plant Growth/, /Goodberry/, /Regenerate/, etc to their limits. Mostly looking for people to bounce ideas off of as far as economics and the like, so DnD knowledge isn't really necessary.
