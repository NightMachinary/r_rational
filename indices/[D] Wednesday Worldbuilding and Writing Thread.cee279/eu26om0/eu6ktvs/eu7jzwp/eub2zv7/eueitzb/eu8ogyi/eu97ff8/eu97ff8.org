The world is otherwise just like ours.

They do not appear to be the same individuals. The wolves' colorations were different, and the deer in the video was male, while the city-deer was female.

Local zoologists have no idea where the wolves came from. There haven't been any reports of wolves travelling this far south before, nor any reports of the animals crossing through Maryland or other northerly states to get here.

It's also unknown where the wolves are bedding down. They are elusive. Their sightings are rare, and scattered all over the state.
