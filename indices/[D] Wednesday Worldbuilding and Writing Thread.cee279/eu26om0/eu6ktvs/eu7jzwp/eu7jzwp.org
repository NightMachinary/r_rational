You are living in a small city in Virginia, USA.

Recently, there have been news reports of wolves being sighted in the countryside. Not in the Appalachians: down among the fields and pastures, wandering about. Strangely, there have been no reports of them attacking livestock, or indeed anything at all.

In fact, a few weeks back there was a video that went viral, depicting a white-tailed deer and a wolf walking together along the edge of a horse pasture. The pair were seen from behind, walking side-by-side, before hopping over a gate and disappearing from sight.

While only yesterday, there was a news story about a wolf and a deer being sighted within your home-city. The pair were out late at night, running through the city streets, the wolf seemingly pursuing the deer. They were seen by CCTV cameras, and a handful of people who were out late. The sightings began in a neighbourhood in the south of the city, and ended near a parking garage in the east of the city, covering a distance of about 4 kilometers. Where the wolf and deer went afterwards, or what became of the deer, are unknown.

What would you think is happening, based on this information?
