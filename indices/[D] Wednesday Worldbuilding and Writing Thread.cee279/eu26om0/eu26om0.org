I've been doing some work on /Glimwarden/, preparing it for when it finally goes out of hiatus, and thinking about the problem of having a bookworm in a world that has no books in common with Earth. Basically, all of the books will either have their contents understood from context, or have their contents described enough to make the point, and will have to be sufficiently generic or recognizable so that the audience can connect. It's something that I've been thinking a lot about, mostly as a microcosm of the larger issue, which is that I'll be going from a world where I can freely reference 2017 American culture, to one where there are parallel books, thinkers, politicians, etc. It feels like I'll be losing a lot of freedom, but I'm more concerned about making sure that loss of context is going to be dealt with in a way that doesn't hurt the work.
