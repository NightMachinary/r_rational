Man, if you disliked the movie adaptation then you'll /hate/ what they did for the visual novel adaptation. Completely butchered the MC in favour of making her more appealing for younger audiences. Honestly, I don't know how Gretchen let it pass - the studio (Gyusu Limited) had a reputation for being unfaithful to what they were adapting. The best adaptation I've seen of Gretchen's work was honestly his collection of short stories, Heverfield Chronicles. It wasn't great, necessarily, I think the serial format of the collection would have lent itself better to a TV show rather than a movie, but the acting was well done and Seffet Onnings absolutely /nailed/ Destarte.
