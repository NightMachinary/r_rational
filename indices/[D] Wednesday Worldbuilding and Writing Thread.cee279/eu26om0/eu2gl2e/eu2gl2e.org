I think that it should probably be more fine than would be expected. Not because it's in easy topic to do justice, per se, but rather that a lot of the time people don't understand actual references anyway, and they still enjoy the media. There is a level of 'if you're reading a book then you'll be more likely to have read other books and thus understand the reference', but if I were to read "It reminded of Gretchen's work. Cold, and unrepentantly pessimistic, but enjoyable", Then it wouldn't matter that I didn't know who Gretchen was (I made him up just now), because I would be able to understand what was being implied by the reference anyway.

I guess I could have shortened this down by saying that because most references are going to have to be made palatable to people who don't understand them anyway, fake references can be treated pretty much the same.
