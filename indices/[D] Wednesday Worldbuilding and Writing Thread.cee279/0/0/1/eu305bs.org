I recently finished the first Mistborn trilogy which does something similar for its bookworm character. Any time an author or book is mentioned it's tied to a concept or idea. I don't think this is too different from how one might reference real texts or modern culture, presumably because not all readers will have read or experienced the media being referenced. Some level of explanation is required either way.
