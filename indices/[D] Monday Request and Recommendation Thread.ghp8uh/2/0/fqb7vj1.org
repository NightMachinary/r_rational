WRT Dune, I'm gonna recommend the first 4. They successively get more and more complex, and take more and more effort to fully parse, but IMO they're worth it. They go deeper and deeper into the horrific tragedy that is the existence of prescience, and the fourth concludes in the only way it possibly could.

You can pretty much stop after any if you get tired, and I wouldn't say that any of these spoil the first. (I cannot say the same for the later books).

That said, I found that it's taking me many re-reads to feel like I fully grasp them, but each re-read I feel like I 'get' one more of them. (I finished my 3rd re-read mid-2019, and finally felt like I understood the 2nd. The 3rd will have to wait for next time).

I will /also/ rec some of Frank Herbert's other works, including my second favourite book of all time: The Godmakers, which is set in a totally different universe, but goes deeper into his explorations of society and it's relationship with religion, but is much shorter, and IMO, tighter. (He also has the Jesus Incident, which is good, but not as good as Dune.
