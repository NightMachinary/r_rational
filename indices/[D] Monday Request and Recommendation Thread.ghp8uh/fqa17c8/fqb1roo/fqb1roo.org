In the Dune series I'd recommend reading the first three books by Frank Herbert: /Dune/, /Dune Messiah/, and /Children of Dune/.

In comparison to the first book, /Dune Messiah/ and /Children of Dune/ have plots that aren't as fast paced or finely focused on the goals of a single character, but it my opinion they still have plenty of action, intrigue and suspense woven in with fascinating worldbuilding. Their outlook on the world created by Muad'Dib's victory is much bleaker, but also more nuanced than the relatively simple 'good guys win' ending of the first book.
