Hello all. I hope youre all staying well in this time of quarantine.

Due to only working every other week I have been burning through my lists of books and fanfics.

I just finished Baru Cormorant and was hoping for something similar to it. I have the sequel lined up to read and will probably finish that today or tomorrow.

Id love some fanfica of boku no hero of similar quality to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/chapters/32073363][From Muddy Waters]]. Ive read the My Hero School is Going Wrong, As Expected mash up. I want whatever youve got that's good quality and either updating regularly or finished. No dead works please.

Additionally I just finished my reread of Dune. Are the sequels worth reading? Ive heard mixed reviews on them and dont want to read them if they spoil the excellence that was Dune.

Additionally Id like to recommend an anime that has kept me motivated to be active during the quarantine. How Heavy Are the Dumbbells That You Lift? Is not rational but motivating with interesting characters that all become interested in working out at a fascimile of Gold's Gym. It's light and uplifting and always gets me pumped to do an at at home workout.
