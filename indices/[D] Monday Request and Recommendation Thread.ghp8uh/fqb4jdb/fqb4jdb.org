Reviewing a bunch of prior recommendations

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30737/the-humble-life-of-a-skill-trainer/][Humble life of a skill trainer[]] Interesting take on the litrpg genre. Clever and mostly believable protagonist, and the world seems self-consistent. I would have liked the protag to be a little more conflicted about lying and torturing but I guess that's personal taste. The stakes have been low up till the most recent chapter and while it hasn't got my blood pumping I am interested in where it goes.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30131/seaborn/][Seaborn]].I recommend. A combination of seafare, litrpg and davy jones. The premise is interesting though the characters haven't quite developed depth yet. The quality doesn't seem super high but the premise have kept me interested this far.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/twilight-kingdom/][Twillight Kingdom]] Really interesting seemingly consistent world. The protagonist is likeable and the conflicts starts believable. I dropped it after the first major conflict were deux ex resolved by spoiler(the protagonist using random runes to kill the big badey without the badey really righting back). I'll put it on hold for a while as I cope with my disappointment but will probably pick it up again because it's mostly well written and interesting.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/nexus-quest-worm-the-gamer-multicross.7046/][The Nexus(worm/gamer/skyrim crossover)]] ]A quest that follows a Taylor that grinds xp and abilities in skyrim. A few clever ideas but the whole concept of killing people for XP isn't explored until fairly late and then the exploration is handled mechanically and without exploring the underlying emotions. I dropped it after 30-40 chapters and find that it's too focused on grinding power and not enough on how to use that power. Weak characters.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/zero-requiem-lelouch-in-asoiaf.745138][Zero Requiem(Lelouch/game of thrones crossover)]] Kind of what you would expect from the crossover - lelouch stomping his enemies by political and strategic maneuvers. I find it refreshing that this lelouch recognizes that he is taking high risk gambles instead of being certain that things will work out, however it breaks a little disbelief that he never loses a high risk gamble. Overlal enjoyable read if tactical curbstomp is your thing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16927533/chapters/39772074][Alexandra Quick and X)(arry Potter series in the US)]] A long as series following a magical student in the US. The main character is very well written. I find the commentary on American culture hillarious and the protag has reasonable magical skills. If anyone have read through multiple books I would love to hear if the protag becomes more actively storydriving or if the pace picks up later. I read the first book and while enjoyable I missed clever optimization and stories that revolve around what the protag wants to achieve so I've put the next ones on hold.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time/][An Advance in Time]] A story that follows an uploaded protag that tries to build and uplift a kingdom in a simulation that is owned by a coorporation trying to make money on it. It had a weak start but the followup have been decently strong.
