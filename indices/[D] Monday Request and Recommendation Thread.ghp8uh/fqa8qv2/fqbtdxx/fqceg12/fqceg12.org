The MC goes on a "gender identity rant" because another character (because of cultural ignorance) called her a trap. It's an /in-character/ rant, and even calling it that is arguably a stretch. It's an expositionaty device to highlight culture clash and the personalities of the interacting people.

The story isn't a soapbox for the author's "SJW" rants, if that's what you---or anyone else reading---is worried about. The vast majority of the text doesn't focus on sexual or gender identity. Because of superpowers bullshit, Cassandra cheats past most of the transitioning "experience". Companion Chronicles is not a trans story. But the viewpoint character is MtF, and it's a part of her character, and as the other replier said, an element of the SI true to the author.

If you're simply not interested in reading social justice rants (a term I'm not really comfortable using because of the belittling connotation, but it conveys the concept), you won't have any problems with the story. /Pick a random chapter, and it's going to be people strategizing on how to solve problems, effect societal change and beat each other up---not gender counseling and pride parades./

If you're just uncomfortable reading from a MtF viewpoint, the character is biologically female for most of the story, and it's not like the narration is drawing any attention to it otherwise.
