You make a good point, but it doesn't break SoD that much for me. Homura spent most of her life in anime Japan reliving permutations of the exact same events over and over, so it's not surprising that she didn't pick up "Western values". She's characterized as deliberately antisocial to her jumpchain peers in an attempt to not form attachments, and is hyperfocused on specific goals, /and/ most settings don't deal with (modern human-style) gender etiquette anyway. If she really is a million years old, it's implausible, I agree, but it's also implausible that a million-year-old person would mentally and socially functional in any way, so...

Edit: it's also possible that she knows the "correct" way of addressing a trans person, but doesn't realize that using "trap" is significantly offensive, because again---she doesn't talk to people much, and you only know something is offensive when you're called out or you see someone else called out for it.
