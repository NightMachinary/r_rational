  Companion Chronicles is not about the jumper. It's about Cassandra, a new companion who chooses to leave their (author-invented) setting and follow the actual jumper on their Doctor Whoesque wacky journey that has been underway for centuries. And she knows what a jumpchain is, which works to both her advantage and detriment, because there are tropes and genre conventions that aren't exactly a good idea.

Worth noting this author-invented setting is still IRL - the fictional work of fiction is set several decades in the future, but Cassandra is from approximately our time.
