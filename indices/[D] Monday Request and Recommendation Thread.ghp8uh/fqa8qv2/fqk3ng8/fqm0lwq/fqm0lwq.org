It's kind of a CYOA thing, for which there are many documents floating around. You/your character is about to be dropped into a fictional setting. You start with 1000 points to buy a bunch of benefits at various costs, and drawbacks that give you extra points. You are then dropped into that setting for 10 years, or until you die, or possibly until a victory condition has been achieved or failed. You then have the option to go home, stay in that setting, or move onto another Jump, keeping all the benefits you've purchased and none of the drawbacks, and often taking a Companion along for the ride.

There's a bunch of jumps created for various settings, and supplemental documents, and min-Jumps, etc.. They tend to be fun to make decisions about what your "build" is going to be, and also lend themselves to story formats.

I'm pretty sure there's a subreddit for them, [[/r/JumpChain]].
