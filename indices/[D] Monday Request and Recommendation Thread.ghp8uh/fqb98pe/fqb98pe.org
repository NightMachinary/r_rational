Looking for long web serials or fanfiction (100k+ words, or complete in the 40k+ range). Particularly like LitRPGs or Romcoms. I like things that:

- Focus on a smaller cast of characters, preferably spending the majority of the story with the protagonist.
- Puts characters over world building, I want interesting character development/relationships over learning some fantasy empire's hierarchy.
- Have educational tidbits. Nothing too heavy, but if a real science/history/psychology etc..., tidbit informs a character decision, that's interesting.
- Have good pacing, Rome wasn't built in a day, but I also don't need a report on every brick placement.If it has fight scenes, strategic and/or with emotional stakes.
- Have a sense of humour, preferably doesn't get bogged down with heavy drama, war or politics.
- If it's Gamer-style, doesn't go crazy with stat screens.

Worth the Candle is easily a favourite. Thank you for abiding my picky criteria.
