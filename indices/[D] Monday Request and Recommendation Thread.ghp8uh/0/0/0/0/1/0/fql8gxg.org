At the very least World of WarCraft has four playable and many unplayable furry races then. And they don't seem weirder to me than the Draenei or Trolls.

In general to me it just seems like an easy (if unoriginal) way to add fantasy races to a setting that aren't Tolkien based.

But I guess I am committing the typical mind fallacy and there is a significant slice of the population that is viscerally creeped out by this stuff, just like others are creeped out by holes.
