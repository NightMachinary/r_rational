In [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NGHLT3G?notRedirectToSDP=1&ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&storeType=ebooks][Dungeon Traveler]] the MC spends a lot of time figuring out his abilities and designing his dungeon. He mainly interacts with gods or through the mechanics of his dungeon.

Two books are finished of what I assume will be a trilogy, and they're all available via Kindle Unlimited.
