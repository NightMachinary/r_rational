I'm... not actually sure. The characters all don't mean anything to me, but I love the hints at /stuff/ going on in the background, with the secretive organization that the main character was going to join before he got abducted into the broken jump system and the memory rewriting that's apparently happening. The thread has some speculation that it might be a crossover with SCP?
