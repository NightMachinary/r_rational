I'll be honest, they don't. Besides Companion Chronicles, there's only one story that I know of that reads anything like a normal story with dialogue, characters, plot threads, and themes: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross.831104/][Nowhere Land]]. The others that I've seen are all just a recap of what (or who) the main character did in which order.

Maintaining a sense of tension and stakes also becomes increasingly difficult, as the main character stacks up on boni and powers.
