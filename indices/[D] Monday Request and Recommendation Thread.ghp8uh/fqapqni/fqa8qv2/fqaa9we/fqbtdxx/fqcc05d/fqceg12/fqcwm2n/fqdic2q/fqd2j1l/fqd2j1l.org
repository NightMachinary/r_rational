It's tribalism. If I read something and get the impression the author is from a different tribe than me, and wearing it on their sleeve/putting it in the work, it creates distrust of the story as a whole.

The above written isn't exactly right; I can't properly put it into words. But there's some vague feeling I can't quite identify that is, I think, why people react this way.

This was written by a person, but text is compressed and lossy. Decompression, reading, necessarily requres some simulation of the mind of the author. That's probably part of it; your model of the author/speaker/narrator informs the interpretation of the entire rest of the text.
