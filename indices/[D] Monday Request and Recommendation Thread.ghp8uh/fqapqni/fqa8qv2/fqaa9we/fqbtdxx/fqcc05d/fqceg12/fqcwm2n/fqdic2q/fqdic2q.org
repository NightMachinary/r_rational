The problem is that its a probably a million year old character (Homura) that's supposed to not know that calling someone a "trap" is offensive.\\
The Doylist reasoning is that the author wanted an opportunity to put some gender issues into the fiction. That is all fine as long as it makes sense _in universe_. The author's work is even harder here since it is an author insert, so the default assumption is that the author shapes the story to the author's whim which breaks SOD, which makes the story unfun. This is even acknowledged at the beginning, but that doesn't make it better.
