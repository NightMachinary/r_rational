The problem with 5 and 6 is that while you have a complete story after the first book, or after the first three, or the first four (I personally think that /Messiah/ isn't complete without /Children/, but wouldn't argue the point), you can't really say that about the first five or even all six Frank Herbert Dune books. /Heretics/ and /Chapterhouse/ clearly switch from entries with their own conclusions, into more of a multi-book build-up towards some never-written conclusion. If nothing else, they suffer for that: they're /incomplete/.

As for the Brian Herbert books... I think the /ideas/ in them were based on his Father's notes, which he gained access to at some point after the /Prelude to Dune/ series (/House Atriedes/, /Harkonnen/, /Corrino/) were written. You can see it in the way that the /Prelude/ series has many more continuity issues than the far-past /Legends of Dune/ prequels (Butlerian Jihad, Machine Crusade, Battle of Corrin), or Dune 7 (/Hunters/ and /Sandworms/) do. Heck, it's hard to reconcile /Prelude/ and /Legends/ into the same universe, despite being by the same authors.

So, if it's the /plotline/ that you don't like in /Legends/ or Dune 7, that's probably Frank's fault.

However, the execution by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson is poor enough that it's hard to say if the ideas would have worked to bring the series to the conclusion it deserved if they were written competently.
