For Baru Cormorant, do you mean the politics, the intrigue, or the themes?

Ah, I personally didn't like the 2nd book in the Dune series and I never read the rest but I've heard that the prequel series was pretty good.

Two my hero academia fics I enjoyed that are both finished were yesterday upon the stairs and Hero Class Civil War

Yesterday upon the stair is a story where Deku has a quirk that that he keeps hidden that lets him see and interact with ghosts. It doesn't have much use in combat, at first anyway, but seeing all the death, past victims of villains, and the presence of a ghost girl who seems to have adopted him have made Deku much more mature and competent. He is a little traumatized but in a realistic way and he is very ruthless with villains as he can literally interact with their past victims and his classmates admit he can be a little scary when he is focused.

Hero Class Civil War shows a class activity where the class is split into two teams. One who will be playing the role of heroes, led by "Paragon" and the other playing the role of villains, led by "Kingpin." Bakugou is acting as Paragon, while Deku is the Kingpin. There is a lot of great strategy and action, people having fun in villain roles, and it shows how scary Midoriya could be if he was a villain.
