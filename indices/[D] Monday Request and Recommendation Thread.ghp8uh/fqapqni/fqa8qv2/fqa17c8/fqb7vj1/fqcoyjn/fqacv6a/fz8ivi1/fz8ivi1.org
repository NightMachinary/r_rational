Sorry I just saw this.

For like it, it felt very rational. The best part for me was how it made you feel towards the end, similar to Professor Quirrell in HPMOR. You KNEW what was going to happen yet you didnt want it to happen anyways. You liked all of the characters and didnt want what was going to inevitably happen to them occur. It reached the rational ending and was satisfying despite going against what you wanted.

Do you have links for those fanfics?
