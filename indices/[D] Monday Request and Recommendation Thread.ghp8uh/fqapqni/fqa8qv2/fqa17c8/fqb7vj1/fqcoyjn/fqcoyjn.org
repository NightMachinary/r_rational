Dune Messiah(2) is great IMO, but it does tarnish some beloved characters, which is why I feel it gets a bad rap. People get attached to characters and dislike it when they get torn down.

Children of Dune (3) and God Emperor of Dune (4) are both amazing, and are the 2 sequels that are almost universally praised. 4 is especially mind-bending and original. Again, Herbert was certainly not afraid of upsetting the apple cart, maybe because he had that fuck you money by then.

Dune 5 and 6 are not as bad as people say, but they do have a lot of issues. I still don't know what Herbert was going for, and it's a shame he never really got to complete his vision.

As to the other books (prequels, sequels, spinoffs) written by his son, they really don't deserve to be even mentioned in the same conversation as the originals. I can't think of a more disrespectful thing that has ever been done to a father's legacy than what they did with those novels. It's the equivalent of trying to pass off a 2 year old's play doh mashing next to Michelangelo's David. I sometimes fantasize of an afterlife so I can imagine Frank reuniting with his jagoff son and beating the everloving shit out of him with jumper cables until he got it out of his system. Like for a decade or two.
