Why are so many blogs designed so badly these days? Surely the standard way to consume this sort of blog is to start at the earliest post and read posts that interest you in order, but there is no way to do this on most blogs. There is just a pointless reverse chronological feed, and even more pointless tag cloud. This author at least has index posts, but obtusely labels them 'Resources for World-Builders' and presents them in 'no particular order.' If you haven't read for six months and want to see what's new, there is no way. Maddening.
