I read Bertran de Born entry and found it shallow for writings of professional historian. I have read more interesting and in depth posts on amateurs's forums. The same goes for LOTR entries. Logistics important and medieval lords profit from war - that's basically all author say in his posts. Less obvious and more interesting things, for example like mounted army move with the speed of wagon train, or how knights see peasants(you would expect they despised them. No. They hated them) or cost of weapon in relation to income etc. are missing.

Disrecommend.
