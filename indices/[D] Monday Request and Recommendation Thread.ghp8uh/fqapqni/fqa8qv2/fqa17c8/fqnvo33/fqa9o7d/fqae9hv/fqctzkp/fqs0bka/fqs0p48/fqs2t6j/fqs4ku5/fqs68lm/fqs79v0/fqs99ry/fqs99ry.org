I figured that it was the name of a place or a person, but I was skipping through the English and only looking at the Japanese at that point, as it was enough to understand what was going on for the most part.

I didn't realize it was Minnesota until you pointed it out. Kanji have something called Ateji where Kanji are sometimes used only for their reading. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateji]] So it's probably not that weird, at least compared to other names? I usually don't take the time to figure out how a name is read if it's an irregular reading. There's too many possibilities, and names often have their own set of readings anyways. Based on my pop-up dictionary the readings are technically possible.

The mess-ups I'm talking about are mostly using random kanji that have the same reading as the word or syllable that she actually wanted to write etc.
