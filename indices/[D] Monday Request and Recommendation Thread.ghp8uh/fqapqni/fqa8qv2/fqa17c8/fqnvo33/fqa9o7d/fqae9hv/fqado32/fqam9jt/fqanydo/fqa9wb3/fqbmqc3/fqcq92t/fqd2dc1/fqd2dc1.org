So, the usual problem with quests is that the audience just wants to do whatever seems shiny at the moment. Through some combination of an unusually good audience and unusually good authorial wrangling, the first part actually reads like a book - like an actual human would make these decisions, with one following from another in a way that is presented as sensible.

Of course, normal quests are the way they are because they can be fun for audience and author alike - though I like them less as a detatched reader. I think both the audience and the author are less character/narrative focused in the sequel.
