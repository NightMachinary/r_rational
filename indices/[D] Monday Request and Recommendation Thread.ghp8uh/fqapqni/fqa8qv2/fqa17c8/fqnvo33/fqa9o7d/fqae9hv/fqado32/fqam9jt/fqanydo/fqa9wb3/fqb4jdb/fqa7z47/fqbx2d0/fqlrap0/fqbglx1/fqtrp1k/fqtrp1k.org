Sabatini's [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1965][Captain Blood]]. Addictive doctor-turned-charismatic-pirate adventure. Skip the movies, book is far superior. Captain stories in general are probably good at this, Hornblower, Master & Commander (have heard this had a good movie). Can highly recommend Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as far as captain stories go.

Psycho-Pass (anime). Slow beginning, really hits its stride around episodes 12-13 (episode 6 in the extended?). The movie is also recommended. Think Funimation still [[https://www.funimation.com/shows/psycho-pass/][streams]] the Director's Cut free with ads, pick "Extended Edition" instead of "Season 1" (it doesn't say you need to subscribe anyways, may have to log in, extended puts 2 episodes into 1 so the count is right). Manly intellectual cop (sadly not the MC, but close enough) faces down elegant anarchist murderer in a surveillance state.

I haven't read any of it yet (closed bookstores and bad shipping times due to virus), but I've had my eye on the character [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raistlin_Majere][Raistlin Majere]].
