Note to those who are interested, that webnovel seems to be translated from Chinese.

If you never had experience with translated novels, jumping into the deep end is going to be rough on your eyes.

Not the actual content of the novel. This seems to be pretty standard Chinese mass murder power fantasy. Nothing particularly innovative other than the lack of the more cringe worthy awkwardly injected romance side plots.

People read Chinese power fantasies for the murder, not the romance. Read Japanese light novels for the romance, Chinese for the murder, and Korean for a mix with varying results.

What they all have in common is the eye bleedingly bad translations to English. The grammar, phrasing, and occasionally even spelling might be lacking as most translations are not professional. Some of them might even be run through Google Translate or other machine translations and you won't be able to tell the difference to a human doing it. It's all that bad.

Combined with the fact the source material is often aiming for word count / paid by chapter / low quality in the first place, these novels aren't quality reads.

Still, they do scratch an itch you won't find elsewhere in the English publishing world. And with often 1000+ chapters with each having 1k+ words, you'll get your fill of these stories and more.

RI specifically seems to have angered the Chinese Government and has been censored off the Chinese publishing world. Last I've heard from Reddit rumor mill is that the author is attempting to self publish but nothing else came out. RIP.
