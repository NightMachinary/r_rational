Any good fics or books (preferably rational or rational-adjacent) featuring MC's that are commanders, strategists, tacticians, or that play a similar role?

If it helps I was gonna ask for XCOM fics but I see now that there aren't that many and most of them aren't what I'm looking for, anything with a similar vibe to what you do in these games would be welcome.
