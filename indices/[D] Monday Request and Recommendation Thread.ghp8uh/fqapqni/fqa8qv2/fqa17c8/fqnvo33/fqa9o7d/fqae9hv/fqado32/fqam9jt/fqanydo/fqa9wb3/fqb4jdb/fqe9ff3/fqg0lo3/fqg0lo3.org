Yes, very much so. Obviously in Book 1, she's pre-teen who has never had formal magical training before, so of course she's not very skilled. That changes throughout the series, starting in Book 2. And the more powerful she gets, the more ability she has to influence the story.

She never becomes "rational", she always remains stubborn and impulsive, but as her skill increases she gets a lot better at actually implementing and following through with her seemingly irrational plans. I read someone describe her character as "bashing her head against a wall until the wall gives way", and that seems pretty accurate.

In my personal opinion, Book 1 is the weakest in the series by a pretty wide margin, so if you already enjoyed it you will probably enjoy Book 2 more. Book 2 is much denser than Book 1, and it also gives you a better idea as to the series' overarching story and what the later books in the series are like.
