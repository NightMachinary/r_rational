Comedy is subjective but I found these two fics funny. Both are self-inserts.

This Bites is a one-piece story where the author is an adrenaline junkie and absolutely loves how crazy the world is. A lot of running gags and weird situations that come from the One Piece world. In the story, the Strawhats find a piece of technology that lets the author's radio show reach a global audience and a lot of the fun is the world reacting to the craziness of the Straw Hats and the situations they find themselves in.

The other is What's her name in Hufflepuff where the author is a girl who is sorted into Hufflepuff and the everyday weirdness that is the magical world that is genuinely funny, seems to fit quite well with canon, and the children in the story actually act like children to the author's annoyance.
