I don't know if I'd classify this is as a romcom, but I find it to be one of the best romance fanfiction/or fictions in general I've had the opportunity of reading.

- great characters and characterization
- fantastic pacing
- amazing humor

Honestly at 42K words it's short and sweet. I've probably reread it over half a dozen times because of just nice of good of story it is.
