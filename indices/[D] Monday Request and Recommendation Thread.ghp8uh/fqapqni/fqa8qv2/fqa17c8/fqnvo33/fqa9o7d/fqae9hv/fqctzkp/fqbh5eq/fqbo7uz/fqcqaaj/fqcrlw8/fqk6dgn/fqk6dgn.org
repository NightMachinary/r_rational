  If you're interested, there are fanfics where the SI has no or very little knowledge of the fictional universe.

Do you have any good examples?

The only ones I read that are like that are With This Ring (Orange Lantern SI in Young Justice tv show that spans three forums and has been updating /daily/ for /years/) and a World of WarCraft/Magic: the Gathering SI that starts slice of life and then has the protagonist turn into a dragon that I haven't been able to find anymore even with dedicated searching.
