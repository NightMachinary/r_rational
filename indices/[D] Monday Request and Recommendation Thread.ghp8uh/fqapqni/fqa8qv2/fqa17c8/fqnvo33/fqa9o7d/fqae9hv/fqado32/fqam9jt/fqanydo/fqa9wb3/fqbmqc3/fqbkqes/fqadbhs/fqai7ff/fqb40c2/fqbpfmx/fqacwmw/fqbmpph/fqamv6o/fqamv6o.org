Seconding Paragon.

Also as a PSA with Paragon, the first arc is extremely slow, boring, cliche and mediocre quality. I was halfway through and was about to give up before I was recommended to just skip to the start of the second arc. If you feel bored/give up I highly recommend doing that.

The author gives a nice summary so you don't miss any crucial details. I love the story from arc 2 onward, easily my second favorite xanxia story after [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/][Ave Xia Rem Y.]]
