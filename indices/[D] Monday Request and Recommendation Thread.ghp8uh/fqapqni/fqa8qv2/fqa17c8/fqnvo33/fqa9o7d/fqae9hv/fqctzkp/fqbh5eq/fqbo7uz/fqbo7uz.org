They're an exercise in exploring a story's world, characters, and plot.

When you read a novel, do you ever wonder what you would do in a character's place? Are frustrated at the actions characters do or don't take? Wish the author had explored some aspect of the setting more fully?

IMO, they're one of the ultimate forms of rational writing. By their nature, SIs are inherently more rational than the original work.
