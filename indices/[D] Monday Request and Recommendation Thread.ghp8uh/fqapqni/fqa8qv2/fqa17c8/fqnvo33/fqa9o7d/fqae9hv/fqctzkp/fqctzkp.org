Here are a few Naruto SI fics that avoid Mary Suedom by virtue of the SI living a civilian life:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/][Sanitize]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12083631/][Great Lakes and Expectations]]

And here's an unfinished Mass Effect fic in which the SI wakes up as a Prothean AI. In my opinion it's got a great take on cyberwarfare with unique worldbuilding about the Reapers.
