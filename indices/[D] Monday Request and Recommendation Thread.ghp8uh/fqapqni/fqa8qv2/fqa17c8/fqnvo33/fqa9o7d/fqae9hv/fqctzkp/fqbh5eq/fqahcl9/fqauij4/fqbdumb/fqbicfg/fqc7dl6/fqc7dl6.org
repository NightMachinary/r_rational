While I agree that Delve's world is in shambles compared to the time of the Majistraal, I wouldn't call it more than /local/ decline. If you treat the Majistraal like Rome, then Rome fell and we're in the Dark Ages, but that just means there's less infrastructure (i.e. smaller towns) and weaker concentrations of power (i.e. no platinumplates), not that the whole world is continuing to decline.

Getting to Goldplate is a snowball effect. When you have a party of golds, you can reliably elevate someone to gold. We see this in the DKE being able to sustain dozens of goldplates, for instance. The same should apply to platinum, but in this post-Majistraal world there just aren't enough platinums to reliably elevate new people to platinum, so we're stuck with gold as the cap until enough people are lucky enough to make platinum at once and agree to get the snowball rolling.

The shrinkage of Fel Sadanis is clear too. The Majistraal had extensive teleportation infrastructure and could sustain a larger city than with just local farms, and while the teleportation arrays still exist they appear to be much less frequently used, meaning Fel Sadanis has to shrink to a sustainable size over time.

As for supports, while I do think that (outside of the Empire) there are generally fewer than you'd want for a balanced ecosystem, I don't think it's necessarily true that they're /continually/ in decline, or that Fel Sadanis is representative of supports around the world. Fel Sadanis, only playing host to Watch and Guild, essentially has minimal organizational infrastructure/rich and powerful people who can hire supports. If you wanted to sell your services to a party of Silverplates or a Goldplate or such, you would likely look elsewhere, in the richer cities.

While the idea that the world is /still/ falling apart is admittedly interesting, my priors rest more on the theory that it /has/ fallen apart and is now in a stable equilibrium (where Fel Sadanis just happens to be on the sucky end of the scale) and will remain that way until the next big rise, which will set the snowball rolling again and bring platinumplates back to the fore. It's not implausible that the Adamant Empire has the potential to become such an event, at least if it isn't stopped.
