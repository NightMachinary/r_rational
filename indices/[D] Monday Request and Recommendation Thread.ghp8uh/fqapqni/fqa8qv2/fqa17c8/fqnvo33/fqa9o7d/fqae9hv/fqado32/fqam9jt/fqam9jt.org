I'm looking for dungeon core stories that are more focused on the core figuring out their abilities and experimenting than interacting with companions. I currently follow Blue Core, Dungeon Pearl, and The Core of a Factory, which are all a bit too much on the interacting side of the line than I would like, but well written enough that I don't mind.

Preferably ones that are currently active, but I'm not too picky.
