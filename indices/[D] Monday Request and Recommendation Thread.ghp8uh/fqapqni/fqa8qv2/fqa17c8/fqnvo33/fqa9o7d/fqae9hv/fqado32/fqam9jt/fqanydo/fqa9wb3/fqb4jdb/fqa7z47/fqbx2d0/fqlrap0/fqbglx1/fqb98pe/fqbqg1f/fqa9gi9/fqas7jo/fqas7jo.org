I strongly counter this rec.

For me, the first book was seemingly written by someone who has never played a 4x/city management game about a boomer who has also never played a 4x/city management game, transported to a world where everything just... works out for him. The idea has a lot of potential, but the application is worse than bad, it's soulless and anemic, it has no depth, no flavor, and zero sense of craftsmanship.

A glimpse into this worlds "mechanics": gold is the only relevant resource, so there is no resource management layer whatsoever, no supply chains, no tech trees, nothing like that. Everything and anything can be purchased with gold, including every building. There is no training time for specialization of workers, they just suddenly know everything their job entails. Production time of goods is completely arbitrary, as is quantity produced or the price of goods. A single level one farm is enough to pay for the upkeep of hundreds of mercenaries(possibly thousands? It's unclear, but it's enough to stave off an invasion by the antagonists, anyway) not once but several times over... How does that make any sense, whether mechanically or narratively?

A glimpse into the worldbuilding: there is an years long standoff between two cities, the first of which specced purely into war, with tens of thousands of well trained, well equipped warriors, and the second that went for "tall" archetype (i.e. high pop, production, culture, science, etc focused on one city). Somehow, over those many years of stalemate the war city is still able to feed and upkeep their many thousands of soldiers (with no trade or pillaging, apparently, as they were cut off from any other town), and the besieged tall city has tens of thousands of citizens that were able to maintain a comfortable existence while resisting invasion and assault. Again, does that makes any sense? Does it seem like the author put any thought whatsoever into verisimilitude?

In short, this is not even remotely a 4x game as it advertises itself to be. The mechanics are mind-numbingly simplistic, the MC is a (non-intetional) charicature of boomer, constantly spouting off trite aphorisms and cretinous truisms, and is not remotely relatable, the plot is thin and uninteresting, and there is absolutely 0 narrative tension, as every problem is well within the MC's capabilities.
