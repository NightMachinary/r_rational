Normally I try to keep it at a ratio of 3 or 4:1 of fiction to non-fiction(I read a lot). Crucial to my effort is classifying it more broadly as just "learning" rather than non-fiction, that way I can count podcasts, articles, online courses and scientific papers in that category. I also tend to use audiobooks almost exclusively for non-fiction, so that I can listen to books while I walk my dog or do chores.

If you want a subreddit thematic rec, try [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25131230][Rationality: From AI to Zombies]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I'm always amazed at how Eliezer manages to make these dense topics so much more lucid and approachable than they might otherwise be.

Another good generalist rec is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow][Thinking, Fast and Loose]] by Daniel Kahneman. It condenses Kahneman's nobel prize winning research into human behavioral science, with an emphasis on cognitive biases and heuristics. It's not the best book on the subject, mostly because it can be dry and seemingly repetitive/overlong, but it's an excellent start, and you're getting it from the horse's mouth.
