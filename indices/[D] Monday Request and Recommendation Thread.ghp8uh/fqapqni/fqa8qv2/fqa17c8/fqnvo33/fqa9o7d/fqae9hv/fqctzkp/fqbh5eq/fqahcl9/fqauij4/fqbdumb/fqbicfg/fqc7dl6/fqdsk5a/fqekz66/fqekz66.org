True (or true enough, as I suppose someone from the Adamant Empire would say that the world's finally swinging back up as Fecht forges a new empire to rival the Majistraal), though as the decline of the Majistraal and the lost grandeur of the old world is ancient history and we are merely seeing war between geopolitical powers, I would say rather than a world in /decline/ that Delve is a world at war, or perhaps a world being devastated.

Either way, I feel that it's important to distinguish between Fecht's expansionism/the ravages of war and the (probably temporary) decline of the world that came with the fall of the Majistraal.
