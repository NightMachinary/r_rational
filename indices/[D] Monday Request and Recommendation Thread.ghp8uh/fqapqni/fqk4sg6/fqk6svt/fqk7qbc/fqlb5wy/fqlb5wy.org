Aside from what others have said, there's probably a taint by association: Furries (the real-life suit-wearing sexual deviants) really loudly like a certain sort of anthropomorphised animal, and people really don't want to associate with that.

That being said, from what little I've seen of this anime, it's not really that sort of 'furry'. The japanese 'I want to fuck anime monstergirls' fandom has always been a separate thing, and the anime art style means the animal-based monstergirls are less uncanny valley than western-style furries, usually.
