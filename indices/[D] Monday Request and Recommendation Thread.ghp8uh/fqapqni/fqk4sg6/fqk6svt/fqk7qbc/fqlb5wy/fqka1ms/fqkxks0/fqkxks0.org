As mentioned by IICVX it's a uncanny valley kind of effect: people generally dislike things that are too human but not human enough. So popular things tend to be either very inhuman or essentially human to avoid this(media format also matters). Talking animals? No problem. Humans with tails and ears? Ok. Humans with "realistic" animal heads so you can't read emotions? Nightmare fuel.

Bugs and Mickey are inhuman and very cartoonish in appearance and action. Thundercats could mostly be humans with makeup/accessories. Beast is a disfigured human and has that portrayed negatively throughout, she learns to overlook his appearance and her kidnapping. Digimon are probably considered talking animals.

Zootopia is a good example of toeing the line while also jumping across it for scares/action.
