  I mean isn't Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse essentially furry?

Not exactly. A better description of the phenomena would be "anthro(pomorphic)", as there's a gap between talking/funny animals and kemonomimi where the furry fandom resides in. The shows you reference are furry-adjacent in the same way we call things rational-adjacent, but they're more stuff the fandom takes inspiration from, rather than stuff that was created to appeal to the fandom. BNA doesn't really have that excuse; I can almost guarantee someone on the production team considers themselves to be a furry based on character design and themes.
