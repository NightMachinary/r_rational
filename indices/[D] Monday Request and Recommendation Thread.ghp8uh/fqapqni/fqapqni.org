[[https://myanimelist.net/anime/40060/BNA][Brand New Animal]] is a rational, pro-transhumanism anime.

"Wait, what?" You might be tempted to say. BNA is obviously an irrational, rule of cool Trigger anime with a side plot about discrimination, just like zootopia or beastars.

Wrong! Without exception, every character in BNA makes choices based on their values, skills, and goals, rather than mere plot necessity. Even the characters that are obviously irrational (comic relief slum bears) are irrational for clearly explained, deep seated socioeconomic reason. Plans are made with fallbacks and neither the heroes nor the villains are stupid. There are 'unfair' coincidences (typically, characters meeting each other at convenient times), but these coincidences could have easily been replaced, as every major event in the story would have had character-driven reasons to still happen. So even the 'irrational' parts are justifiable, as they happen for storytelling reasons rather than "move the plot ahead" reasons.

Yes, the fight scenes involve throwing lasers around and friendship based powerups. But these powerups match the enemy unfair powerups beat for beat, so a fight's winner is still who you'd expect to win at the beginning of a fight based on levels of athleticism and training (combat or otherwise.)

Finally, we have the issue of the 'technology' used. It would deserve a spot on tvtropes 'artistic license - genetics' page, except that it's very clearly sufficiently analyzed magic. It works in a self-consistent manner, and technological upgrades are foreshadowed.

So now that I've explained why BNA is rational, I'm going to explain why I reccommend it. And to an extent, that recommendation depends on the 'Death of the Author.' I made an earlier assertion that BNA wasn't concerned, thematically, with discrimination. But it does, in fact have a pretty lukewarm but unobjectionable anti-discrimination theme (it's a bit of a broken aesop for a few reasons, but I can' t go into why without spoilers.) But, probably by accident, it manages to have a very strong pro-transhumanism stance. Most anime about the future shoehorn in some sort of "technology can have drawbacks" or "we need to be careful not to lose our humanity" subplots. BNA goes very much in the opposite direction. Can't say too much because that would be spoiling the plot, but BNA is of the opinion that genetic modification is awesome, people should have whatever bodies they want, and being something other than human would be pretty damn cool.

And of course, the characters are likeable, it got some genuine laughs from me, and (as with any trigger anime) the fights are awesome.

It does have one YMMV drawback-- namely, that it is unapolagetically furry. But I would recommend it to non-furries despite that (as it wasn't made for the furry fandom, it just happens to fall directly into their wheelhouse.)
