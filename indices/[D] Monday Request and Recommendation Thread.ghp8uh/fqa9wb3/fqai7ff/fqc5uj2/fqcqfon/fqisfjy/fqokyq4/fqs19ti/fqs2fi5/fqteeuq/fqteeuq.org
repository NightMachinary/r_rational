But that's, what, one harem per pre-modern polygamous kingdom per generation? I was hoping for a source as to a majority of IRL harems (1 man and 4+ women I guess?) being/having been like that. Like, I'm not claiming you're wrong, but I don't want to just assume that harems of lesser nobles and generically rich people were all and always as bad as we hear from the Imperial Chinese or the Ottoman Turkish horror stories.
