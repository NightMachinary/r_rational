I've read two of those and really liked them.

A series I have been really enjoying is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles]]. I think it does the treating women as human beings thing well. The start of the story is a bit rough writing wise. But after that it has the philosophizing of Worth the Candle as the cultivation of Cradle with some litrpg-ish elements, before it gets to the straight up VRMMO litrpg (that blends perfectly with the "real world" cultivation). All with great worldbuilding.
