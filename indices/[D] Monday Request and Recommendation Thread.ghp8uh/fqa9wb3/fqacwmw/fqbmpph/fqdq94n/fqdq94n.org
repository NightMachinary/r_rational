meh fair enough, i would personally consider it better than the vast majority of xanxia simply because though the characters may not be particularly clever, they at least act like humans rather than walking talking tropes.

But yes definitely more for the progression fantasy side of things rather than rationalist.

Though out of curiosity what was the biggest problem you had with it? I've seen a lot of people dislike it and most of their complaints didn't really end up mattering to me. Which is strange as usually I'm pretty picky with the things I read.
