Hard dis-rec on this one from me. OP wants to turn off his brain, not rip it out from his cranium in frustration.

It was extremely well recommended on [[/r/ProgressionFantasy][r/ProgressionFantasy]] so I pushed through scores more chapters than I otherwise would have. As this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I am obligated to point out that, even considering the august heights of rationalism to which most xanxia aspire, /Paragon/ falls far short.
