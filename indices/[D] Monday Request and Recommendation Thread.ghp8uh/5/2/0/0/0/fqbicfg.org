In a functioning world, you're totally right. Undesirable role so the reward grows until people are willing to fill it.

The smart thing about the setting though is that Delve's world is in decline. The story doesn't bash you over the head with it like Worm or something, but there's little hints sprinkled all over. The big magical Empire fell a long long time ago but the world has never stopped sliding. Fel Sedanis is smaller than it used to be (the whole city fits with room to spare inside the shield dome now), or the remaining platinums are too few in number to raise another person to plat (if they could even get along to do so), the Watch doesn't patrol so far out.

And in this context, it makes sense. If you're in a state of uncertainty, you /can't/ afford to go with the economic choice of support. A support class could be enslaved or robbed. Hell, the MC himself might have been enslaved if he had useful buffs for the city's leader instead of a different buff path. Even a 'steady' job is risky, because they can lose their livelyhood charging up teleporter pads all day if their city gets invaded (or just get robbed by a random awakened). At the very least every awakened needs to be able to run off and hide in the wilderness without dying to trivial monsters, in case the Empire of Adamant comes knocking.

It leads to a terrible cycle, because supports really are necessary. The fewer supports there are, the more shitty things become, which causes fewer supports. But nobody wants to be a support, because things are just getting worse.

It makes the MC's unique build actually make sense, because the world really does have a gap and the whole setting is hurting because of it. It also means he's better as part of a force multiplier in a group, instead of going by himself solo'ing world bosses, which is a significant fail state in many stories.
