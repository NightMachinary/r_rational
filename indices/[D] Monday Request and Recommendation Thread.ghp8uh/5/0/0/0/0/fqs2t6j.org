There's one or two phrases in chapter 1 that were quite jarring to me, but I might have spoken too soon, overall it doesn't seem to be as bad as I thought. (Talking about the Japanese used, for example messing up tenses, verbs and particles.) It's just that it came right at the beginning.

I hope it won't become too much, having the SI speak broken Japanese is ok, but for the canon characters it breaks immersion a bit.
