This is from the third paragraph, first chapter: "Then my mind caught up to the fact that he'd called me Cassandra; less than a dozen people knew to call me that. I wiped a bit of hollandaise sauce off my chin, feeling extraordinarily self-conscious of the stubble I hadn't bothered to shave that morning. Having someone call me â€˜Cassandra' "

I can't picture the main character. Are they a woman who needs to shave, MTF trans, or man with a woman's name? One of my big issues with stories that are supposed to be so character-centric ... describe the MC! If it's supposed to be a great Cassandra based story, not telling me enough about Cassandra the cat-owner is not going to keep me reading.

Edit: Chapter 2, MTF trans. MC goes on a gender identity rant. Those types of stories are not for me.
