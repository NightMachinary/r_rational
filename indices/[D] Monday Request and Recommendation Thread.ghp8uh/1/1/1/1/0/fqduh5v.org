I haven't read the fic, but it's totally possible to be a million year old insensitive asshole.

Edit: I read up until this part, and it's Homura from Madoka. I can definitely see her being a million year old high schooler, because that's what she is.

It's roughly equivalent to someone from the mid-90s referring to gay men with the British term for cigarettes - back then it wasn't particularly polite either, but it was also super common (particularly in high school).
