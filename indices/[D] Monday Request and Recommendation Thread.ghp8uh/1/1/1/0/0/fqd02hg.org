That part was fascinating because it's not as much an allegory as a /story about allegories/, and the subject being a trans metaphor is merely Management making it in-character for Cassandra. I would argue that despite having transness being a plot element, the arc isn't /really/ a trans story since the themes and moral of that arc aren't about identity, fear, bigotry etc., but about agency, narrative and tropes as you said---and also about how changes in circumstance and opportunities can lead to disconnect from a community, and how societal change can lead to the obsolescence and fading of such communities, which are again widely general.
