[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.57643/][Companion Chronicles]] is /technically/ a multicross fanfiction, specifically a jumpchain if you know what that is, but I think it would be more thematically accurate to call it original fiction set in a jumpchain setting. It's the only jumpchain I've read more than 100 words of, and it's... different.

I don't think it's exaggerating too much to say that Companion Chronicles is to the jumpchain genre as Worth the Candle is to the isekai/SI genre.

A jumpchain is, as I understand it, a structured multicross where the protagonist ("jumper") is imported into a fictional setting for a number of years at a time, with selectable perks, drawbacks and objectives on import (similar to the Worm CYOA, which some may be more familiar with). Once the failure or success condition is met, or time is up, the "jump" concludes and the "jumper" is transported to the next setting to do it all again, with an intermission in between to recuperate. The jumper keeps the abilities between settings, and may bring characters from settings with them as "companions", which can also go into settings with them and accumulate abilities themselves. If you think this sounds a whole lot like powerwank wish-fulfilment fantasy, you're right.

This story is an attempt to deconstruct all of that.

Companion Chronicles is not about the jumper. It's about Cassandra, a new companion who chooses to leave their (author-invented) setting and follow the actual jumper on their Doctor Whoesque wacky journey that has been underway for centuries. And she knows what a jumpchain /is/, which works to both her advantage and detriment, because there are tropes and genre conventions that aren't exactly a /good idea/.

Companion Chronicles is about many things. It's about how struggles to reconcile free will and the knowledge that she's the younger version of a anime character from a franchise most people she meets have seen (note that she leaves her seemingly baseline world years /before/ nations starts building giant battle-mechas to wage international war, so her own setting sounds to her exactly like the incredibly dumb anime plot that it is, about dealing with her complex motivations, history and traumas boiled down to tropes on a cast list and continuity errors retconned into lore. It's about the morality of intervention (think Prime Directive; her first jump after leaving her homeworld being /Worm/ just pre-locker probably already tells you a lot) and about the consequences of indulgence in power fantasy, which are very real and explored with a heavy hand. It's about narrative and predicting the game master. It's about identity and the consequences of functional immortality. To a large extent, it's also about the personal journey of Cassandra, who's a three-dimensional character in her own right instead of a blank slate like the majority of authorial inserts, and about a continuous struggle to look past the tropes and conventions of a plot she knows to the people behind. The comparisons to WtC write themselves, and I mean that in the best way possible.

As of right now, Companion Chronicles has finished Cassandra's first two jumps: 10-years in Worm, which taken alone would be a novel-length Worm SI better than most I've read, and a foray into Star Trek which has a lower word count but still packs a punch. It updates roughly weekly with 5-10k chapters. It is severely underrated and receives nowhere near the amount of traffic it should, which is a huge shame.
