One I would recommend that hasn't been yet, that fits the theme of this sub, is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach][Godel, Escher, Bach]]. It's an excellent set of dialogs, puzzles, and structural references that can only be done justice in hardback. It focuses on formal systems, communication, intelligence, and their emergent properties but does so in a rather approachable way. It tackles the question of AI.

Personally I think it pairs well with Eliezer Yudkowsky's Rationality: From AI to Zombies. Both have interesting structures, and they approach similar ideas from radically different directions (very roughly one as self help+psychology series of blogs, the other as history+math textbook with dialogs).
