If you enjoy historical non-fiction, I highly recommend Erik Larson's novels:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City][The Devil in the White City]] follows the lives of Daniel H. Burnham and others who designed and built the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The story delves into fascinating details about architecture, technology, American culture, and the burgeoning labor movement at the turn of the century. Juxtaposed with the Fair's shining symbol of progress, the story also follows the life of Dr. H. H. Holmes, a notorious conartist and serial killer who murdered most of his victims within the apartment building he owned just 3 miles from the border of the Fair itself.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Garden_of_Beasts][In the Garden of Beasts]] follows the life of the American Ambassador to Germany and his daughter during their stay in Berlin in the year leading up to the Night of the Long Knives. The story examines the reasons why so many warning signs of the coming violence went unheeded, and how even 'good' people got swept up in the seemingly glamorous early days of nationalist fervor in Hitler's Germany.
