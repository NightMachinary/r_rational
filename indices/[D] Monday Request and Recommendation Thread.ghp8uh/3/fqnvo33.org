Just for those who like meaty worldbuilding stuff, check out [[https://acoup.blog/][A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry]]. It's a relatively new blog by a historian that (among other things) dissects pop-culture depictions of ancient and medieval war and politics. He kicked it off with a six-part analysis of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields from LOTR (he concludes that--in the book--both Denethor and the Witch King are excellent strategists). Right now he's marking the anniversary by looking at Helm's Deep. I find it all very fun and informative. Give it a look!
