Reposting this since people might not have seen this from last weeks thread. A couple recommendations if y'all like "political" style stories.

--------------

Here are a couple more politically focused fics that I've enjoyed. They're not solely focused on politics, but the background is political enough that it works. These are pretty popular so there's a good chance you might have read some of these. Hopefully at least one is something you're unfamiliar with.

#+begin_quote
  This Romance of the Three Kingdom's SI is a decentish fic that does a good job of scratching the political intrigue itch. SI is the eldest son of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shao][Yuan Shao]] (Benchu) and is thrust directly into of the most volatile periods of Chinese history. Its biggest flaw is that it's too short, but thankfully it's still ongoing and we can see how the story develops. Tthe story does a fantastic job of balancing between giving the SI the ability to have a significant impact with keeping the SI from being too OP.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia][Lelouch of Britannia]] - Code Geass Fanfic - 140k words. 5/5. Abandoned

#+begin_quote
  This is my favorite Code Geass fanfiction in existence. It's also high up on my list of favorite fanfics of all time. It does a great job of taking the simple premise of a Lelouch who didn't get himself exiled and runs with it. Lelouch does his best to use intellect to navigate the intricacies of Britannian court politics. At times it can get a bit Lelouch OP, but if you can get past that flaw, the story is a delight to read. Special shoutout to the Milly chapter. The author does a great job of capturing her essence and I always have a smile while re-reading that part. It's sadly abandoned, but what we have is beautiful.

#+begin_quote
  This story does a fantastic job of toeing the line between uplift fic and political fic. I have a healthy amount of cynicism regarding uplift fics since they tend to be extremely unrealistic. The SI often is greatest engineer/scientist to ever live who also has perfect memory of every useful piece of historical science knowledge possible resulting in what best can be described as uplift porn than anything resembling a story.

  Thankfully this story does a great job of being fairly realistic regarding what a single human with very little power in the grand scheme of things can accomplish. Skagos improves, but it doesn't become the center of all human civilization. The political storylines tend to be more background, but when they are front and center the storylines are quite well written. Abandoned, but worth a read for sure.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-onrushing-storm-history-just-before-ww2-si.604261/][The Onrushing Storm]] - Historical SI into Ireland's President Pre-WW2. 120k words. 4/5. Abandoned

#+begin_quote
  This is a really fun fiction. The SI merges with the President of the Irish Free-States pre-WW2. With what power he has, he does what he can to prepare the Irish nation for what's about to happen. This includes basic war prep, implementing new economic policies, improving Ireland's development, immigration policies, ect. It toes the line between uplift and political. The biggest criticism of this fic is that it seems to stick to a historical deterministic perspective. That whatever the SI does, WW2 and the genocide of the Jewish people is inevitable and all the Si can do is minimize the devastation. Other than that, it's still a fun fiction that takes a perspective that's not often seen. You also get a really interesting view of Irish history and political issues of the time period. Author gets deep into the details.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/][A Better Class of Criminal]] - DC SI who becomes a Batman Villan and tries to reform himself. 110k words. 3/5. Abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  A really unique fanfiction that got abandoned way too soon. SI entered DC and became a supervillain. He was caught, served his time and after emerging from prison is attempting to reform and be a better person. That means running for Mayor. The overall plot is well written and the SI's thought process is a lot of fun to read. The biggest problem with this fic is that it suffers from a case of, "SI's MAGIC solves all problems." Sadly it was cut short just as the story was entering the most interesting arc, but it's still worth a read.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt there's much I can say about this since it's been recommended to death on here and anywhere fanfics get recommended. If you like political fics, at the very least you'll like a couple arcs of this. I only include this story here to recommend is checking out the Apocrypha if you haven't already. Some of the omake's and sidestories are fantastic and do a great job of adding to the worldbuilding. The only real flaw is that the story latches onto the trope of Tanya overestimating her enemies and underestimating herself + allies for a bit too long and overdoes it a bit too much.

#+begin_quote
  It's a been a while since I read this, but I do remember being impressed with the quality of the writing and the mannerisms of the MC. New Joffrey conducts himself in how a young, genius, pragmatic !rational person to do. Irrc, it grated me in some sense since his demeanor was written in such a self-assured overmature "better than you" style, but if you can get past that, it's a fun read. The courtroom scene was well put together and the SI's job of navigating the political arena is accomplished fairly well. It's a shame it got abandoned so soon.

  This a fantastic oneshot about the ninja world where Naruto is a mythical Hokage. Honestly I'd be spoiling by saying anything more. It's 3k words and portrays a unique worldview in a specific version of Ninja Society.

/Random stories I don't fully remember, but I think were alright. (Not great, but not terrible.) They might be worth a look if you're really exhausted for something to read./

- Batman in ASOAIF - [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-dark-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-asoiaf-batman.603050/]] - Honestly this was just kinda weird? Like the writing is solid, but it got confusing in where the author wanted to take this story. I think that's why it was abandoned.

- A Trident Is Forged -[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-trident-is-forged-asoiaf-si-au.463027/]] - IRRC I felt that the story got too boring and the SI was too OP. Still, it has its moments.

- The Black Princess - [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-black-princess-an-si-story-asoiaf-got.553815/]] - Don't remember anything about this tbh, but it seems popular and I read it while it was active. Maybe it's worth a look.

- Ok [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7206371/1/APOCALYPSO][APOCALYPSO]] is a literal oneshot crackfic, but it's somewhat political HP story I guess? Idk, to some extent I included it b/c I find it extremely underappreciated. 6.5k words.
