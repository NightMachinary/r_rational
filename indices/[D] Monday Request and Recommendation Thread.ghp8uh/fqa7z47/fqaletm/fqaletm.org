Here's a looooooong list of fanfiction that might fit your criteria. Let me know if you have any questions about the fictions themselves.

*Long Fanfiction - Harry Potter*

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] - 5/5 - 38K

#+begin_quote
  This is a hilarious fic that takes a crackfic premise, but does it justice. The concept is if an abused Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys. After being abandoned he has peculiar encounters that leave him believing that he's actually an elf. A free forest elf. Very funny and very cute. Has a sequel that I also highly recommend with a 5/5 for that as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/3/][Seventh Horcrux]] - 4/5 - 104K

#+begin_quote
  There isn't much I can say here since this is so well known and has had more than a handful of recommendations. It's an extremely funny story that takes the premise of if Lord Voldemort was a misunderstood somewhat monster instead of a complete monster and runs with it.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] - 5/5 - 246K

#+begin_quote
  My favorite HP fanfiction of all time. The humor, the hijinks, the characters, the overall everything might not be the exact best in each category, but they're all top notch and together they create the best story. The basic premise is an adult Harry messes with the Viel spitting Sirius who was stuck inbetween into a new dimension and Harry follows him there. The buddy cop dynamic between the two is so much fun to watch.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter, The Geek]] - 3/5 - 65K

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who becomes a geek after spending an entire summer on a computer. Dumb meme and videogame references everywhere.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003/1/Weeb][Weeb]] - 3/5 - 124K

#+begin_quote
  Written by the same author as Harry Potter, The Geek comes Weeb. This is a more refined and more anime joke focused version of The Geek. The author makes it a point to make this one both funnier and weirder. If you like anime and don't mind seriousness, this is for you.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What would Slytherin Harry Do?]] - 5/5 - 44K

#+begin_quote
  Varied oneshots of a more cunning and social Harry in Slytherin. Not serious, but at the same time, somewhat plausible and written with enough detail that you'll probably laugh out loud.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][Whatever Happened to Bromance]] - 4/5 - 10K

#+begin_quote
  Seriously, why the hell did Harry not get asked out more often in the books? The man's a literal celebrity who saves the school at the tune of at least once a year. Great story and shows you how Harry really should branched out and made more friends.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] - 3/5 - 180K

#+begin_quote
  This is a classic in the genre and despite the numerous grammatical mistakes, this story and its sequel still make me laugh whenever I reread. The basic premise is Harry Potter going on a world tour to fix himself, but ends up fixing everything around him instead.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] - 3/5 - 54K

#+begin_quote
  This is a bit of OP Harry doing weird and crazy stuff and tbh even though the grammar and humor holds up alright, the OPness is a bit grating. The story toes the line between a 2/5 and a 3/5. I include this story, on here only for the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2630300/1/You-Did-What][third story of the series]] which imo is pure gold on the comedy and hijinks. An easy 5/5. The third is best read after pushing through the first two, but if you're getting stuck on the first or second, feel free to jump to the third, not thaaaat much is lost in between.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]] - 4/5 - 30K

#+begin_quote
  Written by the same author of The Shadow of Angmar comes an even better HP/LOTR crossover, maybe, I think. Harry is now a child elf with a lot of power and an inability to get what he wants. Those things are sex and a way back home so becomes just a bit psychotic.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man][Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man]] - 3/5 - 10K

#+begin_quote
  The literal definition of a crackfic. Still got me to laugh out loud at a number of points. Harry Potter is sent to live with, "The Most Electrifying Man" instead of the Dursleys. Chaos ensues.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] - 3/5 - 30K

#+begin_quote
  This story and it's sequels are simple casual fun. The basic premise is that of a Harry Potter who values relaxation over everything else.

Long Fanfiction - Other

--------------

RWBY - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898868/1/Professor-Arc][Professor Arc]] - 4/5 - 580k

#+begin_quote
  This story's premise is if when Jaune Arc's fake transcripts were much more impressive than they should have been. Instead of becoming a student, he's offered a job as an assistant Professor. The story is about the charade he engages in so that his cover isn't blown and he isn't sent to jail. Runs with the misunderstanding premise a bit too long imo, but otherwise a hilarious story. Has a sequel that I haven't bothered reading, but could be good. The author is really good at writing and some of his other works are well written stories as well.
#+end_quote

RWBY - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11721523/1/The-Fall-of-Professor-Arc][The Fall of Professor Arc]] - 4/5 - 20k

#+begin_quote
  This story is kind of a divergence fic of the above fic written by the beta of the Professor Arc fanfiction. This author is great in their own righ as wellt. Highly recommend reading it after finishing/getting through at least halfway of Professor Arc. The story takes Professor Arc's story and reverses it.
#+end_quote

Konosuba & Overlord - [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blessings-to-this-wonderful-overlord-a-konosuba-overlord-no-not-that-one-si-story.746338/][Blessings to this Wonderful Overlord]] - 3/5 - 110K

#+begin_quote
  A great story of a dude who chooses the overlord gauntlet when inserted into Konosuba. He creates funny minions and gets caught up in the weird that is the world of Konosuba and multiplies that into funny chaos.
#+end_quote

Smallville/DC/Marvel - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3294180/1/The-Incredibly-Dense-Mind-of-Lois-Lane][The Incredibly Dense Mind of Louis Lane]] - 4/5 - 30K

#+begin_quote
  Written by my favorite fanfiction author of all time, Nonjon. This is the story of a woman who refuses to see the obvious in front of her and a man who is forcing her to choose between him and himself.
