My favorite SI stories by a long shot are the ones where the author inserts an alternative version of themselves that is like they would be, but with a selective amnesia that removes all knowledge of the setting from the SI's mind. In "With This Ring" for instance a dude wakes up with an orange power ring in the world of the Young Justice tv show. He knows quite a lot about the DC universe but is completely stumped by all the things that are different in that show when compared to any of the comics and doesn't have any real future knowledge either.
