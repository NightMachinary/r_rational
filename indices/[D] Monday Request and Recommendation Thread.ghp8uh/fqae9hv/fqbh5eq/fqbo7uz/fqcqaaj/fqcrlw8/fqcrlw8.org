'The problem'? I'm not sure what problem you're alluding to.

If you're interested, there are fanfics where the SI has no or very little knowledge of the fictional universe. And of course, fanfics and spinoffs of other fanfics, including of HPMOR. I haven't read many of those, though, so I'm not sure if there's any SIs into fanfic universe, though it wouldn't surprise me.
