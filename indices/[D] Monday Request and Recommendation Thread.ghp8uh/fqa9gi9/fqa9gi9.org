Highly recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/CivCEO-Lit-Accidental-Champion-Book-ebook/dp/B07YRTVLMZ/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=civceo&qid=1589214776&sr=8-4][CIVCEO]]. It's a series of four books about a person transported to another world where deities chose heroes are chosen to lead villages in their name. MC is the newly retired CEO of a company on earth and decides to create a nation focused on his strengths, trade.

The story is a mix of city/kingdom building and trade and merchant negotiation. The story is a bit of a popcorn fic where things happen a bit too easy for our MC, but if you like kingdom building/merchant trading/a splash of political intrigue, the books scratch that itch quite well. The books get better as the series progresses as well.
