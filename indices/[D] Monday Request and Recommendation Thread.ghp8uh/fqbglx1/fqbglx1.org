I'm looking for stories where the MC is competent without being a Mary Sue.

​

It's a scenario I'm getting more interested in as I get older and my patience with seeing the Nth MC that has trouble doing basic things decreases. Less of on YA vibe and more of an adult cast.

​

Examples I've seen: Delve, MoL, HPMOR, Perks of Immortality, Eight, Forge of Destiny, Bobiverse, James Bond (?), Indiana Jones.
