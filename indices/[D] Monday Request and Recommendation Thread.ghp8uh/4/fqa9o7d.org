Wildbow has started his new webserial [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][*Pale*]], which is set in the [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] universe, but, crucially, does /not/ require people to have read Pact before.

It seems set up to be different from the stories Wildbow has written so far, from what he mentioned he wants to keep this one short (so probably just like one or three normal books' worth of content), and it's told in 3rd person perspective, switching between at least three main characters.

The writing is atmospheric, I already like the setting, a small Canadian town for which Wildbow has even provided [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/07/brochure-experience-kennet/][a brochure including a map]]. The main plot seems to be a murder mystery with supernatural elements.

These three main characters are the most childlike Wildbow has written so far; they're three normal (not magical) girls around 13 years old. (Technically, the Lambs were younger, but they were trained assassins and don't at all compare to these three). So I don't think we'll see them be competent badasses on the scale Wildbow's protagonists usually are.
