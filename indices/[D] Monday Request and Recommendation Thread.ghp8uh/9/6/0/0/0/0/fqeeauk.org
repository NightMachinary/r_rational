id say the first 120 chapters had quite a few annoying deus ex/lucky breaks kinda thing but probably wouldn't class it as explicitly irrational behaviour by the main character just not very clever. I'd say the plot improves a lot from about 120 chapter in. But if you didn't like the start at all you won't like the rest, same strokes but a better painting.
