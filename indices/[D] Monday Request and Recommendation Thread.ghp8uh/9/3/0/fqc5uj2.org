Thanks for the recommendation, but I can only assume that you either haven't read that much of it or your comment is some sort of cruel prank.

Women are practically nonexistent in this story, and when they appear, it's as "females" whose looks /must/ be commented on and compared to the other "females" around them. There is literally a conversation in one chapter about how "females" only have value when men give it to them. Not only is the MC gifted a hot magical princess gf out of nowhere, but she's incredibly insecure and deeply in his debt because apparently his dad gave her a magic tree when they were babies.

I read a little bit more while writing this comment, and /my god/:
