A harem isn't well-written if you don't have the involved members going at each other's throats, I feel. The very foundation of it is the age-old struggle and conflict for limited resources (in this case influence and access to the "owner", who is in a position of power to warrant a harem in the first place). To have the harem get along with each other and "share" seems so unnatural and forced, and rubs out an avenue for the writer to write about intrigue. Most real-life examples of harems end in some ridiculously gruesome stuff.

I also agree 3-4 members in a harem is optimal in terms of screen-time for each "party" to make their case. More than that and there isn't any space to get to know the characters.
