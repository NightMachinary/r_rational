One problem I have encountered is that even very well written polyamory falls apart once the author tries to move beyond a threesome. - Relationships are only interesting if they get some depth and heft to them, and if they are multi-lateral. With a threesome, you need to track 3 relationships from 3 points of view. This can be done, and even fit within the constraint of a not-wrist-breaking book length.

However, the graph of relationships gets just far to many lines in it at four and above, which means either earlier relationships stop being explored (and at that point, you might as well write about serial monogamy!) or everything becomes super superficial.
