I had to drop this, it was good until the author turned the MC combat strategy into I'm so fast nobody can touch me on the inside, and made her hyper OP on the outside. The setting is good, I'd have enjoyed a more reasonable power level and progression on the outside, but no, the MC can just ignore the economy, have and steal any power she wants and even upgrade them.

It's too much for me. One or two things sure, but this level of OP is too annoying, coupled with this rebirth / chosen one stuff it's like he's trying to make me drop it on purpose.
