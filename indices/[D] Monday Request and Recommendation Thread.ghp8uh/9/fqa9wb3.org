I like LitRPG and Xianxia for light reading because they let me turn off my brain for a bit, but the majority of the ones I read on Amazon Unlimited and the ones I see recommended here completely destroy my 'mersion when all the male characters act like awkward weirdos around women.

What are some good progression-porn stories that treat women like human beings?

Here are some that I've liked, in no particular order and off the top of my head:

- Worth the Candle
- Street Cultivation
- Changing Faces (thanks [[/u/IICVX]]!)
- Cradle
- ... I really thought this list would be longer
