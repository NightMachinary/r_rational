I've mostly played Red Rescue Team and Explorers of Sky, so I can only really offer ideas on those two.

Red Rescue Team has heavy fate elements, with the protagonist being sent into the Pokemon world so that they might save the Pokemon world. The main problem, the meteor, is solved by Rayquaza blowing it up with a Hyper Beam, which ought to do next to nothing to the meteor itself beyond reducing it to a ton of smaller meteors no less deadly when summed up. The protagonist is also guided through the plot by a Gardevoir who can only appear in dreams, despite said Gardevoir having nothing at all to do with the protagonist. From the perspective of rational fiction, the overall plot's a total mess.

Explorers of Sky has a lot more character agency, comparatively. There's you, a human with pre/postcognitive powers, and Grovyle, who both head back in time from a Bad Future to try and Fix Things. There's Primal Dialga, the tyrant ruling over the Bad Future where Time itself has fallen apart, and his faithful servant Dusknoir who is sent back in time to stop you and Grovyle. Then there's Darkrai, the hidden mastermind behind not only Dialga's descent into madness but also the human, you, being separated from Grovyle, gaining amnesia, and being put in a Pokemon body from attacking you while you were time traveling. The only real beef I have with it is how Darkrai is unambiguously evil so the fundamental drive of the plot isn't as interesting as it could be.

Insofar as adapting an existing story to a rational fic, Explorers of Sky sounds like a good fit, though the many moving parts might make Red Rescue Team an easier target for its simplicity. Insofar as making an original world/plotline of the Mystery Dungeon theme for a rational fic, there's enough creative freedom in the world for a large variety of plots, but as a price you effectively have an original fiction with a Pokemon veneer.
