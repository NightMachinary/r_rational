I plan to write a rational mystery dungueon and i already have a lot of worldbuilding ideas and part of the first chapter ,but I just cant start writing, and I keep procastinating and leaving it for later. Its also the first thing I write so I dont think its going to be very good but anyway I think I should start writing and post it somewhere to get feedback instead of being constantly rewriting the first charter. So thanks for giving me a reason to convince myself to start writing.

Originaly it was the plot of a mystery dungueon fangame I was making and I migth still do the fangame but In going to write it as a fanfiction anyway.

I don't know how rational the story is going to be I have more or less an idea of how to make the setting make sense , (although I still havent though munch about things like politics and how the viliages are organiced,or why the main character ends up in the pokemon world), but I don't know if I will be able to write good intelligent characters.
