There is a very, very old fanfic I read... must have been about 15 years ago called: "The Type Chart". I remember thinking it was awesome, and it was kinda vaguely along these lines.

EDIT:

Holy Miltank! [[http://www.thepokemontower.com][www.thepokemontower.com]] is still up! All the fanfiction of my youthful reading! wow!

And I found it!

Fic is by Dragonfree, direct link to the text is [[http://www.thepokemontower.com/authors/dragonfree/typechart1.html]], 7 chapters long, each chapter increasing that final integer by 1.

Nostalgia time!

It's incomplete. I didn't even remember. ;-;
