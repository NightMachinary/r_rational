Depending on the specifics of how and where it gets hyper beamed that could make a huge difference actually. lots of little meteors burn up in atmosphere, and if done from far enough away or with enough force it could spread apart the individual meteors enough to cause no long lasting harm, or if the hyper beam goes through the meteor it might throw half or more of the mass in the opposite direction.

Also, darkrai having no real motive makes it easier imho, as that means one can be assigned much easier.
