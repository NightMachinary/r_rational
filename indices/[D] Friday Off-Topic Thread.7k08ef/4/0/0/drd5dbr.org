Hmm. An Immediate Mode gui seems like it would be much more in line with what I'm used to for actual game development, but in my experience that is make-or-break based on the power of the library used. This javascript project is intended to be a resurrection of the Bill's PC template creation utility, so it's basically a glorified form. This sort of things /ought/ to be something that the web knows how to do already, plus I'm attempting to give a good faith effort to actually /learn/ web dev for once instead of just bitching about it from afar. It may or may not work out, but I'm not willing to have /that/ much control over how the GUI operates.
