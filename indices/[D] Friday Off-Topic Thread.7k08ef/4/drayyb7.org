Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

--------------

Skipped last week for lack of anything to talk about, sorry. This week at least had me poking at code for the first time in a while;  I am unsure if my recent motivation is more due to beginning to take 4000 IU of vitamin D3 at night, or due to the confidence boost from getting the most bitchin' haircut I've ever had in my life.  Either way, I'll take it, but I hope it's the D3, as that seems much more reliably available.  

I set up the repo and got Ember and Semantic UI talking with each other, but my lack of experience is certainly felt.  In Visual Studio it's /so easy/ to throw a UI together and iterate on its behavior, and I don't just say that as someone who's used it for a couple decades.  Back when I was /12/ I could throw together GUIs like nobody's business using the precursors of the modern tooling, but in web development it really feels like I'm straining to reach my arms under the bed to solve a rubick's cube purely by touch.

It doesn't help that every resource I can find is geared towards trying to explain the /language/ of javascript to me when that's not what's confusing.  I can pick up the language details as I go thankyewverymuch, I just need something to point me in the right direction as far as grokking the /workflow/ and organization; how do these files interlock with one another, where does my logic need to go, *why the shit does a simple application need four separate languages*, etc etc.  Part of this is my own doing, since I've essentially randomly chosen two sets of libraries to work with, but oh well.

I might actually spend a few minutes laying out what I want to see in Visual Studio and then use it as a guideline as I hit the browser until it does what I want.  That seems like a decent plan.

I'll probably not get a whole lot done this weekend, as my brother is graduating from college and for some reason I'm expected to be there, after which we're also getting roped into an early chrismas celebration.  Here's hoping it's not too big a speed bump.
