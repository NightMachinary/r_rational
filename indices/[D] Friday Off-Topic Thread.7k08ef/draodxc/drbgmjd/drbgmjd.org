  Gravity is still fucked up near the edges

Wouldn't it just slope diagonally down and towards the center, making it feel like a hill? If the disk is large enough that observers can't see the whole thing, and automatically adjust their perception of "down", then when you walk towards the edge it should appear as if you are walking up a hill that gradually gets steeper and steeper. If the inhabitants didn't have a good theory of gravity and built a map of the world out of local maps, they would think it was shaped like a wide bowl, with a flat part for most of the world but slanted uphill around the edges. And funtionally, it would be pretty much identical to living in a world that actually was shaped like a bowl and had gravity pointing uniformly in one direction.

So I don't think your mortal-detector is necessary for gravitational purposes, it would only be needed to prevent people from falling off the edge (or peering over it, or noticing it exists, if your gods care about that)
