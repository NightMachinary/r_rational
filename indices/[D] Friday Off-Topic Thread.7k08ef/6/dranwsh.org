I've started learning Python, from the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Coming from learning C++ and some Java in college, it's an interesting experience. I don't particularly like the dynamic typing, and think the way of specifying which data structure to use through which braces you put is annoying (put parenthesis around your data to use a list, curly braces to make a dictionary, and I think square brackets to make a tuple?), but the ability to just /do things/ is really nice without having to think much about implementing something efficiently. The modules system is also just hands down better than C++. If there was some way to make Python statically typed, but change nothing else, that would be nice.

Note: I started less than a week ago. Any criticisms can and should be taken with a grain of salt.
