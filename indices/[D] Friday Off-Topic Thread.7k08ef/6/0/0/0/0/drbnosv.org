I agree, C++ simply has too many features and possible sources of syntax/typing errors to be a good language for learning. Students should be working with theory, whether it be high level logic in simpler/more forgiving languages like python or byte level manipulations in C. (Although personally I think learning in C and then moving to higher level languages makes for better programmers) That book has a great list of topics btw, I've been wanting to learn Scheme so I'll be sure to check it out.

Although I'm not entirely sure what you mean by your computational science recommendation. In scientific computing, Python is still mainly used only as an interface to C, C++, or Fortran code and it's generally important to be able to work with it at all levels. Funnily enough, the bloated way python2 loads modules and the increasing number of scientists switching to it was causing a lot of problems for clusters a few years back.
