  I'm so, so sorry. Your school has done you a disservice. Many schools are switching to using Python for their CS programs: Java isn't worth teaching (it is falling out of favor, and close enough to other C-like languages) and C++ is an "experts-only" language --- that is, familiarity is required, but you won't be able to learn enough of it in college to say you know it.

I actually rather like C++ when I can get things working. It's not an easy language, but I think it's good at teaching how the computer works at a lower level, where Python seems to hide it. For learning computer science over learning programming, I don't think it's a bad choice, and it makes languages after that easier to understand.

  Before judging dynamically typed systems too hashly, look into some languages with stronger typing systems than C++ and Java. Haskell, for instance (not very practical, but still worth spending the time to learn).

I'm not making any final judgements any time soon. I haven't even finished AtBSwP yet, and I'm aware that it isn't the best book for learning the Python language.
