Been thinking about religion.

One of the things it seems to be actually useful for is support during hardships, especially loss of loved ones.

- It frames the situation in a positive light- they are in a better place and if there's a culprit then he'll burn in hell forever (especially when the earthly courts don't serve appropriate justice because reasons). Also their death wasn't meaningless roll of the dice, but part of a greater plan. Yes, it sounds horrible to most of you, but when one of your beliefs is "you don't know shit about God's plan or can even comprehend his âˆž IQ" then it's easier to use (also heaven is a thing, so they just got invited to party earlier).
- Often provides social support. By this I mean both local community as well as religious services, stuff like confessions and blessings.

So I guess my question is: atheists/non-theists of any kind- what do/did you do when tragedy like that hits you? Is there any comfort that is brought by science and rationality, be it practical or more mental/psychological/philosophical?

(Edit: True, I am pretty much referring to Christianity. Sadly I don't have enough experiences with other religions. If you do have such experience, then please tell if those arguments change in any significant way.)
