The goal of science and rationality isn't to make you feel better when tragedy hits, it is to make it less likely for tragedy to hit in the first place.

Being comforted by tragedy is a *bad* thing. You shouldn't be feeling happy when you lose loved ones. You shouldn't be thinking this is all part of a grand plan by an omnipotent benevolent being who will make everything right in the end. And you *definitely* should never think that this tragedy is beyond your ability to comprehend. To do so is to lose the motivation to actually do something about the tragedy.

When the non-theist sees death, they don't think "oh this is god's super super wise plan, let's not interfere with it lest we break it", they think "this is a meaningless dice roll, so let's work on loading those dice in our favor". And then they get to use science and rationality to figure out how to load those dice effectively.
