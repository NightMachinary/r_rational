  When the non-theist sees death, they don't think "oh this is god's super super wise plan, let's not interfere with it lest we break it"...

Religious people still value their contemporary lives. They still wear seat belts, avoid addictions and in general lead healthy lives (as much as 'normal' people do, anyway). While there /are/ extremes like you've mentioned, 'following God's plan' mostly just means making sure your actions are moral, with some consultation from scriptures/religious authorities.

Religion's strength doesn't lie in it's logic. In fact, there's a fundamental disconnect between religion and science- (again an example from Christianity only) faith is valued higher than empirical evidence, as shown here- [[http://biblehub.com/bsb/john/20.htm][John 20:29]] /“Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.”/.\\
Talking to an imaginary deity, going through all the rituals and gatherings and interpreting the holy books in a specific way... The purpose of all those practices is willful expansion of irrational beliefs. The beliefs people hold will contradict, because their personalities, subjective worldviews and needs differ, even if they stem from one 'culture' provided by a common pantheon.\\
'God loves you' isn't just an empty platitude there, but probably the most fundamental belief a practitioner may have. However terrible the trials, they are better than they could be, and even in most horrible situations God still has your back. Is it enough? With the right attitude, yes.

Religiosity is like any bias, instinct or emotion we as humans have- it distorts the correct vision of reality, but it still serves a practical purpose. Also, it's /there/, as you can't just cut it away, merely acknowledge and try to ignore/control it. And just like with the rest of those 'features', ignoring their influence or possible uses feels like a massive blindspot in rational outlook.

  The list just goes on and on and on. While sure, none of them guarantee you perfect immortality, it is better to do them than to just sit on your thumbs thinking that some benevolent omniscient god has everything already planned out for you. And the less happy you are about tragedy, the more motivated you will be to actually do something about it.

While I do find this attitude good and admirable in general, it waves away the problem of actually facing the loss.\\
I don't mean loss as a death of a single family member, like a grandpa. I mean stuff like losing your wife and/or kids while your house burns down. A difference in implied severity here.

There's one problem especially- what happens when someone does /all/ that, yet tragedy still strikes? When they try their hardest, and it isn't good enough? What can that person /do/, besides carrying on like they used to? Won't their efforts be 'proven' (irrationally and not quite, but still) to be meaningless, since they failed to stop that from happening?

My questions boil down to: does science provide any tools or knowledge for managing internal mental state /during/ the grieving process?\\
Assuming that a person /does/ find comfort in religious practices when facing hardship, is there any pragmatic reason for them to believe in rationality instead?

It may look like asking for a magical wand that solves all your problems, but- science already manages to master/manipulate all parts of the external environment. Does any of it extend into realm of the human mind however? Feels like it should have.
