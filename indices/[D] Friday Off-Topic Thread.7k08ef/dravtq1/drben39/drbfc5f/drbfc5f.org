While tragedy itself probably shouldn't comfort anyone, there's value in finding comfort in the midst of tragedy. Because tragedy (at least in this current stage of life and probably for the rest of our lives) is unavoidable.

It's all well and good to tout that we should be trying to beat death but, let's face reality, 99.99% percent of people aren't doing anything in their lives even remotely related to possibly beating death. Even if we're generous and include everyone working in the medical/pharmaceutical field, that still leaves a vast majority of people who are doing nothing to stave off death and probably never will. So why is it wrong for them to then seek comfort after what is (often times) a completely unavoidable tragedy?

I do see where you're coming from here from a logical perspective; I just think your perspective is flawed and supremely over-idealistic.

EDIT: And it's also worth pointing out that even the most religious fanatics are usually quite fine with advances in medicine and other life extension options. Just because they believe it's God's plan doesn't mean they mind living longer, better lives (usually anyway)
