A) /I/ would prefer it if you explicitly delineated between "religion" as a category and any specific religion, since I get the impression you're talking about Christianity, what with the hell fire and all.

B) I have not had a loss of a loved one. For what loss, tragedy, and hardship I've experienced, I reach out to friends (so, that community aspect), and I look to solve problems. How can this thing not happen again?

C) I've had spiritual experiences that give me something like that "positive light" to tap into, but nothing like the specifics of what you've described.
