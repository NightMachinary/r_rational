#+begin_quote
  put parenthesis around your data to use a list, curly braces to make a dictionary, and I think square brackets to make a tuple?
#+end_quote

#+begin_example
  a_tuple = 1, 2, 3
  a_list = [1, 2, 3]
  a_set = {1, 2, 3}
  a_dict = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}
#+end_example

Parentheses, =(= and =)=, are only relevant for /empty/ tuples, aka. =()=. The expression =(1, 2, 3)= is just a parenthesized tuple, just as =([1, 2, 3])= is a parenthesized list.
