Excellent, you can start with good habits!

For an opinionated guide that explains good defaults for every decision you might need to make, check out [[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/][/The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python/]].

If you're after a 'compiler has my back' feeling in Python, check out the [[http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/][Flake8]] linter and use [[https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Mypy]] to check your type annotations - with Python 3.6 for the nicest annotation syntax and =typing= module.
