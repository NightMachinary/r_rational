Nah, you've got the gist of it. JavaScript is basically the same thing, except closer to C++ syntax, less insane in some ways, more insane in others.

If you want "C++ except you can just do things", I recommend the D language. It has basically C++'s typing system with awkward classes and the best templates I've ever seen in a programming language. It has modules instead of #includes, and other nice stuff.

There's no real killer feature (though, again, best templates ever), but it's the best compromise between python-style accessibility and C++ style type safety that I know of.

Also, it has very convenient language bindings, and it's binary-compatible with C and C++, which means you can easily set up hybrid projects.
