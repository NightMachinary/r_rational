MagicWeasel life update:

- Had my job interview for my own job (see last week's thread / my comment history for details about why that is a thing) on Wednesday. I fucking nailed it because of course I did, I'm pretty charismatic and can be super profesh for interviews.

- My boss was on the interview panel and he came to my desk Thursday morning to say how well I did at the interview (as if there was any doubt - I'm super qualified for the job!!! - grumble grumble he has no faith in me - but whatever!)

- I'm making a mango and ginger cheesecake today (EDIT: I [[https://imgur.com/2f8gaqP][made]] a mango and ginger cheesecake)

- Now all my stupid job stress is over and I'm on uni break I can start writing more of my urban fantasy supernatural romance novel in earnest which is really exciting as what I thought was a complete first volume needs some expanding to have more actual romance in it (and for the record by romance I mean like social interaction not quivering members)

- Met up with a person who saw me mention I was from a small Australian city and was like "any chance it's Perth?" and I was like "yes can we be best friends", so a (first?) [[/r/rational]] meetup has technically happened
