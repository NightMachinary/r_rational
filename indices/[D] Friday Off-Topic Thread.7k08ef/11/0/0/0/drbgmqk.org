  It's all well and good to tout that we should be trying to beat death but, let's face reality, 99.99% percent of people aren't doing anything in their lives even remotely related to possibly beating death.

This is only if you define "beating death" as literally becoming immortal, and ignore everything else that helps prevent tragedy. Which is pretty unfair since there's tons of little things you can do to help prevent tragedies:

- Wear a seat belt.
- Ensure your city has good traffic laws.
- Look left and right before crossing a street.
- Learn medicine.
- Exercise.
- Eat healthy foods.
- Go for medical check ups.
- Vote for laws/politicians that promote safety.
- Avoid dangerous actions.
- Learn science about disasters to prevent them from happening, or at least get early warnings.
- Prepare emergency supplies and emergency escape routes.
- Get proper policing and firefighting services running in your area.
- etc.
- etc.

The list just goes on and on and on. While sure, none of them guarantee you perfect immortality, it is better to do them than to just sit on your thumbs thinking that some benevolent omniscient god has everything already planned out for you. And the less happy you are about tragedy, the more motivated you will be to actually do something about it.

  EDIT: And it's also worth pointing out that even the most religious fanatics are usually quite fine with advances in medicine and other life extension options. Just because they believe it's God's plan doesn't mean they mind living longer, better lives (usually anyway)

Theists are hard to model because their beliefs tend to be contradictory. Or at least, have members with radically different beliefs that raise the same banner anyway. For example, when a tragedy happens, some priests say its "God's will", so just accept it and be happy that god is taking care of the dead, while others say its a "trial from god", or that "god only helps those who help themselves", so you have to work hard to overcome it or face god's wrath, which is not exactly comforting since you're apparently in some horrible trial with your eternal salvation/damnation at stake. Which is it?!
