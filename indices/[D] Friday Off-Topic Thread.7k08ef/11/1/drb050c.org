Atheism tends to both require and result from a tendency towards accepting reality, even when it's not what you wanted. I mean, let's be real, it would be absolutely amazing if God had a plan and everything was going to work out, and everyone who dies goes to heaven, etc. Even just being able to truly believe that, whether or not it's true, would be a great help in reducing anxiety and stress.

The problem is, very few Christians actually seem to truly believe any of it. Christians cry at funerals when they should be celebrating instead. Christians join the military and go off to kill people, potentially jeopardizing their place in heaven, or at least their relationship with God. For better or for worse, true belief seems to be a rarity among Christians. Unfortunately for them though, most people are better at understanding and accepting reality than they would like to be.

Nonetheless, I think it's easily arguable that there /are/ belief systems which are objectively superior to atheism for human functioning, whether or not they're true. For example, a genuine belief in a "divine plan" would certainly fit that definition as it would relieve anxiety and stress. Genuine belief in heaven is harder to argue for since it can reduce fear of death and cause risky or even risk-seeking behaviors. Even so, I think there are actually some variants of Christianity which could be described as objectively better than atheism for human functioning. Unfortunately, we humans are better at accepting reality than we might like, so atheists get stuck with facing the good and the bad for what they are whether they like it or not.
