Speaking as someone raised Christian for the first 17 years of his life (and then getting knocked straight into Agnosticism in his freshmen year of college), they usually have justifications for those things that (while oftentimes circular in their own way) allow them to continue on. For example, at funerals, most people will tell you that they are crying for themselves, not the person who died. And the pastor will often remark on how it's important to remember that that person (no matter how shitty or "un-Christian" they were, lol) is now with God and living blissfully. And for military service, Christians will often say that the "Thou shalt not kill" rule is absolute (and there's some evidence to suggest that's true) and things like wartime and self defense are usually exceptions.

And I do agree that there are certainly belief systems that are objectively superior to atheism for human functioning, regardless of their veracity.
