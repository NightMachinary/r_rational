I've long seen the value in religion in exactly the context you're speaking about. It serves as a beacon of hope and a moral center for people who allow themselves to buy into it. Even the most vitriolic atheists among us can probably agree that they would prefer their loved ones going to a benevolent eternal afterlife as opposed to the lack of existence that we feel is one of the more likely outcomes of death.

I've honestly had moments where I wished I could delude myself enough to buy into a religion (most probably Christianity since that's what I was raised in) because I can see the emotional comfort and strength it gives so many; the idea of God allows people to have a capacity for love, forgiveness and hope that is, while not impossible, very /very/ unlikely in shitty situations.
