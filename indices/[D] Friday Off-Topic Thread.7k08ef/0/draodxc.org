Unexpected rational world-building in a glowfic I'm reading:

So the protagonist is transported to a magical realm. Among other oddities, the Earth is flat. Whatever, that's just a standard fantasy thing, I'll roll with it.

And then she gets the chance to chat with a minor god, and it turns out that no, there's a story behind it.

The gods started out not knowing how physics worked. They built a flat disk world, because intuitively that seemed like the right shape for people to live on, but it didn't have enough mass so nothing would stick to the surface.

They eventually figured out the mass/gravity thing. So they naively fixed their prototype by extend the disk into a /giant cylinder/. Gravity is still fucked up near the edges, so they clumsily patched the worst of it with magic, and installed a mortal-detector so that any explorer that wandered too close to the fucked-up regions could be politely turned around.

By the time they realized that a sphere would work way better, there were already mortals living on the flat bit, and planet remodelling releases far too much waste heat.

*edit:* "Also when we introduced oxygen there was a mass extinction event. There were actually several of them."
