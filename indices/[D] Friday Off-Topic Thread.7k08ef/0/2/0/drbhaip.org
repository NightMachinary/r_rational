  Wouldn't it just slope diagonally down and towards the center, making it feel like a hill?

Yup. Unfortunately, the inhabitants are Tolkien elves (or at least a fanfic of them, I don't know the lore well enough to tell), whose eyesight is good enough that they can tell their planet is flat by sight when the weather's good.

I don't remember the exact reasoning for the mortal-detector, maybe it /was/ just for people falling off the edge. Gods don't particularly keep all this secret, they just want the world to behave as originally intended.
