It's a form of multi-author fanfic/roleplay, told primarily through dialogue. Often spending rather more time on character development and world-building than on advancing any sort of plot.

Authors typically re-use their favourite characters a lot, except reborn in one setting or another. The main protagonist is often female, and often overpowered for one reason or another. The "portal fantasy" plot is super common. Crossovers between glowfics used to be super common, now less so.

It's a descendant from rationalfic, in that the original ones were written by Alicorn (and Kappa) using the personality of Alicorn's rational!Bella from the Twilight rationalfic Luminosity (itself directly inspired by HPMOR). Characters are generally rational, sometimes even rationalist, though settings and plots not necessarily so.
