No offence taken. You are quite correct. I don't go around /recommending/ glowfic; I think people who would enjoy it are a minority even in this sub.

What attracts me to the genre despite its flaws is:

- Conversations between intelligent and eminently reasonable people. That practically /never/ happens outside rationalfic, and even within the genre it's not normally the focus.

(I'm just coming back from the new /Star Wars/, and *boy is this on my mind right now*.)

- /Romance/ between intelligent and eminently reasonable people. Same.

- Protagonist is powerful and wins. Wish-fulfilment is the sugar of fanfic, in that it makes it easy to like a fic but will make you nauseous if that's all the fic has to offer. Well, glowfic is dangerously sweet, to be sure. I did use the original as one of the examples in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41zkkw/d_yudkowskys_first_law_of_science_fiction_a_rant/][my rant on the topic]]. But good glowfics temper it by regularly throwing new, diverse, and at times horrifying problems for the protagonist to curbstomp, and that works well enough for me. Or I drop the glowfic and pick a fresh one whose problems haven't been solved yet.
