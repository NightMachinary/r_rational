I swear I don't mean any offense, but I've never seen the point in reading Glowfics, the format is just horrible and as you said quality comes and goes seemingly randomly. Really seems like the kind of thing that is made for the writers instead of the readers.

Could you try to sell the idea of them to me? I'd like to give them another try, since I keep hearing of them, but I just can't bring myself to knowing what I know.
