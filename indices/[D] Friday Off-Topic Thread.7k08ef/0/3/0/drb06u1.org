[[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/212][Leave of Absence]], by Alicorn and lintamande.

I did say "glowfic", which in this case is shorthand for "the clever, highly driven Bella Swan from [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][a particular Twilight rationalfic]] is reincarnated in Loki from a genderswapped Marvel Cinematic Universe, who is stranded on Middle-Earth during the events of the Silmarillion. The story is very long and primarily told via dialogue."

Delve into glowfic at your own risks, it's a bit of a rabbit hole and the quality is variable.
