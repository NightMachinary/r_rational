Have you tried looking into Immediate Mode GUIs? =Semantic= looks nice, but it also looks very Retained Mode, which accounts for a lot of "How the hell do you go from this code to that result?" types of problems.

On the other hand, Retained Mode GUIs are the norm, and Immediate Modes are harder to find. The one I know about is =dear_imgui=, but it's intended more for debugging than actual game menus (and the workflow isn't even that easy to grok).
