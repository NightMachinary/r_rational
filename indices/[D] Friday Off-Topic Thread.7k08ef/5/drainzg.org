So, I'm told discussing US politics [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr6lx12/][is now forbidden]] on the weekly threads? Is that an official rule yet? 'Cause I don't see it anywhere.

EDIT: Never mind, it's in the sidebar. Maybe put it in the thread intros too.
