I recently discovered that I had erased part of one of my short story entries from Google Docs.

I had local copies, so I uploaded to a more permanent location which would not be subject to my occasional electronic housekeeping efforts.

If I ever participate in the writing contests again, I think I'll just skip Google Docs entirely and use Fictionpress from the start.

Truck driving and writing are not entirely mutually exclusive, but I find that my writing moods and my driving schedule are not aligning well. I'm looking at making some changes soon, and seeing if that helps to better synch my muse and my career.
