  I'm officially done with finals. It's weird that I often end up way closer to the wire to get an A than you'd expect from chance. I think I end up moderating how much effort I put in to that goal which is probably less than ideal.

I've always thought gunning for scores beyond the ceiling of evaluation to be wasted effort, at least in classes that are not intrinsically interesting or useful or when you're not trying to impress the teacher (for e.g. letters of recommendation). It's good to overshoot a little bit -- to buffer against uncertainty in whatever your marks for the final evaluation might be -- but past that I see little point in trying to get a high score (unless you're shooting to be #1 at your school, but I'd think for that you might need to sacrifice taking a difficult (set of) major(s), since you'd be competing against people with less challenging coursework). Better to focus your energies on research or side projects or bettering yourself in other ways imo.

I was always a bit chuffed at my own ability to skirt by at just above a given cutoff. Even managed to do it with Latin Honors, too (since you typically leave numeric GPA off your resume/CV once out of school, but would usually write out /summa cum laude/ or whatever after you degree name). If the rewards for being the best are uniform across all the members of that set, it's best to be the worst of the best lol.

Anyway, congrats on the A! And on being done with finals! Have a good winter holiday!
