I'm officially done with finals. It's weird that I often end up way closer to the wire to get an A than you'd expect from chance. I think I end up moderating how much effort I put in to that goal which is probably less than ideal.

In other news I need to decide what to do next now. I'm more and more feeling like I'm falling into the same kinds of mental traps video games use. Doing something because it feels productive even if it isn't. Should I still be going to school or should I seriously search for a job and find the best one I can now. I finished my CS degree, my thought was that for my ideal degree Biotech could only help and I have essentially free tuition, but I'm less and less sure of myself
