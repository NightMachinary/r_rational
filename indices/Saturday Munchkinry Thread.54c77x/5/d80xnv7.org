You have a material that can stop all kinetic motion within a certain frame of reference, according to preprogrammed geometric shapes. The more energy fed into this material, the more energy it "stops". There is a lower limit, you cannot stop electrons or photons or anything else of exceptionally low mass, but so long as you have enough energy, there is no upper limit.

How would you use this for combat? What about improving society?
