*The Fly Power*

"Absolute and impossible to be overridden control". Ok, time to generate infinite energy or wealth or whatever via doing things like controlling flies to spontaneously fuse into heavy elements. That and no limitation or organic flies. In the spirit of the prompt? No idea, but munchkinry and all right, controlling robot flies is at least a start, and stretching the definition of absolute control seems like something that should be tried.

*Board Games*

Already covered well in other comments. Can likely be utilised to win at gambling, depending on how far you can go with custom board games and the definition of board games lets you potentially become a source of any information desired. Assuming it has you win following the rules anyway, and not be swindling everyone else into giving up or whatever.

*Super Rectal Muscles*

Clench hard, attempt to recreate the new universe in your image because you just destroyed the current one.

*Livermorium Control*

Step 1 is spending a lot of time figuring out how to prove it, step two is I now have the ability to keep it from decaying and possibly get closer to absolute zero than has ever been done. What would scientists do for the chance to study Livermorium without the chance of it decaying rapidly? Just got to telekinetically suspend its state. Although this does stretch the usage of telekinesis a bit.

*Half-Invisibility*

I spend months training until I don't know the difference, making all of my both my left and right half from my own perception. Alternatively I exploit flawed wording and just do both to the lack of conditions about exclusivity of invisibility.

That or start research into what the uses of substances that change to match the refractive index of their surroundings are. Hmm, I wonder what happens if it separates two mediums? Water and air for instance, it should be analogous to one of the two, measuring using equipment that can pick up the tiny refraction anyway, which makes it appear as something it's not rather than not appearing. Might be able to do something with that.
