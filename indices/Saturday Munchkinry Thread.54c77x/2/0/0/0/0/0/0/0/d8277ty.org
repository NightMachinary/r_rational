Well they don't /need/ a calculator, and it's not guessing anymore than sudoku is a guessing game.

That said, it's still a pretty poor game, being just factoring given numbers repeatedly to progress.

Games can be odd and seem ungamelike though, TIS-100 is a perfect example of that, being a video game that is literally just programming in a made up programming language and OS to solve problems. Nevertheless for the kind of niche market it targets it can be quite liked, I liked it.

Really the question is, what counts as a board game? How would it deal with an effectively pure luck based board game such as snakes and ladders for instance? Let you roll the dice in just the right way? A lot of gambling games have a board or very similar structure, could you use it to win at something like roulette or blackjack?
