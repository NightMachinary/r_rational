What? Jesus man, have you been living under a rock? How have you never heard of /Factoring 27,221 into it's two three digit prime factors/?

The game board is two equally sized squares, touching on one side, colored white and black. Two game pieces are placed on the dividing line between the two squares.

Gameplay has both players guessing (in secret) two three digit prime numbers, and if they divide 27,221 evenly, that player wins, and their piece us moved to the white square. That means you can have 0, 1, or even 2 winners!

What part of "easy to learn, hard to master" don't you understand?
