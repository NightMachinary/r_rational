Ok no computer.But the main idea is creating a board game where In order to win you have to For example calculate prime factors or make computation x or just plainly answer questions , you can make a computer based on board games using a friend's moves as input and your power as unlimited processing power.

If games like trivial count you can make the questions and use it as an Oracle machine and if the power doesn't answer questions , but instead only says where you have to move pieces(so it's only for games like chess or go) that's no problem because you can design the game so you answer questions by moving pieces to places)
