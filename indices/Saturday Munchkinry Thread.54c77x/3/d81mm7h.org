You have the power to make homeopathic products that you touch work(they follow the 3 laws of homeopathy ) but only if they were created by someone who believed in homeopathy and considers himself to be a expert and sold to someone who also believed that it should work ,but the effect isn't affected by the client beliefs only the beliefs of the homeopath and can't contradict the beliefs of the community of homeopaths (basically you have a touch based power to make placebomancy like in unsong work for homeopathy) .\\
Because I know how you are , touch means contact with parts of you that are still connected by living flesh to the rest of your body

Do the most damage posible.
