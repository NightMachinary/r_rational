You can transfer energy between mediums, at an efficiency lower than what it would take to do it using normal technology. For example, if you have physical access to a car's gas tank, you can convert the gasoline to kinetic energy to push the car, but you'll run out of gas far quicker than if you were just using the engine. You can also use your own calories for an energy source, but you run into the same efficiency issue. Power is line of sight for effect, proximity/touch for the source. The closer you are to both, the more efficient you get, but it's going to be less than burning/eating/otherwise using the energy in the first place. Basically, this power doesn't break the laws of thermodynamics.

1. What do you do, and

2. What is the most energy-dense fuel you can buy cheaply, in large quantities, without arousing suspicion?
