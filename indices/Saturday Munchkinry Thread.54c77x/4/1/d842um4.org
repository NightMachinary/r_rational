Is "heat" energy? Is "a temperature gradient" energy? If those both work, then you have infinite energy from the start, and your only concern is how quickly you can use it to generate power.

(This also works with "pressure" and "pressure differentials".)

More in the spirit of your question: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials][Gasoline/diesel]]. You can easily carry about 100 MJ worth (~3 l), and it is available hundreds of liters at a time.
