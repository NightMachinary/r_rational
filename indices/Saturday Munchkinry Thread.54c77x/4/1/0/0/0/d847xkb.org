  Can you draw the heat from an object (netting some energy), then use the temperature differential between that object and the environment to draw out more energy, then draw that heat out, etc.?

I mean you can, but you won't get much, as you'll have to wait for the atmosphere to heat it back up same as you would anything else. You can't get something even remotely close to absolute zero using this power, it's not nearly focused enough. You're still not "netting" energy, but you are giving yourself a focal point to pull energy out of the atmosphere. You won't be freezing the planet with this method anytime soon though, since you have to wait for it to heat back up naturally.

  A bottle of gasoline? I don't see the advantages of butane or lighter fluid.

Mostly the arousing suspicion part? If I get pulled over with a bottle of gasoline in my car, it's suspicious. If I get pulled over with a small amount of lighter fluid, I pull out my zippo and a carton of cigarettes I keep around (for plausible deniability, not consumption). And in a pinch, I can burn those too.

  1l = 26 MJ, or as much energy as a person eats in 3 days. Pseudo-super-strength? Laser beams? Telekinesis?

I like the way you think :p
