I agree, though the main limitation to that is you have less forgiving distance requirements for the "source"- it's essentially limited to "touch." So you can set someone on fire a few meters away, but you have to have your hand over the gas tank to do it. Though, yes, this is technically a "freezing" power as well.

One thing I didn't mention, there's a "transfer rate" limit, also affected by distance. Pull too much energy at once, you burn up.
