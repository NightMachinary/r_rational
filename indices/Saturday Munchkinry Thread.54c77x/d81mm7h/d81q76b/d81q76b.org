Advertise new miracle homeopathic medicine. Administer it to people who believe that it will work. Since you know it works, and your patients think it will work, it shall work.

Give worldwide demonstrations. Soon people will believe it works, and the doctors will too. Each success builds upon itself. Sceptics would be shown evidence that it works beyond simple Placebo. Some wouldn't believe it, but the masses would.

Have a central factory where you dip your finger in the vats of the stuff. Provided you manage to ride the initial eave of success, you can have an empire of medicine.

And then 'invent' something which can halt aging. Repeat the process.

You may or may not have your own religion by now.

The rest is up to you, stop production of and watch people die from the unhealthy habits, being immune to disease has bred in them, rule for eternity, etc.
