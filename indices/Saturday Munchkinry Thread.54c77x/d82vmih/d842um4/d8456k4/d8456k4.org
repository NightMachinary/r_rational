They both count, but you have to focus on the source of said energy, and the energy is lost from said source- so if you have a device creating a pressure differential, then the pressure will decrease until it hits equilibrium. If you're drawing from a moving car's kinetic energy, the car will slow down, or it'll take more gasoline/the engine will have a lower fuel efficiency while you're drawing from the energy (and it's usually better to just pull from the gas tank directly, but you won't always have access to the tank.

I was also thinking gasoline, and I'm thinking that would be good for larger/stationary jobs, but what about something that is relatively energy dense, but can be carried on your person? Lighter fluid? What could you do if you could use this power, using only a 1 liter flask of butane?
