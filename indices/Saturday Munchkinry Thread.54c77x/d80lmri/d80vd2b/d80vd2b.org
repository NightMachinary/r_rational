I think the first thing I would want to do is test how it reacts to different food sources. It dissolves all organic biomass, so does it react differently to plant matter or meat? Is there a specific food it reacts differently to? If so, we can theoretically use the differences in food preference to establish basic Pavlovian interactions.

Something else I would run concurrently is try to harvest some of this crystalline biomass (hopefully there's a way to do it without harming the creature, its fear (or equivalent) would likely be a sub-optimal behaviour to induce). If we can tell the difference between crystalline biomass containing different thoughts, we could hope to establish methods of reading its thoughts by some scanning apparatus. If we can replicate crystals of different thoughts, we could have those crystals touch the blob to provide communication the other way. It wouldn't be aware of the setup, but it's intelligent, so we could make it aware if we identify the right thoughts to send it.

Of course, we don't know how the blob works, so any or all of this could fail spectacularly, but these are the clear first steps.
