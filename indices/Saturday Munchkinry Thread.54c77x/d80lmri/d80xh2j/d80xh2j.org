How does it interact with the outside world? There's no feasible way it could evolve intelligence without there being some sort of selection pressure. And how does it get food normally? Does it simply wait for animals to walk past it and grab them? If it isn't camouflaged then wouldn't animals learn to avoid it? Does it have means of locomotion? How does it use its intelligence to further its purposes of getting food and reproducing? What does it use to perceive the world in order to make decisions?

I don't mean to be pedantic, but knowing these details would probably give insight into how to interact with it in a way that it would understand. So I guess, if I was a researcher I would try to examine its natural habitat. Did it just fall from space one day and that's all we know? Because if so then I would try putting it in a variety of situations in order to test these properties in order to get a clearer picture before attempting intelligent communication.
