It can reshape and recolor its mass as it requires, but only when it is sufficiently large. More crystals=more clever it gets. We know its intelligent because its spaceship was just more of itself, the burnt remains show something that looks like a genetic improvement chamber for sections of its body that were disconnected from the whole.

The crystals are mildly photosensitive but the organism could re-purpose them when it has a surplus.

Our blob is just the only section left alive when their spaceship crashed with an unknown object.

Again the reason why we can't just feed it animals until it gets big enough is that no one is willing to risk what the escape of blob would mean in that case. We don't know the physical capabilities of a full blob or its intentions. We cannot risk that.
