You have a sapient blob of crystalline biomass, which thinks and communicates by its crystals touching other crystals of itself and sharing half-formed ideas among them. Basically a non-centralized brain. Naturally this blob didn't evolve things like vocal cords because it doesn't need them. The blob feeds itself by dissolving all organic biomass in its reach and converting them to crystals.

Blob has no concept of self but it is intelligent. You are a human with a normal body, you have a team of scientists with you and the resources of NASA. Blob is contained in a glass cylinder about twelve feet high.

Now, your team needs to find a way to talk with blob. "Find a way," or else you shall lose you funding, lab and reputation.
