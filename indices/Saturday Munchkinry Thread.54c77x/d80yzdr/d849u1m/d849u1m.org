Somehow manage to gain access to the private keys of some major corporation, likely by being in their IT department. Of course, they will ensure that physical storage devices never leave or enter the premises, but I have my memory bank. Store their private keys. Wait about a year, then move on from the company. Wait out whatever period is required by my non-compete clause, then move to a competitor known to be more shady and give the private keys to the higher ups there. Cackle madly.
