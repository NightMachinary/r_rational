Well it ought to be noted that with clever usage of reference frames this can be used in a way pretty similar to high level telekinesis. In combat choose reference frame such as a bullet traveling upwards at great speed, then stop the motion of your enemy relative to the bullet, thus shooting them upwards at ~the speed of sound.

Now interestingly there's nothing that says you need to actually have a object /to compare reference frames to/, so you can just imagine ay object with any speed, and with sufficient energy you can then make any other object match it's speed (from the theoretical objects perspective it would stop).\\
Now I don't know how you get energy to power this ability, so it's really hard to actually gauge what it's capable of. It's also not clear whether this is a superpower, or whether the preprogrammed geometric shapes act like magic runes that anyone can use.

In combat you can instantly destroy your enemy with trivial ease, it really depends on how you're getting energy, but I assume you can at the very least easily exert amounts of force that you could physically apply with your body. So it ought to be easy to constantly change your enemies movement or juggle them in the air, tearing any weapons out of their hands, and focus the energy on a smaller area to hurl projectiles like bullets at them. With larger amounts of energy just smash your enemies against the ground.

When it comes to improving society it's hard to gauge effects without knowing how you get energy to power the ability, and what the deal is with runes (and thus whether you can setup automated systems, or whether every use of the power has to be deliberately performed by you). If anyone can use the runes, then you want to ensure that nobody except trusted allies figures out how they work. Whichever governments have this are pretty much guaranteed victory in a conflict, so maybe only give this info to governments that probably won't go starting shit, so maybe like switzerland.

As for improving society: Well this could make getting things into space/orbit super easy. So just get the UN to build some enormous space colony, then you'll get it into space. Same thing goes for getting spacecraft around; you could spark a revolution in space exploration.\\
With enough energy you could bring mineral rich asteroids <10 miles wide safely to earth for mining. You could levitate amounts of water into the high atmosphere, then bring the giant pieces of ice back down to replenish lost ice due to global warming, or break it apart and let the ice crystals decrease the earth's albedo. Puting giant mirrors in orbit might be a useful way to get cheap solar energy. Who knows I'll be able to think of more if I know how the power actually works.
