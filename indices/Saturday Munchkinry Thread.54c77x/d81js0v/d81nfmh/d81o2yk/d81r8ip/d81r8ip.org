Chess on a computer is a video game? I disagree.

Regardless, the concept of beating a board game can be leveraged into making a physical game with programmable states - Turing complete, and thus anything computable can be computed.

A game where you win if you successfully factor a product of two primes before your opponent? The last step has to be you winning.

Or, here, I'll make it easier.

The game is your opponent draws a question from a deck of cards and asks you. If you get the answer correct, you win. If you answer it wrong, you lose. Like, game over.

Now just make custom cards and ask arbitrary questions. Instant gameover.
