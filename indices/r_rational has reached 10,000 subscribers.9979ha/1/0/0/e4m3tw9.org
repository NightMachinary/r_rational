I still find it depressing how hardly anyone else reads rational fiction. Are there any other fiction genres that are this obscure? You'd think someone would have popularized the genre by now by publishing a good non-fanfic work offline. There are a lot of genuinely intelligent people out there who would undoubtedly enjoy reading stories with genuine portrayals of intelligence. It's one of my biggest passions and I can't talk about it with ANYONE out in the real world.
