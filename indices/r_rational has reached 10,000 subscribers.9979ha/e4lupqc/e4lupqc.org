Sadly I don't think the number of active subscribers is increasing. This is just a way of eyeballing if active subscribers is increasing, but the most recent top-all-time posts on this sub are all at least two months old until you go a fair way down. And the only two things that are highly upvoted lately are Worth the Candle updates and Mother of Learning updates.
