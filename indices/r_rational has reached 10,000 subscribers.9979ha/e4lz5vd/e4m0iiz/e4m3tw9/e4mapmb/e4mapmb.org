It might not be called rational fiction, but any work with good enough worldbuilding is 3/4 of the way there. I would argue that the most popular rational story is The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. Otherwise, we have many stories that try to be intelligent, some of which succeed, some of which don't. They're not generally found in the fantasy genre though.
