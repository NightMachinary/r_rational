I think I can mention my experience, since I joined around September:

I found Mother of Learning trough a friend recommending it to me last year. After reading the whole thing, I went to tv troupes to see if I could find a few new troupes to search other works from. That in turn netted me the "RationalFic" troupe that mention one other fic (HPMOR) that I've read before and has this sub linked on the description. One glance at the sub wiki recommended list was more than enough to convince me that this was what I was looking for.
