If the sub is growing, then recent posts will get more upvotes easier. The quality of a post at sub num 8000 could be the same as a post at sub num 10000, but sub num 10000 should get a whole 25% more votes, a pretty dramatic difference. A really amazing post from 2 years ago could stay up longer, but if it's just stuff like chapter updates, if the sub's growing more recent chapter updates should almost always have more upvotes.

Although I've been going into some other subreddits to try to gather proof, and the results are not matching my expectations, so it seems like something's wrong with my hypothesis, or Reddit's changed some algorithm around or something.
