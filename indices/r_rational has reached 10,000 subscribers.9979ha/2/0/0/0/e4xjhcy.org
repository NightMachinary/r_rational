As someone who has been posting most of MoL chapters here for the past year I can say that the number of upvotes is slowly rising. A year ago a good MoL chapter ended up with ~150 karma, today we hover at 200, and even broke 300 mark a couple months ago. However reddit sorts the posts is of little relevance, I think.
