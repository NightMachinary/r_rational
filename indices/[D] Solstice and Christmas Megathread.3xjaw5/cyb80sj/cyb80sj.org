I'm trying to figure out an excuse for the winter holidays.. or any potential winter holiday we might be able to construct.. to be the giant things that they are, and I'm having difficulty finding a single one.

If you're going to have an annual tradition, it seems as if smaller groups should celebrate it at spaced out times, possibly spaced by region, because doing things all at once puts a huge burden on infrastructure, in everyday terms this translates to most stuff being extremely expensive and lots of stuff getting wasted.

The only practical tradition I can think of that requires everyone to break their routines at the same time every year is some kind of giant party where cliques cannot be divided into disjoint sets. Say you want to have a party where the best friends you met on the internet will be in roughly the same place so they'll get to meet each other, and so do each of them, and so do each of their friends and so on. If it's possible to organize such a thing over the 2-dimensional surface of a large land mass it will necessitate a mass pilgrimage of a large proportion of the population. And it would be wonderful and I would support doing that shit every year.

But.. if you include the requirement that this happening must happen in the worst part of winter(or in the southern hemisphere, the worst part of summer) rather than a reasonable season like the spring, then it just becomes ridiculous again. Perhaps this entire thing just a coping mechanism for seasonal affective disorder? Let's come together and get sloshed to make sure that nobody kills themselves? (Getting everyone bright, UV lamps would probably be cheaper)
