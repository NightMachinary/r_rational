It will be more apparent in the next chapters that the characters are as rational as I can make them. I designed the first chapter as a hook to the world with a couple of fight scenes.

​

The framework is there if you look at the other pages tho: you can find the protagonist's character sheet at the glossary, and you can deduce several of the world's rules on Encyclopae Arcana / Anomalus Maleficarum. These dudes won't suddenly level up and learn a deus ex ability that would solve their immediate problem- in fact, I'm planning that level ups will only happen in-between books.

​

The epistolary stuff are not required reading for the story to make sense, but I believe it allows the story to be able to use the Fair-Play trope, play with being a Munchkin and ensure that there won't be deus ex machina.
