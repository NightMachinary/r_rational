  use the same tense throughout your paragraphs

I'm working on it, I promise.

#+begin_quote
  Landshark hits kid with its special attack. Kid uses force plate mail. Does it *do* anything to him?
#+end_quote

It dissipated the kinetic force entirely. I'm adjusting the paragraph to make that more clear.

#+begin_quote
  inside the room is an anomalous Exalacross
#+end_quote

Just like the landshark on the first inquest, it should read '..a /potentially/ anomalous Exa..' Fixed it.

#+begin_quote
  The know the monster only has six abilities... how?
#+end_quote

You just guessed the first few paragraphs of the next chapter.

Class Level = number of [Abilities] from the Class.

Anomaly = a creature or object expressing an ability-like effect, without having the said [Ability].

#+begin_quote
