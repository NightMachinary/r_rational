  These dudes won't suddenly level up and learn a deus ex ability that would solve their immediate problem- in fact, I'm planning that level ups will only happen in-between books.

Honestly, I don't mind this happening *ONCE*. Assuming the levelup system works like in WoW or Diablo or something, and fully restores health and magic, the players might try to time this to an advantageous moment. But even if not, there's nothing wrong with it being done a single time, *not* against the final boss or whatever, just to keep things interesting and show that it is possible.

Using it more than once, or relying on it to solve plot points is bad form, though.
