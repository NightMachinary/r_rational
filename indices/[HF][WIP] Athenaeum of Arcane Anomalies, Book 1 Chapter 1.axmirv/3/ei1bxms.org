I started reading, noticed the brackets, dug around on the side....

​

LitRPG. Great.

​

Formatting has some issues, seems to jump around a bit. Not really impressed.

​

Then I got to the *Exalacross*.

​

/NOW/ you have my attention. So far it's kind of like an anime-esque RPG version of the SCP. I'm hooked now!

​

First, please, for the love of all that is rational, *use the same tense throughout your paragraphs*. It's not difficult, whatever tense your first sentence is in, the others should be in, too.

​

Second, is there a way to put the stuff in brackets in *BOLD* or /italics/ as well, to make it stand out? Would be appreciated.

*SPOILERY QUESTIONS*

​

Landshark hits kid with its special attack. Kid uses force plate mail. Does it *do* anything to him? We don't get any description as to what happens, merely that he uses it. Does he just tank the hit effortlessly, the armor also protecting him from all the impact force? Does he get knocked over but is physically unharmed? Does it redirect the force back into the shark? He gets repeatedly attacked later, so I'm assuming it just makes the attacks do... nothing?

​

It says 'inside the room is an anomalous Exalacross. But the characters are trying to determine /if/ it is anomalous. Is that a direct tell to us, the readers, that it /is/? Or just a minor error?

​

The 'Cross has something akin to the regeneration of the Lernean Hydra, minus the fire weakness. So why do they continue to cut at its eyes, knowing it will just make more?

​

The know the monster only has six abilities... how? Is that a hard cap on the limit of how many abilities all monsters (or that one in particular) can have? And if it's a random number, how did they know that already without another group prodding it repeatedly with an identify wand?

(*EDIT*: It's stated in some of the side material on the site that it is assumed that no creature can have more levels than it has years of age. I'm going on the assumption that, in a similar vein, no /creature/ can have more Special Abilities than it has levels, so if it's a Level 6, 6 abilities are the max. Excepting possibly Anomalous abilities. Maybe.)

​

They know it has six abilities, but I only see four listed. Did I miss something? Also, it seems the new kid is perfectly able to tag it and get information, why did he suddenly back away? Wouldn't it be good to tag it a few more times just to make sure that 'six' number was right?

​

The thing has superman-esque heat vision that apparently can be bent like a Kamehameha. That... is at least 2 more abilities. I'm assuming there was supposed to be an exact number which that is a violating of, confirming its Anomalous status?

​

Emmy has 17 levels under his belt. Does that make him a level 17 character, or are they all tracked separately? Is it common for people under 20 to have this many levels?

This makes me wonder what level the Senior Archivist and others are. Is he special at multiclassing?

(*EDIT*: Also found in side material. Even the characters in their world are uncertain about this, some saying that the more levels you have, the slower you go, while others say leveling up speed appears to be on a class-by-class basis. As well, seems that a third of people after a certain date had 'growth spurts' where they rapidly accrued levels in their early teens, which matches up with some of the stuff the kid went through. Likely the amount levelled up has some correlation with stressful events in their life.)

*SPOILERY GUESSES*

​

An Exalacross, being a living Rift, can probably perceive the departure and arrival points of people using Teleports, usually since such magics in other systems 'cheat' distance by cutting through dimensions. The teleporting guy probably should have known that, or at least assumed after it tracked him.

​

Exalacrosses' weak spot is probably the center of the cross, the 'overlap point' of their rift energies. The eyeball is likely coincidentally placed there for whatever reason, and not itself the weak point. If this were a D&D monster, the overlap point would be where you need to hit it to affect its 'main' pool of Hit Points, while the limbs can be attacked separately. The eyeball is probably just the 'emitter' of its magical attacks. Likely when its eyeball was stabbed the first time, insufficient damage was done to kill the creature, and then they just started attacking the other eyes which were located on its limbs. I base this guess on the fact that the creature tried to guard its center even after it had more than one eye.
