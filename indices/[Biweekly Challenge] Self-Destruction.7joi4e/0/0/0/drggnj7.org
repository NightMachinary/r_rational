Thanks! There's a million things no one brought up, I had to choose what would make a decent story.

(Actually, I just put the first things that came to mind. I wasn't trying to be as rational as possible, the purpose of the story is to imagine circumstances in which people behave relatively rationally but there's still the set-up for a YA dystopian, hence the typical dystopian elements like birth control, central planning etc. except here they're actually necessary and going against them kills everyone).
