I think it will be very difficult to change her opinion. It's not just a matter if presenting her with proof, it will be a difficult and gradual process.

It also depends a lot on how open she is to changing her mind. But Creationism isn't (usually) one of those things people believe just because they haven't seen the evidence like what color of car is the best or whatever. When it's tied to deeply held identity (religion in this case) there's a whole edifice of myths and misinformation. Most likely everyone around her tells her the same thing and whenever she sees something pro-science, she just turns to Answers in Genesis or whatever, finds a "rebuttal" and dismisses it.

So good luck.
