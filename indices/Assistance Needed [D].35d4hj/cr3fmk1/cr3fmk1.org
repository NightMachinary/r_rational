  why evolution is real
#+end_quote

Evolution, like gravity and relativity, "is real because it is". You should instead ask why we /consider/ it real, at which point you can refer to what is possibly the most diverse body of evidence ever amassed for a single theory, the fact that we have literally observed bacteria evolve new capabilities, the way it arises from the basic function of DNA (it would be hard to see how mutation plus reproduction could /not/ lead to incremental changes over time...) and the total absence of counterexamples that don't fit the narrative.

Keep in mind, all of life on this planet came about by incremental changes from a single-celled ancestor billions of years ago. /That's insane/. It would be entirely credible to disbelieve, if not for the /enormous weight/ of the evidence.

PS: go visit a natural science museum with your parents! One with dinosaur bones!
