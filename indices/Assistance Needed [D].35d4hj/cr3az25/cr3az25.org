You should avoid arguing with your family. If your mother wants sources, however, then give her [[http://talkorigins.org/][this link]] and direct her to [[http://talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html][this FAQ specifically.]] She has certainly been misinformed.

This subreddit is not the place for requests like this, so I am downvoting. I wish you luck with your familial relations.
