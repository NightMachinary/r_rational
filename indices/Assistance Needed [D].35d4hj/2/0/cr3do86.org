  Well, I can't offer up any proof for the non-existence of god, since there seems to be as much concrete evidence disproving Him as there is for proving Him- that is to say, zero.

Oh boy. You don't know what can of worms you just opened.

Firstly, complexity priors are a thing. Now the rest of it.

Claiming that there's no evidence against the existence of God, no falsified predictions, is a /massive load of bullshit/, and actually an insult to the religions of our ancestors, the ones they /really/ believed instead of [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Belief_in_belief][believing it made life more meaningful to believe]]. Have you ever /read/ an actual liturgy? As in, actual prayers?

[[http://www.ourtemple.org/dnn/YouthEducation/HebrewSchoolPrayers/MaarivAravim/tabid/170/Default.aspx][Here's a particularly pointed example]] (taken from my own birth religion, so as to avoid offending others more than I already intend). A reminder: this prayer is actually supposed to be said once each day.

#+begin_quote
  Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, Whose word brings on the evening. Whose wisdom opens heaven's gates, and Whose understanding changes the times and seasons, and orders the stars in their heavenly constellations according to the Divine will. God creates day and night, rolling away light in the face of darkness, and darkness in the face of light, causing the day to pass and bringing on the night, separating day and night. God's name is the Host of Heaven. The living and eternal God, rule over us for all time! Blessed are You, Lord, Who brings on the evening.

Now, I can buy that Maimonides, for instance, being a proto-scientist and a philosopher in his own day, had some massively "allegorical" interpretation of this prayer, along the lines of "Something something Cosmic Clockmaker something something God made the laws of nature blah blah." But that's not what the prayer /actually says/, and if you read the /more/ ancient commentaries, the Mishnah and Gemarah themselves, and particularly the Midrash, you don't find that our /actually religious ancestors/ believed in philosophical cosmic clockmakers for their God.

[[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp-gameloft/images/f/fc/Princess_Luna_vector.png][No, they believed in the /scientifically beyond-ridiculous/ but /otherwise totally obvious and natural/ reading of the prayer, in which God literally moves bits of the world around to show the passage of time and set the natural order.]] They also believed in guardian angels that walk you home from your religious services on Friday evenings, and in demons who brought bad luck but could be warded off by spitting.

They also believed that a prophet, having been /literally/ immortalized (that is: given immortality) by God, would visit every single household of their coreligionists during the same evening of an annual holiday, /Santa Claus-style/, and that we should accordingly /leave him a cup of wine to refresh himself./ Hell, when I was younger, I actually saw someone walk off our lawn, get in a white sedan (small), and drive away, and figured, ha, /that must be the Prophet Eliyahu!/ Lo and behold, the cup of wine we'd left out had been drunk!

(I wasn't /that/ young, and my brain /did/ nag about alternative explanations, but hey, I had an informed prior weighting my thinking in the wrong direction.)

[[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/jms/jms13.htm][During the same holiday]], we spill drops of wine, which is a curious example of how religion has been perverted these days. See, my ancient ancestors would have admitted the simple truth: they spilled wine because they were talking about plagues, and spilling liquid onto the ground (as by spitting or spilling) /wards off the demons and evil spirits drawn by the open mention of disaster/. Nowadays our so-called "sages" say it's because we have ever so much compassion for the enemy nation who God gladly slaughtered for our sake in the story of the holiday!

Look at that! Look at how a careful, humane, philosophical explanation was invented for a religious practice, /to cover up how it was originally an outright superstition/ based in /such/ a /flagrantly/ non-naturalistic world-view that nowadays we might laugh you out of the room for proposing to write a /work of fantasy/ in which the world actually did happen that way!

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][This was because the old, ancient religion /actually made claims about the world/, in everyday terms that any common person today would be able to check on Wiki-fucking-pedia.]]

So no. There are /loads and loads and fucking heaps/ of falsified predictions made by /honest/ religion. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jy/avoiding_your_beliefs_real_weak_points/][There are just /also/ loads and loads of goddamned apologists who are always ready to /water their own religion down/ in a desperate effort to keep believing in it instead of saying, "Well, it was kinda nice in a funny way, but that's just not how the world works."]]
