With vigorous, forceful, precisely controlled breathing, breath "energy", also called chi/ki, can be generated. This can be used for a variety of effects. (This is basically Ripple from JoJo's bizarre adventure.) Learning time varies, some people have a natural aptitude (generally correlated with good physical condition/aptitude, good lung capacity, and various biometeric ratios). Having someone that has completely mastered breath energy guide your training can speed it up by a factor of close to two with continuous mentoring. Alternatively, less skilled mentors or only occasional guidance from a master might speed up learning by around a factor of only 1.5. A breathing apparatus designed to force your breathing and other helpful equipment might also speed your learning by a factor of 1.5.

At base level of practice (around 1 year with preexisting martial arts training or high aptitude, or 2 years otherwise) * minor physical enhancement, mostly in conjunction with precise martial arts moves and techniques * minor self healing * very limited manipulation of material under favorable conditions (organic material, wet material, with extended direct contact) * Minor improvement of natural healing in others

At mid level (4-6 years with moderate aptitude and continous training, 1-2 years with extreme aptitude and/or esoteric training) * Healing of others via laying on of hands (primarily just regeneration of tissue) * Major self healing * Manipulation of natural elements in direct contact with your body * Heating/retaining heat in cold environments * Sensing breath usage in other at short range (within arms length)

At high level (1-3 decades of training, it varies heavily with aptitude, although individual advanced techniques can be learned faster) * Precise manipulation of water, wood, other natural elements * Fire breath (uses the bodies heat and calories in a way that can be dangerous/exhausting) * Cooling off in hot environments * Temporary immunity to fire * Temporary increase in durability (up to small arms fire) * Extremely brief invulnerability * Sensing breath use in other from long range (tens of meters) * Healing of more complex conditions than just regeneration of tissue (i.e. some types of cancer, bacterial infections, congenital conditions) * Rapid self regeneration * Complete restoration of lost limbs * Life extension (to around a few centuries at maximum)

So munchkin ideas?

- What sort of usage in the modern world might this ability have? Usage in pre-industrial times?

- Most valuable high level technique?

- Any valuable applications besides just fighting/healing?

- Best way of economically exploiting healing/fighting abilities?

- What sort of institution would best support learning these abilities? (A program to search for kids with the aptitude? Sponsorship from a rich hospital? Military grants?)
