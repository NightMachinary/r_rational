  First of all, I'm assuming that the precise breath control needed was only learned recently in evolutionary timescales, so there's no animals that use this.

I didn't even think about animals evolving the ability, although it is pretty obvious once you point it out. If I was world building from scratch, I would say that the mindfulness and willpower required to actively control it is rare in animals. So maybe a few smarter species might have a few limited tricks using breath? Maybe a few species of dragons with breath explaining their esoteric abilities.

At least the sect leaders and teachers won't destroy the world with global warming.

  To give just one example, in a world where primary education includes a couple of years' worth of training, the minor healing would be effectively worthless, qualifying you for the equivalent of a barista job healing fatigue from officeworkers.

I didn't think of that, you are right, the minor healing would not be economically valuable if everyone learned it. But it would be a boost to the health for everyone that learned it, so any modern industrialized country that puts int the effort for public education and healthcare would also try to develop a system for teaching minor breath ability during primary education.

  the rich can afford to add breath training to their routine, and so live longer, while the poor are stuck with baseline lifespans

Well that's dark. I guess economics and class structure can make anything depressing. The extent to which aptitude matters might disrupt this slightly, with poor people born with high-aptitude managing to jump ahead in life, but this just means someone would try developing a eugenics program to breed aptitude, which is even more depressing.
