First of all, I'm assuming that the precise breath control needed was only learned recently in evolutionary timescales, so there's no animals that use this.

In a preindustrial setting this would lend itself to a low-power xianxia structure: between the healing and longevity, each master would likely acquire wealth and a network of influence along with apprentices vying for training.

They might form isolated sects, and the effects of high altitude on lung capacity would be a great original explanation for the mountaintop monastery trope, especially in conjunction with the resistance to cold. They could equally slot into existing political structures.

One important cultural effect is that reaching the mastery stage and attaining the lifespan extension is a significant investment of time. This would select for masters who are highly motivated and good at long-term thinking and planning. Because their powers would also help them find themselves in positions of power, one scenario could be a world where most nations are ruled by masters, who have long time horizons and so avoid conquest in favour of long-term growth. This could mean an industrial revolution spreads quickly as they all seize on its potential, or alternatively a master tries to keep it under wraps and contained to their own territory until they have a strong enough advantage.

I don't really know enough to comment on the utility of individual abilities, and their economic applications would have a lot of dependencies. To give just one example, in a world where primary education includes a couple of years' worth of training, the minor healing would be effectively worthless, qualifying you for the equivalent of a barista job healing fatigue from officeworkers. In a society of mostly subsistence farmers, where very few can manage the investment, even that small level of ability could be very valuable, for example helping people work more efficiently at harvest time by recovering from fatigue faster.

If the healing can be adapted into more general biology control, that would be significant. Otherwise the main unexpected use I can think of would be to improve returns on strength training by healing the muscles.

In terms of supporting institutions, I think aptitude would take second place to mindset: living for centuries means the masters will be detached from broader society, and so they would likely prefer apprentices who are receptive to their norms. In such a case, a couple more decades to indoctrinate them might be preferable to a prodigy who could become independent much faster.

Lastly, inevitably someone will leak a full set of manuals which allow anyone to train themselves up to mastery. I think this could be a good opportunity for a story about time horizons and how they're affected by socioeconomic pressures - the rich can afford to add breath training to their routine, and so live longer, while the poor are stuck with baseline lifespans because their 9-5 gives no time for it and the scarcity they're accustomed to detracts from making long-term investments.
