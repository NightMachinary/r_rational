I think a society would move toward mastery being standard as from how it's described even at the slower side of average the amount of time and resources invested in mastery is less relative to the gains than low level training, I assume there would come a point of diminishing returns eventually though. I imagine a society of elf like peoples with fourty years or so of preparatory "childhood"(I'd hope they don't develop the sort of culture that we have around childhood) education with an expected lifespan of a couple centuries beyond that, it seems like you've implied there'd be some intellectual growth as well which would have it's own implications. You mentioned that it could be divided by 2 with masters teaching and a further 1.5 with good equipment for just 10 years to mastery for even the untalented but I expect it'd still inflate to fourty years or so because the more time one has the more time can be best spent increasing what one can get out of the rest. With generational turnover slower the civilization would move more slowly and methodically. Technology would mostly focus on chi constructs before physical objects, the fact that most "tools" would be mostly non transferable might have interesting social implications. There'd be far more time for leisure and since everyone effectively is heavy landscaping equipment what an individual can get done if they set their mind to it would be immense, regular people IRL have done things like cut through mountains, build castles and carve huge statues given a lifetime and dedication and dedication would be a trait highly encouraged by such a culture. Decadance could be a problem but I doubt it since a great deal of persistence would be needed just to be an average citizen. I expect most of what work there would be would be working to fix the doings of idle hands. Yes I think civilization in such a world would end up incredibly similar to our general idea of elves.
