What can I do to minimize subjectively negative experiences?

This question is implying several things by not having bounds. It should encompass all sentient life and all of time and space, and doesn't give my any information that I'm unable to utilize. If there's a way past the 3 minutes, the answer will encompass that.

It's possible that this will prioritize non-human life, but there are workarounds for that, if I feel that it's necessary.
