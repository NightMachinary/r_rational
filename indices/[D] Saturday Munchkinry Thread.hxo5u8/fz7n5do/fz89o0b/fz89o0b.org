First ask if there is any feasible way at all to extend the 3 minutes, whether its lifespan prolonging medicine or time dilation or cryogenics or mind uploading or even time leaping. If this succeeds, you are done.

Otherwise, ask what actions you can take within the remaining time to cause butterfly effects that ensure the survival, freedom, and moral goodness of humanity for as long as possible. Omniscience should perfectly predict the vastly different results of every possible action you could take in those 3 minutes. So the amount of 'success' that you can give via butterfly effects should far far far exceed any type or amount of info you leave behind via other methods.
