  PS2: pls avoid obvious trick 'asking question what is the best question'
#+end_quote

In that case, let's go with the next obvious trick, basically "what is the best answer": "what action or sequence of actions can I take before my death that will maximally increase the sum utility of all moral agents[^1] according to my coherent extrapolated volition?"

It may be debatable whether "you will be only able to phrase the answers in a language you know" precludes being able to phrase the answers nonverbally (i.e. by actually executing an action, if it is not a solely verbal action), but from context it sounds more like "you aren't granted knowledge of all languages in the bargain", not "you are arbitrarily restricted to your own spoken language". But if you can "phrase" the answers by doing them, then whether the correct answer involves the transmission of knowledge or not, you can just do whatever is necessary. And by phrasing it as "before my death", if it is possible to save yourself, it is very likely you will do so (you will unless doing so somehow turns out worse for the world).

On the minus side, depending on how the gift works and whether or not it's possible to save yourself, you may be flooded with the knowledge of an unbounded personal future and the certainty that deviating from it is the wrong thing to do, binding your free will for as long as you can remain moral. (Although maybe the answer will be something like "follow The Plan for 10^100 years, and then erase your knowledge of the specifics of this answer, because then it and you will be the last remnants of suboptimal utility to be optimized".)

[^1]: Replace with something other than total utilitarianism, if you wish.
