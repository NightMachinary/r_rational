let's break game rules again.

Omniscience.

You will gain ' omniscience ', defined as ability to answer any possible question (but you still retain your language, your thinking speed, and you will be only able to phrase the answers in language you know), but.... you will die in next 3 minutes.

So basically, you have 3 minutes to gain as much answers you want (by asking yourself questions in your toughts) and write answers out somehow.

What do you do? Are you getting answers to ensure your family well being? Are you getting answers for humanity? What kind of questions you ask? Do you care at all, assuming that you have 3 minutse of live left? How do you store out the answers? Writing? Drawing?

PS: also consider that the remaining people might won't trust what you write, so maybe you should focus on smaller questions that are more easily verifiable

PS2: pls avoid obvious trick 'asking question what is the best question'
