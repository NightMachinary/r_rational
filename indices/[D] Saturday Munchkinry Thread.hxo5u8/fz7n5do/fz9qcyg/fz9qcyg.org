Wow! You can now create arbitrary material objects!

To do so, you must provide a certain level of specificity. Don't worry, you don't need to know where every atom goes, but the power borrows your intelligence, so that degree is "could you construct this yourself with a box of unlimited resources?"

To put it another way, the power can't generate any sourceless knowledge, it just extrapolates the way you would build something and then skips to the part where it's done.

The whole of your creations must be within 100 meters of your person, take one second to appear, and will only displace air or water of sufficient purity when appearing.

You have a daily mass limit of 100kg, objects coming out partially complete if their creation would exceed the limit. Matter that does not exist in your universe (for the whole of the second it takes to create) comes up empty.

No other limitations. No other supernatural powers exist, and you win the simulation when a minimum of five billion humans vote for you in an election for Supreme Dictator of Earth.
