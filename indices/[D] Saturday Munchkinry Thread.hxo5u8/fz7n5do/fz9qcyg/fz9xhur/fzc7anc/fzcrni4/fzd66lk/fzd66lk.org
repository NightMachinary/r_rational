For the box: counterfactual you can pull cubes of atomic elements from it of any desired size and density. They start with their hands, but can make tools, use those to make better tools, and so on. They don't get bored and don't come up with original ideas, no matters how long it takes. Their utility function is "create any specified object to the best of your ability, then mark it as done." If they don't know how to proceed, you'll receive the incomplete product.

The things you make appear without unusual momentum, if that's what you're asking. That is, you can make a block of steel in midair which will then fall normally, but not a block of steel flying into orbit at immense velocity.

The voting is judged by an outside impartial layman tracking informed consent (they have to have an idea of who you are and that they're voting for you when they do.) You can work under a pseudonym, it can be a figurehead position, for AV only first choices are hits. Other humans are unlikely to be so kind as to host the election for you, so you'll have to do it yourself.

You can't prohibit anyone over ten from running against you, all votes have to be registered within a one year period, and five billion have to press a button on their phones (or mail-in, in-person, etc.) saying they accept you as dictator and consent to your rule.
