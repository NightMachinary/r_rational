Pre modern:

The masters play themselves up as gods or demigods of old, and look down on the untrained. The secrets of breath would be closely guarded to prevent anyone else from gaining an edge on them and in some cases new or exotic ways of utilizing breath might die with the creator.

Masters would wage war against each other and eventually only the most cunningly brutal or brutally cunning would be left to rule. Making petty wars like Naruto ninja.

Modern:

If the ability to utilize breath suddenly appeared in modern times I could see the first manuals popping up on the internet. And videos on YouTube showing that the manuals do indeed work. Militaries starting a new race of breath supremacy. Though that brings up the question of what happens when vets come out of the military. People who may or may not have problems and enhanced human capabilities mingling with a civilian population.

• I think the most valuable high level technique would be life extension. Sure it looks like it's a passive to having trained for decades but I could see it being enhanced with a technique that's made to increase life. Like some form of biofeedback that fixes damaged DNA.

• Useful things might include weather manipulation if enough masters work in concert, growing crops, building infrastructure, perhaps FTL travel if natural elements includes space-time.

• Orphanages, no parents, some show up in the system real young, and a few might not have lots of prospects in life (I have no idea what orphanages are like in real life, forgive me). I see it basically as the Jedi from Star Wars. Funding could come from alumni doing public works, or government contracts to lend out some members. Idk. Maybe what amounts to ninja states in Naruto but with breath users.
