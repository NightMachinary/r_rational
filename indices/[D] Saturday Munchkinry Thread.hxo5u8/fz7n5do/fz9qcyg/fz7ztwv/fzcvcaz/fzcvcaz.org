Power : You have limited logical omniscience. This means that when looking at a group of axioms/theorems, you are able to immediately see all resulting theorems a distance of 3 logical inferences away, and have those inferences in your working memory until you take a long rest (dnd rules: >8 hr), and can only be used once a day (as determined by the moment you wake up after a long rest).

Goal: maximizing power/wealth/doing the most good/just improving your own life. Whichever you chose.
