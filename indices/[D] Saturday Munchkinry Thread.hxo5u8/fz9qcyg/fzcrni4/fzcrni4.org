When you say the box can make what I could construct, what methods could I use? How do tools play into this? Am I only able to make things I could build with unlimited materials and my bare hands? What shape/shapes are the unlimited materials in - do I get lego bricks, or have to carve out shapes from a huge sea with my hands?

You also say there's a mass limit, but is there a separate energy limit?

As to the victory conditions - what counts as a vote for "me"? Can I work under a pseudonym? Can the position be a figurehead position, with absolute power but an understanding I'd never use it? Who sets up the election - can I make all non voters vote for me by default by running the election myself? Can I very reasonably suggest AV for the vote, so everyone votes for me to some extent (though likely not as first choice)?
