seems easy, you can convince people that you are a deity and all's done.

Or second approach, you can just use your power to create wealth...

daily limit of 100kg. What is the most expensive substance?

Or just screw it, let's go with gold. From what I can Google now, *61105.71* $ that's the price per 1kg of gold. So you get.... 6 110 500$ daily. Omg, even assuming that, it would take few years only to become the richest person in the world.
