Do your creations persist after your death?

If so, the simplest method might be to construct a doomsday device with a dead man switch and threaten to trigger it if you aren't elected supreme dictator of earth.

Said doomsday device could be a big lump of antimatter, electromagnetically separated from normal matter so it doesn't explode until you turn off the current. It would also be fairly simple to set up the circuit so your death shuts it off.

Your rule will not be safe, as your doomsday device is most likely unstable and will soon explode. But hey, all you wanted was to win the election, not govern afterwards!
