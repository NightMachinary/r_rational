I watched The Old Guard on Netflix last week. Pretty good movie, Charlize Theron is a total badass and the action sequences weren't as monotonous as I find most to be.

For those who don't know, the movie is about a group of four immortals who for some reason have decided that their best method of helping humanity is by engaging in violent conflict rather than, say, building up enormous fortunes or bodies of scientific knowledge. OK, fair enough, they do all seem to have been soldiers to begin with so maybe that's why they were given their powers in the first place. The movie explores some of the psychological aspects of eternal youth, but didn't really dig into its potential like I know this sub can. Some of the stuff below is not addressed at all in the movie; I made it up based on what feels right.

Spoilers ahead.

You are an *Old Guard*.

- You do not age, and your body maintains the physical condition it was in immediately before your first death.

- You have a rapid healing factor, able to regenerate from a gunshot in a matter of seconds, a shattered limb in a few minutes, and more serious injuries such as bisection or full-body pulverization in a few hours. Any injuries you sustained before dying for the first time would have healed at the normal rate, but upon dying your body is healed up to perfect condition. This also functions as infinite endurance, since your body will constantly heal damage to your joints/muscles etc.

- Your durability and pain tolerance are unenhanced, but as you age and accumulate experience you are able to push yourself farther and deal with higher degrees of pain.

- While separated from any other Old Guards, you have dreams showing flashes of their location and surroundings.

So--assuming you don't take the same path as the folks in the movie & hire yourself out for bloody warfare to whoever you think has the most just cause, what do you do? Priority one is going to be escaping detection & capture, as you have no enhanced ability to escape and eternal imprisonment is a very real threat. How do you make sure that won't happen to you, and what do you do once you're safe?
