The best way to avoid the depressing outcomes, I think, would be for the mid-tier manipulation of natural elements to be sufficiently versatile and valuable to guarantee employment, even if everyone else has it too, because of the diversity of possible skills it unlocks.

Here's a potential route for a more equal society:

- Subsistence farmers everywhere

- Each village ends up with someone trained to low-mid level, because everyone sees the benefit of paying in for someone who can heal their farm accidents

- This reduces child mortality, gradually lowering family sizes

- A mid-tier practitioner works out how to use the natural manipulation to restore the fertility of soil by shuffling the nutrients around, which boosts yields significantly

- Suddenly everyone wants their village practitioners to have this skill, and so the technique spreads quickly

- The bump in productivity happens too fast for the population to catch up and reduce things down to subsistence level. Instead, the villagers have spare time they don't need to spend working the fields to grow enough to survive, and they've all just seen how valuable practitioner training can be, so large numbers start learning from their village practitioner up to the middle level.

- Because the supply of people with mid-level skills has jumped dramatically and exceeds the demand for field fertilisation, they start to experiment with their new abilities, discovering other profitable applications in streamlining existing jobs like carpentry or leatherworking, and opening up new possibilities which were not possible without the natural manipulation

- The surplus of mid-level practitioners flock to the market towns to ply their trade, quickly becoming a middle class in economic terms

- The boom in healthcare means the economic boom isn't accompanied by one in population, maybe mid-tier training can also be used for contraception too?

- Now people everywhere have seen the benefits of this and can justify supporting a child or grandparent through the training, while those at the mid level start wondering what kinds of possibilities the highest level opens up

- The established elders are surprised by how quickly the world has transformed and they've found themselves outnumbered by new amateur high-tiers who've trained themselves up outside their existing power structures
