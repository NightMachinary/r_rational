  PS2: pls avoid obvious trick 'asking question what is the best question'

By that, do you mean that all recursive questions and meta questions will fail? Meta-questions and questions that utilize recursion are your best bet for packing in as much information as possible and getting useful bits of information.

Baring those sorts of questions. I think my next best bet is to ask for AI-related algorithms and example code. A few core algorithms should be the sort of thing you can write out in 3 minutes. I am not sure if any useful example code could be written in 3 minutes. So for best algorithms to ask for (because by your meta restriction I can't just ask for best algorithm I can write in under 3 minutes)... off the top of my head... maybe a modification to reinforcement learning that allows it to generalize over multiple scales? (Reenforcement learning has a scale imposed by how you define states for instance the next move on a game board and is thus limited (requiring either looking an excessive number of states ahead or truncating how many states ahead you look) in the real world where you don't have access to a true and accurate model with which to compare to and you have multiple scales you need to consider simultaneously: for instance your actions in the next second simultaneously with your actions over the next minute/hour/day.)
