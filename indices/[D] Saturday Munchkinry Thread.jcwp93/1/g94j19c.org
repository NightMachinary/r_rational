Chaos Magic Powers. Inspired by Discord from MLP. You can make almost “anything” happen but it always takes a chaotic twist, with bizarre side effects and misdirected primary effects. The more precisely you try to control your primary intended effect the more chaotic the side effects. Trying to undo the side effects tends to creates even more chaotic side effects, although with luck, practice, and skill you can occasionally get side effects to cancel out. If you deliberately make the primary effect chaotic, you can make the side effects more manageable. If you avoid repeating yourself this also make the side effects more manageable.

For instance healing a missing arm:

- if you try to directly replace the missing arm exactly how it was before it might dramatically mutate the person's body elsewhere for instance turning a leg into a monkey leg.

- if you just try to “replace” missing limb, it might give the person a lobster arm or monkey arm or tentacle.

- if you try to regrow the arm, it might trigger weird growths all over the person body

- if you are intentionally chaotic and try to grow/replace their arm with a monkey arm they might only grow monkey hair or have another limb made monkey like as side effects.

- if you tried to heal multiple people in a row, your power would get more unruly and chaotic with each healing

- on the other hand, if you only healed once every now and then with no particular pattern you might find the side effects easier to control.

Creating persistent magical effects tends to result in persistent magical effects that oppose or subvert the intended effect. For instance replacing an arm with a magically empowered monkey arm might summon into existence a magical monkey that steal people's arms.
