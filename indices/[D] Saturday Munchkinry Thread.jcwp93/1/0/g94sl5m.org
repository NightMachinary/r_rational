I don't really remember Chaos's magic working like that, but I only saw the first few seasons.

Within the constraints you provided, I guess my best bet would be to create an incredibly powerful being, Intelligence, or force whose utility function closely aligns with mine who's power isn't constrained by chaos. After a few months, do it again. Then again, etcetera. Hopefully, the extremely open- ended nature of the request and saying closely aligns instead of matches will give fairly minor or just random side effects and not create a more powerful oppositely-aligned being.

After some low- stakes experimenting with the power, I may be able to create things like: An incredibly powerful bean whose utility function closely aligns with mine; An incredibly powerful utility company that closely works with me and isn't constrained by chaos; Etc.
