It's always easier to destroy something than to build something. And there are /so many/ ways to destroy things... I could turn in into pudding, have it dismantled by bees, take a giant eraser and simply rub it out...

So /destroying/ things should be simple and straightforward. I could destroy a large swathe of seaborne plastic by turning it into fish; I could erase the hole in the ozone layer; I could turn nuclear bombs into cake. (I might even be able to restore someone's arm by erasing the injury that took it off in the first place...)

/Creating/ things can be a lot harder. But even there, there are options... I could try to pull fictional objects (or characters) out of books or stories. I could create new forms of life where I specify only one or two characteristics (like /smart/ and /empathetic/) and let the rest all be random. The important thing is never to try to create the same thing twice, or in quick succession. And I'd need to create random, minor props on a very frequent basis, so as not to build up too much of a chaotic charge...
