I have a (slowly expanding) hivemind.

With care, I can have members of my hivemind start taking on different studies, developing different expertises. (The education, accommodation and food costs will be the major limit on how fast I can expand my hivemind). This will lead to me quickly developing mentally-accessible experts in a variety of fields. Being able to put together techniques from disparate disciplines will help me to develop new... well, new just about anything. (If I knew what I could specifically develop, then I'd just develop it without bothering with the hivemind).

Moreover, having clones who live in different places and never physically meet will help to ensure that no pandemic can easily stop me. (My main body, being the only one capable of generating new clones, will stay out of contact with everyone; one of the clones will deliver any necessary sanitised food supplies).

My clones can take on skilled employment in various fields once their educations are complete (there will be some confusion regarding things like identity documents, but a half-dozen clones all turning up at once and claiming to be different people should resolve that) and thus become self-sustaining...
