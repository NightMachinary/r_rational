Once a day your body can clone itself through magical means. Only your own body can do it, your clones cannot clone themselves. Each cloned body has the same nutritional requirements as your own body, which can change depending on what diet plan and activity your clone body follows. All clones start off looking identical to you and having identical DNA. However, that can also change depending on diet, exercise, and injuries. Basically, your clones are real biological human bodies. The mass for them comes through magical means.

Each clone is in a mental link with every other clone, and there is mutual trust between you and your clones. You cannot share everything through this mental links, but you can share thoughts, images, and videos (or whatever the mental equivalent is, memories?). The sharing is instantaneous, but it can take time to parse the information into useful understanding.
