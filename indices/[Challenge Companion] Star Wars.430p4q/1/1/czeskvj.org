I like midichlorians on a literal level, but I dislike the thematic implications - particularly the idea that force sensitivity is a strictly hereditary trait. I really hope the sequel makes clear that force->midichlorians rather than midichlorians->force. Midichlorians don't even need to come up by name to do this (since the fandom hates them so much). All that needs to happen is a clear distinction between force usage and heredity. Rey not fucking being Luke's daughter ought to go a long way towards it.
