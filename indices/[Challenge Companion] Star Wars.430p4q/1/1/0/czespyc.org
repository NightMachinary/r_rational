One of my hopes as well. Though isn't force sensitivity kind of implied to be hereditary from the original movies? Even if it can still surface in random people by skipping a bunch of generations, the odds of both of Anakin Skywalker's children being force sensitive in a world where genetics isn't a factor seems fairly improbable, since force sensitivity is apparently such a massively rare thing.
