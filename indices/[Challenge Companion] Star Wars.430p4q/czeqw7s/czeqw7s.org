Not a story, but I absolutely love [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/208580/][Knights of the Old Republic 2]], a game released by Obsidian over a decade ago. I wrote a little bit about why this game is so unique [[https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/40w79x/recommendation_request_what_are_star_wars_stories/][here]]. Besides the usual quests that must be fulfilled, much of the game consists of conversations that advance the plot. To get a flavor of it, you can take a peek at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5w9LBcYu5g][this video]], which describes a conversation you can have (if you make a number of dark-side choices throughout the game) about a captured wookie companion.
