Although the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones are fun, high-budget movies set in traditional serial settings, I'd hesitate to call either a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction]["reconstruction"]] (tvtropes warning). Both play their silly tropes completely straight, and neither puts effort into justifying them.

Star Wars had the special effects budget to make Star Destroyers and space dogfights /look/ believable, but gravity and life support and faster-than-light travel (along with artificial intelligence, space swords and sorcery, and single-biome planets) all serve at the behest of the plot and the visuals rather than the other way around. There's no science in this fiction.

A perfect example of the appearance of believability is the aliens. They speak (and indeed some are only /capable/ of speaking) their own languages, and other characters do or do not understand those languages. Sometimes we get subtitles. At the same time all but a few breathe the same atmosphere, have the same gravitational needs, and look like humans in (sometimes elaborate) makeup and costumes. All of the major characters except Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Yoda are essentially english-speaking humans. Even C-3PO.

The extended universe has made some awkward attempts at reconstructing all of this stuff into a logical and consistent whole, but the films themselves do not. It's a genre grab bag.

I think the confusion comes from the fact that where Indiana Jones revels gleefully in its genre source material's absurdities, Star Wars tends to take itself pretty seriously... and that may be Spielberg's influence, and it may be Harrison Ford's (His is certainly the only character in Star Wars whose genre saavy strays anywhere near the fourth wall.) Everything looks realistic enough, and the characters behave realistically enough, that there's not a lot of room to pull back and see how ridiculous the fundamental conceits are.

At any rate: Where deconstruction says "no", reconstruction says how. And I would be thrilled to see a Star Wars-type universe reconstructed. I'd love to figure out how a bunch of genuinely alien intelligent beings function together politically, or how interstellar travel and access to other planets affects those politics, or how a government that spans not merely languages and cultures but /worlds/ arranges its justice system...

...and how all of this somehow involves psychic wizards.

Star Wars certainly isn't answering those questions on its own.
