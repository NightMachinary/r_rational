Midichlorians get a bad rap among most of the fanbase, and I'm curious to know what [[/r/rational]] readers' perspective on it is. Do you think it grounds Star Wars into being ever-so-slightly more realistic/rational, or is it just a stupid idea that clashes with the rest of the story's thematic feel?

(Note: Though they first showed up in the prequels, Lucas had originally thought them up as far back as 1977, and referenced them by name when laying out the guidelines for the Expanded Universe books. I've often wondered if they would be hated so much if they were part of the original trilogy, or if it's mostly just incidental hate due to the general awfulness of the prequels).
