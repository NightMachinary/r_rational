Sure, but I guess I see force sensitivity, ideally, as roughly equivalent to "importance". Not in the literal sense that all important people are force sensitive and vice versa. But in the sense that, though the children of someone important are more likely to be important, it wouldn't even be an accurate model to view "importance" as a multifactorial trait - it's more than that, not just a combination of genes and environment, but a combination of genes, environment, and /incorporeal personal woo willpower/, in that order from least to most important.

I actually have one pet idea kinda batting around the corner of my head that force sensitivity isn't passed on genetically at all, but rather through emotions - children don't receive force sensitivity from their parents because of genetic reasons, but because their parents feel very strongly about them.
