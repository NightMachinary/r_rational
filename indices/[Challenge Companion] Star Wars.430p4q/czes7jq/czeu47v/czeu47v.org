I was going to criticize the implementation of midichlorian counts on the basis that Anakin does not seem powerful enough. The fact that he lost the fight with Obi Wan suggests that Anakin's spectacularly high midichlorian count is actually kind of useless. I was surprised to find that the math kind of supports Lucas' portrayal.

It looks like there are about 1,000 systems represented in the Republic senate (rough estimate based on the number of 'seats'), and based on Naboo, Coruscant, Tatooine, etc. we can estimate that the average population of those systems is probably around 5 billion people. There are maybe 500 Jedi alive during the time of the prequels, making them about one in 10 billion.

If midichlorian count follows a bell curve, then we can expect that a typical Jedi would be about 12.5 standard deviations from the mean, in order to end up with about 500 Jedi in a republic with a population of about 5 trillion. If the Jedi council has been around for about 1,000 years, and if Jedi live an average of 100 years, and if the republic has been approximately at an equilibrium population level over the last 1,000 years, then we're looking at maybe 5,000 Jedi having existed. And Anakin has a significantly higher midichlorian count than all of them. This places his midichlorian count at somewhere around the top 1 in 500 trillion, meaning his midichlorian count would be at least 14 standard deviations from the mean.

This suggests that while Anakin would have an advantage over other Jedi, it would not necessarily be a huge advantage. His midichlorian count would only need to be about 12% farther from the mean than a typical Jedi, so it seems reasonable that Obi Wan could have still defeated him on Mustafar through advantages in training and experience.
