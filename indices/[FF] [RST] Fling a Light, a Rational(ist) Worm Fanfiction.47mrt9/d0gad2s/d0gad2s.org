I liked it. Especially the commentary on homo sapiens. I look forward to Tesseract's rapid rise. Not sure if I fully understand her powers. Do the portals exist forever after she creates them? Is effort on her part needed to maintain them or to destroy them? If equipped with a space suit can she portal to M31 in Andromeda for instance? Is travel through portal instantaneous or light speed limited?
