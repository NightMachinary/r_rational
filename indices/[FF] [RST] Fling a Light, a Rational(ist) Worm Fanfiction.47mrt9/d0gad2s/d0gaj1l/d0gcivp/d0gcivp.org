Thanks. Tesseract reminds me of the kind of person I wish I had been in my teens if only I had learned to ask the right questions. But despite all the books I read, I never quite managed to progress from sapiens to sapiens sapiens in modes of thought. Hit a cord there. Speaking of portals, one thing that bothered me about the video game Portal is the apparent violation of conservation of energy, such as if falling through a portal on the floor can transport you to a portal at a higher elevation where is the potential energy coming from. I am not saying that Tesseract's portals should or should not work that way, but it seemed overpowered in the sense that a portal powered super villain could evacuate all of Earth's atmosphere into space if energy conservation wasn't imposed...
