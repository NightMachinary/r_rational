This sure was needed after not one but two heavy emotional arcs (I find it hard to believe that the story before viridian forrest was about the gang just goofing around on their way to pewter). I kinda wish it went on for a little longer tbh. Just a whole chapter dedicated to red spending time with his new pokemon and to have Mia, Scyther, and Growlithe get acquainted with the group.

I find it hilarious that red just wakes up to being rich without ever realizing how close he was to getting buried in a legal nightmare by the guy that paid him. Also, woohoo, assbutt be coming back!

Its also a funny coincidence that this story and origin of species have a concurrent story thread about a soon to be revealed mystery pokemon. I keep thinking that porygon is gonna make an appearance here, even though that makes no sense.

Loving the story, see you all next time. Stay safe!
