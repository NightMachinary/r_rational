Thanks for your review!\\
We initially planned to have the gym this chapter, but in the end we just kind of wanted to let Red relax. A break from the last two acts, which were quite intense. So we focussed on character interactions and some lore. Some never made it into the chapter (for example at first Mawile robbing the shopkeeper of pokepuffs and then getting irritated when he kept following her and subsequently trying to make him leave by paying him with one of his own ---was a scene in itself. But ultimately, while Scyther's thought process was a little heavy and things did happen, this chapter was about Mawile doing Mawile things, Shellder doing Shellder things and Growlithe doing what he always does (Fall in love with someone who is really not good for him)
