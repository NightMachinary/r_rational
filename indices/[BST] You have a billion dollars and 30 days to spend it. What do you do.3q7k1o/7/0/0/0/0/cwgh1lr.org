  If so, that's something you could probably do now, even without a billion dollars.

I'm unemployed, receive SSI, and have a boat load of college debt. And can't drive. This gets in the way of lots of things, including the personal trainer option (and the Modafinil option, for that matter). While I don't think a billion dollars would get me a self-driving car and an insurance policy and a way around the legal tape, it'd expand my options from "sit around and whine about it" to "just about everything available to normal people and then some".
