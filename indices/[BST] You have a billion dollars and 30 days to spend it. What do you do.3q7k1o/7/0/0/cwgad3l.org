I have no idea, but with that much money on the line, I can probably find someone who does within 30 days. Not to say that they could succeed within 30 days--I want something permanent, so long as the upkeep is something I can become capable of within the 30 days--but whatever's out there would have to actively avoid me if I have a billion dollars an no reason to hold on to it.

Mostly, it'd allow me to try things that are currently absurdly difficult or impossible, where cash balances out my lack of conscientiousness/charisma. (And by charisma, I suppose I mean courage+communication skills?)
