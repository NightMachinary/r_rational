Assuming I cannot arrange to move the money in a circle back to me and must abide by the /spirit/ of that:

I would spend weeks researching, brainstorming and outsourcing research into what causes would most appeal to myself. This is where it gets hard, because I don't exactly know where a billion would do the most good. Feeding Africa? No. Curing diseases? No. Give it all to MIRI? ...No. Probably. I'll do the research honestly, but I don't know programming, and I have no way of evaluating the expected return on giving a billion dollars to MIRI. I'm obviously not going to give a billion to the political party I'm active in, because they are so far from optimized it makes me sad. If I can set my family up with no debt and a few tens of thousands in travelling around the world, I'll do that, because that's pocket change and allows me to focus on Noble Stuff. Cryonics? Well, I have high hopes, but even assuming I can turn up on my favourite living people's doorstep and convince them to let me pay to have them frozen when they die, that's extremely expensive time wise, and I think when Cryonics finally pays off, if ever, having a few dozen people like Noam Chomsky revive will not be enough to make a very great political impact. I'm leaning toward anticipating a techno volatile future. I also cannot use my billion to assassinate 'bad guys', because I have no idea at all where to find reliable assassins, and looking for them would only risk getting me into a situation where I cannot spend the money. I'm not American, so I cannot easily spend money on bribing US politicians, although I will of course research this. I similarly cannot use the billion to buy Sanders the presidentship.

So the answer is, I would not spend much money until I had done research. I would buy an absolutely fabulous laptop, and I would lock myself in my room and spend most of the time on the Internet. What I would do at the end of the month I do not know.
