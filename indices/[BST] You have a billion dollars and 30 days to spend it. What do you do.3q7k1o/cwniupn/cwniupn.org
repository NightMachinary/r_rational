I send it to the SENS foundation with a note: "Dibs."

The sooner we fix the problem of mortality, the better. I think most of the problems we face as a species are budgeting failures because " we can't take it with us" and "it'll be someone else's problem once we're dead."

Also, I'm going to go super edgy atheist here, but I think the belief in a just afterlife has been used to justify/excuse all sorts of suffering here on earth. Arbitrary life extension should go a long way to helping us abandon that crutch.
