It seems like private enterprises are already solving the space race problem, so I would split in four parts:

- 10m to MIRI.
- 100m to SENS.
- 290m to GiveWell's top choice.
- 600m to XPrize to fund a bunch of prizes. Some governance is necessary to ensure the prizes don't become bad incentives (i.e. promote values misaligned with humanity's).
