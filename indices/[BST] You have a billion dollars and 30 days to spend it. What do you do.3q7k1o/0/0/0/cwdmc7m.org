Because if there is a rule that you must 'spend' the money (magically or legally), you buy a legally separate piece of property, then transfer that property back into fungible cash for as small a penalty as possible. Your original contract is now complete -you spent a billion dollars within a month. You have a completely separate billion dollars free and clear now, with no requirement to make poor, rushed decisions as to the spending.

This works, because if it didn't, you couldn't buy anything with any resale value with the money, as all of them could still be flipped again for money after the time limit. If they magic/law doesn't like stock, buy gold/platinum/assorted other commodities. Just make it a large enough market that a billion sudden influx doesn't crash it.

... Can you tell I work in law?
