Well, that's a number of huge changes to the original scenario, but in that case, you do the same thing, only you immediately transfer the stocks to the care of a Trust Fund or similar legal body of which you are the director. In Case 1 (Ratio for Donation), you pay yourself the divided required to meet that standard, and organize it so other people also get similar value through work generated by the corporation.

Or, I mean, depending on how the rule specifies $100, you could give yourself $100 US and 10 million others $100 in Zombabewean dollars (Approx 0.0000001 cents US).

If you can use it to buy property that you can't own, again, the Trust owns the property, and you merely rent or use it at the trust's request (you also being director of the trust). This is actually what English nobles did in the 1500's to get out of paying land taxes, which required Henry VIII to create a law called the Statue of Uses to counter (interestingly, still law in some Commonwealth jurisdictions).

If you have to donate to the company, create two companies, one of which you do not control, one of which you do. Depending on the legal language of the rule itself, you either own all stock in Company B, which owns all stock in Company A, or you own B, and A is independent, but has in it's constating documents a clause which indicates a required payment to Company B or a trust fund set up on behalf of Company B on a regular bases. Said clause could not be removed without dissolving the company, in which case under most legal systems, you are allowed to recover money you invested in the Company at its inception.

Add in as many needed C-ZZ shell companies in between these two points to satisfy the requirements of the rule.

Any mechanical (legal) system can be gotten around in this way because of the independent legal status of corporations and legal liability law. Unless there is an omniscient conscious entity in charge of finding out whether you are following the spirit of the rule, you can get around any rule in this way.

The economy is simply too connected to rule otherwise. Do you break the rule if you end up giving the company money, and later you eat at a restaurant it owns? If you walk through the public park it bought? If you happen to qualify for a grant it offers? If your local road is fixed up by tax money it paid?

Everything is connected in the modern economy. Money doesn't actually exist as a tangible thing, that's the point of money, it's 100% fungible. One dollar is the same as another dollar for buying purposes, but 99% of that money only exists as numbers on a computer database.
