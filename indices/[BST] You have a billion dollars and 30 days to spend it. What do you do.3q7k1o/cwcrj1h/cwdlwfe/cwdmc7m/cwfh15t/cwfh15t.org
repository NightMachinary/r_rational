What about if there's a rule that you can't benefit yourself directly or indirectly without also benefiting some other large group of people -- i.e. if you want to spend some of the money on yourself you can only give yourself $100 and 10,000,000 other people also have to get $100. Or if you use it to buy a piece of property you can't own it afterwards, it has to become a park or something similarly public. Or if you donated it to a company that company would be prohibited from giving you anything or favoring you in any way afterwards. Then what would one do?
