"This is being used to benefit me directly" and "this is used to benefit me only by improving the world that I live in" are not yes and no things, they are two points on a continuum. Does something that benefits 90% of the world, or 40%, or all Americans, or all people in the computer industry count as benefitting the world? What about something that benefits my family? If I try to make myself very rich with the sincere intent to use most of the money after the 30 days are up on helping the world, does that count as benefitting the world? (And if not, why should it count if I make any individual person rich with the intent that the wealth spreads to the world, such as giving the money to a businessman or politician?) What if I use the money to open a foundation that I run, for that matter?
