Meh. Say I put the money in a fund for a specific use--sort of a grant/loan pool for certain types of projects. Would making myself eligible for drawing from the pool after the 30 days violate the spirit of the hypothetical? Assume these projects would generally require more than 30 days to complete.

I have no idea where a billion dollars could do the most good. That's a lot of money and I'd probably just ask a lot of the smartest people I can find (so ... probably here), and then they'd mostly point me toward Givewell, so I'd probably just start at Givewell.

But, again, a billion dollars is a /lot/ of money. If I shave off 10% of that for things other than EA, that's still a huge impact, and I get more than enough change to accomplish things more personally relevant, like throwing money at [[http://wicab.com][Wicab]] until they are able to / agree to sell the Brain PortÂ® at a reasonable price, or buy/build a ton of tactile displays so they can reach people at a reasonable price, or... you know, maybe a billion dollars is enough money to start a health insurance company that targets the rare and outlandishly expensive stuff? Seeing as I keep tripping over the outlandishly expensive stuff.

Buuut... there is something I kinda want / could really use that fits into the range of a few dozen thousand at most, but spread out over a few months. I wonder if I could pay it all up front and still get what I need?

Would that a billion dollars could significantly impact the incentive structures in medical research, but in the US, a billion dollars is one new treatment. So I doubt I'm getting any medical miracles out of it. I guess I could spread it out among existing research that is only a little underfunded, but then I'd have to spend most of that 30 days researching the research and figuring out how to donate to them. I don't think my attention span can handle that. (Also: buy a million dollar subscription to attention span-increasing medication. I don't care if it's Ritalin or Modafinil or Bupropion... I just care that it works.)

I mean, I'm spending as much as it takes on Executive Function interventions. But 30 days is nowhere near long enough to properly evaluate those. I might need to hire someone to do long-term treatment, and after a while, a contract system where I pay everything up front and they continue indefinitely seems a little shaky.

But yeah, a billion dollars can sorta-kinda approximate some of my "this genie does not take 'CEV' as a wish" genie wishes. I doubt it'd be enough for all of them, but it'd at least be enough for me to pay a few of the smartest people out there to brainstorm something better than I can come up with.
