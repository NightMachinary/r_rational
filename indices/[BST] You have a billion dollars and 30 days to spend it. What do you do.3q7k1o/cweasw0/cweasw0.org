I'd probably get in touch with Elon Musk and be like "hey, so I've got a billion dollars burning a hole in my pocket, can I help you space?" With that much money to throw in, I might be able to get a seat on the SpaceX board and help oversee how the money gets spent. BFR and MCT get made even sooner, Mars colony gets built faster, humanity gets into space earlier making us that little bit more resistant to Death-by-asteroid. Or if I can help allocate some of those funds within SpaceX, help kickstart asteroid mining and orbital manufacturing. Nothing like sipping champagne on my spin gravity orbital shipyard while building the first large scale interplanetary transport ships.
