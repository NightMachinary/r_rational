Inefficient.

Solve down to Earth problems problems first, such as hunger, using money under conditional spending, and the rest of the money self-sustaining itself through some sort of resource-busting investment.

It is more effiecient to put billions on the 'brain market' and have them perform research, than to fund research directly. It also avoids the problem of 'useless anachronistic technologies' which we think might be useful but turn out in the future to be a waste of money.
