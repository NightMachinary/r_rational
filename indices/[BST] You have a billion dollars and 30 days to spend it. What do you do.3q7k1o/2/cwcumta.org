Endow a foundation dedicated to space development. There are other things that perhaps have higher value -- AI, cryonics, life extension -- but nothing that has as high a payoff and as much certainty of achieving the payoff. Asteroid mining, space colonies, solar power satellites...it's all either engineering or research, not basic science. The other things I mentioned are very much basic science.
