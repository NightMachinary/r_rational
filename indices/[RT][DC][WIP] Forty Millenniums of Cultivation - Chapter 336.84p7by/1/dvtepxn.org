I've found it difficult to continue this. I am at chapter 42, and I recently realized what I didn't like: everything is huge. There has not been an event or fight or accomplishment that didn't have a corresponding description like: "his heart burst with such great joy it couldn't be contained."

I was wondering if this type of "everything is the coolest thing" sticks around or if it gets better?

Or if anyone has a recommendation of a more down to earth example of xianxia.

Thanks!
