I mean, I get that it is its own genre, and it has its own ways. And I also get that many people greatly enjoy that.

What I am saying, is that I have a hard time enjoying that. So I would love recommendations of the same genre, xianxia, but more "down to earth", as I described it.

Thanks for the info though.
