  What I am saying, is that I have a hard time enjoying that. So I would love recommendations of the same genre, xianxia, but more "down to earth", as I described it.

Take a look at [[https://novelsground.com/legend-of-the-cultivation-god-index/][Legend of the Cultivation God]]. It's unfortunately dropped (and a little slow to start) but honestly what's there already is really an enjoyable read.
