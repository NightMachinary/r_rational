Yup, that's xianxia for you. Could be worse, of course. In most other xianxia novels those attributes are cranked up to eleven. The opponents will usually look down on the MC because of his apparently low level of cultivation and attempt to kill him, which allows him to justifiably fight back and often kill the aggressor, showcasing how much more powerful he is than everybody expected. Lather, rinse, repeat.

You notice how every now and then the author of 40K Cultivation references the way things used to be thousands of years ago, with a prevalent "might makes right" mentality? That's the author referencing the xianxia genre as a whole. Far in the past of 40K Cultivation it was just a standard xianxia novel, but their society has grown since that point.
