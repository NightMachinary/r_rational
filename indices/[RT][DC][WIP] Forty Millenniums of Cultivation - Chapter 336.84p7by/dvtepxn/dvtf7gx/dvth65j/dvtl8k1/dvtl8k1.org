I think that your problem is more with the Chinese writing style than anything else. FMoC already defies the genre conventions by quite a bit, so it does what you describe less than most... but it's still part of the accepted writing style, so it still comes up. In terms of a story that defies convention /even more/... Cultivation Chat Group comes to mind (read it on the site-of-your-choice, as there is some controversy over the translation host). That said, I don't think you'll entirely get away from that sort of reaction so long as you're reading stories by Chinese authors; that's just how they write.
