Translation quality is reasonable. It's far better than machine translation, but the current translator doesn't seem to be a native English speaker; this sometimes results in awkward grammar and odd word choices. The overall effect places it comfortably among other translated Chinese webnovels; if FMoC is not your first Xianxia novel, you're likely used to it.

It's probably fair to say that the original translator put in a bit more polish and care into his work, while the current translator is translating semi-professionally. The difference means that the current translator produces work with a bit less quality... but at a notably faster pace. Given the sheer size of FMoC, that's quite good for anyone who actually wants to read the whole thing any time in the foreseeable future.
