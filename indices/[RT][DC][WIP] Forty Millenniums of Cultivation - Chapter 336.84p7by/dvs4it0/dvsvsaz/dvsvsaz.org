That's not an unreasonable point to make, but Qidian are the publishers of FMoC, and the only ones translating it. If you want to read this particular story, they're the only game in town (barring the various leech sites that are literally just stealing their content to put their own ads on it; those are arguably worse).

Also, as megazver noted; I'm not giving them any money, nor seeing any of their ads.
