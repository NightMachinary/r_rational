Story follows the format: MC faces overwhelming challenge and everyone doubts him -> MC exceed expectations, doubters red-faced -> repeat. Often the reward for the reader is the humiliation of the MC doubters.

Character development is very slow and many opportunities frustratingly skipped by the author. I still find the plot enjoyable enough and it's the only xianxia I read.
