I tried it but it just didn't pass the sniff test for me. I read quite a bit into it, but the author never addressed how the two worlds have such different histories, and yet have so many similarities in the present. The same cities, the same nationalities, very similar geopolitics, and culture, and technological level. And yet the history is completely unrecognizable.

Worse is how Gwen meets the same familiar people with the same names and personalities and everything else, and yet on closer inspection they have wildly different backgrounds. And despite that, they are virtually identical to the counterparts gwen knew, to the point where Gwen doesn't even have to try to fit in or to clandestinely fill any knowledge gaps. It's never much of an issue that she would automatically pass as a native of an alternate dimension, hah.

Does the author ever address this?
