I noticed a new series topping the list of [[https://topwebfiction.com][topwebfiction.com]] last month and decided to give it a try. I was a bit ambivalent about it for much of the first half, but really got sucked into it as the series went on. I just finished the most recent chapter last night, and decided I'd recommend [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles/chapter/163574/chapter-1-some-things-begin-something-ends][Metaworld Chronicles]].

*Summary*: A 30-year old successful Australian business woman named Gwen Song awakens after a night out drinking to find herself in a parallel world. It is 2001, not 2017, and Gwen is a teenager again in an apartment she hadn't seen since she was 16. This new world is a startling mixture of familiar locations and faces from her old life and a completely different world altered by the existence of magic. Here, humanity lives in shielded cities guarded by powerful magisters in floating towers, to protect them from the magical and demi-human races that rule most of the Earth. Gwen, struggling with the dual nature of her old life and that of her new teenage self, vows to use her business accumen and this world's magic to establish herself and become a force of nature that will leave her mark on the world.

*What I liked*: The magic and elemental system is well established and explored, and there's enough left unrevealed that the readers are constantly guessing what will happen next. The setting is also different from what I'm used to for isekai novels; this isn't Japan, Europe, or the US that's main-screen, it's alt-Austarlia and alt-China that serve as the backdrop. The author liberally sprinkles the text with regional slang and sayings, which helps the areas really feel differentiated. There is a lot of detail paid to both outfits and to food, which is not really what I'd expect in this kind of series but helps flesh out the settings. And the alternate history is really neat too, and has so far been pretty well done. Finally, the author seems to be writing at a crazy fast pace; they have released 160 chapters since September 2017. So constant updates are a plus!

*What I didn't like*: There seems to be a LOT of grammatical and spelling errors peppered throughout the text. Words missing, tenses wrong, etc. This gives it a very amateur feeling at first, though it does seem to improve a bit over time. The author also doesn't seem to like timeskips AT ALL, which can make some of the chapters feel like a real slog. The attention to detail helps flesh out the world, but it also makes reading the 20th description of outfits get frustrating. The fast release pace helps negate this somewhat, though. And finally, the main character is a Mary Sue (albeit, at least a morally conflicted one). She's incredibly overpowered. In a world where most magic users have one school of magic and the strongest can attain four after decades of practice, she has FIVE by the time she's seventeen. She has access to a second elemental affinity, Void, which so far only two people in the entire world seem to possess. She befriends or is protected by some of the strongest mages in Australia and China, and is casually gifted items that only the 1% could could usually even dream of possessing. She's not invincible, but a good amount of the world seems invested in giving her the best protection and opportunities to grow. That said, she has a really interesting perspective caused by her dual lives/memories, and the big bad antagonist is intuited to be even stronger and infinitely more ruthless so you always get the impression that Gwen's not quite strong enough. She's basically a teenage Supergirl, with potential to be the strongest being on Earth but only if she gets years more experience and can somehow overcome an evil Superman-level foe.

*Is it rational?* I'd say it's rational-adjacent. Gwen is intelligent, and frequently uses her abilities in a smart way to overcome challenges while staying true to her moral compass. She does make a lot of mistakes, but often this is because she doesn't know something about the new world or its factions, not because she's holding the idiot ball. Her goals make sense - she wants to make connections and increase her power before she really debuts, to protect herself from being used by any one political faction or worse - being captured and cut up as an experiment. The magic system is well developed and the cultural-social systems are realistically interconnected, which means that when a twist results from an event you can usually see how it happened when looking back. Really, the only parts that don't seem rational would be that the plot revolves around her to an unrealistic degree. While we get explanations for the times she's unexpectedly saved at the last moment, they still feel like deus ex machinas in the moment. As the series continues there's more foreshadowing than after-the-fact justifying, but it makes the first arc feel unsatisfying for quite a while.

Anyway, I say it's worth reading. It's definitely one of those series that, when I caught up, I was anxiously awaiting what would happen next. I'm not sure why it suddenly showed up on topwebfiction, and is placed so strongly, but it's currently competing with Ward, A Practical Guide to Evil, and Wandering Inn for the top few weekly/monthly spots. I'd give it a solid 7-7.5/10, with it being weaker at the beginning.
