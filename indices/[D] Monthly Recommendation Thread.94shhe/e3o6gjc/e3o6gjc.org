[[https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football][17776: What football will look like in the future]]: A work of multimedia fiction by the always excellent Jon Bois about an immortal humanity, told by artificial intelligences. I laughed. I cried. I wondered. Not "rational" but very very entertaining.

[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], by Wildbow: You've heard of Worm? In my opinion, Twig is better. With a greater focus on characters than Pact and Worm, Twig blows his previous works out of the water. Having the classic Wildbow focus on worldbuilding, Twig portrays an extremely interesting setting, both in the biopunk aspects and the political ones, and how they are both intertwined. The first few arcs start off feeling like a tabletop roleplaying game, with a "monster of the week feel" (which Wildbow himself dislikes but I found fun). The story moves past that once the main plot is set up. A coming of age story on the backdrop of a colonial America filled with biologically engineered horrors, I consider Twig a must-read.

[[http://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/][Unsong]], by Scott Alexander of SlateStarCodex. Unsong is based on a simple idea: what if the world ran on Judeo-Christian teachings? In 1968, Apollo 8 crashed into the heavenly crystal sphere surrounding Earth, causing physics to break down. The archangel Uriel comes down from heaven to hold Earth together, but it is irrevocably changed. A pun-lover's dream, Unsong is half Kabbalah-punk adventure romp, half alt history story, about rational-ish characters making their way through a world that makes little sense anymore.

[[https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1][Always Human]]: You want Utopian science fiction lesbian romance? Look no further because this is cute as hell and gives a very optimistic view of the future. Also well written romance between two girls that isn't toxic and doesn't end with either of them dying. Very slice of life. Very good.

I also recommend [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods are Bastards]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]], [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], but since you're on [[/r/Rational]] you've probably already heard of these.
