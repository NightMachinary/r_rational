If you like Worth the Candle and Worm but want a break from the angst, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-the-gamer.601118/][Greg Veder vs. The World]] is a fun and surprisingly well-executed litRPG crossover between Worm and The Gamer. Like WtC, it picks up after the Tutorial and it touches on the consequences of "what if your life were a game," but unlike WtC, it never gets too serious. Characters are mostly rational; the plot is mostly ruled by cool. For anyone who's put off by Greg, he's actually likeable here without losing his canon nerdiness.
