My favorite book by far in my last few months of reading has been Semiosis by Sue Burke. It's an amazing work of xenofiction, and it reads like a series of five novellas, each one being focused on a pivotal member of that generation. It's a story about a new colony on an alien world where the intelligence niche was filled by plants, who then manipulate the animals to do their bidding. It's a fascinating tale of generations clashing, hard choices, and learning to communicate.

Worth The candle and Threadbare are still the only "hard litrpgs" that have actually entertained me, there's just so much terrible writing in the genre it's painful to find the gems.

Caverns and creatures / Critical Failures by Robert Bevan is more of a character driven comedy/adventure. Group of jackasses piss off their new GM, game master turns out to be a wizard who drops them into the game world. It's honestly hilarious, and while there's a modest amount of cruder humor, it usually fits in context and isn't disruptive to the story. It's really enjoyable, especially if things like the narrative disrupting popups that every litrpg since the gamer needs to have, are irritating to you. Character sheets are an actual item in this story, and the stats are secondary to the plot, closer to how things are in order of the stick and other stories that keep a nice plot/mechanic seperation.

NPCS by Drew Hayes is another interesting "the tabletop game is a world", where the player characters die off rather early, and a few NPCs, in order to save themselves from the threat the dead PCs were supposed to handle, take up the quest, without the GM noticing.

Super Powereds is also by Drew Hayes, mentioning it because it's finally all in audiobook form, and it's great. It suffers from some pacing issues, like only halfway through the last book do we finally understand the goal and motivation of the antagonist, but there's plenty of action and other character arcs to fill the space. The only major plotline irritation I have with that world is that it has the annoyingly common "cutoff system" where the students are trained and ranked and there's a drastic artificial culling system that ends with only 10 graduates and dozens of washouts with a massive amount of training they can't legally use.

There's a new book by Yahtzee Croshaw, currently an audible exclusive, Differently Morphous. It's a novel in an urban fantasy world where the masquerade breaks. It has Eldritch horrors getting asylum in England, a student of magic who doesn't actually have magic, just an eidetic memory. It has an entire magical community learning the meaning of political correctness. I've loved his other novels, mixing his wonderful sense of humor with rather original settings.

The Undead: Parts 1 - 18 by R R Haywood is a rather unfortunately named zombie survival series that I passed over for a long while. Despite the most bland title I've ever encountered, the actual contents would best be described as a zombie apocalypse happening inside a british comedy. It's got a lot of really solid characters, including one of the more realistic depictions of an autistic main character.

The Curse Workers Trilogy by Holly Black is a wonderful thing. It's a fairly simple magic system, where some people have one of a handful of touch-based powers. This magic is well known, and among other things, has caused a society where gloves are just as socially important as pants.
