  Synopsis: Fireball? Chain Lightning? Frost Mirror... Wait just a minute; I've come to practice kung fu! Spells have nothing to do with me! What's that? I'm a Mage? Oh, right! I am a Mage indeed. But... Are you certain I'm one? Alright... Feel the might of my saber! My sword! My hidden weapons! What? You're saying I'm no Mage now? Let me prove it to you if you don't believe me! But even if you believe me, I will still show you just how unstoppable a Mage who knows kung fu can be!
