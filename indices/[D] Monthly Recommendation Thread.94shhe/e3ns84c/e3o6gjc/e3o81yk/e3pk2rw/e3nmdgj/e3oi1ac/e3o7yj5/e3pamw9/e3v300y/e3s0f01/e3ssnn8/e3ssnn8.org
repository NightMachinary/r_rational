Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Silver Resistance. It's not rational fiction but it is fairly witty and quite intelligent at times. The world building is pretty well thought out and I don't think the author has ever done anything solely because the plot demanded it. They're pretty good at making the story stick to its own rules. The story went on a long hiatus a while back but it's updating again now.

It's about a human who gets turned into a charmander and loses his memories, and finds himself in the all-pokemon country of Amberra which is under the tyrannical thumb of the mysterious Master. He joins a Resistance Team to help fight against the Master.
