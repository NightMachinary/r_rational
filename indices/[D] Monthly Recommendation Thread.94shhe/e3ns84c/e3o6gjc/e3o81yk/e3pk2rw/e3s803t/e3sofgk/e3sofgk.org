Not to the extent it would likely pass a smell test, no. There are comments on it (like how brands are the same, but have entirely unique features - like Audi cars existing, but running on magic crystals rather than gasoline). There is some talk about how in this world magic crystals replaced and removed entirely the need or desire for fossil fuels (if they even exist). Basically they are a naturally renewing but capped energy resource that provides great power on par with electricity without any environmentally or anthropologically dangerous byproduct. Like if humanity had harnessed solar power before even learning of petrol, and thus never even bothered to explore other options. There is also some rumination on how amazing it is that humanity survived to the modern day when magic study and scientific research didn't really begin until approximately the alt-Enlightenment. Which... again, strains credulity. Humanity /should/ have been wiped out in its infancy, in all likelihood.

If you can hold your breath and just go with it, it still works out fairly well. There are definite differences: no one's heard of Shakespeare, or at least he didn't write his most famous novels, which Gwen quotes extensively. Humanists like John Locke existed, but were famous because they were magisters. And many ancient countries and cultures existed and are remembered because their faiths included sectarian magic not available to others; so the Egyptians are referenced but are known as necromancers due to their (in)famous pharaohs, or Israelis exist, but they're a powerhouse due to their golems.

Not sure how far you got into it, but as I said before, I find the beginning to the be the weakest part. The world expands as it goes on, and the story becomes more interesting and engrossing as Gwen grows from a closeted high school teenager in "frontier" Sydney to a slightly-more-worldly college student in magical Shanghai.
