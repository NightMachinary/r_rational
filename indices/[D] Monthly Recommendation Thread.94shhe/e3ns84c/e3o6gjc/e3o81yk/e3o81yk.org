Main rec: I finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise][Kings of Paradise]] by Richard Nell a few days ago, a self-published novel which only recently got a physical edition. As you can see it's been out for a year, but has less than 200 ratings on goodreads, which is unfortunate as it's the best fantasy novel I've read in a while. I highly recommend it.

The two storylines start very slow, and took a long time to capture my full attention. For me it took about a week to read the first 60%, and half a day to read the remainder.

Other recs:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36896898-spinning-silver][Spinning Silver]] by Naomi Novek. A decent "wild magic" type of story, with all female POVs.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25787656-injection-vol-1][Injection by Warren Ellis]]. A graphic novel. Super AIs and shamanistic magic. My kind of weird.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/214767-new-era-online][Life Reset 2: EvP]] by Shemer Kuznits. It's pretty good(for a litRPG). The first book didn't occupy a high place in my mind because of some weirdly bad interactions with a corporate lawyer, but it was still a pretty good story. The sequel does away with the bad and improves the good significantly. It's impressive how much the author improved. He managed to juggle the feeling of progression and keep the narrative tension high throughout a very long book.
