I would say that 2 of 3 of the main POV characters in Kings of Paradise are level 2 intelligent characters, and all are intelligent and fairly rational. The mechanics of the universe have not been deeply explored, and the characters are only starting to develop their powers, so it remains to be seen whether the author will do so rationally. I'd say the story as a whole is probably up to scratch in rationality.

In Spinning Silver the protagonist is intelligent, but not a level 2 character. To put it simply, the story is a self-aware pastiche of a fable type story told in a fable format, kinda. It's clever, but almost purposely irrational, if that makes sense.

Injection has plenty of Level 2 intelligent characters and I would say so far what I've read of it is definitely rational.

Finally I would not say that Life Reset 1 was a rational story, as a lot of the plot was flimsy and felt like "the plot required it". The second one avoids all those problematic plot points and retcons some of the worse ones, so it's much better in that regard. But it's still not particularly rational.
