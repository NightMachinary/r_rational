I just recently watched the Korean films Along With The God's, it was released as two movies and is adapted from a manhwa story. The movies are absolutely great with awesome storytelling. The worldbuilding is well done and I'd say the character motivations are rational and most of the events are very rational so at least it should be rational-adjacent. Synopsis : Imagine if the afterlife had lawyers, well that's what guardians are, the three MCs, who have to save 49 pure/honorable paragon souls from getting punished in any one of the 7 hells from Buddhist lore, in a 1000 years to get a chance for reincarnation. You follow as they are reaching the end of their mission.
