  You seem to have missed the part where she's trying to not get elected?

No, not at all. I mean she's groping the idiot ball at not seeing the obvious parallels to the modern world. Her oblivioucy is the silly part. "Let's point the anger at the alt-French, because they're not the Polish, or the Jews! This will never end poorly!"

Or even in the more modern US age... Why does she think becoming Alex Jones is a great idea, rather than Elon Musk? She's acting like a sociopath, sure, but also like an ignorant one.

It's still fun, don't get me wrong. But also it requires accepting the protagonist (and author) are riding rails to WW2 at the expense of shoehorning Tanya into the role as alt-Hitler. It's horrifying and hilarious, but completely obvious.
