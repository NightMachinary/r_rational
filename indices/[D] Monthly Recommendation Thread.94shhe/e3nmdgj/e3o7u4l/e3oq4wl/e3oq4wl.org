I would reccomend the source material. Its not rational, but def8nitslly rational adjacent. What sold me on it as a series was it's introduction, in which the MC dies, meets a being that stops time, calls itself god, and demonstrates various abilities like reincarnation and world shifting, but unlike the standard for this genre, realizes that this is, in fact, not nearly enough evidence to prove that their god, and that it's rediculous to expect an educated modern person to beleive a tale that rediculous. He ends up getting in an argument with the god, which he dubs “being X,” and it ends up with him being reincarnated in not!1900s europe against his will.

As far as youjo senki / a young woman's military record goes, its much harder to describe the story without major spoilers than just the setup, but it's essentially isekai flashman, or maybe isekai ciaphas cain. The author puts a lot of effort into doing their research and has some very consistant worldbuilding, which is always great to see. I would heartily reccomend you give it a try, although if you decide to go with the.anime their choice for what to puut in the first episode doesnt do a good job of setting the series, esspecially relative to how the manga and light novel did it, but it does to a better job in other ways.

All this is to say that the source material is good, and the fanfic is really good. It's if you've seen the source material, but I introduced the fic to my brother and he's able to keep up just fine without having seen the og series.
