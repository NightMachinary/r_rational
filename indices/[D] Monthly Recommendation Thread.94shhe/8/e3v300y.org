If any of you haven't read Blackwing the raven's mark you should.

The main pros of the story are:

1. Author is a HEMA practitioner, he knows how combat works and how to write about it.
2. The story has accurate representations of god-like beings. Immortal people with incredible but limited powers, with deep plots and plans that can span 50 years. Gods how you'd imagine them to be, they are rational, calm, cold, cunning, ruthless planners and somewhat distant from human affairs.
3. Interesting time period and world building, time period is basically renaissance europe, guns exist but they are bad and people still fight with swords and plate armor, with some magic powered technology. World building is basically a battle between 2 distinct god-like factions one with humans as pawns and the other as an eldritch sort of faction.

It's one of the best fantasy books I've read in the past couple years, and I'm looking forward whatever that author releases next.
