Just for fun, but I quite enoyed [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/virtual-world-close-combat-mage][Close combat mage]]. Webnovel about playing a videogame, best part is how often it made me laugh out loud. Also it's only at chapter ~130, so you get to read the good part and stop before it starts dropping off in quality :)
