[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620364-the-philosopher-s-flight][The Philosopher's Flight]]: One of my favorite reads in recent weeks. The story takes place in the 1910's, about eighty years after the discovery of magic and follows one young man trying to enter the Air Force.

I would call the book semi-rational in that the worldbuilding is deep and thoughtful, and most if not all the characters have clear goals and realistic motivations. Though there are a few moments where the MC should have died but didn't because of Plot Armor. 4.5/5
