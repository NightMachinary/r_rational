Read through it since yesterday, it's quick since there are only several chapters so far. It was hilarious, gripping, and horrifying all at once. My reaction the entire time was basically "No... no... no... no no no no nononononoNO!" Like watching a slow motion trainwreck. I do find it odd that Tanya tried to take over in a manner that pretty clearly is going to make her into alt-Hitler. Considering she's the reincarnation of a modern day Japanese salaryman, I would have expected her to realize that xenophobia, militarism, and social upheaval would lead to a worse outcome than trying to, say, enact a rapid industrialization and modernization plan like Japan post-WW2. Granted, the Treaty of Versailles put post WWI-Germany in a MUCH different state than the Marshall Plan did with post WW2-Japan. Still, it teeters on the edge of disbelief that she wouldn't see the parallels to her own world's history.\\
Still, a good recommendation and one I'll probably catch up on again in several weeks when more chapters are out!
