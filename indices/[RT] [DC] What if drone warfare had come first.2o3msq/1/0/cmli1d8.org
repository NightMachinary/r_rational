1 - I think the point was - WW1 was still a huge event because in that universe death of 100 people in a war was a big deal. See our universe and 9/11 for examples how small thing can be perceived as a big deal if it's outside expectations, no matter if it's really important.

Mine my problem with such alternate history stories is - given such big change in the past (Cartagina etc) - it's implausible that recognizable USA even exists. Small change 2000 years ago could have made a big difference, such big change would probably make everything different, not just one aspect of the world.

But it's not meant to be realistic, it's just moralitet to show how stupid some of the arguments against drone warfare are. Agreed - it would work better if the anti-drone warfare side wasn't dumb and crazy.
