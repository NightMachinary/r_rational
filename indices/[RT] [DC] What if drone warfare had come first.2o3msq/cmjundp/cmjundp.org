Fun read, but I perceive a few issues:

- The "alternative history" world-building is a bit heavy handed. Why reminisce about a World War I that didn't happen or even mention Hannibal if he didn't manage to have any historic impact. Just to make a point that it would be an "insult to the memory" of whoever brought about all those decidedly /non-pivotal/ moments in history? I get the point that the author tries to make, but wouldn't it instead make sense for the pro-human-warfare faction (i.e., General Ripper) to argue that soldiers who did valiant deeds could become heros or "stars" and potentially monetize the tales of their heroism? "A billion dollar market..."
- Ripper is too much of a straw man. He violates the rule of rational fiction that your antagonists must make good and internally consistent points. He is too obviously crazy and ridiculous and not even [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/][Level 1 Intelligent]]. And there are some good points to be made for his views that can be refuted on a higher intellectual level. And it's easy to come up with many of those if you just set aside 5 minutes and think it through. If you /do/ think the story requires comic relief, give Ripper a young and politically-incorrect attach√© who can interject with some of the more "inappropriate remarks" like "the lower classes could serve as cannon-fodder". And leave it to Ripper to agonize about whether to slap down his subordinate, to concede or to argue the (bad) point.
- You can point out that your "alternative America" is doing better than the real version is without resorting to "We have more tax money than we know what to do with these days anyway."
- Too many people in the room, one of which (Wells) only gets a single line. Hawke and Steele could probably be easily merged into a single person.

TL;DR: IMHO, does not really qualify as /Rational Fiction/
