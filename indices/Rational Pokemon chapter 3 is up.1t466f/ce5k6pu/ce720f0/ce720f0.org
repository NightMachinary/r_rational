Honestly, as there's no connection to our world at all, it probably won't be particularly "engaging" to someone not interested in the Pokemon world. The only real prior knowledge it assumes is that you know the basic concept of what pokemon are ("magical" monster that take the place of animals) and how humans interact with them (capture them in pokeballs to protect themselves or battle with others), but I also don't go into detail describing every pokemon that shows up, and many of the "rational" parts are dissections of the irrational aspects of Pokemon.

That said, I would be interested to know what someone who knows nothing of Pokemon makes of the fic, so if you do read it I'd love your feedback :) If anything, just googling each Pokemon that shows up should cover the majority of what confusion you may have.
