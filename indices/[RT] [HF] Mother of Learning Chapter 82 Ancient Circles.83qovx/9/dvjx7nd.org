Wow. Getting that ring is going to be a huge pain every time they attempt it. Maybe they can try some diplomatic approach to reach the high priest in the future before pulling the same mind magic attack?

Did we know it was a ring before this chapter? It was mentioned very offhandedly so I am assuming yes, but I thought it was still a question mark over which of the two remaining artefacts they would find.

Very interesting in knowing the rings abilities. Also, it seems likely that it will have some hidden time-loop related abilities. If it does, that strongly suggests that all 5 key pieces have bonus power for Zach and Zorian which is a definite plus.

I like that Z&Z discussed the unneeded danger QI imposed on himself with the flashy dagger storage last chapter. I remember some discussion in the comments of people trying to decide why he would do that.
