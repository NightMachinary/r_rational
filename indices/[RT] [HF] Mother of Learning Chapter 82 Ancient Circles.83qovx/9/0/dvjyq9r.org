  Getting that ring is going to be a huge pain every time they attempt it. Maybe they can try some diplomatic approach to reach the high priest in the future before pulling the same mind magic attack?

I doubt it will be as difficult on repetition. If they know where the priest is, they can either ambush him as soon as he leaves the temple, or they could find out where he is in the temple, teleport to him, take the ring, and leave. Maybe not simple, but achievable since I don't believe the wasps have wards good enough to detect Z&Z outside the temple nor restrict scrying and teleportation. The ring certainly has anti scrying defences, but it's much easier to find the priest.
