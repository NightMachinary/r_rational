Alanic not having mind defenses would surprise me due to how combative he is, and he knows the value of good defense or he's not be so angry at zorian for neglecting soul defenses.

zorian can cast, flamethrower, severing disc, incinirating ray, plasma whip, fireball and flame vortex. where off incinirating ray and flame vortex burn pretty much all his mana and he can't cast too many fireballs either.

Cyoria is like one of the most mana filled area on the planet, zorian can recharge pretty fast there by absorbing ambient mana, and they were diving into the hole the actual most mana rich area on the planet (that we know off) so not very slow at all he should have had full mana when they started the assult without any issues.

the in depth shaping books are because zorian should look for shaping exercises that are good for the spells he wants/needs to cast, rather then xvim not knowing more, but why study something you wont have any use for when pressed for time as they are now.

mind defenses are super common, he states that pretty much every mage knows them in the early chapters when he just started learning mind magic, however most don't use them permanently and only activate them when they find them relelevant (like in combat), MIND BLANK however is hard to cast and used by a much smaller amount of people.

mind bland and mind shields are completly different, shields protect your mind while mind blank makes your mind totally immune to any interaction from mind magic (it can however be dispelled but dispelling is hard in combat)
