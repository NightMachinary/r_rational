  the in depth shaping books are because zorian should look for shaping exercises that are good for the spells he wants/needs to cast, rather then xvim not knowing more, but why study something you wont have any use for when pressed for time as they are now.

ahh gotcha, must have missed the part where shaping exercises were really specific

  mind bland and mind shields are completly different, shields protect your mind while mind blank makes your mind totally immune to any interaction from mind magic (it can however be dispelled but dispelling is hard in combat)
#+end_quote

yeah and shields/typical defences are basically useless against zorian, if you don't have your mind completely blanked and shut off, you're going to get pretty rekt. unless you're some whacked out lifeform like that worm lol

iirc, xvim has a permanent mind blank cast?
