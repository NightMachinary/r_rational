Both Alanic and Xvim would win vs zorian in a straight up fight, zorian is not a godlike mage, he's a superior mind mage and crafter but he lose pretty much all his combat viability as soon as someone have a mental shield, there was a reason he was pretty much a tag-along when they attacked the ritual plattform with the battle group while Xvim joined the actual fighting.

Most of zorians power comes from items, that take time to craft so he's very dangerous with prep time since he can craft them, but that's only really viable if you're the one picking a fight if zorian just suddenly found himself in combat he'd be in deep trouble.

Zorian is basically an engineer, he build stuff, and he knows how stuff works, he's just bare minimum when it comes to combat, just like you would not call a weapon manufacturer a great warrior, but given time he can build a weapon for any situation.

Zach is the combat mage, he can beat basically anyone.
