xvim still got better shaping skills, he calls zorians skills passable but shaping is basically Xvims MO.

  because his mana capacity is already super stretched by the simulacrums, who are simultaneously burning it up.. where the others in the party without simulacrums have full mana <

does not apply since he had no active simulacrums then.

okey what combat spells have you seen from zorian that are so good?, he solves most problems by chugging explosives at them, acid, or incediaries, and the only spells he often use on regular basis are moment and detection based, like teleport, divinations, gate & invisibility, he got a mean magic missile but that is a really basic spell.

most of the time he uses mind magic, and he uses it on scrubs since they can't defend themselves like a mage can, he's still horribly outmatched against most mages it's just that mages are relativly rare so most of the time it's like fighting against swords with a ak-47.

Alanic especially would just douse the entire area in fire and call it a day with fire manipulation, sure zorian would use fire wards since he knows Alanic is heavily specialised but still Alanic is a really powerful mage or he would not have lasted against the lich when it was "disarmed".
