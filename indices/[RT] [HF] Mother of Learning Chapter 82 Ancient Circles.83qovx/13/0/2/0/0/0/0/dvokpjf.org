yeah i'm not saying he's godlike, but i don't see how alanic/xvim would dominate him, not in what we've been shown in the story. yeah they're both very powerful in their own right, which is why they always recruit them.. but even then, they often go to alanic for his contacts and ability to recruit even more people, than his skills directly.

plus, zorian has shaping skills solidly on par with xvim by now no?

  there was a reason he was pretty much a tag-along when they attacked the ritual plattform with the battle group.

because his mana capacity is already super stretched by the simulacrums, who are simultaneously burning it up.. where the others in the party without simulacrums have full mana?

  Zorian is basically an engineer, he build stuff, and he knows how stuff works, he's just bare minimum when it comes to combat, just like you would not call a weapon manufacturer a great warrior, but given time he can build a weapon for any situation.

true, but the small scale combat spells he knows are extremely effective and efficient, especially with his world-tier shaping skills?
