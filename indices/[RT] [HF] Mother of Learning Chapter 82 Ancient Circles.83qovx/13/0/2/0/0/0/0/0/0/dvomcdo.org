  xvim still got better shaping skills, he calls zorians skills passable but shaping is basically Xvims MO.
#+end_quote

he told zorian to look for more in-depth shaping books in the end yeah? i thought he's not learning any new exercises from xvim cos' he tapped him dry? since even zorian knows the importance of the skill by now.

#+begin_quote
  does not apply since he had no active simulacrums then.
#+end_quote

his simulacrums had been burning his mana the whole time? I don't exactly remember mana regeneration rates, but they're not in a mana rich area so... slow?

#+begin_quote
  okey what combat spells have you seen from zorian that are so good?, he solves most problems by chugging explosives at them, acid, or incediaries, and the only spells he often use on regular basis are moment and detection based, like teleport, divinations, gate & invisibility, he got a mean magic missile but that is a really basic spell.
#+end_quote

hmmm i swear he (earlier on, pre-zach) was practicing plenty of combat spells, when he actually needed them, not just magic missile? and only shifted focus once he teamed up with a living-breathing combat spell? (and that zach isn't great with any kind of complex magic unless he can brute force it with bulk mana)

#+begin_quote
  most of the time he uses mind magic, and he uses it on scrubs since they can't defend themselves like a mage can, he's still horribly outmatched against most mages it's just that mages are relativly rare so most of the time it's like fighting against swords with a ak-47.
#+end_quote

xvim has a permanent shield on his mind yeah, like a mind blank?

what about alanic?

plus, afaik, MOST mages don't have good mind defences, or any of any sort, just the top tier ones? and even then, only a very small number have something impenetrable in place?
