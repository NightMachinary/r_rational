no he have unstructured defense, it's basically a automatically repairing rubbery defense so it's hard for Zorian to get through it, and he can't just blast his way through it either.

mind shields are described as "shells" they are basically a layer of something rigid protecting the mind, pretty much always with cracks and weak points that you can use to dismantle the defense, but generally a mind shield would give you enough time for you to beat Zorian, since he'd need to remove the shield, dismantling is cheap and time consuming, breaking is quick and expensive.

Mind blank is the immunity, but have the side effect that it drives the user insane if used too often, it's not a shield as much as it simply remove the mind from existance for anyone but the user, and since it does not exist nobody else can interact with it.
