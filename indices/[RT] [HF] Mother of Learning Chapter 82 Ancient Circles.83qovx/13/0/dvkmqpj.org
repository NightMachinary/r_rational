The nature of these time loops give them several advantages that those going through time regularly would not have:

1. *Effectively Infinite Money*: After learning the locations of large mana crystals, easy-to-acquire-but-rare ingredients for alchemy, lost treasures, etc., they start off every loop with plenty of funds. This lets them buy secrets, tutors, training equipment for learning spell formulae, and whatever else they please.

2. *Risk Taking Without Risks*: Zach practiced his combat skills by taking on a dragon alone. Without the loop, he would be risking death from trying such a stunt. With the loop, if he dies, then he's back to square one. They can learn dangerous spells that might harm them during the learning process because all of their injuries (sans soul damage) recover at the start of the loop.

3. *Blatant Criminal Activity*: They stole an airship and killed several individuals in the process to acquire an easyish way to get to a distant continent. Outside the loop, they would forever have a country hunting them down, and their morals might stop them from killing the guards, but inside the loop, the deaths don't amount to much.

I'm sure I'm missing some, but this list should be enough to make my point: Zorian hasn't lived a normal seven years, he's lived a jam-packed, study-filled, adventure-laden time that even royalty couldn't get on the outside to the same degree.

One last thing of note would be the time dilation rooms. Zorian mentions that he's been in the loops about seven years /not counting the rooms/. These give extra weeks every loop of practicing mana shaping exercises that Xvim states are the bread and butter of archmages, improving their casting abilities that much more.
