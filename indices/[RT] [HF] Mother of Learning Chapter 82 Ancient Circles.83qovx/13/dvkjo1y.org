Wait wait wait wait wait

He's only been in the loop for 7yrs? This is confusing on multiple levels, I thought he was well into decades by now, and Zach even further

If it's only been 7 years, how come he's basically the most supreme master of magic on the planet, if it only takes a piddly 7 years of practice to get this good? Makes no sense.
