Hmm is he really that good? I don't think they are archmage level yet.

In any case they have not only lived 7 years but they basically have cheat codes to learn/steal master secrets over and over.

They can repeat hard to do tasks until succeeding which normal people even with decades of experiences can't.

They can be reckless because they can't die until recently where they need conserve cycles.

These are huge advantages..
