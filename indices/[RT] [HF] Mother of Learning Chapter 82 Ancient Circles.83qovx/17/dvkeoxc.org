I'm starting to think that the Crown's special function has nothing to do with markers, and instead just gives (effectively) infinite mana.

Dagger kills dudes -> Dagger's secret function kills dudes across resets.\\
Orb stores things -> Orb's secret function stores things across resets.\\
Crown stores mana -> Crown's secret function stores mana across resets.
