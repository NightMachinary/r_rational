problem with that is that Zorian would instantly know if she was an empath, simply because since he "opened" his mind he've "seen" & "felt" minds around him and other psychics appears as "suns" compared to the "dim" flickerminds.

so he's recognize an empath by just switching on his mind sense, something he does ALL the time.
