  We've often seen situations where Zach would be much better suited to massive mana reserves. The fight with the hydra, this fight. We've seen other fights where others could better use it- Xvim ran out of mana, and generally served as an effective trump against the Lich. We've not so often seen Zorian run out of mana because he's so precise with his mana usage now and doesn't tend to use it in a flashy way.

I think in part this is because Zorian has such low reserves. In addition to him being really miserly with his mana, this means him being out of mana means him being /out/. Zach being low on mana means he can only cast a few more shields and some of his cheaper offensive spells. Zorian would probably just die against someone close to his level if he got as comparatively low as Zach does. Xvim did actually die when he got too low.

Zach also regenerates absolute amounts of Mana much faster than normal people, so a sustainable level of combat for him is still very respectable.

  I'd imagine the crown would work well passed from person to person depending on the situation.

Unless the crown can store multiple people's Mana, it wouldn't. Mana is attuned to a single person and can't be used by someone else with any ease. There was a world building post that mentioned this I think.
