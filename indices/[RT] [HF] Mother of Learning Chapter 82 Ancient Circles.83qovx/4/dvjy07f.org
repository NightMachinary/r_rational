I know it wasn't really mentioned much in this chapter, but if Z&Z can obtain the crown, who should get it? My thinking is if the Crown stores a fixed amount of Mana, then Zorian should get it. He's more efficient in using his Mana than Zach, and is currently much more limited by his small reserves. He'll take a long time to fill it up, but he could afford to use much costlier spells than he can currently. If the Crown stores an amount of Mana based on how much the user has, then Zach should get it, because the total amount of Mana storage gained is much larger if Zach's Mana is multiplied than if Zorian's is. Then Zach could make artillery spells fall like raindrops. For a short time at least.
