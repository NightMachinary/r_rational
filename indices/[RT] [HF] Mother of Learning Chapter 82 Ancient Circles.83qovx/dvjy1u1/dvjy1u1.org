1. This was a great insight into QI (relating it to city kids being squeamish about knowing how animals died). It's been said before but really well related to what we can relate to even today. Also, maybe nobody103 didn't appreciate being told his style for QI's speech was off - with Zach saying he was similarly informal each previous time he interacted with Zach. I hereby tender my apologies to the author :D

2. Sulrothum are way more scarier if they have access to wards and the like.

3. Sulrothum soul mage?! They were supposed to have access to magic, but this high?

4. Any way to trade with them for soul magic? Maybe the battle priest would be interested. If they can meet and just get the ring and bounce....
