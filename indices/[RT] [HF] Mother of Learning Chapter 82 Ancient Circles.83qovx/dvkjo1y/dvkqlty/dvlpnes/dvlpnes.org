I think he was between 5 and 6 years when they teamed up. From my notes which I made on some early read:

- 1 month of not knowing he's in a loop
- 6 full and a one very short iterations of sitting around doing nothing and wondering when the repetition will end
- 1 month with Zack there
- 6 months of improving himself, trying to impress Ilsa and Xvim
- an unknown but large number of 3-5 day iterations
- 1 month where Kirielle comes along
- 6 months where he's trying not to draw any attention because Zach's around and he's afraid of soul bonds
- 11 months of learning from the Aranea in Cyoria
- a very quickly ending iteration where he suicides to escape RR
- 22 months of staying away from Cyoria (minus 10 days)
- 9 more months before he teams up with Zack

So that's 63 months plus however long he spent in short iterations.
