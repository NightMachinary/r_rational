Ahh gotcha, don't remember anything about the unstructured defence bit

Zorian doesn't have to dismantle a regular shield tho?, he can just punch straight through it like he's done plenty of times before

He only dismantles them if he doesn't want the person noticing/doesn't want to hurt the person.
