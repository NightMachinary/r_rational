idk if we've been reading the same story, what makes you think xvim is his match 1v1? he's strong, but he seems to die pretty easily in their attacks lol.

zach is the only normal character we've encountered that i'd say has a really solid chance, since he can just nuke zorian from orbit with bottomless mana lol.

on the other hand, all zorian has to do is mental attack if zach has no barrier up, so there's that. zorian is a lot craftier with better control where zach is stronger.

  but he've been in the loop for decades polishing his combat magic with lots of resources, targets and interest to do so.

I don't even think he's been in it for DECADES has he? zorian is only up to 7yrs, zach wasn't in it for decades before zorian.. like.. A decade maybe? i'm really confused at the timeline tbh.
