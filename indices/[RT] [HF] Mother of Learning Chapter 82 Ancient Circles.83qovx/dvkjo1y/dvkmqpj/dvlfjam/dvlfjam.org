Don't forget, basically a combination of 2 and 3, /shamelessly ransacking the minds of top-level experts like Sudomir/. It's well known that despite the efforts of public education, there is a whole lot of good stuff that mages already know how to do, but keep to themselves. ZZ can beg, buy or outright steal most of it.

From what I can tell, there are basically three challenges that people face in a magical career, and if you can deal with all three, you can be good at everything.

1. Cost of ingredients. This affects alchemy and golem-making. Obviously a non-issue.

2. Precision. This includes disciplines that need excellent shaping, and also eg spell formulas that need careful programming. Zorian has the right mindset for this, he had the right mentor, he had motivation due to his need for efficient mana usage, and he had lots and lots of time where shaping exercises were about all he could do (early loops, black rooms, etc).

3. Obscure knowledge. Lots of the best combat spells are not exceptionally hard to cast, merely restricted in the library. ZZ have raided all kinds of secret and illegal stashes.
