If I had to make a serious guess, I think the ring's ability would deal with subtlety or disguise in some way. Rings are small and unobtrusive, so hiding the wearer from perception in some way makes sense. That said, invisibility and physical transformation are already achievable, so maybe something like being able to convince anyone that you are whoever you say you are? Kind of a stretch, and I'm not really sold on this line of thought.

Alternatively, rings in medieval times were used to stamp things with the king's personal seal, in order to verify that something had come from the king. Convincing other people makes some sense again, or maybe some form of true sight.

The staff makes a lot of sense as a magic weapon. The ability to shape ambient mana as if it were your own would be monstrously OP, so I think that's out. Maybe the ability to cast any spell that you are able to cast, but at maximum efficiency? Or cast spells almost instantly? Thats kind of what staves do in this setting, although they're much more limited. Would have a very nice synergy with the crown, and would be amazing for Zach.

Oh, maybe the crown is for Mana storage, the staff for Mana shaping, and the ring for Mana generation? Each is very strong on its own, but synergizes extremely well with the other artifacts.
