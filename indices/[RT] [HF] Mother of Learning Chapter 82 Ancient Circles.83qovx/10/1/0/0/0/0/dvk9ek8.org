So it's OP enough - just the right amount of OP. (the crown gives QI massive mana, but he still has to deal with Alanic, Xvim, and others. Oh, and he is no one man army - he did get beat in the Necromancer's war.

This was a great chapter, but I missed getting battle details. I hope if this guess is correct, we'll get a pretty OP battle between ZnZ (+company!) and QI!
