  I 100% agree with the staff - especially with the almost instant spells would be really useful, but not terribly OP.

Instant spells would probably be better against QI than huge amounts of Mana. Combat magic, as explained in the most recent wordbuilding post, is basically any magic that has a use in combat and is quick to cast. You can't spend an entire minute casting a single devastating spell, because you're dead by then. Getting better at combat is generally about getting quicker to cast the spells you already know. If you aren't limited by how fast you can cast spells, or are at least a *lot* better than your opponent at casting quickly, you can overwhelm his defences because you can launch so many attacks before they can cast a defence.

Remember how devastating QI was when he sped himself up with time magic? And why he needed to do so in the first place? He had a bunch of attacks coming at him, and not enough time to erect defences. And then he blocked all those and launched attacks that were quick enough that some mages didn't have time to defend against them. Imagine being able do that effectively permanently. Launch multiple attacks so that anyone you face has to either dodge (sometimes not possible), or have generic defenses that aren't nearly as efficient at stopping any one type of spell. And then just continually throw out cheap spells that the enemy has to respond to individually. Even if you don't have nearly as much Mana as the other guy, you can quickly drain him dry. I think in most cases, you could beat the other guy by firing two near simultaneous attacks that can't be blocked by any single defence. Xvim's shieldbreakers plus a force lance, or something like that.

It wouldn't be unbeatable, because you're still limited by your reaction time, personal spell knowledge, and Mana reserves, but I think it's of a similar level of OP as the Crown. In combat anyways.
