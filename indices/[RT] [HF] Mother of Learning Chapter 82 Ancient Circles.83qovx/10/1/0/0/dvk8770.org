  Oh, maybe the crown is for Mana storage, the staff for Mana shaping, and the ring for Mana generation? Each is very strong on its own, but synergizes extremely well with the other artifacts.

If the ring is the symbolic source of power (as the seal) then it makes sense for mana generation. However, I'm not too convinced since the crown is the biggest symbol of authority. But well reasoned! I 100% agree with the staff - especially with the almost instant spells would be really useful, but not terribly OP. Could they beat the lich with something like that? Assuming they do NOT have the crown ofc.
