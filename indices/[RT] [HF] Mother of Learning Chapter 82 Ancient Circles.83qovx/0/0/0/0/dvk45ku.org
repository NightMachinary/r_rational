I think it's generally good advice to specialize heavily, up until the point where you regularly fight things by yourself. A group of people each specializing in one offensive tree each will be better able to handle something over a group of generalists, because the single specialist will be able to defeat one area of something else's defences fairly easily. Say Zach, Hypothetical Zorian who only has mind magic attacks, and hypothetical Alanic who only has soul magic attacks, form a party. Each still has the same defences as they normally do. By specializing in one offensive magic each, they will be be able to overcome things with average defences in each tree more easily than a party of generalists would, because average defences in any tree would easily fall before specialized attack in that same tree.

If you're a single adventurer though, or just an overachiever, then yeah you need to have more variety in your arsenal.
