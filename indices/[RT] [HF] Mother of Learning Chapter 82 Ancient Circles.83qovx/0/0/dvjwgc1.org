I have always thought complex fantasy combat all boiled down to Physical/Mind/Soul if you don't have a good defense in all of them, someone good in one field could probably take you out in one attack. If you can't defend your soul, then one Avada Kedavera (Or whichever equivalent there is) is enough to take you down. If you can't protect your mind, you become a slave/brain dead. If you can't protect your body... well. You die.

But you only really need to be good at *attacking* with one of them. You only need to win in one area to win the battle.
