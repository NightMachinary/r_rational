Yeah, great observation. Honestly, the magic system is half of what got me interested in this series. Wondering if the author made the magic system keeping the Realmatic Theory in mind or it's some kind of converging thought process among writers.

With regard to [[/u/Caliburn0][u/Caliburn0]]'s comment, I half agree. Zach & Zorian are good at all three magic types and it's something that's been building up for a while.

Zorian is great at mind magic (being a natural mind mage and trained by the spiders) and not so great at combat (which requires a lot of mana reserves and his inexperience). So he focused on soul magic (hard to defend and useful with the mind marker) and left most of the physical combat stuff to Zach (who is so overpowered he literally killed a dragon to test himself). And they have the knowledge of a bunch of mentors helping them out to make up for their inexperience and to give them an edge over other people (since knowledge in this world is stingily given to others so you literally have to meet the creator/master practitioner to learn it)

They've been winning because they're good at attacking with all magics.
