It was established that memory packets are really big (Zorian could carry very few notebooks while he still had the matriarch packet) and that the orb can carry memory stuff, which makes it perfect to hold a bunch of full memory dumps of people.

The question that wasn't explored so far is if memory packets can actually be overwritten over actual people, so far we only saw them compared to very big books but for memories and they have to be "digested"
