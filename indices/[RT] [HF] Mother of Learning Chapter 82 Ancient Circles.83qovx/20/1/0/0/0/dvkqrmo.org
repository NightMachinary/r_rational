The matriarch stored a memory packet in Zorians head but she was the one that had to unpack it. It seems like a person has to create/unpack a memory packet themselves (Zorian cannot do it for another person).

Also, the memories don't need to be physical things. One of the orbs uses has been stated to be an ability to store memories across restarts.
