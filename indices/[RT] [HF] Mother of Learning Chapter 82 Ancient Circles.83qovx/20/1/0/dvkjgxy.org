They don't actually do that, Zorian just brings notebooks over, he can make memory packets but I don't think he can just overwrite other people's memories with them.

Although now that I think about it that could be worth researching: making memory packets (which are huge) and storing them in the orb, then somehow research how to forcefully overwrite people's memories with them.

It probably can't be done but it would be worth researching the limits.
