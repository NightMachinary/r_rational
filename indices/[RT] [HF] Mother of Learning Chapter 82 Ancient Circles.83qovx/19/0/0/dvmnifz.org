Also to the other commenter, true, there shouldn't be any surprise. But that doesn't mean there wouldn't be any. QI is special because he is the holder of the crown on top of the receiver of divine blessing. Exacerbated by possessing grazing, if not intimate, knowledge of divine artifacts. Paranoid Zorian should be cautious in the face of several new things. Rationally, he should wait to loop began anew before attempting to trade Imperial artifact.

It's just a hunch from a reader perspective. Stemmed from 1st arch ending where Zorian had been very calm witnessing his spidery ally got massacred. It has left a deep impression in me so that anything suspiciously related to time loop warrant extra attention.
