This is a very nice catch, but I would expect imprisoned primordial to be much more powerful that his worm. Location/color matches somewhat. But:

Zach wouldn't be able to hold down primordial. This sand worm should have god blessing (like hydra in orb). It is far too weak for primordial. Gives enough challenge for Zachs simulacrum. Responds to calls for assistance (like hydra does to drake chameleons).

It is possible that we would see some more god-bless guardian animals with ties to other divine artifacts ( if they are not killed yet ).
