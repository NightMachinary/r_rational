soul magic is not any more difficult then any other type of magic, so there's nothing "high" about soul magic, the reason why it's "rare" is that the church activly discourage people from it's use. it does require you to gain soul sight though if you want to do any significant with it since it is hard to aim for something you can't see.

mind magic is more difficult since it require very fine manipulation, and for people that are not psychics it's like trying to operate with a blindfold. you can do it but you're way more likely to cause lasting harm.
