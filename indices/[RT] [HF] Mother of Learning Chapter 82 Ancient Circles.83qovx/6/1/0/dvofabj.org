Fair enough re how hard it is. However, the problem of access still remains. Where did they learn soul magic from? How did they trade for that information? Or have they been practicing soul magic since forever?

if you try to harvest the soul crysantheum for example, you'll die pretty quickly.

Also, author mentioned that blood magic is simple, if bloody. Nothing like that for soul magic - it took Zorian a significant amount of restarts to get even the basics of soul defence from Alanic.
