When did it say this? I remember the spider's memory packet was huge, but that could be because of all the crazy mind things she was doing. Remember, this spider was using some kind of parallel processing to receive the inputs of ALL the spiders in her colony at the same time. That one memory packet of hers probably contains the memories of the ENTIRE colony.
