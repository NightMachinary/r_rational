check the worldbuilding site. there was a question about this particular memory packet and the author answered that matriarch packed the packet in a way which would be easy to read for Zorian. His own skills were pretty irrelevant:

He would have definitely had a much poorer grasp on her capabilities, and may have even failed to grasp any of her other thoughts at all. But that wasn't what nimelennar asked. He asked if he would he have understood any less of the message the matriarch left for him if he opened the package sooner, and the answer is no... because the matriarch specifically wanted him to hear that message and made sure it was in the form that was understandable to his mind.:
