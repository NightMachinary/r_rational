He wouldn't need to store them in the orb, he maintains memory packets in his mind across the reset - e.g. the matriarch's. They're also, as far as I can tell, not physical things, so there wouldn't really be anything to store in the orb. The only issue would be if they're really big he might be unable to fit more than a few in. Maybe just go with storing a memory patch?
