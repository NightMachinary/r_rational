regarding study of divine blessing - I'm pretty sure neither Zach nor Zorian are proficient enough in soul magic to study reflection of divine magic on soul. QI was bragging (and he had enough proficiency to brag enough) about how few mages are able to study them.

3). The sacrifice thing is not that far fetched. While simulacrums wouldn't do what the originals won't, both Zach and Zorian (especially Zach) are OK with sacrifice since they are in time loop and it bears little harm. Zorian is less keen to die, but they are kinda immortal, so sacrifice could work for them.

4-5). As for further strategies - the sulrothum empire has some very interesting things, but most likely they will be postponed for post-loop period. They will have to interact with them a lot until they learn the high priest location, but I'm not sure if there is a way to unearth the method for wards/mental defenses of the sand worm. There's always kindnap/mindrape thing, but it won't work out as well as it work for aranea (due to distributed nature of their colonies and smaller self-sustaining communities to kill). The sulrothums live in the single place and it is too large to conveniently incapacitate/interrogate them. But if they find out the high priest location for ring, if they manage to disable the priest without raising a lot of fuzz, I don't see any reason Zorian wouldn't scry his mind for any useful knowledge

The point about stirring up the situation sounded very interesting to me as well. There's immortal eleven we didn't hear about yet. There should be many more old powerful secluded geezers duo hadn't met yet.
