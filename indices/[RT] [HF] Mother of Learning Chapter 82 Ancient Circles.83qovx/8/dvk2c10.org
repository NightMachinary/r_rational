1) I really like that nobody103 is reading this reddit and corrects the possible flaws we find in each chapter. Like explaining QI's attitude (he acted a lot like a teenager in last chapter), or how to exploit his knowledge. Z&Z would probably do it the same way anyway, but they explicitly talk about those issues now, so everyone knows they're aware of them.

2) I'm kinda disappointed Zorian wasn't studying Zach's blessing as the very first thing after the previous chapter. That's exactly what I would expect him to do - if he could somehow cast even very weak copy of the blessing, it would still be a low hanging fruit for him - it would magnify all his powers. Maybe it's only 'cast-once' enhancement (blood magic?), so he has to train very hard to be able to do it well? Still weird that he wasn't even interested in it this chapter, though ...

3) I do find the fight a bit disappointing, too. We were used to having detailed descriptions of fights (invasions, fight against QI, god-touched hydra, even last time on the airship - where we only see the simulacrum on one airship fighting), but now we just learn that the simulacrum teams sacrifice themselves / outright die. I understand that having free clones of main characters makes the clones expendable, but it still seems weird in-universe - it would make sense if they had some sort of agreed upon limits to what mana they can use, but nothing is said in the chapter.

4) Looking forward to how they change the attack at the Ziggurat in the next loop. They should be able to get more support - I really thought 20 mages is not that much, considering how many they had previously (I know - different fights, different continent - but still!). It's again not explicitly said, but I expect that they have to move quickly before some sulrothum reinforcements arrive. So they cannot just wait and kill all the sulrothum that come outside - and then go inside with all the resources they have. They still should try to loot everything there is in the Ziggurat, though - but that would most likely require them to kill every sulrothum around ...

5) We learned two new things that Zorian doesn't really understand now - some subtle wards aroung the Ziggurat and some sulrothum mind defenses (that he's obviously able to overcome, but it costs him a lot of mana). The wards can be either broken -> the strategy for getting the ring remains the same (attack group for distraction + infiltration group for getting the ring), or maybe it's not wards but some innate ability of sulrothum - which would require change in strategy (see 4) - maybe one frontal all-in assault? ). The mind defense could be a bit more tricky - but Zorian loves exotic spells / shaping exercises, right?

6) Another option I can think of - they've already been inside the Ziggurat and there obviously aren't any anti-teleportation wards -> next restart they can just teleport inside, open portal and attack from the inside. With distraction from outside or without. I still think the high priest will have some interesting loot on him (beside the artifact ring).

  Zorian did find it kind of interesting how many otherwise obscure groups and individuals were roused into action as a result of their theft, though. Perhaps it would be a good idea to stir up some similarly great outrage back in Altazia, just to see if something particularly interesting would show itself in its wake...

Attack on the royal tresury, getting all the interesting stuff (books, artifacts, basically anything useful) and running away should do the trick. (Although it says 'stir up outrage Altazia', which is continent containing splinter states, not Eldemar). Maybe they're gonna stir up outrage in every splinter state, to find all the interesting parties?

  "Yes, but I had another idea about that," Zorian said. "What if... we recruited his help in breaking into the Eldemar's royal vault?"

Ou yeeeeah!
