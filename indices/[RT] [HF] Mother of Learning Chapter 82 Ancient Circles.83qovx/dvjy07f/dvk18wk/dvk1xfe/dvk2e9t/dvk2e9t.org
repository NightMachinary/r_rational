We've often seen situations where Zach would be much better suited to massive mana reserves. The fight with the hydra, this fight. We've seen other fights where others could better use it- Xvim ran out of mana, and generally served as an effective trump against the Lich. We've not so often seen Zorian run out of mana because he's so precise with his mana usage now and doesn't tend to use it in a flashy way.

I'd imagine the crown would work well passed from person to person depending on the situation.

Mana regeneration generally scales with your reserves as well, so if that applies to the crown as well Zach may be able to do some utterly absurd things, like power a time stop. We can see.
