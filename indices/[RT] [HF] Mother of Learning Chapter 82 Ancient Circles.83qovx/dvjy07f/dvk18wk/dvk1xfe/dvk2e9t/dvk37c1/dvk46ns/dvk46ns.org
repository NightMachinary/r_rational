Yes, so Zorian's combat style is well optimized for him having low reserves, and he has techniques and skills centered around that. Zach's style is optimized around him burning huge amounts of mana. As such, an artifact that lets him burn even more mana would make him a lot more effective. He can be much more wild and unsustainable, repeatedly casting massive spells that would before drain his huge reserves.

  Unless the crown can store multiple people's Mana, it wouldn't. Mana is attuned to a single person and can't be used by someone else with any ease. There was a world building post that mentioned this I think.

The crown seems to act as a battery for a person's personal mana. We don't know if it also enhances their mana regeneration powers, but generally, if you have a larger personal mana reserve, you can draw power up faster.
