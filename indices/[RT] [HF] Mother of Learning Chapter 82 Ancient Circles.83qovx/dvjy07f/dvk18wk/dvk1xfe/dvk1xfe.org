Even with that, I think the marginal benefit of giving mana-monster Zach an additional flat bonus is less than the benefit of giving mana-starved Zorian the ability to store huge amounts of mana. Zach can already cast just about any spell he comes across, and the crown gives him the ability to cast more of those. For Zorian, it is either impossible or extremely impractical for him to cast some spells that he certainly knows but hasn't practiced extensively.

Put in other words, giving the Mana storage to Zach gives him a quantitative improvement, and Zorian a qualitative and quantitative improvement, even if the quantitative improvement isn't as large as it could be due to lack of practice.
