it's interesting in theory but in practice, i don't think it really matters. sure they may have it for a loop or two but they'll only have it for a little bit of time because it will be the last object they get before exiting the loop at which point they won't have it anymore. without the fallback of the loop, i don't see the point of risking their lives just to get the crown back from QI.
