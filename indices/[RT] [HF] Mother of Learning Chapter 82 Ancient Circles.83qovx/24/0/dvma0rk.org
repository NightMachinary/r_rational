The third arc will end when Z&Z escape time loop. There might be the short forth arc about what happens after they exit, author kinda promised that. For now author wants to finish up the story he designed.

As for being king - you don't just become king. It's not a president stuff where one can be elected. For Zach to become a king he would need to slaughter all the royal family and proclaim himself royalty. Not happening.

They are going to live (at least plan to) happily ever after.
