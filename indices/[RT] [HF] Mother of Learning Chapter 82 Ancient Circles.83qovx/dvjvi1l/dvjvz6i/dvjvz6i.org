They have to collect every artifact in a single restart in order to unbar the gate. They've simply gotten good enough at getting the orb that it's not mentioned in the story. They're not going for every artifact at once because they want to spend the time to optimize getting each artifact individually before trying to do everything at once. Also, if the artifacts give some extremely useful ability aside from the time loop related one, it could make getting the other artifacts easier, so it makes sense to get really good at obtaining each individual artifact and understanding it before putting huge resources into going for the others. For example, I imagine the crown would make getting the dagger much easier because depending on whether it gives flat or percentage Mana storage, Zach could have even more mana or Zorian could have nearly as much as Zach does now.
