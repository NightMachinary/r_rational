I don't understand. If the crown stores a fixed amount, then Zorian becomes strictly stronger. He would become no more dependent on the crown than he is currently. If he manages to completely deplete the crown, then he declines in combat ability... down to where he is right now. The only question is whether it gives a bigger advantage for Zach or for Zorian.
