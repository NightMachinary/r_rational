What about accessing the Bakora Gate network?

We know that there's /some/ kind of proper way to do it, and being able to travel around the world would be very handy for a Controller. And the "Gate spirit" has some kind of involvement with soul magic, but doesn't respond to normal attempts to contact it.

Also, the orb had a helpful-but-not-critical loop management power. What if one of the others follows that trend and allows the Controller to access the Gate/Guardian remotely?
