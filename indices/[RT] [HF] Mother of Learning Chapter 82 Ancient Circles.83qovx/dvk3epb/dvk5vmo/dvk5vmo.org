Nope, none so far. I'm guessing a ring is kinda an access card though, kind of like the calling rings in Kingkiller Chronicles (Patrick Rothfuss). Maybe I'm wrong but that feels intuitively right to me. As for its purpose in the time loop, it could be access to the maker? I'm reaching here.

Orb = info storage Dagger = Template change Crown = Soul Markers (esp since QI was the one that put Zorian in the loop) Staff = Rare magics? I got no clue? Ring = Access card into maker and other information?

Just like the Orb, Dagger, and Crown serve important (but basic!) cases in the loop, the staff and ring should have something similar going on.
