It is unknown if the Controller strictly /needs/ the artifacts to place temporary markers on or soulkill others. It is possible that those functions are embedded in the Controller Marker itself, and RR gained access to them when he Jailbroke his marker. Zach has limited Soul Sight and Zorian's marker is broken so they don't know that.

Given what we know though, it is likely that RR had some access to the Eldemar treasury and RR somehow managed to barter QI for temporary access to the Crown.
