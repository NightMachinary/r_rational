Going by the theory that RR got into the loop by studying/changing a temporary marker, and that the marker is granted by one of the artifacts, then someone in Altazia must have gotten their hands on an artifact aside from the orb. Since the ring and staff are much harder to stumble on than the crown, and the dagger is more conceptually linked to removing people from the loop, the crown is the most likely choice.

Also, crowns mark a person as important. That links it conceptually to temporary markers.

None of the above is definite, but I would put money on it being the crown.
