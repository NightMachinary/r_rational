So far we know only two "base" abilities of two Keys: mana battery and portable pocket dimension. The first one is a straight up mage upgrade, but the second one is more mundane in function (though is still a marvel of divine level magick crafting). I woud guess 50/50 on the Staff (or any other unobtained Key) having some advanced magic ability.

Shaping of mana is a soul function, we have no examples of shaping being enhanced in the story (only meticulous training). We'll see if the MoL Gods have something to remedy that.
