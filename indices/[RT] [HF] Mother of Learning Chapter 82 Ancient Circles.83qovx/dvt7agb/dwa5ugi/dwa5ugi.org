The Many Deaths of Harry Potter (it's fanfiction, but good fanfiction). Premise: whenever he dies, he resets).

Also, try The Wastelands of Time (and its sequel: The Heartlands of Time). It's again a Harry Potter fanfiction, but here he also starts every month again. A small problem is that the story drops him right in at the end (where he knows the time loop is going to finish soon), so you don't get to see his growth. However, he does exploit his knowledge greatly. I prefer this one to the one mentioned above.
