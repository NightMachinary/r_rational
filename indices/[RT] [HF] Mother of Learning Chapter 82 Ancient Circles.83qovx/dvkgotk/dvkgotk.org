so what's next? they got away with ring, so now they will fly the ship to blantyrre - trying to find some gates and start combing the continent for staff . They will be using the ship until they locate staff (without the ship ti is too large task to perform it on feet) and it may be too hard/impossible to hire anyone to find out/narrow down location of the staff.

This cycle they had some issues with ship stealing/warding scheme so they had to fight the pursuit team. the next restart they will be able getaway perfectly and fly to Blantyrre straight away to find the staff. And I won't be surprised that Neolu will be key to identifying the staff location. They will be bringing Neolu to another continent (why not bring the adventurous girl) and due to her divination bloodline she might narrow the location.
