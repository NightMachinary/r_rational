I'm not sure treasury is the best target. It does attract aggro from forces with close ties to royal family. In previous attempt duo didn't use gate spell/simulacrums to get away, so the next time there will be a lot more fuzz/investigations.

Now if they would attack royal treasury and then would be seen away running away with stolen airship - this would raise enough eyebrows.

Another target would be attack on infrastructure like trains. Something Eldemar is proud of. The whole nation. But I can't recall any object which would qualify.
