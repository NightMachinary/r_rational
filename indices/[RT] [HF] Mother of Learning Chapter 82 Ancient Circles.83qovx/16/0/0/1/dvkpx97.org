If the crown grants temporary loop markers, just give one to a royal or someone with access to the royal vault. After they see the invasion for themselves and learn that ZZ can stop it but need the dagger from the vault, they can just remove it from the vault without triggering all the wards and deliver it to ZZ at the beginning of the next few loops. No need to breach the vault at all, just bypass all those wards instead.

Of course getting the crown is another matter.
