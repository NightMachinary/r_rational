  For example, I imagine the crown would make getting the dagger much easier (...)

If you mean the ring, then I agree. It means being able to fight for longer time. But the dagger is in the royal vault, and last time they tried it, the problem was their (lack of good) ward breaking/divination spells, I don't really think mana would help with that.

  depending on whether it gives flat or percentage Mana storage, Zach could have even more mana or Zorian could have nearly as much as Zach does now.
#+end_quote

From what we know, Zach and QI have the same base mana, so either way Zach would get 10x mana from wearing the crown (just the mana, not mana regeneration).

If the crown mana storage is flat, it would hold ~2250 magic missiles (QI has ~250 without crown, with crown it's 10 times larger). Last intel we have on Zorian (before he was casting invisible missiles) is being able to cast 35 magic missiles.

So if the bonus is flat, Zorian would get +2250, which means ((2250+35)/35) = ~65 times as much max mana as he has now. If the bonus is percentage, Zorian will get +315 max mana (10 times as much as he has now).

(Of course all of these numbers are based on magic missiles that Zorian can (probably) cast better than either QI or Zach.)

One thing the crown doesn't change is mana regeneration rate, so it 'only' helps at the first part of the battle, if the battle's too long, the crown's usefulness disappears.

btw If they manage to get the crown reliably + early in each restart + decide to give it to Zorian, maybe he should start learning different spells - right now, even though he knows the more expensive spells, he is more focused on cheaper spells => trained them more == has better efficiency in them. He mentioned many times through the story that he doesn't care about the more expensive spells.
