Giving the crown to Zorian would be a waste, regardless whether the bonus is flat or multiplicative. If it's multiplicative then the crown's efficiency is gimped. If it is flat, he becomes overly dependent on the crown and also becomes a loaded gun. Once the reserve is spent, he suffers an abrupt decline in power until he has multiple hours of rest.
