  If you mean the ring, then I agree. It means being able to fight for longer time. But the dagger is in the royal vault, and last time they tried it, the problem was their (lack of good) ward breaking/divination spells, I don't really think mana would help with that.

No, I mean the crown. Yes, Zorian isn't going to suddenly be able to batter down the vault doors, but it will almost certainly devolve to a fight at some point, and more Mana will help with that.

I mean, yes, the extra Mana will probably help with the dagger the least of the artifacts, but we don't know anything about the defences around the staff, the orb is apparently almost trivial to get now, and the crown obviously can't help getting the crown. I suppose the crown helps with getting the ring if they choose to follow the same method of getting it again, but I think the difference in skill/difficulty between getting the ring at all and getting it easily is less than not getting it and barely getting it. Also I wasn't thinking of that example, which is honestly the much bigger factor.

  One thing the crown doesn't change is mana regeneration rate, so it 'only' helps at the first part of the battle, if the battle's too long, the crown's usefulness disappears.

Thank you for the math.

It would have to be a rather long battle for Zorian to spend 65 times his normal base, even if gets more wasteful as a result of his Max storage being higher.

It would also take a looong time for Zorian to fill up the crown. I think that a normal mage can go from nothing to full in about half an hour, provided there's sufficient ambient Mana? ~33 hours of continuous Mana generation, and that's only if he spends none of his Mana. He'd also have to take time for sleep.
