Given that he loop has a fixed starting point and the thief took the Staff all the way to Blantyre (the hardest to reach continent), I'm starting to think that the staff has some kind of advanced travel spell/ability.

Maybe it can open a portal to a Bakora Gate from any location or something like that. Fast travel would be undoubtedly useful in the time loop.
