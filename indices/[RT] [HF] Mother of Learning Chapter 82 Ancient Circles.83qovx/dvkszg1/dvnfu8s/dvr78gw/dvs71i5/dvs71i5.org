Nice idea, but...wouldn't that mean that the original Golden-Feathered Worm had been killed relatively recently? And wouldn't that have been major news?

I mean, /this/ worm can't really be the one that had a cult following, because they worshipped something that was apparently imprisoned and this worm was free.
