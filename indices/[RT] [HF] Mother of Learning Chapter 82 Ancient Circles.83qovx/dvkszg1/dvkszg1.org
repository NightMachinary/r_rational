Chapter 77

#+begin_quote
  The chapter in question described a small cult of mages, '*somewhere in Xlotic*', which worshipped an entity imprisoned behind some kind of 'dimensional veil'. ... After repeating this process gods know how many times, the cultists eventually assembled a fair amount of information about this entity, which the cultists called 'the *Golden-Feathered Worm*'. To Zorian's eyes, it appeared clear that this Golden-Feathered Worm was actually an imprisoned primordial, even if the book never actually identified it as such.

  He had barely finished speaking when the sandworm suddenly shook, almost like a dog trying to dry itself off, and a serious of translucent, glowing, yellow wings grew out of its sides. They were long and paper-thin, reminiscent of dragonfly wings, and looked comically inappropriate for lifting a creature like that into the air... but as the creature's many *golden wings* started slowly undulating like oars on a boat, the sandworm slowly lifted itself into the sky and then reoriented itself towards them.
