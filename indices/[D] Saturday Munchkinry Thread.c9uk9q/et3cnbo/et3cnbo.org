Let's say you're a nice, powerful vampire in the Present Day. You've got money, you've got physical strength, and you've got a bunch of powerful vampire allies (and powerful vampire enemies).

Task: You've decided it's time for vampires to Come Out Of The Coffin (i.e. become known to the world) as the Masquerade is not going to survive much longer, but you want to use it to your advantage - and you want Fame and Respect.

Do you use your influence to tell the humans that your enemies are "evil vampires" and they should be torched? Do you become The Vampire and go around the talk show circuit? Demand vampires be given voting rights and then become the Leader of your Human Country?
