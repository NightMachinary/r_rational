I think I'd wish for vastly enhanced speed and reflexes.

--------------

There are two ways to avoid my falling rocks; tank it, or dodge it. Spending a second wish on either durability or speed will allow anyone to do so with ease.

Spending /my/ second wish /entirely/ on speed means I get to keep up with them if they do the same; in effect, it's then out First Wishes against each other. On the other hand, if they didn't spend their entire Second Wish on speed, then I am now able to run circles around them, dodging their attack and possibly even turning it back on them (if they have some defense against my Falling Rocks).

In order to attack me, then, they'd first need to break through my cover and then hit me - which is possible, for someone who (say) spent their First Wish on a lightsaber and their Second Wish on speed like we did - but all in all, I think that a strong defensive wish like this is the best option.

(Third Wish should be a weapon of some sort again. Fourth Wish maybe an accelerated healing factor?)
