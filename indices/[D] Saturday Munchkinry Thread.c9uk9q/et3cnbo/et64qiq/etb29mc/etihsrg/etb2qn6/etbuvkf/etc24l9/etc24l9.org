*Brainstorming*

- So the falling rocks will kill anybody without enhanced durability or a mobility/evasive power. So I think she wants a good hax power to designed to counter that next.

- The metal dome seams pretty good defensively to the point I feel it would be worth more to invest into an attacking wish next rarther than defencive. Unfortunately the metal dome gets in the way of that so something that can bypass solid objects is needed.

- It will be best to try and tie the power of wishes to some trait or attribute that can be increased in the future. Physical strength or reaction times might be good.

- She should test if you can use a time travle wish to send infomation about the next fight before she had made the wish. For example: Wish that upon your the end of the next fight a message describing exactly what happened up to that point is send back in time to before you made the wish. That way you can scout out the enemys without having to pay for a wish.

*Wish Ideas*

- [Mind Control Aura Punch]: You can convert the kinetic energy of an attack to fire off a spherical aura that can pass though solid objects and mind controls anyone but you who enters it. The more Kinetic energy used for the abilty the largers the radius of aura /or/ the faster the aura travels away from you. So you could turn a punch into: a 2m wide aura that moved at a snail's pace, a 1m wide aura that moved at a human sprint or a 0.01m aura that moved with the speed of an arrow.

- [Time Twin]: Felicity can travel back in time to anywhere within Xm of her pasts selfs location with the limit there can only be Y alive Felicity's at any one time. Where X = the distance she could sprint in a second at the time she uses the ability and Y = the largest number you can make it while still being a valid wish. To be truly effective Felicity's will need to be willing to kill themseves for the group but even with out that it's still useful. (Edit: or just make it that future Felicity's obey past Felicity's) Can be combind with a strength stealing wish later down the line for exponential physical power growth.
