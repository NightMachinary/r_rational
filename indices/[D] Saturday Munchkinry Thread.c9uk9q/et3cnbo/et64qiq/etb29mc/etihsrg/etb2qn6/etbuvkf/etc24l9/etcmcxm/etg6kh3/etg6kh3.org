one idea is wishing for a library full of useful information about the rules with a closed room made of metal and full of hallucinogen gas around wherever the other contestant is.\\
another is a fortress full of traps that can kill or disable the opponent and either poisonous gas or something that can disable the opponent, with herself and the cover at the center.

Or she can wish for a magical decoy/ servant that looks like her and has as many skills and physical ability that she can get away with wishing, can act independently and causes all wishes and magical abilities other contestants make that reference you to target it instead.

try whishing multiple things with ands first .and if that doesn't work try tying both of them to a single concept.
