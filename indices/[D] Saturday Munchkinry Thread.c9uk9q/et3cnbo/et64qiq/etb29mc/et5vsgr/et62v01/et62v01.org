Super messed up but the first thing that came to mind was giving abortifacients to pregnant women at various stages to find out definitely at what point a fetus is alive enough to then become dead.

Does it only work on humans? If it works on insects you could probably be a great pest exterminator. I bet it'd be great use for an ecologist, too, studying lifecycles and whatnot.

Depending on the distance you could use it to find old tombs and subsequent treasure. Or the opposite, burial plots that don't have bodies but should.

You could be an advisor to families debating whether or not to pull the plug on a beloved family member -- no, they are not going to wake up, sorry.

I don't know how useful it would be, but you could convey information. First, look at 10 dead people, say. Second, have someone else line up the bodies that you've seen in a certain order with bodies you haven't seen. The gaps in your sight give information. Can you sense/see the light through a camera or TV?
