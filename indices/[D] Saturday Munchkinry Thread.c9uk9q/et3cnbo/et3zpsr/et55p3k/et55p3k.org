    Demand vampires be given voting rights

  Not unless they have been removed first, I would make sure that even suggesting taking our rights away is considered discrimination similar to taking away the rights of people because of their race or sexuality.

"I was born a human; I remain a human despite the accidents of my condition. I did not die; I was reborn, much as any Christian is reborn in his baptism. I am as loyal to my country as any American; indeed, I am more loyal to it because of the protections it offers me that other countries do not. No court has stripped me of my right to vote; I have committed no crimes. I have lived in my house and paid my taxes and registered my car. There is no ground to say that I may not vote."

Appeal to the rule of law, to the principles of the country in which you inhabit.

"Epidemiologists may wish to model my condition as if it were a disease, but they want to model gun violence and memes as if those were diseases, too."

Don't allow the implication that the vampiric condition is a scary disease. It's just a thing that happened to you.
