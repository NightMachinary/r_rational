  You should read Contratto by Alexander Wales/cthulhuraejepsen. There a similar situation is adressed
#+end_quote

oooh, I read that back in the day, but it's been years! Thank you.

  Thats where its important to have religious figures on your side.
#+end_quote

You're right, religious endorsement would be a very important part of the whole deal, especially because the existance of vampires makes religions suddenly seem more plausible what with proof of the supernatural happening and all that.

  But if they did I would make its limitations public(or make some up) so people have something they can do to feel safe
#+end_quote

I was imagining this as being True Blood without the perfect blood substitutes, and in True Blood wearing sunglasses protects you from Glamour, so emphasising that would be the obvious thing to do.

  And even if I just started to make a lot of stuff up who could refute me, like I could claim to have fought in many historical wars, to have dined with kings we know little about, or even to have witnessed events like the crucifixion.

A truthful account sounds like a great idea: if you lied I think you'd run into the same problem that people who remember past lives and are kings, consorts, met Van Gough, etc run into: people would wonder how you managed to interact with so many famous humans. And if you tried to claim historical presence in a place you weren't, you might end up accidentally fucking up your historical accuracy and modern historians could counteract you (yeah, okay, maybe modern historian of religion can't attest to exactly what the minitae of a particular church you were in believed; but if you mention a particular type of plough centuries before it was invented).

All in all, though, sounds like you've got things covered; though I notice you've went more to fame and power than Respect. (Giving respected people immortality is probably going to help on the Respect front, though!)
