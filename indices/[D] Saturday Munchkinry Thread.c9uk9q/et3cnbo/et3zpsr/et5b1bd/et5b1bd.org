Some of it depends on how many crimes vampires are responsible for. If a thousand cold cases are suddenly explained by the existence of vampires, then vampires have a real problem on their hands from a PR perspective. You can present as basically being a human with a "disease" of some kind all you want, but as soon as the first tearful family comes forward crying about their innocent teenage daughter that was snatched up from the streets and found three days later drained of blood ... well, that's not going to get public support, that's going to get harsh "we must do something" laws put into place, suspicion from everyone (especially given the secrecy), and deep investigation that might not be so great for these vampires, /especially/ given how many laws they must be breaking by their mere existence (even if they're getting their blood from ethical and legal sources, they almost certainly have to hide their identities in some way, which means fraud, forgery, tax evasion, etc. unless things are done /extremely/ carefully, and even then, it might literally not be possible).

I think all of the above is true for the two principle issues, which are 1) immortals and 2) drinking blood. Anything that makes the vampire stronger makes it harder for them to come into the light, so to speak, even if it's not something that makes vampirekind appreciably stronger in aggregate. For example, immunity to anything but silver would require armed forces and vampire hunters to tip their bullets in silver, which doesn't make vampire extermination all that much harder, but the immunity makes vampires much more threatening to the average person, which helps to tip the zeitgeist in favor of vampire capture, restriction, tracking, or extermination. Contrarily, easy-to-exploit weaknesses like requiring an invitation, damage from sunlight, inability to cross running water, etc. make vampires less threatening, which is a good thing from the perspective of bringing vampires out into the world.

And then we get to mind control, which (depending on the specifics) is a bigger deal than anything else combined. Even relatively short-term mind control, on the order of minutes, means that chains of command have to be reconfigured, new protocols need to be put into place, and at best there will be rampant paranoia about vampires taking control (plus a bunch of false 'vampires made me do it' reports). Superstrength can be handled with existing laws, or with pretty easy grafts onto existing laws. Mind control? Not so much. It's hard to know how the powers that be would react to the introduction of mind control, but I think "not well" is probably underselling it, and some kind of draconian response would be expected, even if it stopped short of considering every vampire a criminal.

So, to strategy:

Having highly respected vampires would be a boon, and depending on transmission rules, would be pretty doable. Full, informed consent would be important. Better still would be to have existing immortal vampires who are highly respected, but if the "no daylight" rules are strict, that might not be possible (here, I'm thinking "noted reclusive author of the acclaimed series of children's historical adventures comes out as vampire"). If you /personally/ can be one of them, especially one with clean hands, then you're well-positioned to +be a Benedict Arnold to vampirekind+ take advantage of the coming out.

Attacking other vampires as "evil" while coming out? I can see it, but it would take a lot of care, since it both sets bad precedent, and it raises a lot of instant trust issues, even/especially if you're claiming to be one of the good guys. Ideally you have proof of some kind, and ideally the evil guys /don't/ have proof. Might raise some "why now" questions, especially if you've been sitting on that proof for decades or centuries.

Making demands sours things, depending on what those demands are. Angling for all the same rights that everyone else has is probably not that much of a stretch (again, depending on how many people vampires have murdered in the past), but it's really a matter how people, governments, media, and corporations deal with all the new stuff, like the blood drinking, immortality, and other stuff. A state might pass a law making it illegal to drink human blood, which would effectively kill vampires, or force them out of the state (I have no idea whether this is true elsewhere in the world), which would then get an injunction or not and kicked up to a superior court. Vampires might have to register as living weapons, if they're strong enough, or even if they're not strong enough and public perception is against them. "Continuing to go about with their lives" is the bar I think vampires would be most concerned with clearing.
