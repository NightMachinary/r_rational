This is kind of the problem of reality vs fiction. Figurative vampires /do/ already rule the world (hence why it's a cliched metaphor). If there were a masquerade, what changes if it's blown, really?

As long as the people in the empire are fed somewhat, and the slaves in the vassal states weak, why would they care if a couple people they don't know get eaten/enslaved every now and then? They don't care now, so except for a powerless fringe minority that's fantastically racist against super sexy vampires, nothing would be different.

Fantasy and reality do not mix well; reality always imposes itself and disappoints. (One of the saddest days on the internet was when I discovered that hurling the Earth into the Sun is less efficient than hurling it into Jupiter.)

Anyway, our vampire overlords trick us into thinking they're not real by all the wacky media they put out there. You think vampires have superpowers, are allergic to silver+sunshine+right angles+wood+garlic, and glitter? Ha, of course not.

They're completely indistinguishable from ordinary humans - philosophical zombies, you can call them. Where did they come from? I don't know. A parallel dimension, or simply a way to save on computing cycles for the computer simulation we're living in. Or nearly anything else. Who can say.
