You win at every game of hide-and-seek ever.

You also make a great detective; with the help of a lot of simple disguises, you can more-or-less follow someone anywhere indefinitely without them noticing (as long as they spot one of your disguises once every half-hour or so, which seems not hard to arrange in most cases).
