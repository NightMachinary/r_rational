  You can present as basically being a human with a "disease" of some kind all you want, but as soon as the first tearful family comes forward crying about their innocent teenage daughter that was snatched up from the streets and found three days later drained of blood ...

Oh wow, yes. All of a sudden all the cold cases came up! Putting myself in the vampire shoes as an Ethical Vampire, I'd... probably be proposing the vampires be put on trial and sentenced for their crimes, with the proviso that a life sentence is cruel and unusual punishment for a vampire. This puts a huge number of vampires on ~500 year sentences though in prisons that can't technically hold them anyway. If vampires literally existed I'd imagine the public would want to put them to death, even in civilised countries where it's not an allowable punishment for any crime.

  Even relatively short-term mind control, on the order of minutes, means that chains of command have to be reconfigured, new protocols need to be put into place, and at best there will be rampant paranoia about vampires taking control (plus a bunch of false 'vampires made me do it' reports).

Oh geez. Can you imagine? The military, the government, would all need to be reconfigured. Even if we give them the sunglasses clause like True Blood, it's... messy.

Ohhhh, you have given me a plot bunny. Thank you. There's obviously vampires out there who see the writing on the wall (or perhaps are just Good People), who are slowly but surely coming up with a respected persona to come out the best when the humans find out. I'm imagining one of those father-son writing dynasties - like Dune but high quality throughout - being revealed to be one such vampire.

  "Continuing to go about with their lives" is the bar I think vampires would be most concerned with clearing.

Yeah, I think with vampires coming out of the coffin, their two options are trying for world domination (easiest way: convert all of humanity in one night, except for a few "herds") or trying for "not being exterminated". The latter would have to be planned, multi-pronged, and probably depend on converting a good deal of billionaires.

I tried to make the setup True Blood rather than My Vampires, but I can't help but think about it in those terms obviously, and for My Vampires, a vampire can only convert once a century and the success rate is on the order of 50% (and much lower the sicker the human is, so deathbed conversions are virtually impossible) - which isn't going to be great for their reputations if they're trying to get celebrity endorsements since they'd leave a pile of bodies in their wake, and even if those bodies are consenting, it'd be an extremely hard sell.
