This made me realize the immunity is actually huge and you could launch a violent vampiric takeover if needed. The sunlight and invitation only are issues but you can presumably wear a morphsuit or something if needed or have thralls defend you during the day. Door to door combat is a snag, but there are some workarounds with blowing houses up or starving cities out.

The element of surprise if no one leaks your true weaknesses makes basically immortal on the battlefield. Throw some thick steel plates on vampires and you have hellishly fast, bulletproof (the metal plates can be absurdly thick, stopping "low" calibers, while the high calibers pierce all the way through so silver isn't left in you) better than night vision goggles (armies would pay trillions for natural night vision) equipped forces that require no supply lines. Drink the enemy, take their stuff, and tear people apart by hand if needed. They can travel hilariously light, they don't need protection from the elements or to carry food. Just weapons, for efficiency, and a shovel for tunnels/deep trenches to sleep in. (If it's traditional they might have to carry their homeland's soil?) These forces would dominate the field, even when weaknesses are found they're better than special forces from day 1.

Vampires are presumably immune to bioweapons and chemical weapons, so you're free to take and use them on anyone you want. Until the enemy makes garlic bombs they have no equivalent, and looted hazmat gear should keep that out without a problem.

You can definitely seize a continent, if someone can figure out a way to leverage vampire powers to stabilize a tyrannical government (mass glamour?) you should be able to grind down the rest of the world from there with regular armies alongside vampires.
