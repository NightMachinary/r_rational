You should read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255][Contratto]] by Alexander Wales/cthulhuraejepsen. There a similar situation is adressed.But to answer you questions.

#+begin_quote
  Do you use your influence to tell the humans that your enemies are "evil vampires" and they should be torched?
#+end_quote

No, because it wouldn't be wise to present vampires as inhuman enough that such violence and violation of rights is necessary(even if its just enemy vampires). Enemy vampires should still keep their human rights and be treated like radicals and criminals from any kind of group, because once you made people think that different rules apply for vampires, then changing that is going to be hard.

  Do you become The Vampire and go around the talk show circuit?
#+end_quote

No, I would offer vampirism to a bunch of celebrities, politicians, people in influential positions, and most importantly people with religious authority(heads of religions like the Queen or the Pople would be invaluable). People would have no reason to trust me if I were to go public, like sure Id be famous and certainly a curiosity, but there are already a lot of better looking, more well spoken people who are trusted by the public. Like people already take medical advice from people like Oprah and Jenny McCarthy, it would be bad not to make them listen to people they trust talking in favour of us.

  Demand vampires be given voting rights
#+end_quote

Not unless they have been removed first, I would make sure that even suggesting taking our rights away is considered discrimination similar to taking away the rights of people because of their race or sexuality.

#+begin_quote
  then become the Leader of your Human Country?
#+end_quote

No it would look extremely shady if immediately after vampires are exposed, one previously unknown one becomes the leader of a major nation, especially when people find out about the mind control powers. At best one of the trusted turned politicians wins the election, while at the same time remembering that he depends on me for his connection to the rest of the powerful vampires.

In general though, I would have to make sure that Vampires are presented in the most positive light, and make sure that at no point were not considered humans by the law or public opinion. Thats where its important to have religious figures on your side. Because when People just get confirmation that the Supernatural is definitely real, they'll want to know that they're not damming themselves to hell by consorting with demons.

The feeding would be the hardest to explain, but I would hope that we found some sustainable arrangement until now that doesn't require us to have committed mass murder over the years. Artificial blood would be the best case by far, but things like feeding on volunteers, blood donations or animals would do in a pinch, but would definitely lower public relations, and could bring potential problems with the law.

The mind control is going to be a extremely hard sell, like in the best case scenario I would make sure that nobody finds out about it. But if they did I would make its limitations public(or make some up) so people have something they can do to feel safe, and make it look like using this power is already forbidden between vampires and have some law that forbids manipulating the mind of others without consent.

The Enemy vampires shouldn't be to hard to deal with, since I assume that truly Powerful ones would have to be smart enough to realize that countering my efforts would only harm themselves. That vampires are considered monsters to be hunted is just in their interest as well. And the truly despicable ones can be presented as deranged individuals to the public who are not representative of the vampires as a whole, and aid human law enforcement in dealing with them in a hopefully non lethal way.

Ensuring Personal power and fame isn't to hard when you're connected to the most famous people of society. And just writing and releasing a book about your experiences in the past centuries would make you extremely famous, because its the first autobiography of a real vampire it will also have historical value. And even if I just started to make a lot of stuff up who could refute me, like I could claim to have fought in many historical wars, to have dined with kings we know little about, or even to have witnessed events like the crucifixion. My powerful vampire allies would certainly have reasons to support my accounts, and my enemies would do it even if I was telling the truth.
