The single biggest problem with this is the question of "where do vampires come from?"

If vampires are born, either from human birth, or by some process after a human naturally dies (and can no longer consent), then they have a solid bedrock for arguing their moral right to exist. They can't help the fact that they're vampires, and they'd prefer to go on living just as any human would.

If vampires are created, either by existing vampires turning humans, or by humans willingly making pacts with vampire overlords in return for life eternal, then their moral grounding is far more shaky. Vampires created against their wishes might be able to win some sympathy. But vampires who decided they were okay with eating humans if it meant they got to live forever, and vampires who are going around making /more/ maneating monsters, will be looked on very poorly.

Such vampires will find it especially hard to win over religious figures, since what they are doing spits directly in the face of pretty much all major religious doctrine. Any religious figure of any clout will probably reject their offer outright, either out of religious conviction, or the simple fact that it would be a /terrible/ PR move.

And if it's a mix of both, then it doesn't matter if vampires are born against their will. They will be hunted down like all the rest, to stop them creating any willing vampires.
