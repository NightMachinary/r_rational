This is part 2 of the mini battle royale quest [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c7002f/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/esgpnm7/][that started here]]. It's very low effort, there's no voting, and it's intended to be simple fun.

For the opposition for this update I quickly brainstormed 16 opponents' wishes and paired them up randomly. This should hopefully mean I can better simulate the natural path of progression that other people in the story go through.

Next update I might write this ahead of the Saturday post, so I can get this up before the Monday sticky, but we'll see what happens.

“Wait!,” cried Felicity, “don't I get any questions?”

Is a round one-on-one, or some kind of group fight? What even is ‘mundane power' or ‘trivial magic'? Was elimination really... you know?

Only silence rang back from the white expanse. It seems she would have to figure this out alone. Felicity sat down, legs crossed, and focused.

  You are unable to conceive of wishes from whole cloth.
  Oh, stop complaining, originality is hardly in vogue.

The insight struck suddenly and Felicity jerked up in surprise only to nearly have her eye poked out by a paper aeroplane.

The story of her recent life written on the sheet of the plane was one thing (“Well that's one way of putting it on paper.”), but the comments and suggestions below it was what really caught her attention. Some minutes of deliberation later spent mulling over their ideas, she had a course of action.

“I wish for whatever wish would make me most likely to win.” It was a silly wish most likely, but it helped scope out the rules.

  Russell would be disappointed in you, Felicity.
#+end_example

Right, self-reference. Easy enough. “I wish for a wish that---”

#+begin_example
  [[ Rule Violation: New rule, cheating is against the rules. ]]
  This is a test of your wishmaking powers. That's your task, not mine.
#+end_example

The rejections kept intruding in her head as if they were just any other thought. So far they had gone as expected. There was one more that seemed like a no-brainer to try.

“I wish for the atoms in the arena to be rearranged such that my opponents have a cut in their brain that instantly kills them, but leaves me uninjured.”

This time there was a brief pause.

#+end_example

Bah, that /was/ a specific wish. There was no time for this wannabe lawyer malarkey! At least the paper had recommended a fallback,

“I wish that my opponents have particularly damaging cuts in their brains.”

#+begin_example
  [[ Rule Violation: This ain't my first rodeo. ]]
  Leave the fighting for the arena. Don't make me call the sheriff.
#+end_example

Felicity took a deep breath. This was OK, she had expected these to fail. Knowing the rules they broke was the point of trying.

--------------

There were a few options to choose from now. A following suggestion was that perhaps she should ask for an elaborated death trap to attack her opponents on entering the arena. Rocks falling from the sky, or explosives around the area sounded like a safe bet, though the more exotic suggestions seemed too risky. She was also suggested to wish for cover at the same time, which would be a good call, though it risked splitting the wish's power, whatever that was.

The downside is that falling rocks would only be a short-term solution. The paper had emphasized skills that grow and cohere, and the benefits of being able to interrogate the opponent after the match. Stealing powers, becoming smarter, seeing the future. All have the potential for greatness... but she needs to survive the next round. Right now she would lose every time against a martial artist with a knife.

There were suggestions of magical kinetic projectiles and a sprite familiar. A sprite would be lovely, and the kinetic projectiles clever, but the idea of someone just running up to her and stabbing her was hard to avoid thinking about. She needed something concrete and actionable, until such a time that she had leeway for these things.

“Alright,” Felicity spoke again to the luminous nothing that submerged her, “I wish...”

The battlefield was brightly lit, but under her cover Felicity mostly saw darkness with traces of sky behind thick metal bars and glass(?) windows. Her cover was an impressive metal dome---nothing out of the realm of human technology, perhaps not even impressive, but certainly thick and well made. Out the port she saw her opponent, who saw her and immediately threw some sort of---

The window shattered and bars bent in an instant, and Felicity recoiled with shock. A fraction of a second later a second thud hit the cover elsewhere, rebounding and leaving Felicity half deaf. A pit formed at the bottom of her stomach, and she scrambled to figure out a way out.

She heard a dull rumble of her rocks falling from the sky, and stood up to---

The environment faded again to white.

*Anton Matthews defeated!*

Congratulations! The next wish for you to munchkin is ‘ten times the mundane, ten times the magic... well, give or take'. You get to keep your previous wishes, but there's no information about the details. The cover, along with a large pile of rocks, are lying to the side in the white expanse. Felicity's minor scratches from the incident have not healed. The waiting time before the next round is another 30 minutes.
