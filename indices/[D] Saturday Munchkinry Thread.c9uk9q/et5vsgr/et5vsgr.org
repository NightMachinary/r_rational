So I'm thinking about doing something with improving OnionBoy's /Reaper's Creek/. In that book, eventually the main character's power ends up being "edit the coding of the universe" but obviously that's way too OP. The character's power starts out with him being able to sense dead bodies.

So, basically, he can sense where dead bodies are in a sort-of-almost sight way, like it "glows" for him, but he also "senses a coldness" or whatever. Once he sees the dead body, he can no longer sense it and won't see the glow, even if he leaves. Also, it's not mentioned but obviously this has a maximum distance he can sense dead bodies (nothing too extreme or whatever).

A Youtuber that did a review of this book stated that this is the lamest power you could have, and I don't think that's actually true! (See: Worm) Other than finding dead bodies of missing people, being able to tell if someone has died in a house or apartment and telling the authorities so they're not left there for days or weeks, and being able to tell if a birth will be stillborn, what are ways this power can be used?

(Some extra parts of the power not mentioned in the book that I think are important are that if his eyes are closed and he comes across a dead body and then leaves, he'll still be able to see the glow; also, he has to process that he's seen the dead body that the glow is leading him to, so if he has a bad migraine and sees it with his eyes but doesn't process it, he'll still sense the glow. Yes, to be fair, I think he should even, at some point, be able to sense /all/ bodies of dead animals in his area, even if they're corpses of dead mosquitoes. I /also/ think that it should not last forever, since bodies decay, so once it's no longer recognizable as a dead body it won't register.)

What are other potential parts of the power that I or OnionMan may have missed?
