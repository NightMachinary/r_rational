You can mark any human that is directly, physically observing you as your "target". You gain perfect knowledge of your target's location for 1 hour. The time-limit can be reset indefinitely if your target sees you again before the hour is up. If you and your target come within 10 feet of each other, your power is nullified. If your power expires, or is nullified, it cannot be used on anyone again until 24 hours have passed.

What could you do with this power?
