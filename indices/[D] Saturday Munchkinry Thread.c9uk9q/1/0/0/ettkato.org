You may know your target's body position, pose and action, but you wouldn't necessarily know the location of everything around them. You could reasonably infer that they're at their desk, typing on a keyboard, or perhaps typing on a phone's touch-screen. But you wouldn't know the exact position of the keyboard in either case, making it hard to infer what they're actually typing.

You also wouldn't know what was on the screen at any given time, making it hard to tell what they're even doing while typing. So even if you could tell what they were typing, and they happened to log on to a site within the 1-hour timeframe (and didn't just have themselves set up to login automatically), you would have no intrinsic knowledge of what site or application they signed into. Knowing what they're typing wouldn't necessarily help there, as they might have navigated to the site or app using their mouse or fingers, and since you can't see the screen...

All that said, a far better way to rob people would be ATMs. Just hang around one in public, and wait for someone to walk up to use it. So long as they see you, you can mark them as your target, and then spy on their bank PIN as they enter it. This would be much easier to guess on the larger, simpler keyboards of an ATM, than on a desktop or phone keyboard.

Once you know their bank PIN, it would be relatively easy to trail them on foot for an hour, and wait for a time when they leave their wallet unattended. Then you can just stroll over, steal it without them noticing (because you know where they are at all times) and then go and empty their bank account. It might take a few tries before you get the perfect opportunity, but the payoff would easily be worth a few wasted days.
