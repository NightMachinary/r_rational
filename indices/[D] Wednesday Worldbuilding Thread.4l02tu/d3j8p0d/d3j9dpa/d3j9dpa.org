Go look at what gaps are left.

Vampires drink blood, werewolves eat flesh. What sort of creature consumes bones? What sort slurps up the nervous system like spaghetti? Is there an undead of entrails?

Zombies are whole corpse reanimation, while skeletons are just the core. You can invert that though, to create a lovingly deboned undead which flops around as just a creature of muscle.

Alternately, you might want to look at emotional resonance. If vampires are lust and werewolves are rage, then what would an undead of greed look like? What about an undead of depression, envy, sloth, etc.?
