I've been kind of tossing around the idea of writing -- and this would be my first foray into writing since I was like 12 -- an Undertale/The World Ends With You, or Undertale/Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover. There's no telling if I'll actually work up the motivation to write it, but it has occupied my mind a little recently.

The latter would actually fit together pretty well. Instead of being trapped underground, the monsters would be trapped in the spirit world.
