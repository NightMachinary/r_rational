I think that if I develop the story I want the characters to explore why a 'wishing hour' would even happen, at the very least, because a wishing hour like that would certainly call into question many people's views on the world and there being a higher power. Science would be turned upside down, and many human rights would be violated by those who figure it out in the time limit.

I guess I didn't go into enough detail of the mechanics of the wishing, so hopefully I can clear up the basic idea. The wishes take the positive spin, but they would still introduce significant chaos. All that happens is that the wishes are auto-interpreted to be accurate to the wish of the wisher without directly affecting another person. In this "wishing hour" one rule would be that no one can be directly affected by any wish but their own, and such wishes that cannot be accurately interpreted differently would not take effect.

Wishing that Amy from HR would just die wouldn't work, but wishing that her house would incidentally catch fire and completely burn down at 2 am when she was in it would be valid, so you can use the materials around the person to affect them.

I still haven't decided about the idea of a wish imbuing a magic power to an item, like "I wish every person that puts on this ring can move twice as fast as they normally do" and whether or not that can affect another person, because there are more nefarious things a person could wish for.
