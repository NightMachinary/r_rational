The second thought I had (i'm sure other people have had these ideas before) was what if you had a wishing machine, or God-level computer, where if you learned how to use it, you could literally control aspects of reality? This one was pretty OP, and it's hard to come up with limits while keeping it interesting, so that led me to a thought.

What about a worldwide wish granting phenomena? Let's say that for one hour one day, everyone on the planet's wishes were granted, not in the way they were expecting, but in a way which would get the results they wanted. For example, someone wishes "I wish I could bang such-and-such hot actress" - that wish doesn't magically force the actress to have sex with the person against their will, but makes the person physically attractive enough to where if they had the personality, they could start dating, and the fulfillment of the rest of the wish was on the part of the person who made that wish to make it happen.

Continuing with that, for one hour, any and all wishes could be granted, with limits. For example, any wish directly affecting someone ("I wish they would to die in a fire" or "I wish James wouldn't be sick any more") would have to be accepted by the other person. How they would accept that, or whether or not they would know the contents of said wish, without asking about it is anybody's guess.

Another restriction could be that any wish which directly affects any other person but yourself is automatically set upon them, however the effects of said wish are completely reversed after some time as the magic leaves.

What kind of supernatural event would allow something like this to happen?
