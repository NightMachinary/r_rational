I think a possible problem with this is that the premise starts on such a massive scale as copying universes. Perhaps if you created smaller abilities/scifi stuff that could be scaled into the universe splitting? It's difficult to keep a story insteresting if you immediately start your character off with this level of power.

For example, for my wishing story or the mana burning, I would focus on an individual character's interaction with the world and discovery, and then scale them into the full power.
