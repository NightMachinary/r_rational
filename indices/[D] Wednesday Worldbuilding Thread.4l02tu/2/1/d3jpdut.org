I'm going to second the "scale too big" reply. It /would/ make a good story, but the level of skill and effort required would make it /extremely/ difficult to do so. I remember seeing a webcomic sort of similar (a device is created that splits the universe every 2 weeks, but one person can experience the same things as their alternate selves) and it just exploded in complexity by the 40 strip mark.
