So I've got this idea that I think is excellent, but have continuously failed to make a worthy story with. Mentioned it in last week's thread, but not as a top level comment.

So there are these portals that, upon activation, split the universe in two (like a quantum event), and the portal in universe A connects with the portal in universe B. Using multiple portals would allow for the creation of infinite computers that span infinite universes.

There'd also be a variation that's activated twice (well, half the time): the first activation splits the universe and does nothing in universe A, and the second activation in universe A causes the portal in universe A to link with the portal in universe B at the moment of the first activation.

Finally, there'd be some kind of ability that causes someone to immediately evaporate in any newly-formed universe B - from everyone else's perspective they evaporate rapidly with very high probability, but from their perspective they can use the portals to copy the universe without copying themselves, giving them as much of any limited resource as they want.
