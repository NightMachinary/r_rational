It's been a very long time since I read War of the Worlds. I don't recall anything in particular that explicitly laid out why the Martians wouldn't try again in a couple of years (the ideal time to launch from Mars to Earth occurs roughly every couple years IIRC). Even if there was a good reason that the Martians would only attack once ever and never try again but this time with better antiviral defenses, I don't remember a way for the humans to know that... so expect a combination of huge defense spending / military buildup that would make the Cold War look like peanuts combined with some sort of setup to try to eventually counterinvade or bomb Mars.
