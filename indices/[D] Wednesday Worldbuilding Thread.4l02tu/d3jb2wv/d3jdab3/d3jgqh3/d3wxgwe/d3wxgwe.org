  get the feeling the Martians did not intend to immediately invade
#+end_quote

Its possible that, if the martian economic and technological advances are to a realistic degree beyond those of earth, that what earth treated as a full scale invasion represented only a microscopic effort on their part.

For an analogy, imagine if a group of individuals from the modern day, equipped with off the shelf guns and explosives, invaded somewhere equivalent to a bronze age civilisation. They could run around and cause immense havoc. For the locals it would feel like godlike powers were being unleashed in a deliberte intent to destroy them, for the originator civilisation it would be more like group of redneck hunters going off and getting drunk, shooting up the local wildlife, then dying because they forgot to disinfect their water.

The invasion force may just be a tiny subsection of martian civilisation
