No, but knowing what the evenual result looks like allows you to cut out a lot of dead ends in research. E.g. you would know to use silicon, you'd know about transistors, you'd know the basic architecture of a computer, (RAM, memory, etc). So instead of the real worlds random walk style of invention you would have something like a Civ tech tree to follow
