  Aside from computers (and math, since even if it's in a different language, the rocket equation is the rocket equation, and so on), other aspects of rocketry will probably be boosted a bit, possibly enough to push them into the early stages of weaponization. Are heat-rays and black smoke replicable by humans? Also, are heat-rays actually high-powered lasers or something similar, or are they something more exotic?

Actually, in the book the ships are launched via some sophisticated cannon rather than any sort of rocketry, since this was believed to be the way that space travel would happen. I'm not sure how a cannon like that could be made to work though, not if it's going interplanetary and expected to carry biological organisms. It would be easy to retcon that the narrator is wrong about that though.
