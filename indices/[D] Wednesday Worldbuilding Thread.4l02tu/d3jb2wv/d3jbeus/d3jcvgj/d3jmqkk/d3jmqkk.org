Technically, it's possible that the Martians themselves may just be computationally capable enough on a biological level to serve as their own guidance. I remember reading somewhere (I think it was some kind of sequel or something) that the Martians were in fact some sort of bio-engineered meat-computer species developed by a more ancient (and also originally earthly, hence why they are even vulnerable to extant strains at all) race. Flexible canon, though, and it may be worthwhile to ignore that idea.

Aside from computers (and math, since even if it's in a different language, the rocket equation is the rocket equation, and so on), other aspects of rocketry will probably be boosted a bit, possibly enough to push them into the early stages of weaponization. Are heat-rays and black smoke replicable by humans? Also, are heat-rays actually high-powered lasers or something similar, or are they something more exotic?

Metallurgy from the tripods will be hard to replicate, but the machinery itself maybe easier, and may add marginally towards things like cars or tanks.

Given how fast it reproduces, red creepers may be able to survive and adapt to the earthly ecosystem despite their lack of immunity, especially in cold climates and at high altitudes. Cracking down on it when it manages to get out of those areas and starts choking out crops may be an issue.

I suppose, looking beyond technology, the entire world is basically going be shoved in a war state of mind. Even if the Martians in the book were the last refugees of a water-less planet (which personally seems unlikely to me), there is no way for anyone on Earth to know that, which means that any country with the economy and resources starts preparing for a second wave.
