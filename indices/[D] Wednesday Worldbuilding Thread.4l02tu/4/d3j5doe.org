I've got a couple of thoughts in my head today, and a thought from last week's that didn't get much traction, so I'll be making two top level posts.

The first thought:

I've had a couple of thoughts and decisions about my world. I've been working on a mana/rune system of my own, and I've decided on a couple of things. First of all, runes were too prevalent and complex - I was going to have a basic system where 3d shapes, when mana passed through would have various magical effects.

I've decided that system was too complex and instead have opted to decide what I want mana to do and then work out what people can use for it.

I want mana to be a fuel type. In the Bible, manna was a hebrew term which translated roughly to 'what is it' as in, this food was falling from the sky and no one had any clue what it was, and I kinda want to keep that mystery there with my mana in modern times. At the start anyway, so that's what the 'scientists' who discover mana are going to call it, because mana would have a number of curious properties.

The first principle of mana is that it burns, in a similar way that gas burns. I haven't worked out what the catalyst for a mana burn is, but i'll get there.

Then, I want mana to have different effects based on the types of burns which are initiated with mana. For every 'burn' in mana, there is an inverse effect which can be initiated.

For example:

#+begin_example
  Hot burn - Puts out heat
  Cold burn - Cools an area (cold fire basically)
  Positive burn - pulling negative charges of electricity to itself, also can act as a ground.
  Negative burn - puts out a negative charge of electricity - can be regulated to put out power
  Light/Dark Burn - One puts light out, the other sucks it in
#+end_example

Any thoughts on how these burn effects could be used?
