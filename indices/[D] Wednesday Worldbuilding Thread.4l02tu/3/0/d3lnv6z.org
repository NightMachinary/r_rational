Can Livermorium channel the field in a particular direction? Like, if I have a Livermorium sheathe around my piece of water-pressurized wodzite, and there's a gap in it, what happens?

This would be very useful for contain antimatter and other highly-dangerous substances. High enough water pressure would create a vacuum around the material without any solid barrier around it, might make certain chemistry easier.

I assume this follows conservation of energy? There's a lot of "proportional to"-s in there, but you said that water flows as if in a vacuum, which suggests there's no resistance.
