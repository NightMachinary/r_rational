Livermorium doesn't reduce the overall volume of the wodzite field unless it completely encloses it (specifically, as long as it doesn't have any holes large enough for water molecules to get through), the remaining volume sort of 'extends' the whatever portion is unblocked, ballooning it out and distorting it from its original shape into a sort of hemisphere-cone shape.

I suppose flow rate is not exactly the right phrasing, but my point was to say that energy is conserved, IE that the energy you put into moving the water through the wodzite is equal to the energy the virtual water field is able to effect its contents with. Does that work? Maybe not. It might work better if we say that wodzite saps half the kinetic energy from water flowing through it, and that kinetic energy goes into the field, which I guess would mean there is some resistance.
