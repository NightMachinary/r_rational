Let's say that you have two substances, both some interesting properties, which become much more interesting in combination.

Wodzite is stone-like substance (most abundant in comets, and regions dense in ice), as well as occasionally in the coronae and coronal ejecta of red dwarfs, translucent and colorless. It has thermal and phase characteristics nearly identical to pure corundum, and behaves similarly on a chemical level, but is starkly non-reactive with respect redox reactions, is a strong electric insulator, and is highly transparent. It also appears to be intangible with respect to water molecules, which permeate and flow through its volume as though it were a vacuum (aside from the pressure of other water molecules also present inside the wodzite). Additionally, when water flows through wodzite, the wodzite emits a toroidal 'virtual water' field, which has virtual pressure and temperature proportionate to that of the water within the generating wodzite, with a scaling factor determined by the flow of the water through the wodzite and the volume of the emitted field (which is in turn determined by the size and shape of the wodzite itself).

Meanwhile, an island-isotope of Livermorium (generally as a small admixture to a highly corrosion and temperature resistant alloy), can contain the field emitted by wodzite, and is itself largely unaffected by that field.

Anything immediately jump out for this system, or similar systems, subbing water out for another simple chemical?
