Perhaps instead of assuming wishes can do anything except a specific blacklist (no wishing for more wishes, no bringing back the dead, no time travel, etc.), you should start from the idea that there is a whitelist of things that wishes can specifically do, and then see where your characters can take it from there.

Because if we start from the assumption that /anything/ is possible unless explicitly prohibited, and everyone in the world can access this power without limit, then you'll have a billion idiots poking at the edges looking for loopholes; and as the author, it would take you a lifetime to close all the loopholes a billion idiots can find in an hour. Can't wish for ongoing magical effects? Fine, I wish for a superintelligent AI and a fusion reactor. Can't make any wish that affects another person directly? OK, I wish for a gun and I wish to teleport to Amy's current location. Wishing only works for one hour? I wish for super-speed so that hour will subjectively be ten thousand years!
