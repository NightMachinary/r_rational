I don't see the reason to ask "what kind of event caused this". Adding some external entity that decided to grant humanity wishes for its own reasons just complicates the story. It could just be Magic.

I'm not sure where you'd go with this. A world where wishes come true is a utopia, a metaphor for what you'd want the world to be if you didn't have to put in the hard work to actually make it real. It's the world after a Friendly Singularity, the world inside /Equestria Online/, or whatever our utopia /du jour/ is.

This bit:

  that wish doesn't magically force the actress to have sex with the person against their will, but makes the person physically attractive enough to where if they had the personality, they could start dating, and the fulfillment of the rest of the wish was on the part of the person who made that wish to make it happen.

suggests you're specifically /not/ writing a story about good intentions that go horribly wrong, which is the usual place that stories about wishes go to. Your version of Magic isn't so much granting wishes as granting coherent extrapolated volitions. (I've been re-reading HPMoR, can you tell?)

The only setting I know of that might have ideas close to what you want is the tabletop RPG /Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine/. It's delightfully whimsical and definitely far from rational, but it's also the only other story I know of that has wishes be relatively commonplace without the "wishing for big poorly-specified things has horrible consequences" limitation.
