Yes. A highly skilled Osteomancer (not all Necromancers are Osteomancers, and not all Osteomancers are Necromancers) can animate a living body's skeleton and allow both the host and the skeleton's possessing spirit to live in the same body indefinitely.

(A moderately-skilled Osteomancer can animate a living skeleton and have both host and spirit live in the same body until the host dies from anemia due to not having any bone marrow.)

Aside from the expected difficulties in complex ritual magic, Skelemen pose several unique challenges:

- Two minds, one body: The host and spirit can have conflicting goals and desires. This can be intentional (in the case of high-value prisoners, corrupt officials, and other rebellious people) or else inadvertent (in the case of misunderstood instructions, conflicting priorities, and insufficient information). Most hosts can overpower their skeletons for short periods of time with moderate effort, but it difficult, awkward, and tiring.
- Senses: Skeletons inside a body lose access to many of their senses. Their life-sense is overwhelmed by their host body and therefore useless. Their tremorsense is similarly dampened, as the host body does not transmit vibrations as well as stone or bone. They are also blind, having their eye sockets blocked off by the host's eyes. They have greatly improved hearing (compared to bare skeletons, who have no ears), and their proprioception and sense of touch is good enough to tell the difference between a muscle moving a limb and an outside force doing the same.\\
- Breathing and sleep: The host will often have trouble breathing and sleeping with an unskilled or uncooperative skeleton. Having your ribcage move (or fail to move) out of rhythm with your respiration can be very distressing. Similarly, moving unexpectedly when you are trying to fall asleep can wake up most people.

All that being said, there are several advantages to Skelemen:

- Strength and Endurance: The strength from the muscles and the strength from the spirit animating the skeleton can be added together (when the two minds coordinate efforts), resulting in new Skelemen being about 2/3 stronger than they previously were. The skeletal strength can also be used to keep the muscles completely fresh and rested on long marches, even to the point of many veteran Skelemen being able to sleep and eat on their feet to maintain a near-24 hour march rate.
- Sleep and awareness: Two minds are better than one, they say. Skelemen get two chances to notice anything going wrong, and the skeleton never gets bored or tired.
- Intelligence: The animated skeleton benefits from having a (normal) human intelligence guide it, allowing much better use of its abilities.
- Magic Resistance: the skeleton's spirit benefits from the protective effects of being surrounded by a living human, which blocks all but the most powerful magics. (/Fireball/ is easy, /Explode Liver/ is hard. /Dispel Skeleton/ is easy, /Dispel Skeleton In A Person/ is hard.)
