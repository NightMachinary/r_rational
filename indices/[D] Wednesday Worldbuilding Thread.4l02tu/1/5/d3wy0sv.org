Early undead myths come from what the cultures of the time experienced around death and their fears of it. So what about our culture?

For us death is either hyper medicalised, long drawn out death full of tubes and drugs and pain, or sudden and sharp, violent accidents, murder, suicide. Make something that taps into those fears.
