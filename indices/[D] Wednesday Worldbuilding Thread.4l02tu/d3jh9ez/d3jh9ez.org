Idea: Techland - a plane of existence in which technological artifacts from across the multiverse are deposited in a random manner.

There are island of survivability in this plane, but otherwise the technological detritus shapes the landscape, some of which are extremely hazardous and some of which are not.

Weather can range from frequent rain of communicator, phones, omnitool, etc to 'oh my god we're oing to die' car sized object or just normal weather such as snow and rain.

On occasion, massive objects are deposited directly on the surface.

There are also wildlife, which are mostly evolved lifeform made from the remnant of technological devices. Less frequent are organic lifeforms.
