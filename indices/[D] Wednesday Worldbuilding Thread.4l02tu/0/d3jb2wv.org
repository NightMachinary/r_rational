What plausible futures are the outcome that follow /War of the Worlds/ (the original)? If aliens come down to Earth in 1897 with immensely superior technology and are subsequently defeated by the common cold, what do you think 2016 looks like?

Edit: If you've never read it, you can read it online [[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36/36-h/36-h.htm][here]]. Also, I have dibs on the title /War of the Many-Worlds/.
