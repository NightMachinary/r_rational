Also a frantic effort to reverse engineer teh martian technology, it is probably sufficiently far from the victorian base that they couldn't directly replicate it, but I could see them getting huge advances in electronics just from seeing the general shape of what can be done.

They also might be able to get some technology to work as a black box, e.g. the heat beam weapons, and use that. Which would vastly change human-human conflicts, or could have useful industrial applications. Depending on how much their economic base was harmed by the invasion I could see a resurgent british empire having a ig impact on the world stage (though I'm not sure if they were attacked more than other nations or it was just the location of the narrator)
