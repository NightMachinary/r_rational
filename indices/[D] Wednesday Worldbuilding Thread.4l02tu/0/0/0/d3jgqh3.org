I get the feeling the Martians did not intend to immediately invade. They crash-landed (hence the need for repairs) and come out of their spacecraft without wearing suits. They find something wrong with the air and retreat, perhaps assuming some sort of gas attack. At that point they finally attack, from what they might perceive as self defense.

Martians watching everything from afar, especially with the disease that ultimately crippled their forces, would have to think long and hard about a genuine invasion. They might put more effort into communicating this time around.
