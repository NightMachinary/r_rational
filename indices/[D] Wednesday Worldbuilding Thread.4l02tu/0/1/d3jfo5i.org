As I've mentioned [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vutn4/hsf_charles_stross_sciencefictional_shibboleths/cxrpgww][before]], alien microbial life (which the spacecraft, the tripods, as well as the bodies of dead aliens will contain in surprisingly large amounts) will interact unpredictably with our own.

The same risk that killed the aliens could very well kill us in ways our immune system might be ill-prepared to fight, and medical epidemiology in 1895 is only just starting to stretch its legs.

The "red weed" may be related, and turn out to be disastrous.
