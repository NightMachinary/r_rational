The idea of specialized computers like the Apollo Guidance computer makes me wonder if you could salvage components, like maybe reactors or even control systems from technology left behind and use it even if you don't understand how it works. If you have something like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator][RTG]] in 1897 I'm not sure that they would be able to understand and I certainly don't think it would give them much of a leg up on building their own, but I bet they could use it for their own applications.
