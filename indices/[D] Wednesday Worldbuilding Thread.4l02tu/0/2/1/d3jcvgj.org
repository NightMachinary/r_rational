The book doesn't go into too much detail on these matters, and I think you'd have to retcon a lot of it because it /was/ written in 1897. However, if we know that they were at the very least capable of launching from Mars and landing on Earth, we can assume that their minimum tech level almost certainly includes computers of some kind. Given their capabilities, there's also an upper bound on what they can do, as a lot of their actions would be rendered trivial by something like e.g. nanobots.

I think 1897 scientists /might/ be able to figure out something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer][the Apollo Guidance Computer]], but I'm really doubtful of their ability to reverse-engineer something like a modern day desktop computer, especially since so many components are made with really complicated processes that can't be easily discovered without having the base research. In addition to that, it would all be in a wildly different language and probably produced by a mindset that's far away from human.

So for the sake of argument, let's say that there's some technological gain, and some proof of concept, but that technology is only going to be a decade or two ahead (and in some uneven ways).
