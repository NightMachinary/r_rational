Its an odd duckling relative to the rational genre.

I think it meets some of the technical criteria for a rationalist story and doesn't engage in many of the tropes that rationalist readers dislike about other genres. BUT it doesn't really feel like other rationalist stories. The MC isn't kicking but because he is the smartest guy around. The story also has a rather narrow focus on the MC and his immediate friends. Many rationalist fantasy stories end up with a much larger scope, like saving the world, ending death, etc.

So people in the subreddit are probably more likely to enjoy the story than any other random story. But its not gonna be a universal hit around here.
