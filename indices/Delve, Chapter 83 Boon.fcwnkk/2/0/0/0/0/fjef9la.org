I've done the math and after level 25 all of his specializations are going to turn him into a monster. Raising the skill level to 15 means more skill levels for Aura Synergy, which ends up making the damages go up a lot, and the range goes up a lot too, then the more effective Aura Compression turns that into a lot more damage.

Right now a full "nova" pulse compressed to 20 meters (I chose that because it's a decent distance, and the specific benchmark the Watch mentioned when he was being appraised) does just under 5k damage. At level 25 bronze rank (15 level 10 auras boosting aura synergy) that increases to just under 9k damage.

At level 25 silver rank (no class bonuses, since we don't know those, just the "everything is rank 15 now") that damage changes to just under 220k damage...

I'm actually wondering if the recent Goldplate fight mentioned "damage limits" in passing just to lay the groundwork for some explanation for why Rain won't be able to kill every hostile in a city block in a single second, even though he'll have the damage to.

(Technically both of those lvl 25 numbers should be slightly higher, because they don't include the small Focus boost that 7 more levels of Clarity will give him through Magical Synergy or whatever, but that's a pretty small effect.
