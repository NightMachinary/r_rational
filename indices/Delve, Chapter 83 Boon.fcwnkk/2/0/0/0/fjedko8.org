I certainly hope so. I really want the MC to get past level 25 and get a new class. I think he might actually turn deadly at that level, rather than just having a weird half-completed aura build.

I'm a backer of the story and the very latest chapter has me hoping that there will be some soul shenanigans that he is able to pull off.

I'm kinda just tired of the MC being weak.
