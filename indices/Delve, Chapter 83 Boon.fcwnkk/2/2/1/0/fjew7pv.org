  There's a difference between having a coherent/complex magic system and being a rational story.
#+end_quote

I know, I was talking about the story (or at least the way it's executed) not the magic systems.

#+begin_quote
  I consider it very rational because of how the characters act and react to the world around them, as well as how the plot unfolds.
#+end_quote

I don't see why Delve wouldn't fit there. The character motivations make sense, the world is pretty well established (planned, doesn't feel like a bunch of random ideas thrown together), everything has consistent rules, the power progression is logical and fairly easy to follow, there are no random power ups, no power of friendship or whatever saving the day. Even the character reactions seem to be normal? they don't start to act out of character or holding idiot balls to progress the plot.
