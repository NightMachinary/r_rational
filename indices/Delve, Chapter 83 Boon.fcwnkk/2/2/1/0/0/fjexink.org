To me, I would say that a lot of Rain's power ups are a result of luck rather than clever thinking. He basically stumbled onto his class and his equipment.

He used math to optimize his growth rate, but we have yet to see him use his head to come up with something new. The latest Patreon chapter seems to be turning that around, however.
