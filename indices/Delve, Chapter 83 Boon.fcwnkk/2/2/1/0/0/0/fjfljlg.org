Well, yea. Though he could be pretty strong with other classes too. But this is just another linear fighter quadratic wizard thing. He is weaker at the start but grows up with bigger synergies. It's almost required for these kind of stories. At least it's better than the xianxias where the dude just TRAINS HARDER in a week than the other dudes who have been training all their lives. :D Not that the bar is very high there.
