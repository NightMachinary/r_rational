  Though he could be pretty strong with other classes too.

Well, not quite. My point was that his current strong class was achieved through luck; Rain could have just as easily stumbled into a less optimal class.

All of Rain's analysis have been focused more on trying to understanding the underlying math of his abilities, but overall he hasn't really optimized things too much. It's more about getting more accurate grasp. Like, Rain would do math to figure out how much mana he needs to use to level up, but it doesn't really /change/ how quickly he levels up, if that makes sense.
