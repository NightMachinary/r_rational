Worm takes very great care to signpost all powers beforehand and to have very few triggers in its hundred jillion pages. Nearly all powers that actually impact the story are well noted before they do. And I think people generally rate it lower on the rationality totem pole due to random powers even with those caveats.

The part of eaglejarl's comment in this thread that resonates with me is that a "whatever the author needs" and a "you lose button" can appear out of nowhere. I understand that part of WTC is that there is literally an omnipotent God and/or narrative, but I don't think that is rational.

That is to say, just because there's a "warning: deus ex machines hard hat zone" sign doesn't actually excuse deus ex machinas falling from the sky. It works for the sake of the story because that's what the story is about, but it still dings the rational score.
