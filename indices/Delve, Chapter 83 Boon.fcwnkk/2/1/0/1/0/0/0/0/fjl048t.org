You're right that Mary Sues can be fun, but generally only for the expanse of a short story. I don't think one could write an enjoyable novel-length work with a Mary Sue protagonist. (It's also debatable whether you can /have/ a Mary Sue protagonist. A Mary Sue main character, sure, but the defining element of a protagonist is that they have a character arc in which they improve in some way.)
