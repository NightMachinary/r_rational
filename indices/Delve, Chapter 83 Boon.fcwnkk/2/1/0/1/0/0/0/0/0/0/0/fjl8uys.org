is not so neatly clear cut. in humanities the lines can be fuzzy.

Sherlock makes good examples, the camera follows watson, but he is a secondary character.

the character arc is mostly non existent, but the plot is about the discovery of the mystery, sometimes one of the victims suffers a character arc, but not always. yet they you would be hard pressed to name them the protagonist in any reasonable definition.

and the hero is sherlock.

counterexamples are abundant and hard definitions can be misleading and sometimes unhelpful. that is not to say that nice definition must not be searched but to make conscious that hardlines can have drawbacks.
