That's a big part of what turns me off. The details of how the character become more overpowered are the least interesting part of the story.

Like, I don't want Luke to start going through a list of the different types of objects he can lift and how heavy they can be, I just want to see him throwing a space-car at Vader.

I haven't tried to read Delve, though, so I don't know how well it fares.
