My feeling is that if someone /doesn't/ have an interesting take on these tropes - that is, these things that are a fundamental part of, like, actually transitioning from one world to another - why write a portal fantasy in the first place? Why not... just write a normal fantasy set in this alternate world, from the perspective of a native?

I guess the answer is something like, "it's easier to write a person from my own demographic from Earth and have the reader relate to them" which just reeks of laziness to me.
