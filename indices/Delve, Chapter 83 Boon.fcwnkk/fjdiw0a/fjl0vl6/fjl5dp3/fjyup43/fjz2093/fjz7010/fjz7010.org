Yeah.

One thought that comes to mind regarding Isekai is, there's actually historic precedent you can draw from.

The colonization of America by Europeans is the most obvious period, but others come to mind.

Basically, any time people were invaded by a more advanced society whose technologies and inner politics were beyond the natives' understanding.

Both from the point of view of the people being colonized, and the people doing the colonizing, these situations were /wild/. They were meeting virtual aliens, from a society so different it might as well be another planet.

Most Isekai doesn't really capture that cultural shock; and it especially especially doesn't capture the societal chaos of having thousands of people have that cultural shock at the same time.
