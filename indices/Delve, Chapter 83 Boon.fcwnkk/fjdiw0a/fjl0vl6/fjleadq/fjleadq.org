I apologize for not being more on top of my portal tropes-- considering how many of them I've read/am reading, I should probably be more familiar.

But if I had to order them from most to least annoying, I think it's --

1. Uninteresting opening scene where MC flounders for a bit, followed by an exposition dump followed by MC musing that his (it's always a guy, huh) social situation at home makes him uniquely suited to be a portal fic protag (which is why there won't be a bunch of homesickness or any mention of MC's previous life thereafter) (Largely subverted/deconstructed in /Worth The Candle/, see discussion above. Totally subverted in /Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lillijoy/.)

2. MC /immediately/ determines that his existing skillset from being a gamer lets him exploit the dickens out of the game system, whether because he unlocks some special ability or has extra powers by virtue of being the protagonist (kinda played straight in /Delve/, deconstructed in WtC, lampshaded in /Nanocultivation/, and pretty neatly sidestepped in /He Who Fights With Monsters/ and /Wandering Inn./)

3. Using level ups as a replacement for character development. I think LitRPGs can exploit a kind of lootbox/Skinner box psychological angle, using Numbers Go Up to draw in an audience and keep them hanging on the loot that'll accompany the next big level drop. /Homestuck/ was guilty of this at points. /Wandering Inn/ uses the level mechanism heavily, but not to the detriment of character development at all so I give it a pass. /Delve/ does it, /He Who Fights With Monsters/ does it, /Nanocultivation/ deconstructs it, /Worth The Candle/ deconstructs this at a molecular level.

4. Derivative/boring interfaces/magic systems. I mean. It's /really/ too much to ask to go beyond HP/MP/XP/Skills but it's appreciated when it happens. WtC, Wandering Inn, He Who Fights With Monsters, Delve and Nanocultivation all deconstruct to varying degrees.

There's probably a longer, more insightful list somewhere. But if all four of those happen in the first five chapters of a work I'm pretty likely to drop it.

Edit: oo, what AW said. aM i dReAmInG oR cRaZy!? gets SO old, SO fast. Which is why "I'm in.. Another world? --oh fuck, zombies. RUNNING" was pretty damn refreshing.
