/He Who Fights With Monsters/ does hold off until the MC has access to experienced adventures who guide him, but they leave him with a wiki and he just goes with the essences he has on hand rather than actually planning a build out.

/Worth the Candle/ dose it a lot better. Firstly the MC wrote system (sort of) but he still works heavily with others to optimise.
