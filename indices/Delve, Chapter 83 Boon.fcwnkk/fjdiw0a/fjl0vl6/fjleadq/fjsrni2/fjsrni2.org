  MC immediately determines that his existing skillset from being a gamer lets him exploit the dickens out of the game system, whether because he unlocks some special ability or has extra powers by virtue of being the protagonist (kinda played straight in Delve, deconstructed in WtC, lampshaded in Nanocultivation, and pretty neatly sidestepped in He Who Fights With Monsters and Wandering Inn.)

I'd love to see an example where the MC says "as a gamer I know exactly what to do here", then closes his interface and doesn't touch anything until he finds the equivalent of the wiki of optimised builds.

Gamer knowledge being superior to natives of the system doesn't make any sense. Now if there's no natives at all (or our band of adventurers are barred from their collective knowledge) then the gamer being better at the system than a non-gamer can make sense with good writing.
