I just had that thought, I wonder if you could write a story with an English protagonist where the universal fantasy language is something other than English.

Like, the protagonist arrives in the Crossroad of Dimensions, and everyone magically speaks Spanish, expect for him.

Not sure what the story would be about, though.
