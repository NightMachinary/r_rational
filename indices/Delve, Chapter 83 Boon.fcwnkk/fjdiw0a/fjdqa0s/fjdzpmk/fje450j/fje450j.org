I'm currently reading A Memory Called Empire by Arkady, and it is about an ambassador visiting the capital of an empire with a very poetic language. She speaks it as a foreigner, and will never get past being clumsy and inept speaking it. I suspect that is a practical close to that feeling, but is not portal fantasy.
