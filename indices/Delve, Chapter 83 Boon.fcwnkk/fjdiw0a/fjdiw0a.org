I've been following Delve for a while. Fairly RT; MC spends a lot of time playing with his skill tree to optimize his capabilities, but doesn't go on to stomp the setting. Decisions make sense in context (sometimes people make mistakes or are irrational, but never just to advance the plot.)

Admission: the beginnings of isekai/xianxia ("oh I have awoken in a fantasy world... NAKED? Oh jeez what to do MAGIC IS A THING HERE? Wow I want to live here, good thing I have no friends or family and do nothing but play video games") annoy the /piss/ out of me even though I enjoy a bunch of other things about the genre(s?).

Delve was /not/ super annoying to me on that front. It got my hackles up at the beginning because I guess all portal fantasy has to hit the stations of +canon+ portals or something. But it's developed nicely, good characters, good worldbuilding, and it's on my shortlist of patreon-supported tales. Recommend.
