  Are you saying that Worm, or any other superhero setting, can't be rational?
#+end_quote

Sure, superhero stories can be rational. Worm /isn't/, but it could be if Wildbow would stop piling narrative cheats on top of each other.

EJ: Hey, why doesn't Taylor use her powers to quickly and efficiently pollinate crops and remove all the pests from them? That would reduce deaths and birth defects due to pesticides, drastically increase yield, and save hundreds of millions of lives.

Wildbow: Oh, the space worm in her brain wants her to punch things in the face instead of using her powers usefully.

EJ: Really? Huh, that's weird. Hey, why do the Entities want people to punch each other instead of doing science? Don't they want to discover a way to prevent heat death?

WB: Um...reasons?

EJ: Yeah, but surely there have been /some/ people who tried to be useful with their powers?

WB: Um...well...there's these giant monsters, see? And one of them can see the future and she'll stop you if you do anything useful.

EJ: Wait, she can see the future? So the world is deterministic?

WB: Erm... /Crap, I don't want it to be deterministic because then there's no point in reading the story at all./ No, it's not deterministic? Whenever you think you are seeing the future it's, um, really just a simulation. Yeah, that's it!

EJ: Wait, but then what about Coil's powers? How can he choose a timeline and preserve it if it was really just a simulation?

WB: Um...look! Kaiju! And facepunching!

EJ: Yeah, about that...have they tried doing something other than facepunching the kaiju? I dunno, nuking it?

WB: Oh, that doesn't work. They're too dense.

EJ: Okay, how about portaling it to another dimension? An unpopulated one.

WB: Oh, that doesn't work. They're immune to portals.

EJ: Okay, how about telekinetically throwing them into Jupiter?

WB: Oh, that doesn't work. Blah blah blah.

EJ: Ohhhkay. What about that hobo who was telling Scion what to do? What took him so long to get around to telling Scion to kill the kaiju?

WB: Um...look! Grimdark misery and body horror!

EJ: Oh, and what about Scion? He was a big hero until Jack spoke to him for, like, a minute. And then he was a massive genocidal maniac. What was up with that?

WB: Well, Jack has this superpower, see...

EJ: Okay, but aren't the Entities immune to all of their own powers since they can choose to be? Eden rendered Path to Victory useless against herself and Scion, so why didn't all of the shards have their IFF turned on at all times, ever since they were originally gathered millions or billions of years ago?

Bleh. That was supposed to be a couple of quick bullets and it got away from me. I'll stop before this gets /ridiculously/ long instead of simply too long.
