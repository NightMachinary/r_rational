I mean, sure, it's fiat-ed that the item that trivializes encounters can't be given to the party because /reasons/. But since we're on the topic of comparing Delve and WTC's rationality, focusing on entads, a black box investiture process that exists as the author's (or DM's) tuning tool is part of that.

Like, how did that item get into his hands? He didn't seem to make it, he can't (or at least they didn't think to) transfer it, so it's essentially just as explicable as if he had a Worm superpower.

Random unique magical items are fun and cool so I like entads, but they're also not rational. This particular entad barrels into the plot, does it's plot thing, then can't be used the next day. I'm not sure if it breaks the letter definition of rrationality, but it sure breaks the spirit.
