  so it's essentially just as explicable as if he had a Worm superpower.

Are you saying that Worm, or any other superhero setting, can't be rational? Worm superpowers run the gamut, but someone coming in with some unknown power doesn't mean that the story isn't rational, so long as that power is still playing by the rules the setting has established, and so long as the characters deal with new powers according to what they believe the probability distribution of powers would be. Even then, outside context problems seem like they're completely fine to me, so long as they're actually outside context, rather than things that /shouldn't be/ but are treated as though they are.

If I understand [[/u/eaglejarl]] correctly, a lot of their complaint is not what the entad /did/, it's that Juniper didn't treat it in the way that it should have been treated given everything that's been shown in the text thus far (specifically narrative, the Dungeon Master, and threats scaling to meet or match powers). That's the opposite of what I would expect if it were /just/ a matter of fiat, because if it were /just/ fiat, you wouldn't expect the character to act any differently.

(I've already said my piece in the comments of that chapter [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/egl22m/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_177183/fcpgt1d/?context=3][here]], and think this is a pretty poor place to rehash any of it, not that I would want to. But if you want to talk about something like entads as disqualifying a work as 'rational' then I'm game for that.)
