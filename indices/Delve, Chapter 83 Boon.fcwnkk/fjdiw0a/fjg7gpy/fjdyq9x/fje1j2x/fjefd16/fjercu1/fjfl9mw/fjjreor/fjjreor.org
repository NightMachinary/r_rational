I don't know that I agree with the assertion, but zie might be thinking of the entads in WtC. Their effects are literally "whatever the author says", so they are a perfect tool for (Deus|Diabolus) Ex Machina. The last but one batch of chapters was a perfect example: Juniper is immune or resistant to most forms of attack, so the author had someone show up with a "you lose" button (a pipe that instantly puts the target to sleep) as a way to justify a prison break arc. Granted, he also needed to have Juniper stand there like an eggplant, doing literally nothing to defend himself, but it still wouldn't have worked without the entad.
