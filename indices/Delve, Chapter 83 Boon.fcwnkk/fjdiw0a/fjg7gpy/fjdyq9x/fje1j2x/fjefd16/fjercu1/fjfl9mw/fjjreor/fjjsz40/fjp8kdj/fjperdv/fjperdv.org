In WtC you can't just take entads from people, since many of them are bound to a specific person. One of the first examples of this is the immobility plate, which no one else can wear. In ch 180 it's explicitly mentioned as being the same hue of Yarrow's soul through Soul Sight, which would mark it as belonging to him, with the question of it being investable an open one. Beyond that, the activation requirements for the pipe are unknown.

Also, be careful about spoilers, as this is the comment thread of a chapter of Delve, not WtC.
