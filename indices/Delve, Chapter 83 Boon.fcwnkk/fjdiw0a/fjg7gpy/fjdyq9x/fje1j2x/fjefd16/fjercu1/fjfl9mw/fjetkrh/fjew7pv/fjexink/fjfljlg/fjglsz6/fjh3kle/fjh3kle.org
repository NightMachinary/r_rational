It was through luck, but it does not matter for the argument. He is in some ways not as strong as others of his level. In some ways he is stronger. He is not yet strong. People specifically do not do what he does because it is suboptimal. It is not because there is no knowledge of the Dynamo class that he has. It is kot specifically strong class. It is mostly that there are barely any supports around. If there were more, he would not be as impressive as people would have mana.

He has his armor and strong friends. He would be more screwed without them than his class.
