If James Joyce managed to make Ulysses work, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of ‘novel-length' anything. The joy of a story of someone doing optimal things relies more on the ‘optimal things' than the ‘someone', and that could stretch a book.

Heck, now that I think about it, I've watched hour-long TASBot videos.

  (It's also debatable whether you can /have/ a Mary Sue protagonist. A Mary Sue main character, sure, but the defining element of a protagonist is that they have a character arc in which they improve in some way.)

I'd consider Forty Milleniums of Cultivation and He Who Fights With Monsters to both have Marty Stu protagonists, despite their character growth. They're not actually ‘flawless', but they're close enough to count.
