- The /main character/ is the one that the camera follows.
- The /protagonist/ is the one who has a character arc.
- The /hero/ is the one who drives the plot and the reader is supposed to identify with.

Usually these are all the same character, but not always. For example, in the OrigTrig, Darth Vader is the protagonist, Luke is the hero, and the main character is a bit fuzzy (it's an ensemble cast) but probably also Luke.
