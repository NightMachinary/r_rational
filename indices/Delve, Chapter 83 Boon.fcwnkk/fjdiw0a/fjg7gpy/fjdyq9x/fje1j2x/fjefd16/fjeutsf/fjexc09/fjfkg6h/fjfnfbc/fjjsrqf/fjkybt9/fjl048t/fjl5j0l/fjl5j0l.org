that is a weird take on what makes a protagonist, a protagonist needs not to grow. think sherlock holmes, does he ever /grow/ in any of the stories? and he is undoubtedly the protagonist.

short stories and children stories are filled with characters that themselves dont grow. in those stories the world around them changes.

i mean character arcs are amazing but not necessarily required
