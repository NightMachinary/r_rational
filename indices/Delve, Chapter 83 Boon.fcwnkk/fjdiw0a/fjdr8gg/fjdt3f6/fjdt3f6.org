  What I'd be super interested in, would be a world where Isekai protagonists are really common and kind of a part of society.

I've been enjoying The Gilded Hero. While the writing style may not be for everyone, it's a somewhat different take then most portal fantasies. In it, 'heros' are summoned en-mass by the king, and then used as a sort of disposable mercenary chattel.
