  What I'd be super interested in, would be a world where Isekai protagonists are really common and kind of a part of society

Funny you should mention that. Just this morning I posted the first chapter of /The Patchwork Realms: Arrival/, which is exactly that. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-patchwork-realms-arrival.63045/#post-14500524]]

The blurb:

"Athos is a good dog. He likes frisbee, bacon, and his family (SmolFriend, Mom, and Dad). He's not so keen on falling through an interdimensional portal to a fantasy world where floating boxes tell you that you've just been given status as the 'Supreme Exemplar' of your species, a powerful package of abilities that includes human-level intelligence. Sure, being smart is nice but less so when it comes with the need to survive in a land made from bits of different dimensions stitched together like patches in a quilt. A thousand species, a thousand lands, sorcery and super science rubbing elbows, wars and intrigue everywhere...it's exhausting for a good dog who just wants to go home!"
