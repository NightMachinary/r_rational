I wonder when we'll start to have discussions about Delve's plot instead of discussions about how rational it is.

As far as the chapter goes, I really like how the characters aren't cardboard cutouts. Lord Rill has a bit more depth to him than a mustache twirling Quisling, and some other recent characters (the healer and the guild master) have shown to be more three dimensional than I thought. I like the way it's revealed, with Rain making biased judgements of them and confirming those opinions until presented with evidence otherwise.

I like the touch with the weapon shop. Now we're able to see exactly what the state of other crafters is compared to Tallheart.

Together, seeing the crafting with Rill's discussion it really paints a picture of the world and help explain why Rain's build isn't seen more often.

Modern people would expect hyper-specialized classes, maybe with strong groups/corporations/nobles to awaken people with specific jobs they'd expect them to do. But that's not the case here. People just don't take support builds. Amelia is an outlier with her healing build. Wallace is one of the only healers, despite there being tons of adventurers. And there aren't any crafters or buff supporters like Rain.

Everyone seems to take passed down builds that are optimized for survival. Their entire family line is built on this, so any risky actions can just extinguish your whole legacy. People don't want to try and push for maximum extreme power; they want to take the safe route that'll keep them alive. That's why not many copy Rain's build. We'd heard it before, but Rill's noble family help hammer it home.

Really excited to see what the Empire's got, since they do seem to go for hyper-specialized builds.
