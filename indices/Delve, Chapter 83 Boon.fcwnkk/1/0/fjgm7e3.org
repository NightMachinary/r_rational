The Empire and a regular adventurer both specialize, but the adventurer optimizes for only themselves (which is why supporter builds are rare due to their low survivability), while the Empire optimizes at the army level.

It's a lot easier to take a non-combat build when you're supported/forced by an Empire, who has enough Blues to spare.
