If by winning, we mean staying alive? Sure.

If we mean getting strong? That's not gonna do it when other people in the setting live to old age and have trained all their lives. Just avoiding fights does not get you strong.

Somehow you are going to have to train better or luck yourself into some power or something to beat people who have cultivated for decades. Dodging fights does not address the how to get strong problem.

Not that any MC has ever had problems with the staying alive department. Power of shounen.
