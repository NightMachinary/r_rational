  Well, not quite. My point was that his current strong class was achieved through luck; Rain could have just as easily stumbled into a less optimal class.

Rain's choice was entirely logical. Linear fighter quadratic wizard says to always play a wizard. Size of manabar and speed of regeneration is the biggest factor in power of wizard; he had enough mana to start off, so optimising regen made sense when distributing his very first points. When he discovered that he got XP for mana spent, the optimal move was to be able to regen mana as fast as possible so he could keep spending it. There is a good class due each of the "monofocus on one ability" builds, so of course he got the one for Clarity.

As to playing a support class instead of DPS, there's multiple ways to validate that choice:

1. Personal preference. He enjoys team play more than solo.
2. He's in a world where he doesn't know what's out there. As a support class he's going to be a desirable teammate and therefore it shouldn't be hard to find a party to watch his back. (This works.)
3. Support usually has a ton of non-combat utility, meaning he can probably make a living /without/ having to risk his life.

As to his build, he spent a lot of time optimising it to match his goals. Most people have to be careful about looking around too widely in the skill trees, because they can't afford the XP costs. XP is mostly free for Rain so he spent a lot of time reviewing all the options that are available and deciding how best to use them.
