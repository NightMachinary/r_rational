... Honestly, if I was to write a xania, the main character would grow stronger than the average cultivator by the simple expedient of /not picking goddamn stupid fights/. The game is immortality, the person who levels the highest is the person who does not take themselves out of the game by dying. Honestly, cultivation seems to be very bad for your wisdom score.
