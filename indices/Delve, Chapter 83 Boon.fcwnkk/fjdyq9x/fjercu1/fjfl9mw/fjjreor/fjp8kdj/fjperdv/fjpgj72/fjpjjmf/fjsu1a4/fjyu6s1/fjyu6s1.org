  Hey, why doesn't Taylor use her powers to quickly and efficiently pollinate crops and remove all the pests from them? That would reduce deaths and birth defects due to pesticides, drastically increase yield, and save hundreds of millions of lives.

Taylor is a bullied, depressed teenager who mistrusts authority and has a propensity for rationalizing her actions while she desperately seeks out human connection. You really think this person is gonna have the desire or the the business sense to go ... call up the agriculture board or ... whatever it is you need to do make this happen?

I'm not gonna call /Worm/ rational, but come on, a teenage girl acting like a teenage girl instead of a rational superperson isn't a "narrative cheat".
