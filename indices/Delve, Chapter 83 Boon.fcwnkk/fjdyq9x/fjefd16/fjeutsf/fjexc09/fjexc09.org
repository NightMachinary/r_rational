Remember that rational works don't assume that a character has no faults, they can (and arguably should, if we're being rational in what we expect from a human being) have gained in knowledge, imperfections, biases.

The important thing is that regardless of their flaws the characters treat the world and its systems (whether magical, political, scientific, whatever) as real, worthy of investigation, and go about that investigation in an informed matter and use the knowledge they gain to further their plans.
