There are three big points in favor of doing it the way that it's done:

1. It's easier to write, since it's easier to write people close to yourself
2. It's easier for the reader to identify with
3. It allows for the main character to naturally encounter a lot of exposition

... and I do think that in some sense, these boil down to laziness, since you can do all the same things without an MC from Earth, it just takes more effort. And for the most part, I think that stories are better when the author takes the time to not just dump a normal Earth person into their world. I don't want to fault authors for using cheap/lazy methods, but the problem is that a lot of the opening chapters suffer from being really rote and not having a lot to do with the plot.

(The plot also sucks most of the time, but that's a bit of a different issue.)

I mean, if you're going to have an MC who is basically an audience surrogate, it seems like you could build up a framework that didn't require all the usual bullshit. Like, pick an alt-Earth where magic was discovered or brought in from an alternate universe in 2018 and allows easy one-time portals to lands of adventure. MC can still be /basically/ from Earth, but they don't need to spend time wondering whether everything is real, they don't need to be super concerned about getting back, they go in not knowing where they're going or what the details are, but more or less knowing the score.

(Even then, I find the idea of an Earth where that's possible more interesting than people actually going to other places using it. Governments worry about brain drain from all their best and brightest isekaiing themselves, universe travel is clearly possible and Earth Prime knows that if it's not already in an arms race, it's going to need to be soon, etc.)
