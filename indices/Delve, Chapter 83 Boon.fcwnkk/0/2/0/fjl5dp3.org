There are a lot of really, really common tropes that don't typically serve the story all that well, and are mostly there because not having them would be sufficiently unrealistic that people would balk at it.

- Going about normal boring life or whatever
- Get pushed through a portal or whatever
- Where am I?
- This must be a dream or delusion!
- How did I get here?
- How do I get back home?
- Oh, I have a power or something
- Oh, there is a plot

And it's only at that point that you actually start getting on with whatever the plot is. All that other stuff is just setup, and /usually/ it doesn't have much impact on what comes after, it's just there so that you can have someone from Earth as an audience insert and fish out of water. (Sometimes the time from coming through the portal to actively being part of a real plot takes a super long time too, though that's a bit more variable.)

Yes, there are ways to go through these in ways that are more engaging and/or revealing of character, but it's a really well-mapped space, and a lot of authors don't put in any effort, which means that by the time you're reading your 20th "trapped in another world" story you feel like you're reading the same first chapters over and over again. (The "dream or delusion" and questioning of the nature of reality stuff in particular gets super tedious, especially since it's not falsifiable, and usually there's not a lot of depth.)
