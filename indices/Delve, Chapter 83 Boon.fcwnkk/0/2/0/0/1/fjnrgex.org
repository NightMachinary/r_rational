This is more controversial, but I'd add "Any kind of munchkining of the magic system" to that list.

Munchkining in original stories in particular seem like a really pointless exercise for me (though for some people it's a big part of the fun). Since you're the author, you can make up any rules or combination of rules you want, so munchkining usually feels at least a little masturbatory.

It's more interesting in a tabletop context, since it's a collaborative exercise where you're trying to adapt to someone else's rules (unless the DM is doing it, in which case we go back to masturbatory), or in a fanfic that explores the consequences of another story's magic system; even then, I personally think it works best in small doses (like "set up, reminder, payoff", where each is a 30-seconds scene in a 2 hours movie).
