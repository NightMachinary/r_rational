  Delve was not super annoying to me on that front. It got my hackles up at the beginning because I guess all portal fantasy has to hit the stations of canon portals or something.

Yeah, the only isekai I can read now are the ones that find some interesting way to rush through the introduction.

WtC has the PUBG intro which does a lot to both introduce you to the world (the army guy uses a lot of fantasy idioms and there's clearly magic, but the prisoners are also being dropped from a military plane) and immediately raise the stakes. "How did I get teleported to a world with magics? WHO CARES, THERE ARE ZOMBIES ABOUT TO EAT ME".

Everworld had a similar setup, where after the first chapter which introduces the characters, they all kinda wake up chained to a wall, then a god gives them the broad strokes ("You're in Everworld. Magic and stuff is real here"), sets up the McGuffin ("Where is your shady friend who happens to be a witch? I need her."), then raises the stakes ("You don't know anything useful. I'm going to have you executed now") in a pretty fast chapter.

What I'd be super interested in, would be a world where Isekai protagonists are really common and kind of a part of society. WtC flirts with the idea, but the main character is still very blatantly the Chosen One.

/Voyage extraordinaire au royaume des 7 Tours/ (Incredible journey to the realm of the 7 Towers) has a nice twist on the concept, where the Narnia-equivalent becomes a colonial-ish tourist attraction, with people paying top dollar for what is essentially a safari in fantasy-land (the book itself kinda sucked and the protagonist was really unlikeable, but the concept was interesting).

Worm has a band of characters who get pulled from our Earth to the Parahuman Earth, manage to get superpowers, and become criminal mercenaries while trying to find a way back home, among other things. They're pretty close to anti-isekai, in that they are absolutely not special: they're not the only ones to have power, they're not the strongest superheroes around, their choices are shaped by a society that's much bigger than them, and a few of them meet a violent and undignified end.

So I think my ideal isekai story would be something like that. Not necessarily cynical and violent, but a world where isekai characters are a part of society; there's an economy developed around them (which would probably have its exploitative side), social expectations for how they behave, and a greater design that the protagonists can't necessarily affect.

Of course, in this kind of story it's a lot harder for the protagonists to have agency. Stories are easier to write when the main character is the most important person in the world and all their decisions are inherently Important and Meaningful.
