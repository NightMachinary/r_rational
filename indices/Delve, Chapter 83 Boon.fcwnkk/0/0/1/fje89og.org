[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters/chapter/386590/chapter-1-strange-business][He Who Fights With Monsters]] has an element of what you're talking about. (Outworlders aren't exactly common, but they're also anything but unheard of. The power ladder goes very very high and those at the top are pretty inscrutable.) It pushed my isekai-trope-cringe factor to its very limit getting through the beginning and MC is preeeetty Mary Sue but once you start meeting other characters it picks up quite a bit.
