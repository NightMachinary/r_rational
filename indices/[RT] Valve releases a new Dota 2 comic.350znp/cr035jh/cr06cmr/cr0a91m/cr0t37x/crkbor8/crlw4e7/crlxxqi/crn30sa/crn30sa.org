Mid Tiny-Io has been a thing since the bounty runes got added. Getting the minute 0 bottle just makes Io that much better in lane.

I think it could work, with a five stack. You'd need a wisp player who knows how to really play the hero. Enigma is going to be a little stunted compared to a jungle Enigma but the Eidolons should let him do pretty decent, especially with units you control now giving xp for kills (I assume that works for creeps as well as heroes? Or maybe not, since Naga Siren would be broken. I'm going to have to look that up) but he should do fine if he can zone the other team effectively with the threat of a black hole. Overall I'd say it would be entertaining to give it a try.
