Is there any place which keeps an up-to-date list? Valve doesn't seem to have one on their own site the way they do for the Team Fortress 2 comics, and these are good enough that I want to follow them despite not actually playing the game, so I'd really like some way to periodically make sure I haven't missed any new ones.
