Yes, DotA 2 is completely multiplayer. That said, the characters tend to be very well-executed and comparatively well-backstoried - most have hundreds of voice lines including specific responses to killing/dying/meeting/etc dozens of other heros, and so forth.

Still not a game anyone plays for the story, but the little touches certainly don't detract.
