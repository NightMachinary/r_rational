I did a little digging around, and managed to find a list which seems at least /more/ likely to stay up-to-date than any other currently-existing one: [[http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Category:Comics]]

It's slightly awkward, since most of the comics don't have their own pages and are just linked in footnotes on their associated items' pages, but it should be basically passable until Valve decides to make a list of their own.
