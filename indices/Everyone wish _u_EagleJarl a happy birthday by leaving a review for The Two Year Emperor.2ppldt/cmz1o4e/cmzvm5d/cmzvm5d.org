Most definitely. During which you will continue to get weekly drops of my writing. Especially now that I'm taking a shot at going full-time with it. :>

As to being older...when I was 10, birthdays were excellent. At 20 they were fine (although 25 was hard for some reason). From 30-35 they were ok. From 36-40 they were less than good. Now, at 44, they are ok again. Here's hoping they stay that way.
