Congratulations, EagleJarl!

You managed to survive up to today, despite the untold number of dangers you, undoubtedly, face every day. From the tiny germs of disease to the Sol's massive might, you have avoided them all due to some luck and a little prudence.

You have dealt with the crazed and deranged members of our society even as you strove to better see through the madness all for the effort to choose, not the right path, but the */optimal/* path.

Sure, your body is a little older and your mind is a little wiser (hopefully!) than the one you had last year. But that just means you have endured and shrugged off what the world had thrown at you over the last 12 months.

You are one badass for lasting up to now.

Think you're up for another year?
