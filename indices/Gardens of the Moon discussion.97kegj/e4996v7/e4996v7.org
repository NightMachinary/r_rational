Trying hard to remember everything. Circle breaker is not fiddler, he's just a guy from darujistan. Ralick nom is definitely not an ascendant, and paran's brush with ascendancy starts with getting the blood of the hounds on him. Mother dark is from the realm of the tiste, just like all the other elves.

Ascendants aren't quite gods. Both are powerful and immortal but ascendants don't have a religion tied to them. There might be something else to it I can't remember though.

And I liked adjunct lorn the best, I wished she stuck around longer. Her journey with tool was my favourite part of the book.
