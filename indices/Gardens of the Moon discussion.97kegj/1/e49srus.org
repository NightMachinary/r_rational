It has been over a year since I read MBoTF so my memory might be a bit hazy.

Circle breaker is not a major character as far as I can remember, I don't even remember the name.

Parans path did to Ascendancy did start with bathing/absorbing the blood of the Hounds of Shadows, this turned him into a soletaken, which are basically werebeasts as in they have a beast form.

Ascendants are those who have transcended mortality, as in they have hit the level cap if you think of it in game terms, they are the strongest players other than the gods and most of them are incredibly long lived or ridiculously powerful but not yet gods, they can probably turn into gods if they develop a religion and get enough worshippers. Also the Deck of Dragons plays a part in kind of selecting ascendants, as most of the powerful ascendants are tied to a card in the deck.

And yes the goddess of Darkness is from the realm of Tiste Andii

My favourite characters are Ganoes Paran and Rallick Nom
