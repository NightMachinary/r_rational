Absolutely interested! It's funny, I know you've tagged the thing as fantasy, but in a weird way, the first chapter recalls to mind "Radio Lab" or "This American Life", where they talk about how the reporter found the story initially; I see the same thing in your character, Emily as she stumbles onto the life of this philosopher. Honestly, if it doesn't do anything supernatural (which I'm usually all about), I wouldn't be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're taking this to crazy-town, don't let me stop you in any way.

I look forward to reading more!
