This American Life? That may be the highest compliment I've ever received. Thank you!

If you're enjoying the beginning of Things That Keep Us Small, you'd probably love The End of Mr. Y by Scarlett Thomas if you haven't read it already. I'm pretty much writing this because I wish there were more books like that.

Updates coming soon... Craziness...well...spoilers.
