I didn't mean freeform in that sense, I meant in the sense that you could in principle put gravity any way you wanted it. It's a subjective rule, not an objective one.

[edit] I keep looking at this world in terms of a setting like /Ra/ with their massive metamagic supporting the regular magic that's going on, like, what sort of universe do you need so you can have magic that just says "okay, do what the user means here" and ask this to the universe and get a /reliable/ answer back? And then you realize that this is limited by area so, what, do you just run out of coverage? Does consent-determination become patchy, or does a spell that normally returns -1 to 1 start returning values in the 0.1/-0.1 range? And what about metabeliefs; what if you consent but don't want to consent? This entire project seems pretty AI complete, and that would worry me normally but I could easily see a post-singularity universe looking like this does, so I guess it's reasonable.
