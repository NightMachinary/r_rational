  Also: is the gravity just completely freeform? I had the impression it depended on which way your feet had last touched the ground.

/Almost/ - it's not freeform or solipsistic, and the Rocks aren't sentient (that anyone knows of). A good direction for unpicking the riddle might be to consider this scenario:

You're new to BDSM and walk into a dungeon for the first time, and everyone's involved in stuff that constitutes a surprisingly wide swath of rule 34. Once the you've cleared away the thought that this is what your great aunt thinks Hell looks and sounds like, you'll begin to notice that there as some scenes which attract you, some you don't care for, and some which repulse you. It probably won't follow any kind of /rule/, but it's not freeform or arbitrary either. Understand what's going on for you in that moment and you understand a little of what's behind the gravity in Sade Hall - and why Raldr's having trouble.

Yet, in CFMC, our narrator experiences not a moment of instability despite not even believing that this system is /possible/. I'm claiming these are the same system working the same way and it's not just that Blue-Eyes happens to be somehow more enlightened than Raldr.

Yeah, I didn't think cool gravity would turn out to be some big existential riddle either.
