Neat. Good to see the setting fleshed out a little.

The ending came a bit out of nowhere; might have been better if it was foreshadowed slightly more? It's also slightly iffy because Stayan is a dragon who is himself hunting a dragon, so it's unclear which dragon he is on first read because we can't necessarily trust what he's saying.

Also, some style issues:

#+begin_quote
  the best most of those Lilim who first make it to Sade Hall as adults can muster is a stubborn insistence
#+end_quote

"best most who first can muster" is awkward

#+begin_quote
  that will not be relinquished no matter how sexy the potential new playmate walking on “the ceiling.”
#+end_quote

... is? If this is supposed to be a deliberately archaic grammar, don't do that. Write clearly before fanciful.

#+begin_quote
  not even his wandering (by local standards) Uncle Reed.
#+end_quote

parens are usually a sign that something wants to be a separate sentence. also note that this is raldr's narration, who would naturally consider his standards the default ones.

#+begin_quote
  By all rights, this should have unhinged him---especially since he managed to avoid the small army of Sade who dutifully cruise the border places between the Garden and Sade Hall looking for frightened Lilim. Many claim the greatest of all his mighty deeds was managing to walk all the way from the border with the Garden to the Library in Sade Hall without being “helped,” but he was determined to reach the library.
#+end_quote

Awkward flow. "Greatest deeds" reference seems pointless and goes nowhere. The tense change also makes this awkward, and the guide Sade are not introduced before or referenced after.

#+begin_quote
  After only a few minutes of shock, he steeled himself.
#+end_quote

Also connects awkwardly to the previous paragraph (his shock and halting is not described.)

#+begin_quote
  and she was summoned off with reassurances that someone would be sure to come along to help the cute Lilim boy, waving her tail goodbye.
#+end_quote

Sentence fragments connect a bit awkwardly.

#+begin_quote
  and many of them seemed as nice and approachable as one he had just met
#+end_quote

the one

#+begin_quote
  far from the brooding monsters of shadow his Uncle Reed warned him about.
#+end_quote

had warned

#+begin_quote
  Foodies eat well,
#+end_quote

maybe "Foodies ate well,"

#+begin_quote
  but that encounter was a very long time ago.
#+end_quote

had been

#+begin_quote
  Even as he followed the spiral down in the dark through the roots of the mountains, it was several weeks more before he could be sure that they lead where he intended to the bottom of the sea and the door to Sade Hall. The whole time he was in that cave he saw no one until he found the wood and iron door that said “Sade,” and it was a full day's walk from the cave to the library.
#+end_quote

had followed, had been several weeks, had been in that cave, had seen no one, had been a full day's

#+begin_quote
  He left the group and went a short way down the hall and picked up a book called “Healing Songs” and flipped through.
#+end_quote

Three 'and' in a row. Maybe replace the middle one with a comma? "flipped through it"?

#+begin_quote
  “This is in Draconic,” he said. “This must be the way.”
#+end_quote

In retrospect, I love how much Stayan is sandbagging here.

#+begin_quote
  “I didn't study Draconic in university or anything,” Stayan said “Since then, it's been kind of hard to avoid.”
#+end_quote

haha

#+begin_quote
  ”Speaking of hunting,” Stayan said. “I've always wanted to know what it's like to hunt as a vampire. My people were all foodies.
#+end_quote

Missing endquote. (Also, would dragons still count as foodies if they eat humans, because they're separate species? Or would it be like .. "Carnies"?)

#+begin_quote
  Still, it was obvious Stayan's curiosity was just curiosity.
#+end_quote

Slightly awkward. "Still, it was obvious Stayan meant no slight."?

#+begin_quote
  It was true. He had been chased many times by those chasing rumors and power, and they had traded with him---those who had something suitably precious to offer---but he had never encountered someone like this, someone who, he would later learn, caught the smoke of his desire for a hunter in the web of dream and followed it with the longing for that musty bookish darkness and his looming presence.
#+end_quote

"He would later learn" and that type of setups are kind of a little awkward? Takes you out of the action, and is a bit hard to connect to what's happened before on first reading.

#+begin_quote
  He lost the heat trail and scent of his friend,
#+end_quote

had lost

#+begin_quote
  He pulled back and looked into the eyes of his friend and saw the cat-like pupils of a dragon.
#+end_quote

/Daww./

Also: is the gravity just completely freeform? I had the impression it depended on which way your feet had last touched the ground.
