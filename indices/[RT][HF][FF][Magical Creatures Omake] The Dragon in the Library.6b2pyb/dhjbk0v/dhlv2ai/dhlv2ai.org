Excellent! I like her style and will likely be following "Things That Keep Us Small" as well, assuming it goes somewhere.

I also like the whole musical backdrop thing. "The Ravens In the Library" is a cute song, and I like that there's this whole thread of music to every chapter, even if it's not usually my taste. Well, except for Neros Dubstep Symphony, because BBC Philharmonic Orchestra.

(Side note, I always hear [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7kzKfwwDFRc][Keep Your Eyes Peeled]] in my head when reading CFMC)
