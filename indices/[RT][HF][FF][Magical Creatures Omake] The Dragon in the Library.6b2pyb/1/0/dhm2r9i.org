This is one of those mystery stories that doesn't reveal itself as a mystery until after the first read. It's not for everybody, but I personally love to read stories that reward a second read for clues.

  Also, would dragons still count as foodies if they eat humans, because they're separate species? Or would it be like .. "Carnies"?

"Foodies" is a term used by vampires in the Garden for people who eat what humans most often think of as food--as opposed to, say, the blood of your kin.

Frankly, I'm not sure. I showed this story to Soren_Tycho, and I was like, "Do I get it?" And I do. Apparently. (He said to me, "You get it in that you understand the sort of problems Raldr would have.") I get a little dizzy like Raldr when I try to understand it, though. Soren_Tycho says he'll answer this question in more detail soon.
