  If so, is the logic Tortoise using incomplete and/or inconsistent?
#+end_quote

I'd say it's both complete and consistent:

- complete (every theorem comes out true)
- consistent (all statements which are true are theorems)

but totally *useless*, like a typechecker that accepts everything, whether it's well-typed or not.
