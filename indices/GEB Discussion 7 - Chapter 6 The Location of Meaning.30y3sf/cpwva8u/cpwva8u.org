a) I found the discussion about =earth chauvinism= wrt the definition of =intelligence= really good. What /if/ we swim in messages and we are unable to identify them due to the unknown frame message?

b) I had to think more about the daily implicit context that we all take for granted and the difficult trade-off on how much context has to be explicated before the =inner message= is lost again because nobody understands what you wanted to say originally.

c) [[/u/rspeer]] has some nice points in the wiki, for example about the =Voynich manuscript= or =Voyager golden record=, thanks!
