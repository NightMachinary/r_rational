Remembering how good this series is I decided to re-read it, and I was struck by the fragments of the message left behind by the matriarch in Chapter 26:

[Missing] ...mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into this but... [Missing] ...simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before... [Missing] ...can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was... [Missing] ...can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly... [Missing] ...hope it won't be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to... [Missing] ...whole other continent. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of... [Missing]

A few key points that don't seem to be fully addressed: The matriarch clearly tells Zorian that the time loop is degrading, and his time is limited, yet it still seems like there is all the time in the world. It just seems like things could go on, without end... Additionally the one winner part seems rather important, as do other bits, yet Zorian seems to dismiss it all far too casually. (This is all just my opinion, of course.)
