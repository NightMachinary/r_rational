For the first point, it would depend on the actions of Zach. When RR encountered Zorian at the beginning of the loop, he was surprised since he believed the loopers were the aranea. Even if he thought he got everything from Zach, he'd still try to interrogate him again. And don't forget, thought and memory reading is imperfect and slow, especially for deep memories. He only got the surface thoughts on the night of the soul kill.

So it would depend on whether Zach went looking for Zorian at school in that loop, or immediately went into hiding.
