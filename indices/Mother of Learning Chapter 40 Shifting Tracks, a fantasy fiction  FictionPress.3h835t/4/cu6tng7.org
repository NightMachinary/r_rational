So, it seems we will get time loop explanation relatively soon.

My favourite theory is a primordial prison failsafe.

The loop probably started at summer festival, because we now know that dormitories (with original Zorian inside) are not destroyed without RR interference. The loop probably goes for a short time in the host world with great time dilation for the guest world.

Zach might be the original sacrifice, and prison is configured to select it, because sacrifice restrictions filter out unsuitable heroes. His marker probably has higher privileges as well.

The endstory bossfight might get quite big.
