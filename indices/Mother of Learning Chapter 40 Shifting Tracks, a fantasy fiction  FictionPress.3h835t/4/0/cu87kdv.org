I kind of like this theory. But i think that Zorian's marker was more of an accident by the result of the failsafe. Xvim also seems linked to this. Maybe the reason he's asking all these unreasonable manipulation tasks is to weed out the time traveler and assist him/her on his quest. Surely he doesn't know who has the marker in the first place, so this is the method he uses.
