I wonder if it's possible that RR knows about Zorian already but for what ever reason won't act against him. After the soul kill incident there were two ways I can think of for RR to learn who Zorian is:

1. If Zach hung around in that loop he could go use mind magic to extract the information, because Zach learned it was Zorian at the end of the soul kill loop.
2. If he did an investigation he could have found out who was missing in that loop.

If Daimen was RR and found out he was fighting with his brother, do you think he'd leave the city alone?
