Maybe the loop won't wind down, and the only way to end it is to soul"kill" /everyone/? That might just be Red Robe's end goal, and he's trying to do it in a way that won't get the rest of the world's powers converging on him when he's half done.

Or maybe emptying the loop will just effectively end the universe. Who knows?
