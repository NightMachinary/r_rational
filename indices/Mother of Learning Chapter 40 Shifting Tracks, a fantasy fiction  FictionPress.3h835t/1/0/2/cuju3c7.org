Yea, the ones on tvtropes are the best. All you Need is Kill is on my book-reading-eventually-list and I have heard good things about it. I haven't heard of the others but have no real experience in the Ranma/Ponies universe. I'll probably give them a read once I have a better foundation. Anyhoo, thanks! :D
