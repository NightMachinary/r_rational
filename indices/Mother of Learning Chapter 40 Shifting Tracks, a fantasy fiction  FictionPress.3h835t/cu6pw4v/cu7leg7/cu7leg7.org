  "The Sovereign Gate is an artifact supposedly dating back from his time," Alanic said. "Like many great rulers, Shutur-Tarana has a great many fanciful stories and grandiose claims associated with him, and this particular one claims he either made or found a doorway into another world. Having found he did not age at all while on the other side, he spent '11 lifetimes' there, learning their secrets and honing his skills. Eventually, he grew homesick and decided to go back home. Once he was back in his own world, however, he found the doors forever barred to him. He stored the Sovereign Gate in his royal vault, there to wait for a worthy successor who would repeat his feat and usher the empire in a new age with the wisdom gained from the other side. Or, well, resurrect it... since it is thoroughly dead at this point."

Yeah, but even if it's degrading, if it originally lasted 11 lifetimes like in the Sovereign's Gate story, it's probably still got a good bit of energy left, even considering that it's probably doing triple duty now. (Which is just one theory about the origin of the time loop, but an interesting one.)

The part I found most interesting was the "can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was". I'm assuming "him" is Red Robe, and that he can leave the time loop at any time, but the Matriarch might have just been referring to him leaving the city and cutting his losses if he knew he'd get interference there.

The strangest part to me is the last line, which mentions a "whole other continent" we've had almost no mention or interaction with another continent besides Zorian's parents vacationing to where his oldest brother is.
