Not a typo strictly, but it seemed odd:

#+begin_quote
  'Damn it, Kiri, I get enough of that crap at the beginning of each *loop!*' thought Zorian
#+end_quote

Then later

#+begin_quote
  "I'm afraid this *loop* is just about to end."
#+end_quote

Unless this is a most ridiculous hint ever, shouldn't he be calling these "restarts"?
