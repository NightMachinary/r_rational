I recommend the movie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film][Groundhog Day]] if you have not already seen it.

The Harry Potter fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7069833/1/Geminio][Geminio]] is a good related fic, though it's not a time loop fic. It's the kind of fic you should read without reading reviews or summaries. [[#s][Spoiler]]
