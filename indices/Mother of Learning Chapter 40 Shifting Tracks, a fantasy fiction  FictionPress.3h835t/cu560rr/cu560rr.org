Another month, another chapter. My only criticism of this story is of how long I have to wait between chapters... heh, a month time loop, a month(ish) between chapters...

Since I'm (once again) dying for another chapter, are there any other good time-loop stories out there? Aside from Time Braid I haven't been able to find many that aren't crackfics or single-backwards-time-travel-do-overs. (aka peggy sue)
