I read a terminator one that I really liked but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called....

-edit- Found it! [[http://rationalfiction.io/story/branches-on-the-tree-of-time][Branches on the tree of time]]. Plus there is another Naruto looping fic that was pretty good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][time braid]]

-edit2- And I just realized you probably didn't meantion time braid because he explicitely mentions it in his post.
