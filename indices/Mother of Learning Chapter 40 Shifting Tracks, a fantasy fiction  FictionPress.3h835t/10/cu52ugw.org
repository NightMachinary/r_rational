I love Baader-Meinhof. In church this morning, the priest was talking about how frequently Jesus said he was the Bread of Life in that particular chapter of John, and he mentioned that repetitio mater studiorum est. Of course, this got me thinking about Mother of Learning, and wondering when the next update would come.
