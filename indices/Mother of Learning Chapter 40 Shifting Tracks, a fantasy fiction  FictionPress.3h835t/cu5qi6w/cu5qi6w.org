Oh yay, I'm glad I found this subreddit. Seems like the perfect place for something I wanted to bring up. I don't know if anyone else noticed it, but here I go...

Over the couple of re-reads I did during the wait for a new chapter, there was one off-hand comment that really interested me. In chapter 17, as the matriarch explained what being "Open" meant to Zorian, she mentioned that one of the characteristics was having "an occasional prophetic dream".

On the next re-read, I noticed there /was/ one instance where Zorian's dreams had been mentioned: in chapter 5, just after Zorian restarts for the first time, where though he speculates that he was just dreaming, he reasons that his dreams were usually bizarre and fleeting and that the memories he got from his previous live-through of the month had "no talking birds, floating pyramids, three-eyed wolves and other surreal scenes his dreams usually contained".

Hmm...

Chapter 28: when Silverlake starts a conversation with him, "the source of the speech was the raven perched on a nearby branch".

Chapter 38: during another of Xvim's sessions, one of the shapes that Zorian was ordered to make out of the mass of marbles he had to levitate was a pyramid.

I think we can assume that there'll be a three-eyed wolf sometime in the future? Possibly the Silver One/the sapient alpha wolf guarding Iasku Mansion?
