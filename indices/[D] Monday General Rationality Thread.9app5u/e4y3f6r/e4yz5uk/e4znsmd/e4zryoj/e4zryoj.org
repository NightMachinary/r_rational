Here's something that works really well for me. Set a super-low effort daily goal for yourself. Very often, the hardest part of any daily endeavor is simply motivating yourself to get started. When I needed to exercise daily, I set a goal of doing only 5 push-ups. It was so simple and easy to do that I never missed a day without doing 5 push-ups. However, despite only needing to do 5, I often did a lot more exercise than just the push-ups. Granted there were plenty more days where I did just the 5 push-ups, but I did a lot more workouts than if I was trying to motivate myself into a full workout plan.

So for yourself, I strong suggest that you set a required daily goal of writing a sentence minimum each day no matter what.
