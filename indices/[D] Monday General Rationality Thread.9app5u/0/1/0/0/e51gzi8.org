  I guess I was expecting some more complex counter-strategies after so much accumulated game experience.

Part of that's going to be limited by the complexity of the world. I've never played DOTA myself, but I understand from context that it's a pretty complex world; and increasing the complexity means that the AI needs to increase the amount of training it requires to reach the same level of expertise.

Of course, playing mostly against itself doesn't help (unless it first learns how to exploit those flaws, it won't learn how to react to someone else exploiting those flaws) and neither does only having a week to learn in; but those two points just increase the odds of there being exploitable flaws in the AI in the first place. The inability to adapt to novel strategies on-the-fly is, unfortunately, pretty much baked in to the architecture that they're using.
