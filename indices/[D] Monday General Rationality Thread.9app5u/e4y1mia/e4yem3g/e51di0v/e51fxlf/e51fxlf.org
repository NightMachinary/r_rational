Yeah, they did mention somewhere that the AI was locked to a specific version, but I guess I was expecting some more complex counter-strategies after so much accumulated game experience. Perhaps it's a limitation of playing mostly against itself. Even if they can include the few training matches against humans, it might not provide enough data as it seems to be learning through trial-and-error ad infinitum. One caveat is that the version they used only had about a week to adapt to the new rules, so it might be possible that they would have shored up those weaknesses given more time.
