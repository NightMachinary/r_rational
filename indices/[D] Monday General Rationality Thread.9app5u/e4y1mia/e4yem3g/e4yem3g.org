I really think the courier usage was vital for how OpenAI beat humans the first few games, and the rules change for couriers made all the difference in the world in how the AI played and how the humans played.

For those with less contextual knowledge: In regular Dota 2 there is a unit called a 'courier' that each team has one of. This unit's job is to ferry items from places that you can buy items (your main base, a specific shop outside your base) to players. It's very fragile and can be killed and takes a long time to respawn, so you can't really use it during fights or near opponents at all. As well as more permanent items, you can use the courier to transfer consumable items that give temporary healing to your heros, but because there is one courier for the entire team you have to plan and share it and use it intelligently. Most teams in current professional dota 2 allow their 'mid' player to monopolize courier use for ferrying regen and items for the first few levels.

Anyways, in the OpenAI experiment, for the first set of games against a ragtag bunch of humans, every player and every bot had an invincible (not fragile!) courier dedicated to their own use. The openAI players used theirs to *constantly* ferry regeneration items to themselves, in a way that would be totally impossible in regular dota 2 for side lanes. This sufficiently changed the way the game was played that the early and midgame bore a lot less resemblance to regular dota 2 in terms of strategy and play, and also warped later stages somewhat. By making the game into something no human player had experienced before, it naturally gave bots a large advantage - they were constantly doing risky things and trading life by diving under towers etc. because the humans didn't really adapt to the odd environment well in the time allotted. When the bots played against the professional teams, at TI, instead of this they had only one courier per team, which made the game resemble normal dota 2 a lot more, and humans were way ahead of bots.

Looking forward to seeing if they can develop a more sophisticated AI system than what they had this time round, and maybe take matches off of humans in completely normal play with no restrictions.

PS: The grand finals were AMAZING this year, and also most of the other matches were really good too. OG vs LGD in the Upper Bracket and also Grand Finals were each an amazing set of games, well worth the time to watch.
