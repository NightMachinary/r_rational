I responded to that when it was originally posted.

Here you have a group of transcendent beings who look similar to fakes, and deliberately refuse to answer in such a way as to make themselves look /exactly/ like fakes.

It's sort of like "what if creationism is true, but God makes the fossils look exactly as they would have if creationism is false and evolution is true". Only when it comes to mysticism and religion do believers have the nerve to say "well, it looks just like a fake, but you should believe it anyway".
