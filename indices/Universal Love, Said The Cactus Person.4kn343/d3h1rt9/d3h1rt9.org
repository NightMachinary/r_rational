The very first comment on this post asks the question

#+begin_quote
  Obviously this is an allegoric metaphor, but I don't fully understand it. Perhaps someone can elaborate on what it means in more literal terms?
#+end_quote

and then there is a whole long nested-comment-tree of responses. Many of these responses continue the GET OUT OF THE CAR metaphor, which is somewhat frustrating because continuing to speak in terms of a metaphor is not a very useful response to someone asking the question "can you please explain this metaphor to me?" Anyhow, my point is, I don't see anyone who actually answers the question. So I'd like to ask it again: /What the fuck is this story about?/
