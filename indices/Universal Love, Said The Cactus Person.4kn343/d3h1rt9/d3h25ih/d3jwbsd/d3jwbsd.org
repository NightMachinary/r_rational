One interpretation (certainly not definitive) is:

The car is your conscious mind. The road is your body, and the various places that you drive are physical experiences. The story rests on an identity separate from continuity of thought, so we need to talk about "you" (qua agent or person) versus "you" (qua personality and memories). The story insists that you qua agent is the more fundamental metric of identity.

In the story, a person has used their body to imbibe DMT, a psychadelic drug. The person then converses with a hallucinatory cactus and a bat of multiple identities, pressing the hallucinations for the proper factorization of a large number. This is implied to be a test for the objective existence of the hallucinations (especially as having access to knowledge or power beyond the chemically stimulated brain of the drug user).

The story equates chemically changing the protagonist's mental state with driving to the top of a mountain to ask how to get out of the car. The road has taken the car to a scenic vista on top of the mountain. Similarly, the protagonist's physical body has taken the mind to an exotic state. But, the protagonist is still trying to use conscious thought, even in this exotic mental state. Thus, the protagonist qua agent is refusing to get out of the car (i.e. abandon conscious thought or logic).

The more coherent of the hallucinations proposes the argument that even providing evidence (by factoring the protagonist's very large number) will not help the protagonist to achieve their goals. Specifically, using the vantage point outside of conscious thought ("outside the car") to improve the functioning of conscious thought ("inside the car") will not help the agent to abandon conscious thought.

The story concludes with the protagonist falling out of the hallucinatory state. However, the characters remain, and appear to have successfully factored the very large number.

The context of the story relies on a long tradition that distinguishes the self from the mind. Even in western thought, there is a divide between experience and the memory of experience. The book /Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance/ follows a similar line or inquiry while discussing various aesthetic and metaphysical questions since the foundation of philosophy (Socrates / Plato).

Now, it's worth saying that patience with these ideas will vary across and within populations. But I am curious about why/how your parsing of the analogy was different than mine. Is the Zen idea of (ill-defined) "experience outside of conscious thought" something that you have run across before?

TL/DR: "Get out of the car" == adopt a non-cognitive experiential framework.

Edit to add: "Paths you cannot travel" are experiences that cannot be had by the conscious mind. If you've read Godel Escher Bach, you might think of these paths as true theorems that cannot be derived by the set of axioms your conscious mind has adopted.
