I could be wrong, but my understanding is that, in this metaphor, the car is your body and the driver is your soul. The DMT-entity is telling him that his material world with scientific proof and all is just what he sees through the windshield (his physical senses), but there are places where the car (his body) cannot go, but his soul could. And so on. In this case, getting out of the car is kind of what hallucination-land is, with your mind/soul going somewhere your body couldn't.

Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm too far off the mark.
