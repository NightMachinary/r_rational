I don't think I managed to get out of the car, but I do think I managed to roll down the window, at least.

Near as I can tell, it's an orthogonal action. If you could take the cross-product of everything you've already done, the action you need to take is in that new direction. By definition, anything you've already done is not Getting Out Of The Car.

Also, I got a tarot reading (I did Science! on it, actually) which was suprisingly helpful, advised me to meditate, and so I've been doing that with I /think/ the effect of greater energy / verve / happiness. (The tarot reading basically said "You're exhausting yourself (you know why/how), so stop that, and start meditating.")
