We can probably assume for narrative purposes that other obvious tests, like attempting to ensoul a pencil to see if it's an issue with Bill's computer, would fail. We can also probably assume that they didn't just forget the name. And we can rule out any action by Ana, as Aaron could telepathically tell if she was sabotaging them somehow.

So, it's probably some form of outside interference. Maybe Unsong is on to them already, or maybe Uriel or Thamiel keep an eye out for the Vital Name and take it offline if a human uses it. Either way, it's a bad sign.
