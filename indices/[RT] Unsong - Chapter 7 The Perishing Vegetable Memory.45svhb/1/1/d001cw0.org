Agreed with [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] that we should /not/ assume other obvious tests would fail. Maybe what the Vital Name /does/ is create a new ensouled species, and once a certain kind of thing is ensouled, all other ensoulments of that kind of thing must be made by procreation.

+Or, uhhh, maybe casting the Vital Name on his Mac immediately ensouled /all/ Macs, maybe the one he borrowed /already/ has a soul.+

+This is about Adam. We do not read about whether Eve was ensouled with the Vital Name, or if the mere shaping of clay/his rib into a human form was sufficient thereafter.+

I~~ think this is my current preferred theory, just for the sheer magnitude to which it makes "Thinking through the implications of our discoveries was not exactly a family strong point" /even more/ the understatement of the millennium.~~
