"Does WoT change in later chapters?"

FTFY.

Seriously, keep it positive. You don't like it, that's fine, and try to do constructive criticism. If that's something you struggle with, use "I" statements: "it cheapens it for me", "I feel like it's trying too hard to be clever". That won't necessarily lead to constructive criticism, but I certainly feel like it helps me out when I'm trying to, myself.

As to your specific points -\\
- Seems pretty clear to me that the "computery" stuff is just a... description layer? on top of something that's more real. No-one else gets the LitRPG perks, although they might be able to pull off similar effects. "Null pointer" actually means something, I'm pretty sure, although it's still just my own guesswork.\\
- I agree that the meta-narrative analysis getting to be a bit much, but I don't get the "too clever". For me it's the usual "too much" when it just makes sense to plan the shit out of everything, which means you get bogged down in planning for tiny spurts of violence. Consequence of people at national power levels doing things intelligently, AFAICT.\\
- I think you're really missing the deep, weird nuance to the "harem", particularly how each character is both their own person, _and_ an emotional foil for something in particularly about Juniper, _and_ the existential and moral questioning that comes from that duality.

I don't think you'll like how it progresses (with a couple of exceptions) as it just gets deeper into the stuff that you're not liking.... but I'm also not hearing you actually tuning into the aspects that I find amazing about those elements. I do agree with you about wondering if the payoff is coming; the story is dealing with some heavy and painful stuff - I mean, the plot practically starts with Arthur's death - and it'll pay off if June "gets better", and that translates to "everyone else gets better". We're seeing that, it's just slow - Grak's story as it goes is a really good example, although it's not really done.
