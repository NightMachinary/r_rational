While the characters are further and further explored and fleshed out, they never really break character to change their habits, and stay largely in the archetype that is your first impression of them. AW does a pretty decent job exploring the justifications for why they are that archetype, but at the end of the latest chapter, they are still exactly what they are presented as. Which I think is interesting, because people broadly don't change their personalities or outlook on life just because they share their backstory with you. Rather, your outlook on a person changes depending on how well your understanding of them develops.

In genre fiction, casts are often built on archetypes, and the meta of the story is setting up those archetypes because that's the kind of world the story is exploring. So the characters are going to stick to their mold, but you understand better why they are molded the way they are. And that can be said for most characters in most stories. There's plenty of "depth", but perhaps you're issue is that there isn't enough "width". If you can't get past the surface level of "Amy is a big-titted, hypercapable princess the MC is attracted to, just like you see in so many harem anime", and become attached to her backstory and self-analysis of why she is that way and continues to be that way, well, you're not going to appreciate the cast very much.

Which is fine. WtC's cast tends to turn me off upon first contact with a new character. Whether they impress me from there tends to be hit or miss. I'm mostly in for how creative the crazy-quilt setting is.
