Read until around chapter 120 if you've come this far. In one way or another your complaints get addressed. Later on the computer stuff will make sense from a different perspective, but it doesn't come up anymore. Narrative thinking comes up from time to time (because it is so relevant to Arthur), but doesn't dominate the story. The characters all get development in ways I think you'll like.

I will say that Juniper's love life never stops being part of the story, so if that really bothers you then maybe the story just isn't your cup of tea. As for payoffs, there are several climactic moments that I think fit the bill, which I won't spoil for you.
