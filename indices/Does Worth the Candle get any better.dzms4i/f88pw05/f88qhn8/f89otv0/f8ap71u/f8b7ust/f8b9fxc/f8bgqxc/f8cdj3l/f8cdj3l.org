It sounds like we have different ideas on what "character development" means in this case. Her character becomes more developed in that we /see/ further complexity to it, when she is prompted to open up about her past and take off her wacky rogue mask. It would be nice if we saw changes and a greater arc to her character as well, but by the definition above she certain became more developed.
