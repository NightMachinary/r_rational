Yeah. To be clear, I am not interested in demonizing your criticism: you have a wholly legitimate right to your own views.

My problem is that, when unacquainted with some critic's history, I have no good way to distinguish insightful from illegitimate criticism except gut checks. Unfortunately, I think there are many people who would tar good books as bad just for bizarre ideological reasons, which taints my impression of such criticisms as a class. I would like to get beyond that.

Taking inspiration from your comment, I suppose one thing that is helpful is moving beyond "X is sexist" and into discussions of the consequences of that supposed sexism, "judging by the fruits". Then I can assess whether some choice of the author is sexist by observing whether it impoverishes a story or not, relative to some posited non-sexist counterfactual. If it does not, that is an argument against its being sexist. If a choice actively enhances a story, that is a very strong argument against its being sexist. These are indirect tests, and would be easy to mock, but I think still very good ones.

This risks collapsing into my personal preferences vindicating themselves, but I think that's a much better risk to court than the risk of being talked into disliking things I'd otherwise enjoy, provided I earnestly try to see the world from others' view.

Getting back to this topic, then, I wonder what you think a less superficial version of each or any of these women might look like.

My perspective is that Amaryllis is intentionally supposed to be creepily well-suited for Juniper in many ways, but she shows depth through her nearly autistic ruthlessness. I agree Fenn is a somewhat boring character, but I think she's a necessary archetype - she is important via her effects on others in the group, and for her flavor, and I don't think it's at all wrong or bad for authors to extract utility from their creations in that way. And I think Valencia could stand to be made a little darker and less innocent, overtly (there are some hints she is terrifying, later in the story, but they are not as drawn out as I'd like). But I wouldn't really chalk these down to sexism, I suppose because I strongly enjoy the story and description of these characters overall.

I guess another point, generally, is that we should try to weigh good against bad in our assessment of different characters' quality.

The main draw of the story, for me, is a combination of the meta-commentary and the RPG "build" elements, many of which are somewhat standard "Gamer" story tropes but especially well-executed. I almost see the character interactions as an extension of both these draws, which might be part of why we have such different impressions of the work. Have you played any RPG video games with party interaction systems, like Mass Effect or similar?

Additionally, the work is unfinished, and it's not clear to me how these might change as it goes forward. I have trust in AlexanderWales as an author, which might be playing a role here - my expectation is that at least some of the issues I have with characters in the story are there so that they can experience character development.

You've been a helpful sounding board for me, thanks for provoking these thoughts.
