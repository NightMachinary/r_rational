In a lot of cases in harem anime the MC's participation is either accidental or semi unwilling. This helps to maintain a relatable "I never thought this would happen to me" factor. The MC is varying degrees of attracted to, indifferent to, terrified by, and affectionate towards members in his harem, but they are all attracted to him. Negima! Is a big example of this but it's pretty common. Even in Love Hina he's just trying to find somewhere affordable to live.

Edit: In the older fate stay/night anime he's not even socially aware enough to notice that they like him, and is oblivious when they get jealous and fight over him.
