I think thats just pretty inherent with genre tags though - and its contextual here. We are using harem in reference to Worth the Candle - which only has harem elements, but is primarily an isekai story. So its logical to compare it to the big isekai stories out there that have harem elements, as opposed to a straight romantic comedy. To talk about an isekai story subverting anything without being able to mention SAO would I think be a hard sell - and there are in fact unique tropes to the "isekai power protagonist's harem" that other shows wont have.

(but I am team "the harem genre tag is not helpful, we are only using it cause OP used it", for what thats worth)
