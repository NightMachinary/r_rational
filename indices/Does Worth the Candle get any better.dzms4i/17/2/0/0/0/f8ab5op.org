"Doesn't want to hook up" also descibes large numbers of actual-harem shows, if that whats we want to go by though. Just to take a few:

Urusei Yatsura - Ataru is uninterested in Lum and bored of his dating-at-the-start girlfriend, preferring to be single, rarely expresses interest.

Sword Art Online (the grandaddy of Isekai Harem) - Kiroto meets and dates his canon girlfriend, then proceeds to meet and reject a litany of female characters so much so that they are known by fans as the "spurned women's club".

Ouran Highschool Club - To flip genders, Haruhi dates Tamaki but only ever has flirtatious or tension-filled moments with the others, never actual other relationships.

I could obviously keep going, but I made sure to name the super-famous ones here, shows that define a genre. Sure there are harem shows where the main character does sleep with everyone, its just not at all a standard trope in the genre.

I will bet that when all is said and done, Juniper will have engaged in sexual relationships with more of his "harem" than the median harem protagonist.

I do prefer to use love triangle etc not because WtC doesnt have these "harem" elements, but because the word "harem" is a poisoned well to mean "raunchy animated comedy", which WtC obviously isnt. The OP used the word harem, and there is an aspect of harem/love triangle media in WtC that is part of its appeal, and which it plays straight. But of course it is not Ranma 1/2.
