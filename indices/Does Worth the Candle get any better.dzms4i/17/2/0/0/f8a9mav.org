But it's not that the characters don't hook up with the protagonist, it's that the protagonist doesn't want to hook up. The whole point of the trope is that it's a fantasy of having multiple relationships at the same time. I would say that a love triangle or regular romance plots don't match at all, since those are, usually, centered in a conflict of someone having to choose between different relationships.

Which is, indeed, what's happening in WtC. Even back when Fenn was around, Juniper explicitly chooses Fenn over pursuing Amaryllis. That doesn't fit a harem trope at all.

The DM definitely intended it to be a harem, and I have no doubt that if Juniper had decided to pursue that it would have worked out for him. But him choosing not to do so is exactly what makes it subverting.
