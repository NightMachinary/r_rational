I see. I didn't realize the main character's personal issues were such an important point for the author. I think it's because those issues really don't resonate with me at all, so my mind just kind of glossed over them. If anything, it made me dislike the main character a little bit.

On the other hand, hardly any of the problems faced by characters in Ward and Worm are relatable to me, but I cared a lot more about what happened to them, and never developed that same dislike for them. So maybe there's a difference in writing style that caused me to kind of check out of Worth the Candle.

On the plus side, I now have a ton of stuff I can +plagiarize+ reference if I ever start my own DnD campaign.
