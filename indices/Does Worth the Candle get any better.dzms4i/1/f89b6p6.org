No the part you're at I already considered great.

>computer system, meta commentary

as in the title, the whole situation is contrived and trying to extract meaning from it if any exists is the protagonists primary motivation and largely the crux of the plot

>characters relationships

pretty much everything you describe undergoes a 180 degree turn around at some point but if you're going to quite you can just read the spoilers

>The self-aware [[https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/][r/menwritingwomen]] is also terrible

This is the only part I don't get. This is a sub largely dedicated to people who are squeamish about sex complaining about how it gets referenced in the media. Even the title gets routinely mocked since they regularly feature romance novels written by women. How this relates to WtC which treats sexuality pretty realistically with all the weird abortive awkwardness of having to navigate around a partner who has their own understanding of how these things work is beyond me.

Unless it's just that the protagonist is straight. In which case yes the protagonist remains straight. Well mostly.
