  I didn't like Practical Guide, specifically because the meta narrative stuff is just part of the world and you have to live with it. Oh, these two characters have already had two fights, so the third one is just going to go this way because that's how the narrative works.

Well, yes and no. It spends a long time setting that up as the default, so that it can play around with the idea later. It gets a lot more interesting than "you can't fight only twice".
