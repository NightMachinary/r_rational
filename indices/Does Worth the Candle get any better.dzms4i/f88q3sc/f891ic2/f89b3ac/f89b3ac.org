Practical Guide to Evil has heavy meta themes, but it's as a part of the world everyone is living in, it's just something that's accepted and part of it. Worth the Candle is, and this comes up fairly early so it's not a big spoiler, a world where the protagonist designed the world, and then was dumped into it. It's like a dungeons and dragons adventure where the DM is dumped into the game. So he knows all the tropes and world building stuff and isn't really big into following along with it, but it's still forced on him anyway.

I didn't like Practical Guide, specifically because the meta narrative stuff is just part of the world and you have to live with it. Oh, these two characters have already had two fights, so the third one is just going to go this way because that's how the narrative works. Worth the Candle is more, and this is the point in the story where the dwarf joins the party and dwarves come from reclusive underground societies. And then it spends the rest his plot totally taking that narrative apart because the protagonist realizes it and doesn't play along.

I share OP's opinion about the soul mage plotline. It seemed a bit too obvious and there was no big payoff at the end of it. But it's still fairly well done and most of the rest of the story doesn't have that problem.
