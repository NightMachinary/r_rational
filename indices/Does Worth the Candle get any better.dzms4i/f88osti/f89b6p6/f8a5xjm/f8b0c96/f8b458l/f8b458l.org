The last time I remember seeing them on the front page was a post about werewolf erotica written by a woman that was supposed to be "in the spirit of the sub" now clicking there I find people arguing that male POV characters describing women doesn't count. That it does count because male characters are just the authors vehicals. It does count because of the abundance of awful misogynistic POV (misogyny defined as mention of breasts here which is wow). And finally that it would be fine except no women get the same treatment because /women absolutely never produce the same kind of observations and have sexual feelings thar are so completely different than gets posted there/.

Yeah self-aware [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]] sounds like the opposit of [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]. Upset at weird language used to tell people a character is attractive is as coherent a theme as I can find.
