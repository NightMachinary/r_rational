It is pretty common for harem stories to end in monogamy, yes, but it's important to note that this usually doesn't happen until the /end/ of the story. Part of the appeal of harems is the illusion that the protagonist could get together with /any/ of the girls in the harem (even when it's pretty obvious /who/ he's going to end up with, like in /Love Hina/). That way viewers, who self-insert as the MC, can fantasize about getting together with whichever member of the harem most appeals to them. This is one of the reasons why harem protagonists are so passive and clueless about romance[1]; if they actively decided to peruse one of the girls, and she accepted, there would be no more story. Having the protagonist start dating one of the girls in a committed monogamous relationship halfway through the show would be like a fantasy novel protagonist who kills the dark lord halfway through the book. It's like, "shit, what the hell do we do now?"

[1] Another reason is that harem anime is a deliberate inversion of the way things work in the real world. In real life, men pursue and women chose; a normal guy has to approach a lot of girls and suffer a lot of rejections to get any results, and even extremely attractive guys simply get a better reception to their advances rather than being actively approached by women. In harem stories, a bunch of extremely attractive girls are attracted to a random loser for no reason, and they romantically pursue /him/. It's like if there was a show about a recent university graduate with a BA in English from the local community college who, instead of sending out hundred of resumes and failing to get a single interview, gets competing unsolicited six-figure employment offers from NASA, Google, and Apple; pure wish-fulfillment fantasy.
