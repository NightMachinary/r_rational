At no point in those 80 chapters does he get involved in romantic shenanigans or express any desire to date or sleep with any of the other characters besides the one he ends up dating. Internal attraction being held against the protagonist/writer feels super unfair, to me?

I honestly don't see anything at all that plays the trope straight, /except for/ the premise that there are more than 2 girls that simultaneously like him that he finds attractive. I'm not sure how exactly anyone could subvert harem tropes if having the premise itself is enough to be considered playing it straight.
