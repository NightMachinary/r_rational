Not twist endings, first would be hinted, and they keep dying along the way.

Third doesn't also have to happen in the end. Twist, sure. But it wound give a chance to change the type of the story midway and give new goals or something.

Ofc would depend on the story, writer, etc , but that's my vision.

Edit: watched million yen women. From harem to horror pretty fast. :D Or thriller or something.
