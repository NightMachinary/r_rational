I mean well written twist endings have the twist hinted at. If what you actually mean is that the other characters are working toward discovering the truth, that just sounds like a crime drama/thriller, yeah :P

It would be pretty neat to see harem story where all the girls suspect each other of killing one-another off but it turns out to be the guy.
