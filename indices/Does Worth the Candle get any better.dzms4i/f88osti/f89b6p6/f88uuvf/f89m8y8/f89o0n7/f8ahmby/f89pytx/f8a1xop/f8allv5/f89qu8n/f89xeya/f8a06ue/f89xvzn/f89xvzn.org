Well if the character killed the girls himself one by one and the text wouldn't cover those parts and the other characters would expose that by revealing weird stuff more and more in the end?

What if the character was asexual and aromantical and had literally no interest in the "harem"?

What if they were just after him for something and then leave him, so they were not really love interests?
