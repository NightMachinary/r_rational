Yeah I had fun while reading it. It gave me lots of opportunities to try and guess what happened next. As for the idiot ball stuff I suppose I disagree to some extent. Fallehter made bad decisions but I always felt like he made them for reasons that he preferred. Characters don't have to be perfect and they can make wrong decisions. It's only an idiot ball if the reasons aren't internally consistent with the characters motivations.
