I thought the paranoia was fine, but I didn't like the ending. Oh no, this guy is going to betray us and we need to make all these plans for when he does, or if he already did. And then at the end when it actually happens Juniper just stabs the guy. I wanted a payoff where he somehow out thinks him and uses soul magic to beat him at his own game.
