I don't know. Like I said, even though I don't relate to any particular Worm/Ward characters through my personal experiences, I still empathize with them all in a way that I didn't with the WtC characters.

I kind of forgot a lot of the story elements since I stopped reading, but I think I'm starting to remember why I stopped. So much of the main story ends up centering around the whole "dated a girl that my best friend liked and then he died." thing. Even at a young age I was the kind of person who got things out in the open and avoided letting drama fester behind the scenes. I think I may have even developed a bit of disdain for the kinds of people who engage in the kinds of petty secret-keeping that caused all of June's (and I only just remembered his name) personal problems.

Even that wouldn't have been much of a problem, except the story just kept coming up with reasons to have June flash-back or inner monologue (or even outer monologue) about his feelings about this one particular bit of highschool drama-turned-tragedy. In Worm, the progress of events causes Taylor to realize how petty her earlier troubles were while still being affected by them. For all June's progress, the story itself seemed to wallow in those problems.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when they went into that big hole that had the haunted mansion in it and it just tied back into all of that drama all over again after a long stretch of not bringing it up that much. I just kind of noped out after that.
