That's /a/ major point, but I definitely wouldn't call it "the entire point", what with the combination of the story's focus on the main character's development, and the author's own statements about how personal it is to him and how it's a self-insert fic. I am equally uncaring about isekai as a genre, but IMO the story is really a recounting of the sort of issues the author had to work through, many of which resonate with me.
