A lot of times the side relationships in a harem are there to create awkward drama for the MC and the OTP. E.g. His crush catches him in a compromising position with one of the side girls that he doesn't actually like. Now he has to ensure his crush that she's his one and only, but he's softhearted and doesn't want to hurt the other girl's feelings either, so he won't be direct.

This has the added meta benefit of creating a "moment" for fans of the side girl.
