  I don't like the computer system. When he actively gets error messages and a character is named null pointer. It cheapens everything

It doesn't come up much, but it's /blatantly obvious/ that Juniper is in a computer simulation. /How/ and /why/ are the big mysteries of /Worth the Candle/, along with what the hell happened to Arthur. If that bothers you because "it's not real", well, maybe read Eliezer Yudkowsky's [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism_(sequence)][sequence on reductionism]]? Whatever /is/, is real.

  The meta commentary is getting too much. It's neat that they meta talk about narratives and whatnot, but instead of feeling clever or neat now, it feels like it's trying too hard to be clever.

I agree that the narrative stuff gets to be too much at some point, but thankfully it gets dialed down in recent chapters.

  The romance/harem building is not for me. The main cast has 3 females who all have high loyalty and like him. The one male character is shunted to the side. The women's characterization are so cringy. Feels like some awful anime.

  - Maniac pixie dream girl with a ~sad past~, jealous of the hot big boobed princess and new innocent girl.
  - Haughty sexy smart princess who eventually falls for him. Surprise, she's secretly jealous of pixie girl for being so carefree.
  - Naive girl with unloving father, who no one trusts...except for MC. Of course she loves him for his basic kindness 5 chapters in.
  - The one guy is never really described. All the women have their chests and features described and compared to the minutia. The explanation is he's a dwarf with a big beard so you can't see his expression.

/Worth the Candle/ is a deconstruction of the Isekai LitRPG anime/manga/light novel genre, and one of the tropes it deconstructs is the harem trope. But you can't deconstruct the harem trope without a harem. This is hard to explain because you haven't gotten to it yet, but Juniper has a talk with someone in chapter 79 that elaborates on why things are the way they are. In fact, I recommend you keep reading until at least that point, because chapter 79 is a wham chapter that completely recontextualizes the story, and you are so close.

  The self-aware [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]] is also terrible which luckily seems to be toned down. "The big booby princess was like my perfect dream girl. I know women don't like to be objectified but awoooga her curvy curves."

This is a first-person POV narrative, and Juniper is a straight teenage male with a healthy sex drive. He is going to /notice/ when women are young and beautiful and have big tits, the same way a woman in a romance novel /notices/ that a guy is tall and muscular and has a big bank account. It would be /unrealistic/ if he didn't mention it; it would make me wonder if he was gay or suffering from low testosterone.
