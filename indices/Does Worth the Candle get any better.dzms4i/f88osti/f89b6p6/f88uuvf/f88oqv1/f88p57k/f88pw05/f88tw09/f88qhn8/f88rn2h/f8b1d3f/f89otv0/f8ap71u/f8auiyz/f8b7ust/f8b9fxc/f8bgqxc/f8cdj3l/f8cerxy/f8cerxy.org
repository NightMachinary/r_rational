I think the revelations about her age, family history (both growing up and later), relationship with elves, etc were all interesting threads that were hinted at. we are also like to get a lot more background on Amy's history with the current arc. So the characters are developed in that sense.

My response to OPs question was more that the fundamental relationships and archetypes remain the same - so if he doesn't like it now, he probably won't like it later. and most of the more interesting stuff was never followed through on...
