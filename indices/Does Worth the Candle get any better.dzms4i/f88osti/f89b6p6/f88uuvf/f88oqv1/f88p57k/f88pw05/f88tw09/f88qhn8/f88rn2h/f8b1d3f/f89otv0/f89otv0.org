FWIW, I read and enjoy the story and am up to current. Very little further development has been given to most female characters beyond the archetypical role. it is decidedly NOT an anime harem, and there are actually some really insightful developments in a few the relationships that deal with heavy topics well. But the characters aren't that deep...Amaryllis is still brilliant beautiful chaste closed off emotional lady, Fenn remains the spunky sexy rogue, Val is the weird doting but manipulative babygirl sub, and other characters introduced are just as one-note. The story is basically a series of "encounters" or battles, with NPC dialogue in between where you check in on each character to see they haven't really changed much. It's kinda like playing something like mass effect.
