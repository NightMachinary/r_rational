... do I do that? I mostly try not to put those kinds of labels (subversion, deconstruction, reconstruction) on the story, because they're not terribly helpful to understanding or interpreting the story and won't tell you whether or not you'll like it. There are definitely people who apply any or all of those labels, in whole or in part, to various parts of the story, but it's something that I make efforts to shy away from. Especially so because I don't tend to like authors telling people how to interpret their work.
