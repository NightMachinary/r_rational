I agree. There's been so many stock characters over the years that it's hard to invent someone, whom you can't pigeonhole into one such category, if you squint hard enough.

Additionally, tropes are not bad.

Look for example at how Sanderson brainstorms characters. He basically goes: Give me a character archetype + an unusual job that does not fit that archetype + a dark secret they have (or a similar schema) - and bam! There's your character outline. Sure, you need to embed the character into your setting, give them a distinctive voice and mannerism, etc., but the three initial variables can basically generate enough variety for a whole setting.

As for tests, the Wikipedia page for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test][Bechdel test]] lists some related tests, but they are all quite weak. I guess you could always try mentally switching all the character's genders and see how you feel about the story then, but that's basically checking for gender-neutrality, rather than for realistically written genders.
