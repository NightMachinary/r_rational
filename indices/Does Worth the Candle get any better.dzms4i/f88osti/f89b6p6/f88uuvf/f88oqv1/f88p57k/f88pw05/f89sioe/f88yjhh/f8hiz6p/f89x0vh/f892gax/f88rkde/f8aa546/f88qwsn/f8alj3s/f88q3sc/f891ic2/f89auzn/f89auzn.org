In PGtE, narrative is basically its own magic system---something hardwired into the setting, existing "above" or "outside" the Gods. The Gods /grant/ people Names or Roles, but then they just /have/ them, no takesy-backsies, and can do whatever they like with them. (Some people lose a Name or Role, but for reasons to do with no longer fitting the criteria that the Name itself checks and enforces, rather than by divine fiat.) I.e. "If you adopt a puppy, it's yours, and the pound can't take it back. But it /could/ run away."

In WtC, meanwhile, "narrative" is just a sort of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology][teleology]] the characters are modelling---a way to analyze effects in the world through the lens of the motivations of God. They assume (not without reason) that there exists a God that steers+nudges the world around them in the way that a DM steers+nudges a D&D campaign, with the goal of creating a compelling narrative for some hypothetical external audience. Mentions of "narrative" are just shorthand for referring to God fucking with them due to this drive it has; sort of like mentions of "capitalism" might be shorthand for referring to corporations fucking with you due to greed. This kind of "Narrative" has no mechanical existence; it's not a set of physical in-setting laws to deduce or predict. It's just a part of the psychology of a very powerful person the protagonists---and everyone else in the setting---are under the thumb of.
