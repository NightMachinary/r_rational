Sure, but isn't the point that it's something the protagonist wants? At this point he pretty clearly doesn't want to be in a romantic relationship with anyone other than Amaryllis. And even though throughout the story potential relationships are thrust in his face all the time, he rejects them.

I'm not denying that the DM created it as a harem trope, it's just that, yeah, Juniper is subverting it.
