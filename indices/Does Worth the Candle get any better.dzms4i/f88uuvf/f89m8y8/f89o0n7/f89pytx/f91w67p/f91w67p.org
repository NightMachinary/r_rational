One of them is a hermaphrodite that's explicitly ambiguous on the subject, one is dead, one is in a relationship with another man and has gotten over him, one is a sadistic home who raped him, one is a deer, one is purely platonic and also a child, and one fits the trope. If the bits of commentary in the story didn't suggest it enough, the GM is fucking with him a bit, specifically with his expectations about harems. Are we reading the same story?
