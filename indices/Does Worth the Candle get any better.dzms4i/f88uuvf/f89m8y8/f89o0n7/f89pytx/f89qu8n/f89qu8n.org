Yea I just checked wikipedia for the genre.

  These protagonists usually end up with a harem accidentally, because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time due to some unforeseeable circumstance or random chance. Most protagonists don't even want the harems they start, as they mostly only have one main love interest and all other members of their harem simply fall in love with him or her because they deeply admire some part of their personality, and the protagonist can't bring themselves to tell them to leave.

I was wrong.

I thought it was kind of a requirement that even if MC has a main girl, he'd be more open for anything.
