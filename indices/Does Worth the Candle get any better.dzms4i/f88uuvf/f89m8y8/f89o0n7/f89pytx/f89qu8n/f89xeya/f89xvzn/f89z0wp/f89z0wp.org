The first and third just sound like "twist endings," and the second maaaaybe a subversion? It seems more like a comedic premise to me, not a trope being subverted. I wouldn't die on that hill though, maybe that's an acceptable example to most people, but it wouldn't really be able to address most of the tropes without an MC that faces the same sorts of challenges.
