The traditional harem story has a lot of elements to it, not all of which need to be included, but most of which are simply outgrowths of narrative requirements and/or mercenary storytelling.

- The harem will include a large cast of female characters who have some level of attraction (almost always some level of mutual) with the main character.
- There are very few other male characters, though that's at least partly a result of how many characters a harem typically has and where it can devote its screentime.
- The protagonist will fail to make a choice or escalate any of the relationships in anything but minor ways, because if he did, then the story would either be over, or become complicated in a way that runs counter to the fantasy. This tends to result in a cluster of common character traits, e.g. oblivious, naive, romantically passive, indecisive, nebbish, etc.
- The plot will run these romances in parallel as much as possible (rather than doing them one by one in sequence).
- There's typically a 'one true pairing' that gets the majority of the focus, and if there's a resolution at the end, then it resolves with the OTP getting together in some permanent way.
- The work will attempt to tease as many of these relationships as possible.

The stock harem plot is intended to appeal to as many people as possible, to sell as much merch as possible, and to continue on as long as it can before it buckles under the weight of a plot that goes nowhere. It's /sometimes/ paired with some other genre, like an adventure, but it doesn't have to be, and it's pretty common for the harem elements to be stitched on.

(There are lots of stock romance things that show up in harem stories naturally, since a harem is, at its core, just a bunch of romances that are going at the same time.)

As to whether /Worth the Candle/ is or is not a harem, or whether or to what extent it's a subversion, deconstruction, or reconstruction, I don't really care that much. If I wanted to focus exclusively on skewering the idea or picking it apart for what I thought was interesting about it, then I would probably write a completely different story than the one I wrote.
