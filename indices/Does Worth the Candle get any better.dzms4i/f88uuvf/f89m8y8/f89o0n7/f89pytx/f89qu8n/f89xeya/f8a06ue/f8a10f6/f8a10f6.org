Good summary, but I find it interesting to note how many of those popular-harem-story aspects actually are about the harem /not/ forming, compared to the stories I've read where harems (male or female centered) do fully form and get explored, which means the conflicts and relationships and drama involved can be very different.

Maybe my take on harems is skewed by this; if most people's only exposure to harem stories involves someone being indecisive or maintaining monogamy, then WtC probably looks a lot more like one to them than to me, even if it still deconstructs most of those listed aspects.

(For those interested in reading a "fulfilled harem," the Meredith Gentry series by Laurel K. Hamilton is probably my favorite one, as it's paired with a great modern-supernatural setting involving fae court drama and occasional monster fighting. NSFW obviously)
