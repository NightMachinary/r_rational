Isn't that true of the large majority of harem stories? Or, cause this isn't an anime, let's say "love triangle+" stories. He has romantic drama with pretty much all of them, including explicitly sexual scenes, bit doesn't sleep/date rhe.m. I think "actually dates 0 to 1 members of the harem" is very standard for the genre.
