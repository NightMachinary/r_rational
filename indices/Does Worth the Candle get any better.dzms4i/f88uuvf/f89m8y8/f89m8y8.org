  I'm just going to address the harem thing, since it's the criticism that I think best shows you might be missing the point:

  This is not a harem isekai power fantasy.

  It's a subversion and meta commentary on harem isekai power fantasies.

How, though? How is this story a subversion? The trope is played entirely straight for at least the first 80 chapters.

Possibly it's subverted later in the story, but 80 chapters is like half a million words, more than the entirety of LotR. If you use a trope straight for that long I don't think it's unfair for readers to judge you by it, regardless of what happens afterwards.
