Don't worry about it. As soon as someone mentions "beta male", it's safe to tune them out.

In case you haven't run across the terms before:

"Emotionally mature" in this case just means that he wants the protagonist to be more self-possessed. Unfortunately, the protagonist is a heavily traumatized teenager, so having him be self-possessed would be lazy writing.

"Beta male" and "cuck" (cuckold, a man whose wife sleeps with someone else) are terms used by the "red pill" community. Their worldview is that, no matter what anyone says, the /real/ truth is that all women are submissive, heterosexual, and desperate for a strong man to control them so that they can feel safe and cared for. Being a "beta male" in this paradigm is a horrible insult -- you aren't a woman (the object that is the source of sex and demonstrates the strength of her controller) and you aren't an "alpha male" (the person with the strength and power to capture a woman's sexual attention), so you are simply useless and of no value to anyone.
