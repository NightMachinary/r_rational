Null Pointer is the peak amount of computery stuff in the story, but it sticks around.

The meta commentary increases. Later on, other characters will buy into the idea that they're living in a narrative so much that the main character gets sick of it.

The harem thing continues, but is increasingly played for subversion or horror. There's definitely a payoff here. The main character is a bad boyfriend and it has consequences. "Naive girl" falls for everyone who shows her basic kindness, and ends up with a steady boyfriend outside of the group. In the most recent chapters, something goes very, very wrong harem-wise.
