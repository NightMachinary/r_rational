  This is the only part I don't get. This is a sub largely dedicated to people who are squeamish about sex complaining about how it gets referenced in the media. Even the title gets routinely mocked since they regularly feature romance novels written by women.

Are you sure that's the same [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]? It's my impression that the sub is about overly male gaze-y portrayals of women ranging from cringe to creepy, in particular when it's supposed to be from a woman's POV. Yeah, they don't really keep to the "from a woman's POV" part very strictly, but it's definitely not just people being squeamish about sex.
