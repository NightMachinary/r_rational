A Practical Guide is really good, but it has a lot more less good (tho still very hq compared to other fiction) chapters/arcs.

Mother of Learning in my mind isn't active - we have one update left, I believe. Also really really good of course, maybe the best Time Loop story, but it's a lot more straightforward and compared to WotC it's nearly one-dimensional (of course, that comparison wouldnt be fair - they are doing different things).

Ward - I don't know. Worm is my favourite longform story, yet I gave up on Ward after trying multiple times. I don't even want to talk about why it's disappointing for me as a Worm fan.
