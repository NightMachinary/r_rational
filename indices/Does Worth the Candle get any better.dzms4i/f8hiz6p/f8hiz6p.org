There's a few different angles here; but I think that there is an underlying ur-criticism.

Based on the direction of your specific criticisms, some word choice, and the content of some of your replies on this subject, I suspect that you are reading this through a particular ideological viewpoint which is tainting your experience.

> All this I can ignore, I've certainly read worse, but the payoff doesn't seem to be coming. The whole evil soul mage tutor ended in a pretty fruitless "will he betray won't he betray" and it barely advanced the plot/power level beyond basic soul magic.

> The meta commentary is getting too much. It's neat that they meta talk about narratives and whatnot, but instead of feeling clever or neat now, it feels like it's trying too hard to be clever.\\
I suspect that you got here via litrpg, not via rational fiction lines. The payoff the intended audience is looking for is possibly not the same one you are looking for.

The expected payoff here is a setting up a story in a genre which is typically filled with specific and counterfactual tropes, and then having a rational actor interact with that environment in such a way which *actually makes sense* given the facts and situations in evidence. The payoff is not 'Protagonist becomes overpowered in game' (though this does happen later on).

The meta commentary *is* the payoff. If this isn't your thing, then it probably doesn't 'get better' from your perspective, because this element only becomes more pronounced as the story progresses. It *is* the story.

Take note of the fact that the protaganist is a D&D DM, not a MMO powergamer - this is emblematic of the differences in approach compared to more typical litrpg.

> I don't like the computer system. When he actively gets error messages and a character is named null pointer. It cheapens everything

You either get this kind of humor or you don't, some of it is pretty 'in-joke'.

Ok, about the harem thing. Based on the direction of your specific criticisms, some word choice, and the content of some of your replies on this subject, I suspect that you are reading this through a particular ideological viewpoint which is tainting your experience. That said, a few points;

> The one male character is shunted to the side.\\
There are no male characters who are recognized as 'companions' by the game layer. Grak is not male. He may signal male, but the fact that he is not male is relevant.

> The women's characterization are so cringy. Feels like some awful anime. ...

> The self-aware ðŸ“·[[https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/][r/menwritingwomen]] is also terrible which luckily seems to be toned down. "The big booby princess was like my perfect dream girl. I know women don't like to be objectified but awoooga her curvy curves."

I'll be honest, this is difficult to respond to, because there is a personal taste aspect here... but I hard disagree with your overall point, to such an extent that I do not understand how you can draw these conclusions having actually read the story. A few ideas to consider;

- the protagonist is an unreliable narrator, who is 17-18. Typically unreasonably precocious and analytical as most rational stories tend to be, but at least this author makes some attempt at the intrinsic bias associated with the history of the protagonist and the follow-on effects of how that should influence story viewpoint.
- the 'romance plot' of the 'haughty sexy princess' is literally centered on her asexuality and the existential horror of being manufactured to be a love interest in a story. I suspect that they will eventually 'end up together', but it will be as a conclusion or extension for that plot line toward the end of the work, not as the 'first brick' in a harem.
- the 'manic pixie dream girl' trope is all but explicitly called out later on, just like every other genre trope that has been introduced.
- the 'new innocent girl' is a slow-burn character, don't jump to conclusions here.
- there is no harem here. there is no sign of a harem here. there is a setup for a harem that is heavily lampshaded, but the entire point of that setup is for the protaganist to reject it, not to be worn down until they accept it.
