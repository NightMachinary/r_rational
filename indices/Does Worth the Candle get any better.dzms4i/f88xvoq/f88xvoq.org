I think I got to the latest update a few months ago but I never bothered going back to see if there are more chapters.

Frankly, it was getting really boring. There's a bit of action, and then chapters and chapters of discussion of what happened, what he wants to do and what he should do, and he doesn't actually do it. Didn't go do some quest, then chapters about he how regrets not going to do that when he received the quest.
