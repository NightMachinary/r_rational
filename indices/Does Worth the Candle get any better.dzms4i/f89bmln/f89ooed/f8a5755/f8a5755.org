I def don't want to go full definitional debate, but in the end what is the "played straight" of a genre? Media actually have a ton of diversity on how they approach things - outside of "there is a cast of characters into the main character" harem/romance stories go all over. Even in the anime world, they go from typical (Urusei Yatsura) to weird sci fi (Haruhi Suzumiya) to completely batshit (School Days). I dont think the idea of this "core" story is as mythical as it is real. (Individual tropes, as opposed to genres, as more standardized and therefore easier to subvert)

I also think the word "harem" might be doing some damage here - its an anime term, but Worth the Candle is a western fantasy, an isekai, and, well, a book! It might also make the "harem" label seem like an insult, when it is not at all. Just to say that a big part of the story is dealing with romantic relationship drama from multiple participants. Tons of YA books are also "harem" stories, aka love triangle stories, we just use different terms. Of course WtC is not Urusei Yatsura, but I dont think anyone here was claiming that.
