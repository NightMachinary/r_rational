Im actually gonna call out people (yes, this includes you Author-of-the-story!) who describe Worth The Candle's harem elements as a "subversion" - it really isnt. The word subversion is very loosely defined so under some definitions I am sure it is, but the main protagonist totally does have a harem, he is dating one of them and has complicated sexual ~stuff~ with others (to avoid spoilers). The harem is not subverted - its just a much more complex story with real consequences instead of fluffy anime stuff, and lots of meta elements.

However, if you absolutely hate harem stories and dating stories more widely? Then you arent going to like those parts of the story - the appeal is that some people actually do like those things, and there is a market out there for stories like that involving real people. I think the same applies to the meta elements - lots of stories just have a few meta moments, this story is Full Meta and commits to those.

As such, I would say you wont like this story, and should maybe drop it. Though I agree with some others that the Fallather arc was one of the low points, and your complaint about the male characters not getting enough screen time will be fixed going forward - Grak in particular will get a ton more screen time and be the third-most-fleshed out character by pretty much any metric. If you think that is enough for you to keep going, then do, but "meta-harem-worldbuilding" will continue to be core to the story.
