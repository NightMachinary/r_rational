This takes the presumption though that harem stories are...definitionally bad? I dont think the term should be used at all if that is the case! WtC is an adult story, so the harem aspects have full adult aspects, and I mean it isnt animated slice of life cartoon so yeah it doesnt work like Tenchi Muyo!

I will note that your list here is "the characters however don't hook up with the main character", but...thats a definitional trope of a harem show! The main character does not get into a relationship with the harem is a pretty core premise. And in normal shows (As opposed to porn) its normally for character reasons.

As I said in another comment, harem is a term we were porting over from anime, but of course WtC is not a slice of life, status quo is god animated comedy, so it doesnt look like those. The OP referred to the harem-style elements so its the word were used, but really its just a term for the generic idea of love triangles, romance plots, etc. Maybe we can just use those terms instead, I dont think harem adds much even if it is "technically" correct.
