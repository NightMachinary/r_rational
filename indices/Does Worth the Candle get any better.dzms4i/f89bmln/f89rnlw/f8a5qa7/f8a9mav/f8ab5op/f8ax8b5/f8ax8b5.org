I think the Spurned Women's Club classification actually should be its own genre rather than lumped in with Harem, personally. It's a MUCH more common trope, there's a lot of genre fiction where a male protagonist who's just SO handsome and strong and virtuous that women keep falling for him, but he has his one true love and they're left to pine.

Lumping that in with Harem is to me just further diluting the trope/genre to the point of near meaninglessness.
