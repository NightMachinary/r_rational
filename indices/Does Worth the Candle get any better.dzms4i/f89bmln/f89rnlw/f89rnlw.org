The intent of the situation he's put into is definitely to be a harem, but I don't agree that it ends up being that.

Fenn dies after being in a monogamous relationship with him, Grak is a hermaphrodite who does have feelings for him, but they are, mostly, unrequited, Valencia grows out of her infatuation, he gets raped by Bethel, Solace is reborn as a kid and never really had any feelings for him in the first place. Amaryllis is ace and not interested, at least till the later parts of the story. They all have complicated relationships because it's a well written story, but I would say it's about as far from a harem as is reasonably possible given that the DM literally dumps him into a harem story.
