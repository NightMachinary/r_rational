The second to last book of pgte seems to be widely considered as longer than it needs to be, filler-filled and a little subpar.

Also interludes are of varying quality (some are amazing of course) and I personally think that the recent focus on having more interludes than main character chapters is a bit over the top.

And yes, the closest to 'objective' comparison we have is approximate reader numbers and topwebfiction, on which pgte does come ahead.
