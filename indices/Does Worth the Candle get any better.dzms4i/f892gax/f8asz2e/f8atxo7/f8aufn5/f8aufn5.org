I personally agree about Ward, but there are a lot of Worm fans praising it as their favorite thing ever, so it was worth mentioning.

About Guide, at the start I would agree, first book I wold say on average below WtC level. But it is consistently getting better. At books 4 and 5 I would personally put it as best active work.

Of course those are preferences, there isn't really a point discussing if Guide or WtC is 'objectively' better.
