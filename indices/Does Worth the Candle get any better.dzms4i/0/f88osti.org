Can't comment on the computer stuff. Never paid much attention to it.

The Meta narrative /is/ the point. They're trying to find out to which degree their universe is being fucked with. I don't foresee this changing, ever.

The romance stuff is a subversion of the usual isekai self-insert trope. The Dwarf isn't actually male, there's been reference to that already by chapter 70 IIRC, and his feelings for the main character are a pretty big (ongoing) topic.
