I like it very much, I guess it's not for you? It's mostly interesting to me because of worldbuilding. I already stole a lot of it for my d&d campaign and it works great, clearly a lot of experience with "worldbuilding for drama" went into it and I love that. I would never think to include SCP memetics in D&D and I got inspired and did and it was great. The whole conception of souls as fossil fuel and afterlife as a curse is also very inspiring.

The payoff I expect is explanation of the whole deal with Arthur and Junpier, the world and why they ended up there.

As for women and relationships - they aren't the focus for me, and they are certainly written better than in 90% of isekai stories anyway.
