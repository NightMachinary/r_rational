I'm just going to address the harem thing, since it's the criticism that I think best shows you might be missing the point:

This is not a harem isekai power fantasy.

It's a /subversion/ and meta commentary on harem isekai power fantasies.

The main character is explicitly in a world that was created to give him exactly the experience in those "awful anime," but he's /aware/ of that and knows reality would not be that simple.

Furthermore, he as a protagonist is not that simple. He's got so many issues, so much baggage and self-awareness, that he makes the standard harem isekai power fantasy protagonist look like the cartoon cutout that they often are.

So if you're worried about it all becoming some saccharine sexy male fantasy, I can assure you nothing of the sort happens. It only looks like that's what's coming because that's how subversions work. Hunter x Hunter has a whole season of (relatively) bland and generic shonen storylines just so that when things go off the rails, it feels much more impactful.

I can spoil things if you want more specific concerns addressed, but hopefully that helps. In general, the story may not be for you if you dislike meta-story awareness and commentary and purposeful subversion. But at the very least you should be aware that that's what it is, rather than think the author is just setting up yet another male fantasy wankfest.
