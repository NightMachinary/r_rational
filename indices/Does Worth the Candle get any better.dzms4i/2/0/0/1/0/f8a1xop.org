  They are defined in terms of their relationship with him - heck even in universe they were created for him.

Importantly, they are /aware/ that this is what's going on (as is he). And because they're not one-dimensional, the story is in part about how they deal with it.

This is how it's a deconstruction of harem fantasy.

/Watchmen/ takes complex believable characters - with their mess of feelings, ideals, past traumas, and personal failings - and shows what happens when they decide to put on a costume and go beat up hooligans. Spoiler, you don't get /Batman/.

/Worth the Candle/ takes complex believable characters, and shows what happens when they find out that they've literally been created to be stereotypical romantic interests, for a guy with plenty of baggage of his own. Spoiler, you don't get... [/Love Hina/? I don't watch much anime, I've only seen harem played straight in fanfics/webfics.]

You do get a whole lot of meta talk though, so if you're not into that you're gonna have a bad time.
