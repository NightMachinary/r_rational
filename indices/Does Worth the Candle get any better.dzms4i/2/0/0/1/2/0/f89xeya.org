I don't think you're wrong at all. The literal definition of a harem may be that the character has a bunch of men/women who are in love with them, but it's generally used to mean that there are romantic shenanigans going on between multiple of them.

If that's not happening, it's not /really/ a harem, imo. Otherwise it would be literally impossible to subvert a harem trope without just... Not including the trope.
