Yeah. There's harem /comedy/, where the protagonist spends a lot of time saying "it's not what it looks like!" as he bounces from sultry seductresses to well-endowed clumsy girls, and everyone treats him kind of like a puppy. And then there's harem /fantasy/, where a cast of possibly-bisexual possibly-nonmonogamous (with a one-penis policy) girls, in awe of the protagonist's sheer awesomeness, learn to share him or make peace with his choice of mate. (Flip genders as appropriate.)

I see the later more in cheap fanfic/webfic, because those aren't shy about just giving their target audience everything they want all the time.

To the extent that WtC is a harem deconstruction, it's a deconstruction of harem fantasy. (I often mentally compare it to /Fimbulwinter/, by William Brown of local /Time Braid/ fame.) "A key for seven locks" is not a comedy achievement.
