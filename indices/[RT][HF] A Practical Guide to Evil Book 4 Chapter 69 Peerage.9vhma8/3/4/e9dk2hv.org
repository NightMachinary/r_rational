I don't think the drow are nearly as good as Cat sell them. She just got shit at fighting ever since she became unburdened by mortality. She doesn't even dodge attacks nowadays. And maybe there's some bullshit going on with Sve Noc's domain too, but that's secondary to Cat becoming really complacent.

Seriously, Cat froze a city once, and that was before ascending. The higher ranked Fae routinely pulped mountains and torched armies. The Mighty? The dwarves hunt them with ballistae ffs.

Remember the previous Black Knight? He could destroy monuments by willing it so. He got killed by a conscript.
