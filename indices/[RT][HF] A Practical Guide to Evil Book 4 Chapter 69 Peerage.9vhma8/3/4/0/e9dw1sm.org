Shit at fighting to the tune of beating back half the crusade's heroes solo right befor coming here, you mean?

I talked about an execption for the King and Queen, yes, and you can lump Sulia in there too if you want. But I find it unlikely that they're prowling around waiting for an opportunity to do Cat a solid.

And if you jump down a tier, you get to the Dukes. We saw Cat with the full power of a Duchess for a while, and it was markedly less impressive than Urulan on his own.

But what's that? Cat wasn't using her power optimally? Well, let's look at the Duke of Violent Squalls, who Cat fought in an almost straight fight in Arcadia, at the fullness of his power. Her story manipulations amounted to this:

  It wasn't handing me the victory in a handbasket -- the fake prophecy hadn't been well-crafted enough for that -- but I'd touched the story just enough I could twist it. That there was a chance for me to win.

Which is to say that Cat's victory was by no means assured, and it came down to a contest of skill and power, which Cat then won. Cat, who was still just the squire with two aspects to her name.

Any one of these guys is so much more powerful than what Cat was then that it's not even funny. And there were seven of them. See where I'm going with this? The locals aren't a threat, they're food.

  The Mighty? The dwarves hunt them with ballistae ffs.

These were the far, far outskirts of the Everdark and have little to no power. Somehow I think the Dwarves will need a different tactic when they start fighting Drow that are actually dangerous. Much like Cat did.
