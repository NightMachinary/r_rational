This isn't about me - this is about the three books we spent building up what Arcadia is. A horrid death trap that can break demigods inside of 24 hours it is not.

I mean, maybe there's something Cat knows about that only lives offscreen, that she's has never thought about, and has had no other impact in the story thus far... but I find that unlikely.
