Okay, I'll bite. What do you think "growing the Night" means here?

Bear in mind that we saw Ivah heading out to increase its Night in the Burning Lands, in what was a holy task, that we've been told about stealing the necromantic magic of the undead for the Night, and that the Night began when the non-Night resource of the Twilight Sages was converted to Night by Sve Noc.
