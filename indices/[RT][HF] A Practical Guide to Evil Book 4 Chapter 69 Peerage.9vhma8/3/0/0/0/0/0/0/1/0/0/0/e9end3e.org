I'm going to need a source on... literally all of that.

Here, I'll run you through the Night as it was explained to us.

Here's literally the first conversation we have on the night, and the only explicit discussion on the interactions between Night and non-Drow:

  “Killing cattle,” I said. “Taking it. What does it do for you?”

  “The Night grows,” Ivah smiled. “To do such sacred act would redeem any disgrace.”

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  I sucked at my lip.

  “Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

  The drow paled.

  “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

  “It does, doesn't it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.”

  “I say no more,” Ivah insisted. “It sees all. It hears all.”

With me so far? Killing non-Drow grows the Night. They can (almost certainly) take the necromancy of undead and convert that to Night.

Not convinced? How about some practical examples. When we met Ivah and its crew, they'd been sent out of the Everdark for one last opportunity to redeem themselves - by harvesting Night from non-Drow

Or we can jump to the very origin of Night. Sve Noc turned the Twilight Sages into the first of the Night. The Night is very explicitly something that can be added to by converting the power of beings without Night ino Night.

Have you got anything to back up what you're saying?
