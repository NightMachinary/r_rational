To be fair, apparently the Drow spent less than a day looking for a way out before they reconsidered signing on with Cat. Which is, uh, not really what I'd call trying hard.

If they were going to get out, I think a better exit would have been a fae who can open a temporary gate, but there's a point I raised elsewhere - why would the Drow even /want/ to go back to the Everdark?

That place sucks, it's about to be overrun with dwarves, and it means joining Cat's slave army where they're constantly under the threat of death and are about to fight their way to Sve Noc herself. Arcadia, on the other hand, is full of Fae to harvest, doesn't have dwarves or Dead Kings, and lets them keep their autonomy.
