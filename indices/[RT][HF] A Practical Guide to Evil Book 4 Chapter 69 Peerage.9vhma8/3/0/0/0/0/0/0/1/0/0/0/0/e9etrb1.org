Nothing you've quoted contradicts what I said, and you're making tons of assertions with nothing to back it up. At this point there's no point in arguing about this further and we're just going to have to wait for more WOG.

However I'll give you one simple narrative reason why the Drow cannot harvest the Night from non-Night holders--because it makes the Night totally OP. Without a countervailing force it totally breaks the setting, and that is not allowed in a rational fic.
