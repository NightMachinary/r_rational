you have to look at it from the drow's perspective: you believe you're a demigod (and like you said, urulan was a tough fight for cat who /is/ a demigod). cat comes and with a /completely/ unknown way, transports you to a land you know nothing about and you can't escape with your powers. this might be enough for a few of them who believe might makes right and only look after themselves, but maybe you hold out. then, one of your peers, who you likely would not want to fight solo, *disappears.* no plotting, no attack */fucking disappears./*

the mighty signing on totally fits with their culture and should not really be too surprising. you mention in another comment that it's most likely that orelik escaped instead of getting killed but even if that was the case, is that what the trapped mighty would think? no, they look down on each other but still respect their ability so /obviously/ it was worst case scenario.

e:minor wording changes.
