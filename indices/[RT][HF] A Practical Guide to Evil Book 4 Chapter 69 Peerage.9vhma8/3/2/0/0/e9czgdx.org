  Yeah, a slow build up tipping into an avalanche would have made much more sense to me than all the Drow deciding that, no actually, being Cat's eternal slave under threat of death in an army pointed at Sve Noc sounds quite nice.

Is this what they see off the bat though? Or are they more like Ivah, seeing another up and coming Sigil, albeit with weird rules. It only dawns on them later that they're successfully fighting against all of the other Drow.

This is a society taught to praise strength above all. When Cat comes in with a great show of force, the first inclination is to cozy up to her to barter or take. And if submission is necessary then they might as well get it over with than risk angering their betters. You don't become Mighty by fighting injustice.
