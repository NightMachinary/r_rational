This requires a large twisting of all the facts involved, and for there to be a double meanings that were hugely glossed over.

Remember we got a definition where "to grow the night" included: learning how to forge weapons, harvest from non-Drow, and steal the necromancy of the undead.

It doesn't make sense for one of these to increase the individuals personal power, and the others to... interact with some other mechanism that has never been mentioned or hinted at?

You don't see an issue with that?

Well you're welcome to search for it. I would, but unfortunately I don't have time at the moment. I might edit it in later, but for now "I don't remember the specifics" does not count as a valid argument.
