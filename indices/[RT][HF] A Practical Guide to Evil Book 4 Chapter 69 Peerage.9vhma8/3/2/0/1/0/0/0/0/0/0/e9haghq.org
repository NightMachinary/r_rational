  The problem with this argument is the Ivah conodrum. Ivah was sent out of the Gloom to gain night by killing non-Drow, with the expectation that it would die, but the possibility of gaining Night.

Or, Ivah was sent out of the Gloom to grow the collective Night/Sve Noc's stores of Night, with the expectation that it would die but the possibility of growing the Night first.

After all, if the /expectation/ is that Ivah will die then how can Ivah bring Night to the Drow? It is essentially throwing lives away on the slim chance that the group not only succeeds but chooses to return at the exact right time. They have to somehow kill enough to gain Night worth bring back but know when to cut their losses and return in time to avoid dying and leaving all that Night on the surface. The odds of this paying off for the drow/Sve are ridiculous.

Under my interpretation, the Night is grown regardless of whether or not Ivah's party manages to return. If they kill seven humans or whatever before being brought down they have still grown the night. The odds of this paying off for the drow/Sve are incredibly high.

  If you want a quote, have this:

  #+begin_quote
    “I return bereft of Night, failing the terms of my exile.”
  #+end_quote

  Which is to say, it's possible to get Night outside the Everdark, and have that Night added to your personal power.
#+end_quote

He does not say "I forgot to pick up some Night from the store." He says "I return bereft of night." While yes, this can totally be interpreted as "I did not gain any Night." It can also mean "I return as the same status I was." Remember that Night determines rank, so opening with how much Night you have makes sense. "Failing the terms of my exile" is an even broader statement that can easily be seen as saying he failed to grow the Night under my interpretation.

I think this is increasingly coming down to Ivah's ass-about manner of speech.

#+begin_quote
  This makes sense, because the nature of the Night is that it's always been something that was stolen and converted. The first of the Night was taken from the Twilight Sages.
#+end_quote

I'm having trouble remembering the specifics of this conversation.

#+begin_quote
  We had an explicit conversation as to how the Drow can steal the necromantic magic of the undead.
#+end_quote

Yes, and it fits both interpretation's.

#+begin_quote
  The issue with your interpretation is that it's not supported by any of the explanation of Night we've received, or any of the examples we've seen.
#+end_quote

No, it fits all the explanations I can think of.

#+begin_quote
  I agree that it means we need a stronger explanation of why Drow haven't left the Everdark... but we kind of need that anyway?

  Your interpretation still incentivizes Sve/whoever benefits from "growing the Night" to send out powerful Drow to grow the Night.
#+end_quote

Nah, it makes perfect sense. The more powerful a drow is, the less they should be sent to the surface. If a drow dies on the surface it's body can easily become unrecoverable. The night is then either lost or removed from circulation, weakening all drow and Sve Noc itself. So you send the worst failures and fuckups who will hopefully rack up a few kills.
