  Fairly sure she can do that because the Queen of Arcadia granted her safe passage back in Book 3

That's a fair point:

  “Of you I ask permanent right of passage through Arcadia for me and all I command, uncontested and unhindered,” I said, voice hollow.

For what it's worth that doesn't change my outlook too much. We've gotten a very good look at what the power of a Duke/Duches looks like, with both Violent Squalls and Cat herself, back when she was a /mere/ Duchess of Moonless Nights (after Masego unlocked her power, but before she embraced the Winter mantle in full), and none of it measures up to what Urulan alone was dishing out in its fight.

Something utterly flipping the attitudes of the sigil-holders around in 24 hours and convincing them to put themselves in what's frankly a pretty situation seems at odds to me with everything that was built up about both them and Arcadia.

  I have to admit the drow arc has probably been the weakest of the series so far. The main characters are separated and the entire thing is dragging on quite a bit.

I'd agree with that. Honestly this whole book has been less enjoyable than the first three, for me, with the drow arc as a particular low point. But there have been some damn good interludes amongst it all, on the bright side.
