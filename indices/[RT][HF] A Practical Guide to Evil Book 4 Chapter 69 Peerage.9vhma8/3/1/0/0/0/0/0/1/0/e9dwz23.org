  I know you excepted her, but the former Queen of Summer casually roasted hundreds of soldiers with barely any effort back in book two and is a decent metric for how strong Cat could be.

Right, but the measuring stick in this instance is not "The former Queen of Summer" or "Cat at her theoretical maximum in a hundred years". What we're looking at is what could have caused the Drow to flip around and decide that, actually, we'd like to sign away our free will, have your power constantly be threatening us with death, and fight and die for your causes against Sve Noc and then outside in service of the "Liesse accords".

So what threatened them? It wasn't a Duke/Duchess, we've seen the powers on display there. And there's not much above that. Is there some leviathan in Arcadia that has never been hinted at, who's sole purpose is to intimidate Drow demigods who wind up in Arcadia off-screen?

  egardless, time flows differently in Arcadia. A week to Cat might have been months or years to them

I've talked about this elsewhere, actually.

If this is the case, it's a little better, but very poorly communicated. And it also doesn't make much difference - the Drow still have no upside to signing up with Cat. And after several months/years, it becomes weird that they haven't escaped, when their ride out is any fae schmuck with a bit of power to their name.
