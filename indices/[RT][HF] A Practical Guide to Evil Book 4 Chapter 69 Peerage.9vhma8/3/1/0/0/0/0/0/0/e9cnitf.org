  We both remember the level of skill displayed by Mighty Urulan, right?

Sure, but there's a difference between a few centuries; or even a few thousand years, and 'older than the First Dawn'.

  Notably, this means that the Drow can exploit the story in Arcadia. Everything from the fae, to time itself, has to obey the script.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure about this. It could be the case that non-Named in Arcadia can take advantage of narrative as well, or it might be exclusive to Named. The only non-Named we saw in Arcadia were under the command of Catherine so we have no real precedent.

  And Mighty Urulan made her draw deeper from her mantle than when Cat utterly obliterated one of her Wild Hunt members.

Do you mean the one back in Chapter 50? If so, first of all she was fairly low ranking. Second, it's rather unclear how much power the Hunt has in Creation. Being part of the Hunt and sworn to a semi-mortal queen probably does allow them to keep more of their power than if they stepped through on their own but still. Masego noted back in Interlude: Heretics that the Wild Hunt are somehow different from other fae:

'He could be picking at the minds of the Wild Hunt to understand what set them apart from the other fae'

Third, and most importantly, the Hunt are sworn to Catherine's service. That almost certainly restricts how they can use their mantles against her.

  Also, for the record, Cat after she's gotten sloppy and arrogant is able to beat down half the heroes of the Crusade without undue issue.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure that's why she got sloppy and arrogant.
