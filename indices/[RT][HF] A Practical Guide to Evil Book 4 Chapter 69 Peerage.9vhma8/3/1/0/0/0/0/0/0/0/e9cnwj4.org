  Sure, but there's a difference between a few centuries; or even a few thousand years, and 'older than the First Dawn'.

And Cat beat one of those things, the Duke of Violent Squalls, in an almost straight fight, back when she was still just the Squire with two aspects to her name. In Arcadia, at the fullness of their power. You said that Cat won because of the story, but check this out:

  It wasn't handing me the victory in a handbasket -- the fake prophecy hadn't been well-crafted enough for that -- but I'd touched the story just enough I could twist it. That there was a /chance/ for me to win.

Cat's victory was by no means assured, and it came down to a contest of skill and power, which Cat then won.

Any one of these guys is so much more powerful than what Cat was then that it's not even funny. And there were seven of them. See where I'm going with this? The locals aren't a threat, they're /food/.

Like, are you suggesting that within 24 hours they ran into fae that made them do a 180 and agree to a life of slavery in an army heading towards Sve Noc?

When we met these guys they represented perhaps the strongest force we'd seen in a room for all of Guide. If there were things roaming around Arcadia that could threaten them, then Cat wouldn't be considering using Arcadia to shuttle armies around.

  The only non-Named we saw in Arcadia were under the command of Catherine so we have no real precedent.

And these guys had just been set here by our stories resident Named.

But even then Arcadia's entire thing is that it responds to everything and anything as a story, and it entirely bound to that modus operandi.

And unless the Drow were fighting Kings and Queens, they probably wouldn't have /needed/ a story. Again, the weakest sigil holder nearly killed the Queen of Air and Darkness several times in a row without much trouble.

  I'm pretty sure that's why she got sloppy and arrogant.

She was using the exact same approach and tactics in the two fights, which to me suggests they are directly comparable.
