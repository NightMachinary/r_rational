  Orelik disappearing almost assuredly means he died

I think it's more likely he /escaped/, really.

We all saw how powerful Urulan was, right? It was the weakest of the bunch, and it nearly killed Cat several times. There were nine of these guys, all stronger than Urulan - what do you think killed one of them? We've seen the full gamut of fae, and unless it ran into the Summer Queen / Winter King (whatever they're called now), it would have been fine. These guys could have taken the Sovereign of Moonless Nights in a fight, are you telling me some Winter schmuck got the drop on them?

Hell, a powerful fae would have been its ticket out of Arcadia.

What could they have run into that made signing up for Cat's slave army for all eternity and fighting and dying against the strongest threats in the Everdark a good idea?
