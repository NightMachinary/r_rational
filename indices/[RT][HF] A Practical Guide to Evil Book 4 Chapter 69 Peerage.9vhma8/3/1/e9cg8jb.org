  Wait, what?

  These seven demigods wandered around Arcadia for anywhere from a single day to a single week, couldn't find an easy way out, and so /sold themselves into slavery/?

  Huh?

  What was even dangerous to them? The cold? The fae? Will spent six months running from the Wild Hunt back in Arcadia back in book one, then left under his own power. Black was using this for fast travel in book 2, before again leaving under his own power. These guys could crush a dozen Wills or Blacks without even noticing. Did the Drow get homesick?

  Seriously, we jump from chapter 66 when these guys are vowing that they will never bow down, that they will kill Cat for what she's done... and then 24 hours later they're signing away their autonomy?

  I notice that I am confused.

Will was backed by a choir, and Black had Warlock. Both were prepared for the journey. The drow have none of that.

Orelik disappearing almost assuredly means he died, which tells the Drow that they're not top dog here. If whatever lives there can take one of them out without any of the others knowing, then they can do the same to any of them.

It's a matter of survival.
