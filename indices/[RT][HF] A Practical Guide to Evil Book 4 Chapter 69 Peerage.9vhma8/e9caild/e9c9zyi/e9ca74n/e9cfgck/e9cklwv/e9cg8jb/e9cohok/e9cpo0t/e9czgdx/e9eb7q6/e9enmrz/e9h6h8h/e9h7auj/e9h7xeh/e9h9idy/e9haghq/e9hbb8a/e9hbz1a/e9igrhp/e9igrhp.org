  Right, everyone who disagrees with you is twisting the facts. It couldn't possibly be that you misinterpreted things.
#+end_quote

Tbf mate, you've made your own loaded statements. If you want to get upset at me for making them, avoid doing it yourself.

But the big issue with your interpretation is that it requires a whole lot of additional detail to be added to the text that was never mentioned. Like a weird back channel were the Night grows, but the individuals who grow it don't actually get more Night. Or for Ivah's exile to have a whole set of additional clauses that were never brought up.

#+begin_quote
  Consistent with the other interpretation.
#+end_quote

Not really? If you're suggesting that one method grows an individual's power, and the other does not grow their power, but instead "grows the Night" in some vauge, nebulous way that's completely undefined and unexplained, and you think these two things are the /same/ then I don't know what to tell you.

#+begin_quote
  Where was this said?
#+end_quote

I've literally quoted this above.

But whatever. It's in the same conversation. Ivah was talking about harvesting the Night, then Cat asked about alternate ways to increase power, first inquiring as to advancing their own skills would work, and second whether killing non-Drow would work similarly to killing Drow.

If there was a topic change, it was not signaled in any way. The only evidence is that the word "grow" was used, which isn't evidence at all.

"Growing" the night implies, believe it or not, increasing the Night. Which implies that after they kill non-Drow cattle, there is more Night. So a Drow killing non-Drow gets them more Night, unless there's a pretty huge addendum to be added on here that there's no textual evidence for.

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't supposed to be, buddy.
#+end_quote

Then what was the point? I'm going to be honest here, I don't find the failures of your memory to be hugely relevant.
