  'Arcadia was, in a lot of ways, rawer than Creation proper. In Creation stories bound only the Named, but in Arcadia everything was a story. It was why everything was so changeable. I was standing in front of an enemy clearly winning against me, at his mercy, and had just prompted him to gloat and reveal his plans. So he had. Even if he didn't want to.' -Chapter 7 Elaboration.

Notably, this means that the Drow can exploit the story in Arcadia. Everything from the fae, to /time itself/, has to obey the script.

  They're a threat to Cat after she's gotten sloppy and arrogant, assuming that nothing in the Everdark can threaten her, not to mention we've never seen her use the full power of her mantle.

And Mighty Urulan made her draw deeper from her mantle than when Cat utterly obliterated one of her Wild Hunt members. Also, for the record, Cat after she's gotten sloppy and arrogant is able to beat down half the heroes of the Crusade without undue issue.

Do you think there are random fae wandering around Arcadia that could utterly trounce Cat? because that would necessitate her using Arcadia in a /very/ different way than what we've seen.

  Plus her understanding of her own power is fairly poor, whereas the fae have been wielding their mantles since before Creation existed. The difference in skill level is vast.

We both remember the level of skill displayed by Mighty Urulan, right?
