Yeah, sorry about writing the literal exact opposite of what I meant. Oops.

You built a lot of arguments around a faulty understanding of what is in the text.

If the Night is as you interpret then there is literally nothing that could have stopped the Drow and their place as a backwater ruin dismissed by all and cowering from the greater world makes absolutely no sense.

But if the Drow are as we interpret their position makes perfect sense.

They can /harvest/ Night from each other to grow their own personal power, or "grow the Night" by preying on outsiders. The difference is not elaborated on but the text is clear that there /is/ a difference. I speculate that "growing the Night" empowers either Sve Noc itself or all Drow who hold Night, but by the tiniest fraction.

Their culture is built exclusively around the pursuit of personal power, yet exile to "grow the night" via surface raids is a suicide mission reserved for failures and outcasts while the more successful a Drow is the closer they stay to central Drow territory. Again, this makes no sense with your interpretation of the Night mechanics but perfect sense with our interpretation.

This just comes down to a misinterpretation. Perhaps the author should have been more clear or should reword things.
