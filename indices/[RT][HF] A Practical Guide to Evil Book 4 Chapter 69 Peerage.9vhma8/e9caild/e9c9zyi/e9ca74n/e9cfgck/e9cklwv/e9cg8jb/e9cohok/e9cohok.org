Yeah, this is kind of weird. If anything, it would have made more sense for Cat to swear the weakest Mighty to her, and use them to gang up on the stronger ones one by one using portals to separate them.

Or use Arcadia time schenanigans so that they have to spend months living in the wild, slowly being ground down, with no news from their Sigil, while only a few hours pass in the physical world.
