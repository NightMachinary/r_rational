  It only dawns on them later that they're successfully fighting against all of the other Drow.
#+end_quote

This seems like it would be quite dumb of the Drow, when Cat has already explained how she's heading to see Sve Noc, and has just shown them the methods she's going to be using. Add to that tht conquering the Everdark and jostling for better positions is the default stance of Sigil-Holders and, well, I don't see how they could have missed it.

  When Cat comes in with a great show of force
#+end_quote

But that show off force is locking them away from Arcadia, where they're stronger than 99% of the natives, aren't concerned with environemtal hazards, don't have to deal with the dwarves or the Dead King or the Ratlings, don't have to spearhead an army pointed at bigger and badder drow than them, and they don't have to swear binding oaths which permanently restricts their behaviour under the threat of death. Weigh up the costs and the benefits, and joining the slave -army doesn't seem like a great idea.

What on earth made them start giving up after 24 hours and sell themselves into slavery? Was it the health benefits of Cat's army?

  the first inclination is to cozy up to her to barter or take
#+end_quote

Again, this is not a regular deal. The Drow had the terms and coniditons of cat's oaths, which are fairly all encompassing, signs away most of their free will, and could lead to their deaths at any given moment. Their reaction to this idea in chapter 66 was pretty telling.

But with the amazing, awe-inspiring ability to send them to /Arcadia/, where almost nothing poses a danger to them... made them give up in 24 hours? Even before whatever happened with Orelik happened?
