I think you're greatly underestimating the powers of the faes here. Cat has, at best, the power of a princess, and she can use only a small fraction of her Mantle's power. Even with that she can beat one of the sigil-holder of Lotow. The other sigil holder cannot be stronger by too much otherwise they would already have taken over the weaker sigils. This means any prince/princess significantly outclasses the sigil-holder.

As for random fae taking them down, we've been shown time and time again that a large number of mooks can overpower a champion. The most recent example is just 2 chapters ago, and Arcadia has plenty of fae nobles in addition to mooks.

As far Cat > Larat? Larat was weakened by him resigning his commission. She is certainly not stronger than the Prince of Nightfall.
