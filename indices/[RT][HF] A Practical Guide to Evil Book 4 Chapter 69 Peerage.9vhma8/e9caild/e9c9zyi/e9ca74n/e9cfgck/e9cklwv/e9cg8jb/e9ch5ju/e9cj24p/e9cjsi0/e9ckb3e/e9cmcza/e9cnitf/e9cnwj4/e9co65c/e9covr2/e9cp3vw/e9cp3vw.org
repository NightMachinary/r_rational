  But there have been some damn good interludes amongst it all, on the bright side.

Yeah, the interludes have really been the best chapters in this book. There were some very good parts in the Keter arc but the interludes centered on Black and Warlock have been fantastic. The three Red Flower Vales chapters were a high point.
