  The Mighty are behind the times on the current situation of greater Calernia, owing to their long, long isolation, but narratives and stories are quite literally a concept older than Creation itself, as is Arcadia. the physics engine of the universe is hardly some great secret, and seems exactly like the sort of knowledge that would still be floating around in the Night as an actual secret.

Fair enough, I phrased that badly. My point was that, not being Named, narrative doesn't apply to their conflicts. Therefore they have no need to develop the skills and knowledge of stories that Black and Catherine have. It's long been established that narrative effects only apply to Named and on the scale of nations across centuries.

'Arcadia was, in a lot of ways, rawer than Creation proper. In Creation stories bound only the Named, but in Arcadia everything was a story. It was why everything was so changeable. I was standing in front of an enemy clearly winning against me, at his mercy, and had just prompted him to gloat and reveal his plans. So he had. Even if he didn't want to.' -Chapter 7 Elaboration.

  Again, these guys a threat to the faerie queen. A single guy explicitly called out as their lessor has capabilities far above anything the Duke of Violent Squalls demonstrated, going by their respective fights. This whole plan came about because Cat, Queen of Air and Darkness, couldn't take these guys in a fight. Are you telling me some random fae at the edge of Winter took one of them in a fight offscreen

They're a threat to Cat after she's gotten sloppy and arrogant, assuming that nothing in the Everdark can threaten her, not to mention we've never seen her use the full power of her mantle. She always uses her power as shallowly as possible to avoid the influence of Winter overtaking her rational thought. Plus her understanding of her own power is fairly poor, whereas the fae have been wielding their mantles since before Creation existed. The difference in skill level is vast.
