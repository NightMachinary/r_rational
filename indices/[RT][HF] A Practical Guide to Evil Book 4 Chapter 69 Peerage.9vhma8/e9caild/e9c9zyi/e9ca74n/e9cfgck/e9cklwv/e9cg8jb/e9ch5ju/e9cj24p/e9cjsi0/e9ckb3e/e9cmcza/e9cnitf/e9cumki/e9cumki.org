I know you excepted her, but the former Queen of Summer casually roasted hundreds of soldiers with barely any effort back in book two and is a decent metric for how strong Cat /could/ be. Additionally, Winter is skilled in subterfuge and cunning instead of straight “in your face” damage. Cat's strong, but she's nowhere near willing enough to fully embrace her mantle. I mean, look at what she's been doing compared to the crazy stuff Akua pulled. Additionally, she's a close range fighter at heart.

(Serious question though, why hasn't she whipped out her domain yet? Or is she planning on using it as a trump card against Sve Noc?)

Regardless, time flows differently in Arcadia. A week to Cat might have been months or years to them
