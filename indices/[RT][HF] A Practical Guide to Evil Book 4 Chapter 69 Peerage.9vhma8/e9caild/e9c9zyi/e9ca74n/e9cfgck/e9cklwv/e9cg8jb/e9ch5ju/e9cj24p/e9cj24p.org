I don't think the fae's performance in Book 3 is an accurate depiction of their combat power. Remember, fae nobles contain immense power.

The Duke of Violent Squalls was called a lesser god. Masego told Cat that if he crossed into Creation in his full power he could quite possibly conquer Callow single handed. Every fae noble killed by the Woe and the Legions was either in Creation (and had surrendered most of their power to cross the boundary) or fighting a Named with a strong narrative advantage in Arcadia, where stories are much more important than anything else.

The Mighty, for all their strengths, are not Named. They lack the advantages that come with a Name. They lack narrative weight, unnatural instincts and the way powerful Named warp the people and the world around them. Against fae their only tool would be the Night, which is formidable, but the fae would be able to wield their full power against them within Arcadia. The Mighty also have no idea how to leverage narrative or avoid dangerous stories. They would easily fall into traps by behaving like the Evil creatures they are.
