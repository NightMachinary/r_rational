  Drow can very explicitly take Night from non-Drow.

You're totally misunderstanding how the Night works. Growing the Night simply means adding more knowledge/experience to it, and you can do this by fighting just like everyone else. But to grow significantly stronger quickly you have to actually take the Night, and that's possible only if the opponent has Nights to take.
