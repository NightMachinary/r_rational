  To be fair, apparently the Drow spent less than a day looking for a way out before they reconsidered signing on with Cat. Which is, uh, not really what I'd call trying hard.

This really is weird.

  why would the Drow even want to go back to the Everdark?

I never thought of this but you're right, why wouldn't they use Arcadia to travel to another part of Calernia and harvest Night without having to go through the Kingdom of the Dead, the Golden Bloom or the Chain of Hunger? Adding to the Night is a sacred task after all.

In reality of course they'd be killed by heroes in short order. Ancient monsters escaped from their underground realm feasting on innocents? That's one strong story especially if the Heavenly Light is as effective as I think it will be against the Night. But they wouldn't know that and even if they did they'd probably be arrogant enough to try it anyway.
