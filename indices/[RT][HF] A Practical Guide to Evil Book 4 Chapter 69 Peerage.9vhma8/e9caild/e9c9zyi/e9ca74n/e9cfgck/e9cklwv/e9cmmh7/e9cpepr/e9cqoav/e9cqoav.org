And?

I appreciate you providing quotes, but you've missed the point of what I was saying.

+you+ (Edit:XeL09) said:

#+begin_quote
  cat comes and with a completely unknown way, transports you to a land you know nothing
#+end_quote

which has two claims in it.

First, that the Drow have no knowledge of how Cat transported them to Arcadia (ie through a gate). And second, that they know nothing about Arcadia.

Neither of these things are evidenced to be true, and are likely not. That's what I was responding to. Again:

#+begin_quote
  all the knowledge since the fall of the Drow empire is freely floating around in the Night, and Arcadia was most definitely still a thing back then.
#+end_quote

Edit: missed who had responded.
