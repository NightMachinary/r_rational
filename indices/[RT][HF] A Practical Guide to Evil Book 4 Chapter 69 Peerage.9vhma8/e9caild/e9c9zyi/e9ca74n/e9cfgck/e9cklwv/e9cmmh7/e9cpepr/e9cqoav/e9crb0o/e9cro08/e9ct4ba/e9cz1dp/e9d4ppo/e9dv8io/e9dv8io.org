  Are you familiar with the term 'Race to the Bottom'?
#+end_quote

Yes, but it also doesn't apply here?

A 'Race to the Bottom' implies states compete with each other by cutting taxes / business lowering prices /wahteer in order to attract people towards them, but at the cost of lowering living standards/product quality/working conditions/etc. and making everyone worse off.

Even if you take the logic of the situation at face value this isn't a race to the bottom, because this isn't a competition trying to attract individuals with positive qualities. This is Cat trying to enslave 7 demigods by dropping them in the wilderness, and then a day later they go "fiiine, I'll sign whatever you want" without actually looking around for a way out.

How do you relate the 'race to the bottom' with the drow only looking around for a day before deciding that escape is impossible and they want to sign onto be Cat's slaves?

Right, thanks. Alien culture and all, I'm finding it easy to get tripped up by the "Priestess" of the Night.

  You're following Cat's uneducated assumptions with this point.

I'm really not. I'm following Ivah's highly educated knowledge:

  Killing cattle,” I said. “Taking it. What does it do for you?”

  “The Night grows,” Ivah smiled. “To do such sacred act would redeem any disgrace.”

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. *“If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”*

  *“That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”*

  I sucked at my lip.

  “Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

  The drow paled.

  “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

  “It does, doesn't it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.

You see?

  We do know that the 'Splendid' are not considered cattle.
#+end_quote

This is a function of their power, not their worth. Mighty aren't cattle either, but they can be harvested just fine. If there's some exception to the fae for night purposes, then it's not explained or hinted at anywhere in the text.

And it's still not an issue? Do you think the Drow said "Oh no, even after I casually kill fae, I can't harvest Night - I'd better sell myself into eternal slavery where I can't harvest Night freely anyway".
