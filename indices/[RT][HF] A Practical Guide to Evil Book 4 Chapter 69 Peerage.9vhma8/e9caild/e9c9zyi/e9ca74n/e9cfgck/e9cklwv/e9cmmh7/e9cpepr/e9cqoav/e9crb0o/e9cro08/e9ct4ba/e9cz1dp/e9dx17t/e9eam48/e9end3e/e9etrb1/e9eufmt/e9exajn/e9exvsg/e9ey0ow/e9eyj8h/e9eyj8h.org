So your position is that you can take skills/knowledge/Secrets from those without Night, but you can't be take power?

This seems incoherent when you remember that for the Night, secrets and power are the same thing:

  “You make it sound like there is more to the Night than the shadow tricks,” I said.

  “That is so,” Ivah said, then touched its lips. “*Shapeless and shaped, encompassing all*. The worthy take. The worthy rise.”

  It's knowledge too, I realized.

They gain Night by turning the dead bodies into Night, that's their vector for taking Secrets.

That's what happened when Sve created the first of the night from the corpses of the Twilight Sages.

But if you've got any textual support for your theory, I'm all ears.
