  This assumes that the Drow don't know that Arcadia, or gates to it, exist.

Those permanent gates that William used were in the Waning Woods, which are supposed to be uniquely connected to the fae. They form Callow's southern border and are apparently the cause of some bizarre weather patterns:

'The lands between Helike and Atalante were known for the occasional bouts of week-long rain and storms, blown south from the Waning Woods and the madness that passed for nature over there. The Fae toyed with the winds and the sky the way men did with their clothes, and the farms beneath them paid the price.'

-Prologue Book 3.

“There must be several gates, then, spread across the Waning Woods,” Masego replied, tone enthusiastic. “Few of them have the ability to actually cross from Arcadia into Creation.”

-Chapter 25: Wake.
