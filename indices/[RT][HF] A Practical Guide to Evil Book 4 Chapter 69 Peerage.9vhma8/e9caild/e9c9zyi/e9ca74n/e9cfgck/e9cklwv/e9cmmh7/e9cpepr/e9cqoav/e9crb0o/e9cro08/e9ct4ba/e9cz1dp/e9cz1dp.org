  To be fair, apparently the Drow spent less than a day looking for a way out before they reconsidered signing on with Cat. Which is, uh, not really what I'd call trying hard.

I think this has to do with culture shock. The vast majority of Drow have never left the Underdark. The outside is where the /weak/ go. They couldn't "find a way out" because they have have no frame of reference to. Additionally these are not people who /learn/ things, they /take secrets/. You've expecting them to act like scientific-rational!Drow, but harvesting Night is the be-all-end-all of society and it is extremely anti-intellectual. To misquote the philosopher Homer "[Night], the solution to and cause of all of life's problems".
