  Sure, odds were good that every single member of my Peerage -- even Ivah -- would turn on me in a heartbeat if their oaths allowed for it, but for all that there was a simplicity to the proceedings that I enjoyed.

This just reinforces how vulnerable this whole Drow system is. Take out the oaths and the Drow turn on Cat, which she probably will not survive. And she doesn't think that this critical point is going to fail at the worst possible moment? If not here, then the moment she faces heroic opposition.

  I was dealing with other warlords, and even before I'd stolen Crepuscular from Akua's mind

Speaking of, I feel like there lots of useful skills and knowledge to take from Akua. Magic, history, diplomacy, and so on. All of the blind spots that she's complaining about here that Akua had tutors to instruct her in.

  Most of those had come from Great Lotow, reluctantly bending the knee after wandering around the outskirts of Arcadia for a while and finding no way out save the one I'd offered. Slaus and Sagas had been the first to fold, remaining where I'd left them and taking the oaths after a single day. The others trickled into my service over the following week as my sigil settled our other affairs in the city. Nodoi and Vasyl had held out for three and five days, respectively, finding no trouble living off the land but no way back to the Everdark either. By then I'd already bullied Losle and Zarkan into oath-taking after a few demonstrations of how dangerous living in places with only one entrance and exit could be when that space could be closed off by gate. Kanya and Soln had refused the longest, the full seven days, and they'd only changed their minds after Mighty Orelik vanished without a trace.

Wait, what?

These seven demigods wandered around Arcadia for anywhere from a single day to a single week, couldn't find an easy way out, and so /sold themselves into slavery/?

Huh?

What was even dangerous to them? The cold? The fae? Will spent six months running from the Wild Hunt back in Arcadia back in book one, then left under his own power. Black was using this for fast travel in book 2, before again leaving under his own power. These guys could crush a dozen Wills or Blacks without even noticing. Did the Drow get homesick?

Seriously, we jump from chapter 66 when these guys are vowing that they will never bow down, that they will kill Cat for what she's done... and then 24 hours later they're signing away their autonomy so they can fight and die in Cat's slave army?

I notice that I am confused.
