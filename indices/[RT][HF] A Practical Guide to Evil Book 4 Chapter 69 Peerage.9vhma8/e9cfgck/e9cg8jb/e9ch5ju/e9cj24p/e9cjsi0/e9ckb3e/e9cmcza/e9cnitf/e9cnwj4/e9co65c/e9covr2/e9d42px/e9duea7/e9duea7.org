  (Hi again-we talked last chapter)

Hey, hope you're going well :)

  . I don't believe that we have seen anything like the capacity for either of these two characters. Cat instigated the story of a long-lost daughter killing her father. She manipulated the fight by literally publishing propaganda and publicizing the new narrative.

You might want to take a look at that fight again.

Cat fought the Duke of Violent Squalls, in an almost straight fight in Arcadia, at the fullness of his power. Her story manipulations amounted to this:

  It wasn't handing me the victory in a handbasket -- the fake prophecy hadn't been well-crafted enough for that -- but I'd touched the story just enough I could twist it. That there was a chance for me to win.
#+end_quote

Which is to say that Cat's victory was by no means assured, and it came down to a contest of skill and power, which Cat then won. Cat, who was still just the squire with two aspects to her name.

Any one of these guys is so much more powerful than what Cat was then that it's not even funny. And there were seven of them. See where I'm going with this? The locals aren't a threat, they're food.

  arguably Larat as well
#+end_quote

Cat's strength being greater than Larat's is a big part of why she can keep him in line.

  When the drow are in their element they have some neat cantrips that interfere with Cat. But on the home turf of the Fae there's no reason to over-hype the low-versatility of Night users.
#+end_quote

"Low-versatility of Night users". We're talking abut the /same/ Night users, right? Urulan, on his own, in the space of about 2 minutes, pulled out a list of powers that looks something like this:

Dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode.

That's more powers than we've seen from just about any other character. And there were 7 of these guys, all of whom had more Night (and thus more Secrets) than Mighty Urulan.

And you say "neat cantrips that interfere with Cat", like the net outcome of Cat having super-healing, and the Drow being able to slighty interfere with said super healing, was somehow a net positive for the Drow. No. Take that out of the equation and the fight would have been over after the opening exchange. Cat only won because Urulan thought he'd killed her - and if she'd been a regular human, or a regular /fae/, he would have.
