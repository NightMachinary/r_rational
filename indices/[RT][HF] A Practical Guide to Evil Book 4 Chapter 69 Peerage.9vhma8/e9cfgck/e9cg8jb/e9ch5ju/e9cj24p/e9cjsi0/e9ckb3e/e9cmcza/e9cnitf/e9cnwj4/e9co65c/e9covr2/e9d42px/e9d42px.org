  We've gotten a very good look at what the power of a Duke/Duches looks like, with both Violent Squalls and Cat herself

(Hi again-we talked last chapter)

This quote helps explain some of the disagreement we were having. I don't believe that we have seen anything like the capacity for either of these two characters. Cat instigated the story of a long-lost daughter killing her father. She manipulated the fight by literally publishing propaganda and publicizing the new narrative. Her standing wrt combat is still firmly below the King of Winter, and arguably Larat as well. Her own power has been grossly misused - the “principle alienation” stops her from using the power freely. She's more of a bucket for Winter's power than a conduit.

This translates to a lot of uncertainty in the “power rankings” but Guideverse has been very explicit about how a>b>c logic fails; success in combat is not a transitive property. When the drow are in their element they have some neat cantrips that interfere with Cat. But on the home turf of the Fae there's no reason to over-hype the low-versatility of Night users.
