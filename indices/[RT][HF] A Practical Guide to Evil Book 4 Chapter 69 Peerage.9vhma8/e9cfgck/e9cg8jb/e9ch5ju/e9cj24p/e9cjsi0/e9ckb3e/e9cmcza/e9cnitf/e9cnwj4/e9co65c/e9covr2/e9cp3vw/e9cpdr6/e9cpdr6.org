I enjoyed that section too, although I had some issues with how the Augur apparently missed that Black had spent several months preparing to have a mountain fall on the armies. You really dropped the ball there, Agnes.

My personal favourite probably has to be /Queen's Gambit, Declined/ (where Pilgrim catches Black) although there are a few contenders.
