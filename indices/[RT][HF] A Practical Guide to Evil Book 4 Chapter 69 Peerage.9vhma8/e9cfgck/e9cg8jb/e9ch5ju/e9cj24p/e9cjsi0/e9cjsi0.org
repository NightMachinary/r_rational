Again, these guys a threat to the /faerie queen/. A single guy explicitly called out as their lessor has capabilities far above anything the Duke of Violent Squalls demonstrated, going by their respective fights. This whole plan came about because Cat, Queen of Air and Darkness, couldn't take these guys in a fight. Are you telling me some random fae at the edge of Winter took one of them in a fight offscreen?

Larat, formerly known as the prince of Nightfall, is one of the biggest fae dogs around by all accounts, and sigil-holders>Cat>Larat>most any fae the Drow are going to be nearby.

  The Mighty also have no idea how to leverage narrative or avoid dangerous stories.

Source, please.

The Mighty are behind the times on the current situation of greater Calernia, owing to their long, long isolation, but narratives and stories are quite literally a concept older than Creation itself, as is Arcadia. the physics engine of the universe is hardly some great secret, and seems exactly like the sort of knowledge that would still be floating around in the Night as an /actual/ secret.

Plus, Cat is currently checking a lot of story boxes that fall into Classic Evil, with monologues and death traps she walked away from and truce-breaking and ultimatums about joining her and obvious failure points and so on. By all rights, the story should be about to punish her for that
