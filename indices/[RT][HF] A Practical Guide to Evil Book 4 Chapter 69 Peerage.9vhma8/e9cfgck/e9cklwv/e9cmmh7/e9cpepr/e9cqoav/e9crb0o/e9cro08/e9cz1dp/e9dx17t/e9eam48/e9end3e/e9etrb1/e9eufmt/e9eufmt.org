  Nothing you've quoted contradicts what I said,
#+end_quote

Except for all of it?

What do you think Ivah meant, when it said that they could take Night from non-Drow?

What do you think it means, to claim the necromancy of the undead for the Night?

What do you think they were out doing in the Burning Lands, trying to collect Night?

When the Twilight Sages were turned into Night... what do you think happened?

#+begin_quote
  you're making tons of assertions with nothing to back it up
#+end_quote

As far as I can tell, you're the one making claims without even trying to evidence them.

#+begin_quote
  At this point there's no point in arguing
#+end_quote

I'll agree with that.

#+begin_quote
  because it makes the Night totally OP
#+end_quote

This is a concern I have, actually. Although Cat's already pretty OP even without that.
