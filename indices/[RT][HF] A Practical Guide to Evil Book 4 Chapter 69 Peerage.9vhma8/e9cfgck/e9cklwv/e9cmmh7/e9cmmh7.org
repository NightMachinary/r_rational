  cat comes and with a completely unknown way, transports you to a land you know nothing about and you can't escape with your powers.

This assumes that the Drow don't know that Arcadia, or gates to it, exist. Which is a weird assumption when all the knowledge since the fall of the Drow empire is freely floating around in the Night, and Arcadia was most definitely still a thing back then. They just didn't know Cat could make portals to Arcadia, going in, because why would they?

  one of your peers, who you likely would not want to fight solo, disappears. no plotting, no attack fucking disappears.

For one, you're making assumptions about what went down with Orelik, when the sum total we know about it is one throwaway line.

For another, Mighty were surrendering well before that Orelik vanished. Slaus and Sagas gave in within a single day, deciding to sign away their eternal lives to Cat's slave army. Note that theire immediate reaction to being transported to Arcadia by an unknown power wasn't fear or dread, but a resounding "fuck you".

  is that what the trapped mighty would think? no, they look down on each other but still respect their ability so obviously it was worst case scenario.

They respect each other's ability, so obviously one of them got killed? Sorry, I'm really not following what you're trying to say here.
