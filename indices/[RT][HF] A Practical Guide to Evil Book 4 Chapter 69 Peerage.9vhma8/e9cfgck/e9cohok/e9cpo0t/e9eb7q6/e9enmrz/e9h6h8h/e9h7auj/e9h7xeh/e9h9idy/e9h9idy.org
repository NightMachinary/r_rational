  Yeah, sorry about writing the literal exact opposite of what I meant. Oops.
#+end_quote

All good haha. Happens to the best of us.

  They can harvest Night from each other to grow their own personal power, or "grow the Night" by preying on outsiders. The difference is not elaborated on but the text is clear that there is a difference. I speculate that "growing the Night" empowers either Sve Noc itself or all Drow who hold Night, but by the tiniest fraction.
#+end_quote

The problem with this argument is the Ivah conodrum. Ivah was sent out of the Gloom to gain night by killing non-Drow, with the expectation that it would die, but the possibility of gaining Night.

If you want a quote, have this:

#+begin_quote
  “I return bereft of Night, failing the terms of my exile.”
#+end_quote

Which is to say, it's possible to get Night outside the Everdark, and have that Night added to your personal power.

This makes sense, because the nature of the Night is that it's /always/ been something that was stolen and converted. The first of the Night was taken from the Twilight Sages. We had an explicit conversation as to how the Drow can steal the necromantic magic of the undead.

#+begin_quote
  Again, this makes no sense with your interpretation of the Night mechanics but perfect sense with our interpretation.
#+end_quote

The issue with your interpretation is that it's not supported by any of the explanation of Night we've received, or any of the examples we've seen.

I agree that it means we need a stronger explanation of why Drow haven't left the Everdark... but we kind of need that anyway?

Your interpretation still incentivizes Sve/whoever benefits from "growing the Night" to send out powerful Drow to grow the Night.

#+begin_quote
  This just comes down to a misinterpretation. Perhaps the author should have been more clear or should reword things.
#+end_quote

I thought it was pretty clear, but yeah, obviously there's some contention around the issue.
