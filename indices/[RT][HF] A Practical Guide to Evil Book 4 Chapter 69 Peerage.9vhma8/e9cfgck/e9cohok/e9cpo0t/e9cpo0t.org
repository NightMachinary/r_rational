  Yeah, this is kind of weird. If anything, it would have made more sense for Cat to swear the weakest Mighty to her, and use them to gang up on the stronger ones one by one using portals to separate them.

Yeah, a slow build up tipping into an avalanche would have made much more sense to me than all the Drow deciding that, no actually, being Cat's eternal slave under threat of death in an army pointed at Sve Noc sounds quite nice.

  Or use Arcadia time schenanigans so that they have to spend months living in the wild, slowly being ground down, with no news from their Sigil, while only a few hours pass in the physical world.

Maybe this is what happened? If so, it was very poorly communicated and doesn't really jibe with the description we got.

I'm also not sure it would have made much difference if they were there for that long? Like, what's threatening them in Arcadia? A guy noted as weaker than any of them was almost a match for the Queen of Air and Darkness herself, and there were /seven/ of them. What was going to threaten them?

We've got a good idea of the power level associated with a Duchy, with the Duke of Violent Squalls and our very own (former) Duchess of Moonless Nights, and it seems pretty clear that any one of the seven Mighty could have won such a fight alone. And if they'd run into such a fae, well, that's their ride home. That's how Black and Warlock got in and out of Arcadia back in book 2.

Hell, why did they even want to go back to the Everdark? That place sucks, it's about to be overrun with dwarves, and it means joining Cat's slave army and fighting their way to Sve Noc herself. Arcadia, on the other hand, is full of Fae to harvest, doesn't have dwarves or Dead Kings, and lets them keep their autonomy.
