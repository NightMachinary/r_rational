How does the default of making a Reddit thread compare to these options, in your opinion? It seems to my untrained eye that a standard thread is similar superficially to a limited Range vote, where the range is (-1, 0, 1), although the canceling nature of a downvote might mean the difference is quite stark.

It wouldn't be too out there to make a Google form for the final vote, or to use another site such as straw poll (which I hadn't considered until you brought it up), so we'll just have to see what people's opinions are.
