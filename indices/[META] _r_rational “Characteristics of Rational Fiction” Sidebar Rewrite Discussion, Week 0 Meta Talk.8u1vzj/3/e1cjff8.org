While the details are too much for me, my initial thought is that contest mode upvoting is not a good idea. I think the vote should be public and come with names attached. It's not such a big deal that it /has/ to be a private vote, and this way people will vote smarter, not to mention it will be way harder to brigade.

Of course, if votes are public then we run the risk of popularity skewing the vote, now that I think about it. Maybe just DMs confirming google form entries with range voting? The important part is that we don't get thoughtless votes or brigading, because we have more enemies than we'd care to acknowledge and I don't want to be stuck with a meme definition forever
