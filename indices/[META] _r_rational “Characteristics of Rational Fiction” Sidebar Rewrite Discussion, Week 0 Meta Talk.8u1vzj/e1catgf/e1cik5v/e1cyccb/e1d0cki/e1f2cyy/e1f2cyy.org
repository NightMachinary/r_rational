My main concern is that a better definition will necessarily be a more /complex/ one - and specificity is correlated with restrictiveness. All those past threads show that it's hard to pin down a definition of rational fiction while also retaining the cogency and approachability of the current list (the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6s2cad/meta_a_suggested_rewrite_of_the_characteristics/][suggested rewrite]] is a real mouthful). Even though the current list doesn't rigorously capture the essence of the genre, I'd venture that it's made the idea of rationality more approachable to the average reader.

And as [[/u/Kinoite]] alludes to, boundaries that are an order of magnitude stricter aren't helpful to the presumptive majority of the subreddit who are here to explore stories. I'd personally prefer a tweak or pithy annex based on what people's biggest problems are with the current definition.
