I think it could be helpful, if put forward specifically as a focal-lens-thingy for introspecting our personal experience as readers. What qualities do we enjoy in these works, which of those do we associate with the rational genre in particular, what did we notice the most when we read our first ratjecent work, etc?

It's often brought up that we're in a situation of knowing it when we see it. We have a common intuitive conception, and presented with a particular work we can often go aye/nay, but with decreasing consistency the farther we get from central category members. In trying to nail down this category, it seems absolutely indispensable to have taken a long, hard look at ourselves asking - when I put [work] inside this category, on what basis do I do so and which of these traits are important?

So, I think it's a good idea to discuss particular works in a dedicated space, with some restrictions. For example, absolutely no debate on categorization, only discussion on and comparison of our personal experiences.
