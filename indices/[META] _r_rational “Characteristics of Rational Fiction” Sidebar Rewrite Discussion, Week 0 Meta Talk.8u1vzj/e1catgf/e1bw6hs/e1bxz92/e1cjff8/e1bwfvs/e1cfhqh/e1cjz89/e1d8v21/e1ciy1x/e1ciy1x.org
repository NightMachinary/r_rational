Hmm. I'm not sure simply having a post-it/don't-post-it choice would give us the data we want. At least /I/ planned to use the arguments to look at people's reasoning for /why/ they consider a story rational, which a binary choice wouldn't accomplish.

Perhaps a binary choice + write-in form for reasoning, then? With all results being made public afterwards. This setup does accomplish something useful, namely an opportunity for people to clearly state their opinions without getting into an argument.

I support this, conditional on including a write-in option. I'm not sure we should post it right now, though, it may distract from this meta-discussion. Perhaps a few days later, if it'll be clear the meta-discussion died down?
