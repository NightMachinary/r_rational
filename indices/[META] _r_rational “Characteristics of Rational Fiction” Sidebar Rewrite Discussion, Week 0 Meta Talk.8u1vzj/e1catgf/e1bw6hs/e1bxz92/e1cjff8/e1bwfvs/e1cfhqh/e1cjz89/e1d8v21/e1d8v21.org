I'd prefer to have both a survey and the companion thread for discussing individual stories discussed above.

A survey will, I suspect, give a clearer picture of which kind of stories are considered rational/rationalist (both because the threshold for filling out a google form is much lower than the one for jumping into a discussion thread and because the discussion thread will likely only focus on the more controversial stories) and people can then jump into the discussion thread if they want to elaborate on why a particular story is/isn't rational(ist).

Besides, you definitely want to have a way to keep the debates about individual stories from bogging down the central discussion. That means either strict moderation or a companion thread to point people to (one of those options will cause significantly less grumbling than the other).
