post/don't post was an attempt to keep the questions as unbiased as possible. Yeah, it won't offer any insight on a particular story, but if there's a pattern where this big group of fics is "allowed" and this this big group isn't, one can draw conclusions based on the trend. Hopefully we would be able to redraw boundaries based on the trend rather than simply forcing existing misconceptions.
