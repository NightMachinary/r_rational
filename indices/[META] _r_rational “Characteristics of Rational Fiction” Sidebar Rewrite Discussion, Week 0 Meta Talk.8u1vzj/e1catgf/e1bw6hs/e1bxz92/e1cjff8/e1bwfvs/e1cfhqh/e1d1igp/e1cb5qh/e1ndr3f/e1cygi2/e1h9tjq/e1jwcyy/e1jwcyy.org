I too feel like the tag approach may be the best course here.

After all, this is quite a small community, and rational genre is very small. Most good works out there will only coincidentally meet our criteria, especially considering our preference towards more fun (rather than purely realistic and serious) works of fiction.

Tags allow for a more broad criteria of "how many elements/what parts of it are rational" rather than "does it fit our closed box of rationality".

This kind of quantification (and evaluation) of singular qualities (tags) allows to compare works on a more mathematical level. This would allow us a more structured approach, tallying 'good' and 'bad' parts, rather than endless debates on whether or not a piece of work is good enough.
