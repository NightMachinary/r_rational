The schedule seems... suboptimal.

For scheduling and ground rules? Sure, a week is lots.

For voting on a fully-formed idea? A week should be fine.

But three intermediate steps? That sounds like it would take longer. Maybe two weeks for each of those steps?

I'm also feeling that there's at least one poll missing, although I'm not sure if should be after Step 1, or Step 2, or both. An attempt to get the definitions of terms nailed down, or get a consensus yea or nay about whether certain tropes are expected.

What I'm basically looking for with that extra polling step is so people largely have the same parts to build their solution out of, rather than having a dozen different nearly-identical submissions because people can't agree on a definition of, say, the difference between a Doylist explanation and a Watsonian one.
