Yeah, that was definitely an ambiguity, but I hadn't quite realized it until I'd copied the matrix of questions for all the fics, and by then was too lazy to hand-edit all of them.

Your interpretation is the way I saw it as well, except that I took "hell yeah" to mean "multiple times". Either way works, since the important part for that question is really the yes/no.
