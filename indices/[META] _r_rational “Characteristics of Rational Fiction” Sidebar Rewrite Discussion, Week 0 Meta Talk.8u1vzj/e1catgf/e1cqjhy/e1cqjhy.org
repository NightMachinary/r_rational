I think that there's an additional role that the subreddit plays (hinted at with your third point):

#+begin_quote
  Act as a guideline for authors of future works.
#+end_quote

Mother of Learning's author was (if I have heard it through the grapevine correctly) introduced to the concept of rational fiction after beginning that work, which lead to a slight difference in focus as he strove to incorporate our tenets.

The position that this subreddit holds is more than just a set of submission rules, it's also a set of guidelines to consider when creating content as well. Having a well-defined set of characteristics informs not only what works can or ought to be posted here, but guides the shape of works yet to come, so we may as well attempt to be clear with what it is that we /want/.

(Plus, y'know, maybe the sidebar /doesn't/ need to be a filter for what's posted. Maybe it /should/ be a vague creed that isn't enforced. I don't know. But that edges away from the meta discussion a bit.)
