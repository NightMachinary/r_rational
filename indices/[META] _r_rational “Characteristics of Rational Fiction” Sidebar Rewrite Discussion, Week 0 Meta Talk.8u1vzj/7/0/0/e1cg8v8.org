Yeah a reddit thread is Range voting (assuming we take top score as winner) assuming voters vote on all options (there might be some small bias if people don't look at all the options because then ignored options basically get an automatic 5/10 vote, but that's probably very minor/irrelevant). The downvote threshold thing is annoying (also less abuse protection maybe? Probably not important) and I'm also a bit worried about the inconvenience for lurkers without accounts, though happy about the convenience for those that do have accounts and the ease of doing so.

I just brought up straw poll just because I'm familiar with it, its really easy to set up and vote in and I haven't set up a vote with google forms before (I think I have voted in a google form before but I don't remember what it was like).
