Re: Voting system

Given the following:

- We use preference utilitarianism as a basis for judging the best voting method
- Every person affected by an issue has an equal stake in the outcome and is a voter
- Everyone's knowledge of the affect of the vote is either perfect or imperfect in ways that aren't correlated with how they vote
- People aren't able to/decide not to vote strategically
- All voting systems has equal easy to implement/understand, or more generally have the same "cost"
- Other things I'm forgetting

Then the best voting method is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting][Range voting]] (which makes intuitive sense since you're just putting down your preferences and then the result is whichever option maximizes preference).

If you want to drop the "nobody votes strategically" and "all voting systems are equally easy to implement" then [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting][Approval voting]] becomes the clear winner.

My hunch is that on one hand people won't be able to vote strategically cause its not like there's going to be a bunch of polling beforehand and who actually cares enough to be a dick about it. Buuut setting up range voting might be a pain in the ass, whereas approval voting is just using [[https://www.strawpoll.me/][strawpoll]] with the "Allow multiple poll answers" option checked. My vote is approval voting unless someone can be bothered to find a good service that allows range voting.
