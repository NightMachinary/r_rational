This seems like a "[[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries][Disguised Queries]]" thing. The point of creating a category is so we can do things with it. But what problem are we trying to solve when we're refining the definition?

The subreddit provides me with 3 kind of useful content:

1. Update notices for stories that I'm currently following.
2. Links / recommendations to stories that I could follow.
3. Discussion about writing.

The current volume of posts is easily manageable. So, excluding stories would make the subreddit less useful. Including more stories could be nice.

I'm not sure that I really see a problem with people posting stuff that they shouldn't. So, refined genre-boundaries wouldn't necessarily help me much.
