Generally speaking, I think a definition that allows for a greater amount of rational (and non-rational) fiction would be a good idea. If a story that is non-rational and unpopular gets posted, then people won't read it or upvote it. But if a story that does not fit the conventional parameters of rational fic were posted, and did end up being popular, then it would be upvoted and the amount of good fiction on this sub would increase. I seriously doubt, based on this forum's fan base, that you're going to get a lot of BTS and Stucky fics just because you broaden the definition. :) It'll likely be decent fics from people who are trying to make quality work. Basically, if your priority is more content to read, a looser and more inclusive definition is better.
