I propose an additional discussion thread: *Practical Problems thread*.

We'll pick a few stories which are widely considered rational, and a few stories rationality of which is widely /controversial/. Then we'll analyse why, exactly, we hold those opinions, compare the stories, figure out what we /actually/ look for in a rational story, and so on.

I think it would be insightful. I would suggest putting this as a separate thread after the "Problem Discussion" thread, or as a /part/ of the "Problem Discussion" thread. I prefer the separate thread option, since I suspect it will require multiple parallel discussions, and would distract from the thread's intended purpose.

Additionally, we could have a "definition practice run" after the Solution Proposal thread, in which we would compare the definitions we came up with by judging which stories are considered rational according to what definition.

Conveniently, I've made [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ScI2wg9CH50jeWw25U69hDZSYh_NVA93lYtoa9d1Ew/edit#gid=0][a list]] of many works which I saw discussed/linked-to on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. We could pick from those. (It's currently roughly divided into "rational", "likely rational", and "controversial", according to my subjective opinion and my understanding of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s opinion. It should be noted that I didn't read many of them, so don't pay too much attention to the divide.)

As example, I could suggest the following combination:

*Controversial:* [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian][/The Martian/]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][/A Practical Guide to Evil/]], [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][/Worm/]] or [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][/Twig/]], [[http://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][/Dungeon Keeper Ami/]].

*Rational:* [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26058753-eden-green][/Eden Green/]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][/Cordyceps/]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/68wlhx/rst_fork_in_the_road_rluna_lovewell/][/Fork in the Road/]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][/Worth the Candle/]], [[https://qntm.org/ra][/Ra/]].

In particular, /Eden Green/ and /Cordyceps/ have some elements of deliberate irrationality, and /Fork in the Road/ is a very short and simple story, which could generate some interesting discussion.

One issue here is that, whatever combination we'll go with, not everyone will have read all of the chosen stories. We should ensure maximum coverage, so that everyone has something to +argue about+ constructively discuss, but at the same time we must explore edge cases. Perhaps stick to popular longer works, and shorter edge-case ones? If we decide on the combination this week, and agree to do this in a separate thread, people will have more than a week to read.
