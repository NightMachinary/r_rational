I think that arguing about individual works is unlikely to be helpful, will suck up a lot of time and effort, and not actually get us that much closer to a working definition. However, I think that people are going to do it /anyway/, so yes, I'd like them to have some place to talk about the whys and wherefores of the deep lore and/or character actions and/or narrative structure and choices of particular stories. That's especially the case since not everyone has read everything.

(The primary reason that I think this is unlikely to be helpful is that most of the threads on individual works have descended into minutia very quickly, and when conversations become about why characters did something, they're several levels removed from the actual discussion that we're trying to have, especially when the conversation is really one about interpretations of the work.)
