Why these half-measures? We need to create an entire /subreddit/ for this occasion! [[/r/RFDefinitionBattleRoyale][r/RFDefinitionBattleRoyale]] or something, with threads for voting system analyses, voting system proposals, voting system voting threads, ten meta-discussion threads, twelve different problem discussion threads, and one hundred sixty-five individual work discussion threads --- for a start!

I propose we have a public range vote on the subreddit's name first, though.
