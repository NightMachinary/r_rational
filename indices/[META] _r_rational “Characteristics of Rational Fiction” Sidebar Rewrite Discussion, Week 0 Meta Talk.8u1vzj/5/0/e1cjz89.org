I think there should be a check box of themes, not stories. They can be fairly granular, like "uplift" or "uses actual math in a plot relevant fashion", but I still think it's better than posting a list of stories and asking for votes on them. Stories have lots of different elements and themes to them, people will remember various themes differently from other people, the quality of the story can influence whether people think it should be posted regardless of themes, more recent content will bias the vote for serials, etc. We would need a lot of stories to get good data from that, and then the more popular stories will have both more votes and more votes saying it should be posted, because "this story should be on the subreddit" and "I liked this story enough to spend the time to finish it" are not independent.

Or maybe we could have a different list of things to vote on. I didn't fully separate out my analysis of the problem with my proposed solution, and we shouldn't conflate agreeing with one with the other.
