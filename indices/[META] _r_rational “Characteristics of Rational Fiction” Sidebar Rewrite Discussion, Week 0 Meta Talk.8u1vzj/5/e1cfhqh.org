From a user on the [[/r/rational]] Discord:

#+begin_quote
  even if arguing over what stories are and aren't ratfics isn't helpful, making a survey would be
#+end_quote

And this seems like it might have merit to the discussion where actually debating it wouldn't. A simple Google form with ten or twenty well-known stories and various checkboxes for "should be posted to the subreddit", "should not be posted to the subreddit", and a textbox for what genre label you would give the work.

Might get us the data I think is the actual justification for even having the argument over a given story, without the minutiae failstate mentioned by [[/u/AlexanderWales]] and [[/u/Noumero]].

What do you think, does this have merit? Should we post such a thing in this thread to give it time to mature before the discussion thread, or leave it until then, or forget it at all?
