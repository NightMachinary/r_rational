Weeks 1 and 2 seem like they could easily be split as needed if there's enough support for it. Unlike this one that we can just drop and run, however, I think that splitting 1 and/or 2 needs to have a certain theme around it. Like have week 1.1 discuss narrativism vs simulationism, and 1.2 discuss everything else, or something.

I'm in the middle of throwing together a rudimentary poll just for people's views on a broad number of fics and how they fit into [[/r/rational]], but this isn't quite lined up with the polls you refer to. The intent with these threads was that solution authors would have the corpus of the recent weeklong discussions to refer to when coming up with solutions, and the ones that matched the definitions used by the most people would be those that naturally rose to the top.

However, I'll try and keep my finger on the pulse of the discussion and put together regular strawpolls for definitions as they come up, and pester [[/u/AlexanderWales]] to keep the latest ones pinned at the top of the threads. Introducing a day-or-two-long gap between 2 and 3 where the polls can be re-ran once the hot issues have been decided seems like a great addition to the process to me, to make sure that any solutions that get discussed have common ground, like you say.
