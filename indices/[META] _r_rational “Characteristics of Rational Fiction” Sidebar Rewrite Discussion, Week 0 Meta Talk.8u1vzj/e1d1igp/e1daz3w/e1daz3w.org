Good survey. It's a little odd to have multiple degrees of 'I have read this fic', but I do think there is some additional information to be found there. For reference, I chose to interpret the answers as:

- *Hell yeah:* I have read all of the main story and I've read some supplemental material/participated in online discussions around it (or would have if it was an option).

- *Yes:* I have completely read at least the main story.

- *Meh:* I bounced off of this part way through.

- *No:* I have not read this, but it is not inconceivable that I might in the future.

- *Hell Naw:* I have not read this and I have zero interest in reading it.
