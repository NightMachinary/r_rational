The players have been voting calm-and-relaxing plans recently, so the plot isn't being driven from that direction. The team has only been in Konoha a little while and the NPCs haven't really had a chance to react to them, so it's not being driven from that direction either.

One of these two things will change soon, but it will probably be another couple of updates since I didn't manage to finish this plan.
