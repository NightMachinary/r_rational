I'd almost say I recommend it specifically because you didn't find anything of interest in the original - a world full of people being thoroughly uncreative with amazing magic powers? Of course you didn't care for it.

But what if people /were/ being creative? And what if the world was on hard mode to keep them from winning instantly? And what if they decided they were going to win anyway, by bringing about uplift of the entire human race, and were fighting tooth and nail to try to accomplish it?

*That's* Marked for Death. Obviously if you hated the whole "some humans have bullshit magic chakra powers" premise in and of itself, MfD won't appeal to you. But the characters and the world and the writing and the commenting community are amazing, so if the premise doesn't immediately drive you off I'd strongly encourage you to give it a try, at least up until the point where we met Kagome.
