You're producing these at quite a pace! Continuing to enjoy them, and as a bit of extra positive reinforcement, really enjoyed the Pallet Town music that kicked in during the first episode. If you could add Route or Battle music into the start of scenes that would be pretty awesome, though maybe it would get too repetitive if a scene goes on too long in the future? Just thought I'd mention it :) Looking forward to the next one!
