China Mountain Zhang could always use more recs. Slice of life novel about... hm... okay, it's about an American. But it's a good sci fi bildungsroman in the spirit of Ray Bradbury, and the setting is unusual.

Oh man, speaking of sci fi with wild settings related to other cultures, if you want a serious doorstop check out Otherland. Very good, very long. Central African protagonists.
