The [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36325/bastion-academy-series][Bastion Academy Series]] by Jess D. Astra is set in Korea. The Mark Lawrence story sounds similar to it. It's set in a post-apocalyptic society that rebuilt itself with "magic" that is really misunderstood/forgotten technology.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6597651-the-windup-girl][The Windup Girl]] by Paolo Bacigalupi is set in Thailand. It's a biopunk/corporate dystopia set in the future where climate change has caused the sea to rise beyond habitable limits.
