Any stories with interesting settings based on unusual locations? i.e Mesoamerica, Mongolia, Africa..

​

I'd like to read a story people here would generally enjoy but in a setting that isn't done too often, or somewhat different.

​

Mark Lawrence does some interesting settings, frozen planet that has the equator livable because of an artificial mirror moon build long ago with lost tech. Very far post apocalyptic earth where the tech regressed but the planet also has traits that caused the apocalypse like nuclear wastelands, genetically modified monsters, mages exist but it's very mild and they're basically people using old tech..
