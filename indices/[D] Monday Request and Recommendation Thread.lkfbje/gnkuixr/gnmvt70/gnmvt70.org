Revenger by Alastair Reynolds is a really cool far future postapocalyptic low tech swashbuckling setting. I enjoyed it immensly.

As I understand it, humanity at some point in the past converted all the planets to countless micro planet "baubles", and has risen and fallen many times in the ruins of this mega project.

Ships cobbled together with a mix of old and new tech travel the darkness on solar sails. The main characters join a ship seeking treasure on baubles.

For me it was a great adventure but also triggered the feeling of "yawning abyss of history filled with mysteries" that I /really/ like. I got the same feeling from Malazan Book of the Fallen and Lord of the Rings (and Silmarillion).
