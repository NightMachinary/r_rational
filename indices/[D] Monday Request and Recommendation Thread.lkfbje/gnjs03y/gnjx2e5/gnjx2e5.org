Here's a collection of stories which I found satisfied my "creative creation of a danger layer-cake for adventurers and explorations thereof" cravings in no particular order:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21045/the-abyssal-dungeon][The Abyssal Dungeon]] which has lots of themed layer building it sounds like you're interested in.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33118/labyrinthias-maze][Labyrinthia's Maze]] also scratched some of that same itch, though if I recall correctly the writing was a little rough around the edges, both grammatically and plot-wise.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27263/the-infinite-labyrinth][The Infinite Labyrinth]]'s "Georgian Era Steampunk alternate history meets litRPG" premise seemed interesting, (and is from the perspective of some delvers rather than the dungeon) though I only read the first couple chapters and don't remember why I stopped, so I'm not sure how well it ultimately delivers.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26480/titan-of-steel][Titan of Steel]] is a bit of a subversion of the usual dungeon delving stuff, in that the dungeon decides to build itself a nuclear-powered mech, but I found it still scratched some of the same itch.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns][There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.]] is, as the title might suggest, rather lighthearted and /definitely/ subverts the a lot of the "deathtrap" parts of the dungeon-building genre, but otherwise has the themed layer-cake stuff going on in spades.
