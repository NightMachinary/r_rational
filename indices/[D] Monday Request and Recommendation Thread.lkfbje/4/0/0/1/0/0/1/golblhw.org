Other references I noticed:

Liar to Animals is a reference to the Kzin Speaker to Animals in Ringworld

Corbin's line, 'We can't ever live in peace - and I don't want to' was said by [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/6b/71/286b7196dbfb752e804f0f60c5d61156.jpg][Christopher Hitchens about Jihadis.]] Basically a giant hint about Corbin's view of himself as a moral crusader.

Also his setup is similar to the backstory of the God Emperor in 40k - again not sure if intentional or not

The Earth with numbered Conurbations is I think a reference to the alien occupied Earth in the Xeelee verse

The South American setting and excessive bureaucracy (hinted at by the Redeemer statue) is maybe a reference to the move Brazil - not sure about that one

Also references to precommitment abilities of superintelligent AI being used for blackmail, and possibly even Eliezer's Yudkowsky's weird movable housing idea with the reference to 'housecubes'

Overall its not really a plausible rationalist take on the actual future and I don't think it's meant to be, more like a rationalist take on a space opera alien invasion plot, a bit like Animorphs The Reckoning which you might like

Weirdly enough the overall plot reminds me of Battlefield Earth by L Ron Hubbard.. Lol l8eck1
