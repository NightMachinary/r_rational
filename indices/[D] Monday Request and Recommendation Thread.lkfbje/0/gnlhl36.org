I'm going to recommend the manga [[https://mangadex.org/title/55476/child][Child]] .It's a manga about a nonverbal girl called Nao and her upbeat sister Yui. It's a manga about mental illness and coping strategies. And it's a story about the tragedies and successes of growing up.

... and it manages to do all that in the10 short chapters that have been translated.

The translation is a bit rough since the translator is using DeepL, but they're quite obviously taking what care they can to make sure their translations are accurate and readable. Also, art aside, this isn't a 'furry' manga, per se-- it's a [[https://www.lackadaisycats.com/][Lackadaisy Cats]] situation where, despite the art, all the characters are obviously human.

edit: and while I'm recommending furry manga anyways, I'll also recommend [[https://mangadex.org/title/35838/slayer-volte][Slayer Volte]]. Moral ambiguity, interesting worldbuilding, and cute characters getting horribly traumatized. Exactly my cup of tea.
