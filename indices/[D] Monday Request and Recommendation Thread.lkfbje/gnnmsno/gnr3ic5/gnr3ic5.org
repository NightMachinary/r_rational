I got up to 40 chapters of runesmith and in conclusion it's a nice popcorn read but it's not for me. The characters just feel dead which is probably due to the authors writing style and there are some inconsistencies. The Gnome girl was getting massively power leveled in the ants lair but the author said that the system prevented this sort of thing. However, there wasn't a single written passage of her killing an ant. Also, during the assassination attempt a level 2 rogue did the cliche of stabbing a human shaped pillow while trying to kill the MC in his sleep. Wouldn't a level 2 rogue have skills that prevent this sort of idiocy? Such as night vision, blood sense, etc?
