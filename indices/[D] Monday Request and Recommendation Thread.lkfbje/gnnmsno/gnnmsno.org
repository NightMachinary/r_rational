I don't usually go for fics about immersive MMORPGs as much as straight Isekai due to the lowered stakes / reality TV type artificiality, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29139/spiteful-healer][Spiteful Healer]] has been pretty good so far, and does a decent job of anticipating the consequences of good VR simulation on society and real-world drama that balances and adds meaning to the gameplay drama. Includes things like using the same tech for surgery simulations and studying, and has real world motives (punishing his neglectful father and saving up for college) driving his in-game behavior. Overall pretty well balanced. And rather than being gifted with an OP cheat skill, he discovers a reasonably obscure skill that he can reach at a low level that needs a lot of grinding and sacrifice to achieve. The character is depicted as stubborn and grindy in real life (with the downsides that implies), so when he does this in a game it makes sense.

Another story (straight Isekai, not VRMMO) about a stubborn/grindy character that I like but don't strongly recommend is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33844/the-runesmith][The Runesmith]]. It's much more of a case where YMMV, as the main character's paranoia and single-mindedness seems to result in a refusal to form lasting teams/relationships and doing everything himself in a world where division of labor is obviously favorable. His inner monologue gets to be a bit tedious to follow at times, considering and reconsidering minor caveats repeatedly. Contains a fair number of writing mistakes and so on. I could see this being a derec for many.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run][The Perfect Run]] also features a grindy character, but has exuberance and humor, and most of the grinding is off-screen. It's more of a time loop story set in a post-apocalyptic superhero timeline and not an Isekai. It has the same author as Never Die Twice, so expect good worldbuilding and a pro-immortality stance, but does a better job at keeping dramatic tension than NDT since there are multiple ways he can die for real if he's not careful (and he's not exactly sane).
