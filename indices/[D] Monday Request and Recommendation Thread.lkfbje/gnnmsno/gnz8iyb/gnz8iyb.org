Thanks for the Spiteful Healer rec. It's a refreshing and engaging take on VRMMO. I have some problems with the worldbuilding and character actions, but the same applies to every litRPG I've come across, and this story is much better than most.

Specifically, he explicitly thinks about how crafting guilds make sense, and how making money from crafting is a balancing act between what is efficient to do yourself and what is efficient to outsource, ...and then just does the typical "solo MC" master of all trades thing of doing it all himself.

This should not work! Sure, he has a skill that gives him double the skill exp, but what this would amount to (in a realistic, optimised group setting) is halving the cost of training, which is, in business terms, essentially a fixed cost, and so is irrelevant long term.

This is also a major problem with the worldbuilding believability - people take this game extremely seriously, so why aren't there cartels who essentially corner the market on any useful good, disallowing new entrants by force? It's an unregulated world, there's no reason this wouldn't happen without a good reason it shouldn't. This happens even in today's games which don't have an explicit in-game-currency to real-world-currency exchange (as the story game does).

Other than those issues - relatively minor compared to most litRPGs - I would second the recommendation. :)
