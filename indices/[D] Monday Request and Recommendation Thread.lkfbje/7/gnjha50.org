I quite enjoyed the Quod Elim Erat series (or whatever the series is called as a group): [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat]] . Science-fiction where you follow a battleship AI that is returning to the fleet after retirement.. but as a crew member rather than as a ship again. Not the most rational, but still more rational than most. Enjoyable characters (though, it does really primarily focus on the MC), interesting factions, and cool alien species.

As for what I am looking for: I recently read [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper]] and while I enjoyed it (it is unfinished before it gets that far and on hiatus), I enjoyed the first chapter more before it diverges off into the actual plot. So any (very mild spoilers): Stories in your future world dystopia that do more with the tech (like the story has where your firmware might stop you from seeing things) than just your usual 'there is cameras everywhere'? Preferably following some form of rebel against that system.\\
