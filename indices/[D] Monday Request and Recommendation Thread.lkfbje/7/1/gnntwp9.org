Have you by any chance read /[[https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]/ or /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490708-echopraxia][Echopraxia]]/ by Peter Watts? Both tend to get recommended here frequently. His books are set in a bleak future teetering on the brink of post-human. Technology has advanced to the point that people's bodies can be modified in many ways. One of the most fascinating and chilling modifications is given to soldiers to shut off the internal perception of consciousness, i.e. to put the body on 'autopilot' to do boring tasks like exercise while a person is 'sleeping' or to operate with machine-like precision in high-stress situations.

Some of Greg Egan's novels also explore the scary implications of body modification technology. [[https://www.gregegan.net/QUARANTINE/Quarantine.html][/Quarantine/]] especially springs to mind with the way the protagonist's brain mods directly alter not just his perception of reality, but also how he /feels/ about that reality. I enjoy Egan's deep portrayal of what living in that future might be like. For example:

  It takes me forever to get to sleep. Boss (Human Dignity, $999) may have rendered it a matter of conscious choice, but somehow I still manage to be an insomniac; I always have some reason to delay the decision, I always have some problem I want to think through -- as if every last nagging question which once might have kept me awake had to be dealt with in the old way, regardless.

  Or maybe I'm just developing what they call Zeno's Lethargy. Now that so many aspects of life are subject to nothing but choice, people's brains are seizing up. Now that there's so much to be had, literally merely by wanting it, people are building new layers into their thought processes, to protect them from all this power and freedom; near-endless regressions of wanting to decide to want to decide to want to decide what the fuck it is they really do want.

  What I want, right now, is to understand the Andrews case, but there's no mod in my head which can grant me that.
