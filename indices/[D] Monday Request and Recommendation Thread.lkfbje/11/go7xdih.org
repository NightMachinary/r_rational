Just read through the transcript of [[http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/episode-252-understanding-moral-disagreements-jonathan-haidt.html][this podcast discussion]] which I found pretty interesting. It's a discussion about what are the "taste buds" of morals, how different people weigh them differently, and how this turns into political disagreement (also about rationalism, by the way). Means I'll probably keep an eye (ear? haha) on the podcast as a whole as well.
