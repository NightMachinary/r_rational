Wow, the Runesmith is really impressive! It is a short story, just 9 chapters long, about a reincarnator who didn't want to deal with the social obligations he was born into and decided to go for a Darwin award instead.

To be honest, I would even call this story *rationalist*, because it teaches you about modes of thought you should *not* use unless you want to end up just like the main character!
