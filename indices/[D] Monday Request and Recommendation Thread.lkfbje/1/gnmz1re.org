Im looking for a decent *Time-Loop Munchkin/ Groundhog Day Munchkin* story set in our world (no fantasy or sci-fi elements aside from the premise, and not a fanfic of another franchise preferably).

Or to put it more broadly: Im looking for munchkin stories set in the "real world" where the only divergence from reality is the power that makes the munchkin possible in the first place, but otherwise the story is realistic and rational-ish.

An example would be the original Groundhog Day, Limitless, Butterfly Effect or Replay, but possibly more rational and munchkinish, and less preachy.
