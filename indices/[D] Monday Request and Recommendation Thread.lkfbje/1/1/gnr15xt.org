"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August" is about people who live their lives on loop, restarting from an early age whenever they die. It's set entirely in the real world other than this, and contains a highly rational character who munchkins using his powers to try to bootstrap the technology base of the world to a higher level by essentially importing knowledge from the future using the fact that people with this power born after him have access to the future and you can chain that to get information from the far future.

...unfortunately that character is the villain and a lot of the book is a morality tale about why That's Bad. üôÅ But on the whole I still enjoyed reading it.
