Females tend to be attracted to more than simply looks.. If the complaint is him being a Marty Stue, sure. I don't disagree, dropped it ages ago.

It just annoys me when I see the generic: 'MC is 'attractive' so I don't like him because I've a subconscious bias against attractive people of my gender, but I can't really explain that so I make up rationalizations to justify it. And because it bothers me this is a legitimate flaw'

Valid complaints sure, real flaws ok, that's reasonable criticism. The MC being attractive isn't, it's just a fraction of the population that inherently dislike attractive people of their gender that gets bothered by it. If you're a part of that group that's fine there's nothing wrong with it, but that's a matter of taste not a legitimate flaw.
