I don't think the women liking him is a valid complaint. Women IRL tend to be attracted to attractive men, just like men tend to be attracted to attractive women. And guess what? An attractive person will get a lot of people attracted to them, that's what being attractive means / entails.

So the complaint doesn't really hold ground for me. If you don't like stories with attractive MCs sure, that's something to keep, but I wouldn't call it a fault.
