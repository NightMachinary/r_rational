Lol I wrote a comment on the prologue itself explaining what I liked. I really thought it was a fantastic prologue, checked all my boxes, inspired me to delete my current prologue to my fic because it reminded me what a prologue should be and that my prologue was hella not effective. But some people really didn't like the prologue because...reasons, so to each their own.
