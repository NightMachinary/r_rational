Open source, open world, zombie survival roguelike. You're a survivor, there are zombie, find some way to make your way through the apocalyptic remains of New England. Instead of character classes you have different starting conditions (gear, skills, location, etc.) and in addition to DCSS-esque skills, you also advance via gear (including an extensive crafting system) and futuristic mutagens/cybernetics from the secret labs which caused the cataclysm. Notable for being the only roguelike I know of with a functional driving and Mad Max-esque car modification system. Like Caves of Qud, it doesn't really have a victory condition, so you mostly just set challenges for yourself or see how far you can take a character.
