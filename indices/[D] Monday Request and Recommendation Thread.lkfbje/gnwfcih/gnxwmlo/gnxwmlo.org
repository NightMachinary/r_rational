I think cataclysm: dark days ahead is all skills, and it's a classic roguelike. Dwarf fortress is all skill-based, as well- there are skills for each conceivable action (axe-wielding, dodging, milling, beekeeping).

I like to play Star Sector as a roguelike (there's a mode to disallow savescumming). Characters in that game exclusively improve via perks, which ends up being a skill-like system. This guy can explain the game better than I can: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqpulP1hLo]]
