Any suggested interesting roguelike games? I played most of the big ones (in particular love Stone Soup and TOME), but what I'd like right now is one that's more focused on levelling up individual /skills/ rather than your character, a bit like seen in Skyrim, or even more, in the /Kumo desu ga/ LNs/manga/anime. Does something like that exist? I mean, Stone Soup does it a bit, but I'd like an even more extreme take on that idea.
