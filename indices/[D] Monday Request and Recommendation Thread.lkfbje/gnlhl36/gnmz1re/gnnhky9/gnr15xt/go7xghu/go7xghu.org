Not sure about it being rational, but the movie "Happy Death Day" was a really fun take on blending that concept with a slasher horror plot. The protagonist gets murdered again and again by some random psycho and uses the loop to try and find out their identity and ultimately avert her fate. I hear the sequel takes it in a sci-fi direction, explaining the time loop phenomenon, and I'm curious about that, but haven't seen it yet.
