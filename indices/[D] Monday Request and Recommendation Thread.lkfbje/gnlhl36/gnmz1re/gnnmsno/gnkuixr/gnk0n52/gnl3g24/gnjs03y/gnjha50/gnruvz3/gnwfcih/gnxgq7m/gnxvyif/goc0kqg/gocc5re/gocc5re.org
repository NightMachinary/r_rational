I know about the term roguelite, that's why I said explicitly I wanted rogue/likes/ and specified Stone Soup and TOME just to make that clear. But yes, I was indeed looking specifically NOT for a roguelite (though I enjoy a lot of those too).

And yeah, I own both of those already too. Now that you mention it, you're right that SotS: The Pit has kind of a system like the one I was thinking about. That said, I'm also genuinely considering the possibility of making this myself. I don't think there's any such thing precisely already, but the mechanism as described in the /Kumo/ LNs seems potentially like a ton of fun, a bit like a crossover of a roguelike with the raw number-crunching pleasure of a clicker/incremental game (and before you mention it, yes, I know of Kittens Game too).
