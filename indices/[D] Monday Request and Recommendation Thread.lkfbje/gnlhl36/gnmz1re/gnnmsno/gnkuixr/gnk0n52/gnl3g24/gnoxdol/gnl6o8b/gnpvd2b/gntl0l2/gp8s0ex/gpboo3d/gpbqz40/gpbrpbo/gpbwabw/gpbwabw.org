Just because I didn't use the exact words you used doesn't mean my argument is invalid..

He could look like a cthulhu for all it matters, if a larger than average percentage of the population is attracted or 'falling over him' that means he is attractive.

But then again I don't want to argue over semantics. My point is clear, it appears as far as I can interpret that you don't like him because he's attractive (or as you put it: women were falling all over him for no reason) and that's as far as you're concerned is a flaw, when in actuality it's a difference in taste.

MC being a Marty Stue is a flaw, MC being attractive isn't a flaw.
