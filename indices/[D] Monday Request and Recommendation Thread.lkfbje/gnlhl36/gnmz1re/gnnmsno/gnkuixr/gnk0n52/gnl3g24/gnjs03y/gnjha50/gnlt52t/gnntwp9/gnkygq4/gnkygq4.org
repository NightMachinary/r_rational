The closest I can think of is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36983/tower-of-somnus][/The Tower of Somnus/]]. It's a cyberpunk corporate dystopia where the MC is trying to claw her way up (socially/economically), in large part by stealing and killing rich people.

You might like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][/The Last Angel/]]. It has some of the same elements - a battleship AI, interesting factions, and cool alien species, but the AI is fighting what it call "The Long War" after humanity was nearly wiped out by aliens 2000 years ago.

It's kinda a mix of both stories - the alien society is built on purging and rewriting history that disagrees with them, to the extent that the humans who survived the cataclysm that wiped out Earth have sided with them, not knowing they're working for the same people. There's a ton of propaganda shoved down people's throats about how they need to be good workers and earn their place in society.
