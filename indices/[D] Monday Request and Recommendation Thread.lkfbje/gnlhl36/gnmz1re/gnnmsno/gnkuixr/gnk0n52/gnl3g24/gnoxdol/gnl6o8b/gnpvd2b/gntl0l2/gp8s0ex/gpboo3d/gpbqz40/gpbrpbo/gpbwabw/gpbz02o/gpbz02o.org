If you define attractiveness as "women like him" then it's just a tautology and is completely pointless. It becomes "women like him because he's attractive and he's attractive because women like him".

Based on my years as a human on this earth and observing romantic relationships (including my own and those of my friends), the character as written does not seem like one who would have an anomalously above average level of romantic success. This is because he is an asshole. He is explicitly an asshole and knows he is an asshole and has said he is an asshole. Some people like assholes. Most people do not like assholes.

I've made it very clear that my problem has absolutely nothing to do with the physical attractiveness of the MC (and have stated in several different ways what my problem is). You seem convinced that you know something about me beyond what I have stated here (and even in direct contradiction to what I've stated).

You are free to believe anything you want, but I don't understand what you think you are accomplishing by continuing this. You aren't going to convince me by ignoring my actual argument and my actual stated problems with the story, and you aren't going to convince anyone else since this thread is 2 weeks old and almost no one will read it. If you don't think that the romantic aspect of the story is badly written, then good for you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Feel free to ignore that portion of my review. But you aren't going to convince me that it's well written, and you certainly aren't going to convince me that I have some unconscious bias against attractive people.

As such this seems like a waste of both our time, and I'll be muting replies. Hope you have a nice day.
