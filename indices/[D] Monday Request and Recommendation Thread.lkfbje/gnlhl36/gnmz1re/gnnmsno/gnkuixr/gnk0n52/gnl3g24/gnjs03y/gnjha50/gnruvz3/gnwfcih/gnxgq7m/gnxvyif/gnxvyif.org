I've got it on my wishlist, everyone says it's amazing and I'll probably definitely enjoy it one day, but it's not the flavour of game I was thinking of right now. I had more in mind something old style, entirely turn based. Though as a concession to modernity, I like graphical tiles instead of simple ascii characters.
