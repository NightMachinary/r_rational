Sorry for the late reply, power is still out so I'm trying to ration my phone use.

The MC frequently goes on long rants about social issues (to the point of even being lamp shaded by the author), and in my opinion those rants are usually lacking any nuance or appreciation of complexity. They just come off, to me, as high horsed and self righteous. However, like I said, it's entirely possible that other people don't get that impression, and that's fine.

As for the women, he only ends up with two women (the noble daughter and the agency person, so far but a third was interested, the indentured servant, but he kept aloof for understandable power dynamic reasons), but it's clear that several other women find him attractive/interesting. Maybe it seemed worse from me binging it over the course of a week, but still, in the course of less than a year (I think that's how long it's been), with no real effort on the MCs part, he's had at least three women fall for him to one degree it another.
