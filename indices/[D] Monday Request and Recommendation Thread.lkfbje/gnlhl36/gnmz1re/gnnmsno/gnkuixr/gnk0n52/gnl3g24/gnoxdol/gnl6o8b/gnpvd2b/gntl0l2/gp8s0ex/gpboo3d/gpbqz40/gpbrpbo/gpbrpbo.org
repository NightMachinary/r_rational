Luckily, I never complained that MC was attractive. I complained that women were falling all over him for no reason. You argued that the reason was "he's attractive". In setting, he is of average level physical attractiveness, so this argument doesn't really hold up. You seem to be arguing against a straw man version of my argument.

If you are now arguing that the reason is that he's a marty stue and is good at everything, and that's why women like him, then sure I guess. He's clearly written so that he's supposed to be good at lots of things. But he's also explicitly written to be kind of an asshole, which everyone, including women, just seems to kind of ignore.

Basically, as written in story, it does not seem believable to me that so many women would fall all over him. His characteristics, both physical and personality, do not seem to warrant the level of interest he garners. It therefore seems like a lazy contrivance of the author. You are free to disagree if you want.

But my argument has almost nothing to do with his level of attractiveness.
