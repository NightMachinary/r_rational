CDDA is not a fun game though. At least not for me. After taking 8h to find a car and craft some crappy gear with no other objective provided it got really boring.

It's not like a roguelike, there's no goal, no objective, nothing just survive and do cool stuff. It's like a story from a discovery writer without a clue on what to do or on how to escalate things interestingly. It's just, yeah I guess now you just survive until you don't and do busywork to keep alive. I didn't like it.
