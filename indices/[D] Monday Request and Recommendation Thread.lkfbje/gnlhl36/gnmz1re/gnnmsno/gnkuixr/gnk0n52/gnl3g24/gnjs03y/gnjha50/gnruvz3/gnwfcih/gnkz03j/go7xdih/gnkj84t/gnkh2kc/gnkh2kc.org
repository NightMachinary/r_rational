I'm still enjoying the DC Fan Universe on reddit [[/r/DCFU]] as well as it's Marvel counterpart, Marvel's Non-Canon Universe [[/r/MarvelsNCU/]]. Both are basically stories written in the universe as if they are published like the comics, with their own plots and so on. You can see the "runs" currently going on in each, as well as one-shots, cancelled runs, and so on. It's very, very good.
