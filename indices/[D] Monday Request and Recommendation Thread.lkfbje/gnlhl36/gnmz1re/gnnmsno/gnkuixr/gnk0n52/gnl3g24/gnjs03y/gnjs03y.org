I've currently got a craving for stories about dungeons and adventurers. I don't care which perspective it's from, *I just want to read more stories about adventurers diving into creatively built deathtraps.*

Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/#post-44695393][I Woke Up As a Dungeon, Now What?]]*: I actually just read this last week, and it inspired this post. The main dungeon is allied to the locals, and is currently using them to practice (while perhaps inadvertently traumatizing some of them). However, the dungeon is located in a contested land between two evil empires, so the /intent/ behind the dungeon design is clear. Eventually one or both empires will invade, and the meat-grinding will begin.

Something I appreciated was that the dungeons in this setting have a lot of design space. Each floor of a given dungeon is specialized, giving discounts for using certain types of rooms/minions and maluses to using others. However, the minions of each floor can enter neighboring floors, and floor specialties bleed into the floors immediately neighboring them. For example, a shadow floor will cause unnatural darkness not only in itself, but also in the floors above and below it. It's a system with a lot of room to experiment, and the author has been using it well so far.

The designs of the main dungeon are also quite interesting, particularly what was revealed in the latest chapter. It involves using illusions to disorient invaders while stacking fear effects, in order to wage psychological warfare on high-level adventurers that would normally be unchallenged by the upper floors of a dungeon.

*[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]]*: The main dungeon that features in this is precisely the sort of thing I'm interested in. Each level of the dungeon is unique, and evolves thematically from the level above it. Different levels have different rules that must be followed, and require different strategies to be developed to safely complete them.

*[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/368012/001-woodland][Delve]]*: The dungeons in Delve are few and far between, but they also fit the bill for what I'm interested in. They're hellishly dangerous, unique, and require extreme care to be explored safely.

*[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078MPQVG6][The Divine Dungeon]]*: This had a lot of what I was looking for early on, but lost it as the series progressed. I think most of what I was interested in was in books 1 and 2? It's been a while since I read them. By the time in book thee when the town starts working with the dungeon explicitly and it literally takes off into the freaking sky, a lot of what I'm looking for right now disappeared. I was more interested when the dungeon was experimenting with level design and its risk/reward ratio.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16717/the-salamanders/chapter/195291/101][The Salamanders]]
