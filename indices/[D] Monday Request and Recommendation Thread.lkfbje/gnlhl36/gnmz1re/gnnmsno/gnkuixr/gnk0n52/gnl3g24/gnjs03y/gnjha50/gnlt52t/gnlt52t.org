You might enjoy /Earth: Final Conflict/, which has eg. genetically engineered organisms that both enhance brain function and enforce absolute loyalty (used by top agents of the Talons only though), or a device to relive memories which they recorded and used to blackmail people with, etc. Though I think the writing only becomes sharp around the middle of season 2 ("Payback").

I guess /Minority Report/ might count. Using clairvoyant human brains to predict the future for crime. Good film.

These are possibly not what you're looking for, but: Perhaps the magisterial noir [[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dark-city-1998][Dark City]], which uses injections for altering memories. There's sociopathic-overachiever film /Equilibrium/ which also uses injections, this time to regulate emotions.

I suppose its pointless to mention, but I'll do it anyways, that the obvious recommendation is /The Matrix/, and (maybe?) /Blade Runner/.
