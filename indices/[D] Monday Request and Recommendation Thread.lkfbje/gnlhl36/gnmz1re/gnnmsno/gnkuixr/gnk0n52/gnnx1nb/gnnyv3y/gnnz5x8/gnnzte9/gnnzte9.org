Cool - It'd be nice to know if the recommendation panned out! The short stories are all over the place in terms of sci-fi subgenres - there's also [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/the-facilitator-2099/][cyberpunk stuff]], actiony [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/bows-and-arrows-against-the-lightning/][out there space opera]], more philosophical stuff about [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/08/30/seeker/][weird alien cultures]] and the main story is kind of an [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/][adventure thriller about overthrowing a corrupt government]] at least for the first three quarters, except you see half the plot from the POV of the leader of the supposedly evil dystopian government that rules Earth. I think they're all eventually supposed to tie together somehow, and I'm probably totally messing up the intended reading order, lol
