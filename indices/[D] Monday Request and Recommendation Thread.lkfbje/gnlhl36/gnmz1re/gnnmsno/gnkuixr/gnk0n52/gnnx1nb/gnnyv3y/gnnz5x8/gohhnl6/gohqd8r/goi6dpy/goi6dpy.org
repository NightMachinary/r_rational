The little 5-sentence intro on the main page made me think that's roughly the shape this story would take, so I feel like I was reading Vash's character that way from the beginning. Oh well lol

Also I loved all of these rationalist stories & tropes coming together into one story. Three Worlds Collide, the AI Box experiment in a side story, calling that transmission “The Broadcast” with a capital B (and given that reference, probably naming the aliens the Dyn as well) felt Unsong-y. Were there any other stories referenced that I missed? Maybe I'll find another story I like :-)

I'm hoping The Apathy gets more chapters too.
