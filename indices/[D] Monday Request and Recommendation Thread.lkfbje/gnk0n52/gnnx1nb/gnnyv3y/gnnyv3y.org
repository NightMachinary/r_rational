It's currently a short story but set in a wider universe and the author said he's intending to [[https://dm.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/likkpl/rt_threshold/gn3n8d7/][follow-up]], so I'd just read the story and see if it suits you.

It's a hard scifi space opera with the typical 'valiant human republic fights a battle against a superior alien foe' plot at least on the surface, except that the bad guy aliens seem to actually be a transhumanist federation and the good guys seem to be suspiciously high levels of unlucky in the events that lead up to the war and suspiciously completely morally pure as they're presented. Seems like they've told him a lot of self-serving lies, at least that was my reading.

There's some backstory already in place - a first contact story with a fairly similar premise to Eliezer Yudkowsky's Three Worlds Collide but with a very different resolution, if that sort of [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/][thing's more your speed]].
