Just read the new sf story Threshold - linked by [[/u/FTL_wishes][u/FTL_wishes]], which seems to be setting up a rational protagonist type in a decidedly irrational situation, who's presented with an incredibly obvious good vs bad story that seems to not make a lot of sense upon second thought. Also, some nice transhumanist themes. Excited for the rest of that,
