Except that in the setting, attractiveness is not rare. Everyone gets more attractive as they rank up (which, by the way, doesn't really make sense given the information we have about ranking up, it seems to be a rule of author fiat just to make the MC more attractive). So his attractiveness is not "more than usual", it's just the norm. He's only attractive relative to our non-magic having world (and still less attractive than most people ranked above him).

But even if he was actually more attractive than usual (which, again, doesn't seem to be the case), it just adds to the overall Marty-Stue-ness of the story. He's witty, smart, competent, /and/ attractive. I have no problem with attractive characters. But characters without realistic flaws are uninteresting and boring.
