He who fights with monsters has been recommended here a bunch of times, for a long time. I finally got around to reading it and binged it over the past week or so. I figured I would share my thoughts.

Firstly, I just want to get out of the way and say that generally I enjoyed it and will continue to read it, and would recommend it for most people on this sub. That being said it has some flaws that may get on some people's nerves. I'll go over those, and then finish with the things that I liked about it.

Most glaringly, the main character is a pretty hardcore Marty Stue. he is some combination of phenomenally skilled or phenomenally lucky with the abilities that he has, to the point that he is consistently one of the most competent and powerful people around (for his power level) even without any special or unique skills, beyond the game overlay (which isn't all that helpful from a combat perspective) and his ability to loot monsters, which is rare, but not unique and pretty much just means he is richer than usual. We aren't really given any reason to expect that he should be more powerful than everybody else, he just sort of....is.

Additionally, all of his "flaws" are of the kind that "he's so dark and broody".

For some reason, attractive women are constantly falling all over him. Despite the fact that his philosophy on life is " I'm who I am, and there's no need to try and improve myself or change my personality at all. If I'm a dick, then I'm a dick and some people will like it and some people won''t (and he definitely is kind of a dick)".

Which sort of leads to another issue, that may be specific to me. The author can get pretty preachy about his personal views through the main character, and, at least to me, a lot of those views are almost childishly naive, yet expressed with the utmost confidence in the fact that they are obviously right and anyone who disagrees with them is clearly just a bad person. There are some /very/ weak attempts to show non evil people disagreeing/pushing back, but they are not done at all convincingly. The author seems to just not be able to imagine a smart, good person holding views different from his own. Someone who is more philosophically in line with the author probably won't have the same problem.

The final flaw that I want to go into is that, at least to me, the voice of almost all the main characters are very similar to each other. in the vast majority of cases, if you took away the "said character x" portion is the dialogue, I would have trouble guessing which character it was. With the only exception perhaps being the main character himself, and then it's only that the main character is amped up to 11, and every other character is just a slightly toned down version of that. mostly this boils down to everyone is super snarky and sarcastic all the time.

Okay, on to the things I liked.

it's honestly very well written. The quality of the prose, relative to a lot of online fictions, is really good. The grammar is good, typos and spelling mistakes are rare, sentence structure flows well and is easy to read. it's done well enough that the reading is able to just kind of fall into the background. It really is better quality writing than most things I see promoted here.

Additionally, so far I'm really liking the world building. it's interesting, and I'm always excited to find out some new aspect of the world that the story exists in.

I also read a critique in the past about the randomness of the magic system. The complaint was that the randomness of the powers led to lack of synergistic builds, and that people would just use a single ability because the rest of them weren't very good. I'm honestly confused as to how someone could come to that assessment of the magic system. Yes, powers are assigned sort of randomly, but almost everyone's manages to be a cohesive whole (earlier powers influence later unlocked powers so that they aren't totally random). And a big theme of the combat, especially recently, is the importance of every essence user (the name of the magic users in the world) to synergistically use their entire build, and not just focus on individual abilities.

I tend to gloss over the combat a little bit usually, since it's slightly more detailed than I like, but for those that like it the detail is there.

overall, I do think it's something that most people here would enjoy. So if you haven't read it, it's worth checking out. The first 130 chapters or so are going to be taken down from Royal road and put into an Amazon book pretty soon. So if you want to read for free, it's probably worth checking it out quickly. If, from my description, you're unsure of whether or not you'll like it, I think that you should be able to figure it out within the first 10 to 20 chapters probably. If you don't like it by then, I think it's unlikely that you will like the rest.

Apologies for any typos or formatting errors, power has been out since Friday due to an ice storm, and I wrote this whole thing with voice to text on my phone.
