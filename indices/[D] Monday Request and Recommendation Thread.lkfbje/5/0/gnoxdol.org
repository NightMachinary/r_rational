I was just so turned off of how silly the first villians were that I dropped it. Cannibals arguing of a misogynistic society during a fight which got them distracted and killed. I tried to rationalize that all the prions they ate from human brains made them dumbfucks but it was too much for me. Do the villians get better? Or all they are silly like the story dungeon crawler Carl?
