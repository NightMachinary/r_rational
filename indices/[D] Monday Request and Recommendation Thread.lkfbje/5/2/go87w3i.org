I'd been getting increasingly bored with it, then dropped it after the chapter where the slave girl repeatedly beats up the protag (because she's jealous about him talking to a hot princess) and it's played for laughs. That was annoying- it seemed like an anime trope imported into a non-anime-tone/more versimilstic story for no laughs in a way that I found grating.

Then, the chapter after that, the author put in a note giving a really weird explanation for why he put the scene in. Something about how it was acceptable for the Sophie(?) to act that way because she was in a weaker position than the MC, and the MC let her beat him up to establish that he wasn't going to exert his legal power over her, and that's why he had the scene.

I thought, okay, I can see how the MC might think that, and it's obvious the author thinks this way. But /most people wouldn't think that way/, and the discordant thing about the scene was the lack of reaction from any of the other characters.

So then in the next chapter, the author has an hamfisted, awkward scene where the other characters call Sophie(?) out, clearly meant as an olive branch to the segment of the readership that were annoyed by the last chapter.

It's weird to complain about the author turning around and trying to fix what people complained about, but the whole thing just seemed jarring. When I'm reading a story, I don't want to be reminded of the readership, or get the impression what's happening on the page is being influenced by which part of the fanbase is being the most vocal (unless that's explicitly part of the format, like in a quest). Obviously, the readers do influence the author both implicitly (you see more stories of the sort that people want to read) and with their comments, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. The beat-up chapter had been annoying, but the author caving and adding a badly-written mea culpa was also annoying, not for any external social reason, but just because it was poorly written.

Anyway, I guess that little kerfuffle was the last straw. I'd already gotten annoyed at the main character's implausible super-popularity, so I dropped the story, but the event still sticks in my mind as an interesting example of author-reader dynamics in patreon-funded serial fiction, and an example of what not to do.

I'm, not sure what the right move would have been, as obviously you can't please everyone and diluting your story to appeal to RoyalRoad commenters seems like a good way to sap the life out of it. Maybe come back and rewrite the scene in a more versimilistic way later, once the fire had died down and I wouldn't seem I was bending to detractors.
