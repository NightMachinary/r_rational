The term "roguelite" may be helpful for your vocabulary, to include as a disclaimer of games you don't want. Roguelikes are, unsurprisingly, games like Rogue. Roguelite is a term created by TotalBiscuit to encompass games like The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon, games that take inspiration from Rogue/roguelikes, but don't strictly adhere to actually being like Rogue.

For roguelike recommendations however, in addition to many of the ones already recommended I remember playing a fair amount of of both Dungeons of Dredmor and Sword of the Stars: The Pit.
