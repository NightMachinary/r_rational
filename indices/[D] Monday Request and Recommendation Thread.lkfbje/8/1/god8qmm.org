Do you have any ideas what could happen?

My current Kirielle idea has the following setup:

QI pressures ZZ into helping him fight Oganj. Oganj has a teleport spell prepared and flees. QI now turns on ZZ. His evil villain dialogue explains that he underestimated them before but always ambushes anybody who can fight him on even ground (that's how he survived so long). He has Ibasan reinforcement and almost takes ZZ out. When Zach wants to teleport away, it fails and QI continues to explain that he put soul markers on ZZ during the fight to stop teleportation (inspired by the Sovereign Gate marker, similarily hard to remove). But Zorian has just retrieved the Ikosian staff, that kind of teleportation isn't blocked and they escape... to Blantyrre.

QI didn't expect that and looks for and alternative to neutralize ZZ. So that's how "Kirielle Kazinski and the Necromancer" begins, she's his hostage. As Kirielle isn't really a threat to QI, he again treats her reasonably, like he treated ZZ before.

Wouldn't mind somebody writing this ;)
