I know this is late, but I wanted to add something to the "uncompressed SETI signals" discussion you were having.

A number of issues were raised, including:

1) Interstellar transmissions would probably be compressed.

1.1) A compressed signal would be difficult to decode.

1.2) A successfully decoded compressed transmission would be unmistakably sentient in origin.

2) Even in analog form, speech is distinct from noise.

Combining these, I think we can invent a reasonable explanation. Suppose the signals are compressed - which I believe will make them similar to noise, since distinct patterns are an obvious opportunity for further compression - in an hitherto unknown format. Then, we can imagine Bulma's new knowledge of alien languages allowed the computer to perform a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack][known-plaintext attack]] on the recorded transmissions, cracking the compression for the first time and exposing the original sound.

This isn't entirely unproblematic, since the three syllables she remembered probably would not be enough for such analysis, but at least it works in principle. We can mitigate these problems as well. For example, suppose memories from the afterlife are much better than ones from regular life, since they were recorded without imperfect ear and brain architectures as a medium. There's also the fact that compression is meant to be decoded, (and interstellar encodings might even be made with simplicity-to-crack in mind, much like our SETI) and if we want to go there, we can say Bulma used technological memory retrieval to make sure the computer got as a precise recording as possible.

Not all of this can fit into the narrative as presented without some retconning, but I thought it was worth pointing out.
