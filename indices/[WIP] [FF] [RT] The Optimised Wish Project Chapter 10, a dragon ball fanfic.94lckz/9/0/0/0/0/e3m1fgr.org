OK, forget the pendulum room.

They were mentioning the interference of divinity in the chapter, so I figured the thought of 'ask god about what's going on' would occur to them, as this god gives people stuff and is probably relatively approachable. Also, think of all the fun SCIENCE! potential around Senzu Beans.

Similarly, I'm wondering what Bulma will find in Goku's gene code. Saiyans can (in canon) interbreed with humans, and possibly whatever species Gure is, but who knows? Especially since species exist in multiple universes, such as Namekians and Saiyans, with their signature abilities (Namekian Fusion and Super Saiyan).
