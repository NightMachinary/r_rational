  Not to mention that figuring out a completely novel compression algorithm without knowing anything about the end product would be really hard.

Originally, before militaries really started to do anything resembling encryption (i.e. using ciphers to keep a text secret), they used "codes"---which were essentially one-off forms of compression (with e.g. whole words being associated with particular numbers relayed via a numbers station.)

"Code-breaking", then, in the original sense, refers to reverse-engineering unknown methods of compression.

Over the years, humanity has become pretty good at it! Compared to cryptanalysis on ciphers, cryptanalysis on codes is considered /easy/.
