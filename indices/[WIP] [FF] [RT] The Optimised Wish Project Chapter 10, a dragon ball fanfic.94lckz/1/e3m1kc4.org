So apparently aliens never discovered encryption or compression, or for some reason are broadcasting unencrypted uncompressed audio data for their primary form of communication.

Frieza must have also been doing all this stuff for decades, and pretty close by, because habitable planets would be at least a few light years away.

I also enjoy that Bulma basically proves that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists in the universe, that there are multiple distinct intelligent species, and hasn't yet thought to tell her father or anyone beside Goku yet. Even aside from all normal implications of this, contacting those alien civilizations would allow them to get information on what DOESNT work against Frieza. Like, does he kill planets because they are too aggressive, and spares peaceful locations? Does he demand tribute? What are his abilities? This is all pretty relevant.
