  If Bulma or anyone on Earth noticed that these signals could be decompressed into an audio file, it wouldn't be a question as to whether alien life exists.

That's a problem even with the uncompressed audio, speech is very distinct from random noise. I'm guessing they pretty much /have/ figured out that these are interstellar communications, they just can't be absolutely sure without some independent source to verify against.

Knowing Frieza is a name is still a big deal though, because it tells them that some form of communication is happening between the different alien civilizations.
