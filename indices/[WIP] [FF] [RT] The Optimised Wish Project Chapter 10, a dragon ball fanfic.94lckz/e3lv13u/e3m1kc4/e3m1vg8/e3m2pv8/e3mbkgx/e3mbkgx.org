  That's true. I think later Dragonball shows had Bulma using ships that travel between planets, and your story hasn't mentioned people knowing about FTL travel yet. So they could just have an incredibly high speed of light

We can actually have hard proof of that. The first test trip Popo and Bulma do with Kami's spaceship is to Jupiter, and it only lasts a few seconds. Even at their closest, Earth and Jupiter are approximately 30 light minutes away! So that was already FTL for our standards. Yet they need one month to reach Namek, while Goku's ship, built on the model of the Saiyan pods, only takes 10 days, and is thus 3 times faster. And of course, Goku himself is able to Instant Transmit... well, instantly, to Namek as needed. And the dragon does that too. Which is all FTL signalling, and we /know/ this is a universe in which time travel is heavily frowned upon, and FTL signalling basically /is/ time travel. So I deduce that either Akira Toriyama didn't know/care about the finesses of special relativity, or Dragon World has either a higher lightspeed limit, or no limit at all.

And we wouldn't want to insinuate Toriyama-sensei doesn't know his theoretical physics, right?
