I don't think that necessarily follows, not if you intend the Aether the way Michaelson & Morley did (if you don't, then you could argue even our electromagnetic quantum field is an 'aether' of sorts). If the Aether was a fluid, it would carry waves with finite speed. The only thing that really disagreed with experiment there was the fact that light waves did not behave like they were carried by a medium with a definite state of motion. I'd see it more as tweaking our existing equations by increasing /c/ a lot. If /c/ tends to infinity, you get yourself classical mechanics at all speed scales.

But I'm not going to try and work out a fully consistent system of law of physics for Dragonball Z. It's probably completely impossible and would require an insane amount of work for a confusing, dissatisfying result. If I ever do something like that, I'm going to do like Greg Egan did and create my own fictional world with its own laws of physics (and optionally blackjack and hookers).
