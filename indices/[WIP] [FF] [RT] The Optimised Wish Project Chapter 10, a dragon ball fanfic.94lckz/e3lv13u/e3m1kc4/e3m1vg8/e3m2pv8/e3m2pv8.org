  About light speed: as I've said elsewhere, I think the Dragon World isn't relativistic, and probably hasn't the same value of light speed as we do. So distances involved may be different from what we're used to. As for intelligent life... I mean, they already had the data, and an inkling of what it meant, they just lacked some kind of decryption key to be 100% sure.

That's true. I think later Dragonball shows had Bulma using ships that travel between planets, and your story hasn't mentioned people knowing about FTL travel yet. So they could just have an incredibly high speed of light

  and you're right about encryption... maybe some transmissions ARE encrypted, just not all because not all of these are super-secure. No, ok, I'm just covering my own ass here, I might not have thought this /completely/ through. Corner of shame

I think lack of compression is the more noticeable issue. It makes some sense that if you're using enough energy to transmit across stelar distances, you aren't trying to be secrative. Secure communications could be done through lasers, or some other narrow beam signals that would be extremely unlikely to be pointed at Earth. But compression is really simple, and saves a lot of transmission time. If Bulma or anyone on Earth noticed that these signals could be decompressed into an audio file, it wouldn't be a question as to whether alien life exists. Not to mention that figuring out a completely novel compression algorithm without knowing anything about the end product would be really hard.

  Contacting alien civilizations when someone able to destroy planets is out there and they don't know your position yet sounds like a /super/ bad idea. Sure, more intel can't be bad, but if the price of intel is revealing your position to the entire galaxy, you probably want to play it careful there. And it's not like they can understand these people's language anyway.

Yeah that's fair. I suppose if the language is figured out, they could broadcast to whatever part of the sky that the least number of mentions of Frieze come from, but that could still be too big of a risk.
