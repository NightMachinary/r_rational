About light speed: as I've said elsewhere, I think the Dragon World isn't relativistic, and probably hasn't the same value of light speed as we do. So distances involved may be different from what we're used to. As for intelligent life... I mean, they already had the data, and an inkling of what it meant, they just lacked some kind of decryption key to be 100% sure.

(and you're right about encryption... maybe some transmissions ARE encrypted, just not all because not all of these are super-secure. No, ok, I'm just covering my own ass here, I might not have thought this /completely/ through. Corner of shame)

Contacting alien civilizations when someone able to destroy planets is out there and they don't know your position yet sounds like a /super/ bad idea. Sure, more intel can't be bad, but if the price of intel is revealing your position to the entire galaxy, you probably want to play it careful there. And it's not like they can understand these people's language anyway.
