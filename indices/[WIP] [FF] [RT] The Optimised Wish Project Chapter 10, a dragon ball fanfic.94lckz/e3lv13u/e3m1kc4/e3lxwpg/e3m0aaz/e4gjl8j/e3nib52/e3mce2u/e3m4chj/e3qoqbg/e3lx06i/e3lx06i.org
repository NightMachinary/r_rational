So, um...

How canon is Jaco the Galactic Patrolman? Because apparently, five-year-old Bulma had encountered Jaco, who was a self-admitted alien. He left right as the story began, in fact. Tights can still probably contact him, and they could ask him about Frieza? Though he'd probably freak out about Goku, given that the first time he came to earth it was to kill Kakarot.
