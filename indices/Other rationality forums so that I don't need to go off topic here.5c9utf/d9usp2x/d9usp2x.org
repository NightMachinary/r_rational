Thank you. I didn't realize that the SSC subreddit differed from the actual SSC in that way. I'll check it out. Sorry for snapping at you earlier AlexanderWales. I know you weren't trying to limit my ability to speak freely with other rationalists. I just got really frustrated and upset and I didn't previously know what you guys just said about the SSC subreddit. I've been feeling really isolated this year because I haven't had time or transportation access to go to any local rationality or hcco meetings this year due to my work and school schedule and the fact that I don't drive and live too far away from them.

Thank you.
