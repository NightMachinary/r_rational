The problem isn't so much that Less Wrong died, it's that it fractured into a bunch of little pieces that are spread out around the internet. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/ramap.html][See this map from SSC,]] though it's two years old at this point.

You basically have a bunch of bloggers from Less Wrong that now have their own sites, or tumblrs, or whatever. The only way to resurrect Less Wrong or its equivalent would be to get all the most active community members back together on one site, and I don't think anything like that has ever been done with any community.

I do think your best bet is probably [[/r/slatestarcodex]], though the audience isn't quite identical. Otherwise, get on tumblr and figure out how that thing works (I know nothing about tumblr except its design decisions are unfriendly and there are lots of rationalists there).

There is a fraction of users on this subreddit who want it to become the new place on the internet to discuss all things rational, but there's a different fraction who want this place to just be for fiction, either because they prefer segregating their rational activities, or because they have no real interest in rationality by itself. We mods err on the side of purity of focus. The compromise is that we have a General Rationality thread on Mondays and an Off-Topic thread on Fridays, mostly so that people can talk about these things within this community while still quarantining those topics away from those with no interest in them.

I do wish that [[/r/lesswrong]] were a bright and vibrant community, but it's not, and I think trying to turn this community into what that community should be won't work and will be to our detriment.
