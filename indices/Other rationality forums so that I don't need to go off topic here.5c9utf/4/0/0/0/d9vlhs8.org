As I understood it, the community always had a lot of almost-crazy people in it from /both/ ends of the political spectrum that the big posters kinda kept in check. Remember all the people getting angry at EY even before HPMOR was finished because they didn't think his female characters were feminist enough? That was some dumb shit.

When EY and others stopped sitting around on the site all the time and started trying to actually accomplish some of the things everyone had been talking about, the almost-crazies from different sides of the aisles couldn't tolerate each other and people quickly started leaving. I've seen it in other "fringe" culture communities. People get hypersensitive. Emotions run high and aren't controlled by normal maturity. The thing breaks up because weird people get along with other weird people even worse than normal people get along with each other.
