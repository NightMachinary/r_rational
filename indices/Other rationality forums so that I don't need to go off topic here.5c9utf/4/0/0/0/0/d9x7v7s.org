I really don't think people saying that a fictional work may contain sexist tropes is an example of crazy, but this isn't about the opinions themselves.

The far left was relatively quiet about it / usually didn't even post to lesswrong / did not engage in systematic vote manipulation. The far right /literally/ singled out liberal users and tried to make them leave the community by downvoting every single post they made. No one went around vote stalking people who liked hpmor.

I wouldn't even have that much of a problem with the alt right presence if it wasn't for the vote manipulation. I even thought it was kind of fun having a different opinion around before things started getting really ugly.
