Only if you actually have grass seeds. And sunlight and nutrients in the soil. I don't think I'm the first person who has thought of reviving Less Wrong. I'm sure other people have tried and failed to do so. Perhaps if I better understood why Less Wrong died and why it hasn't been successfully revived I might be able to come up with a way to revive it? I don't think that's very likely though.
