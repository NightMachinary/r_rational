The de facto location today is the weekly [[http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/open/][open-threads at SlateStarCodex]]. There are 2 or 3 a week, they can be reached by the link at the top of [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][www.slatestarcodex.com]], many great people post there (as well as many not so great) - the threads are extremely active, hitting +1000 comments in mere days (which is the reason for now having so many new ones each week).
