I get the impression that there are a greater number of commenters that do not share some assumptions (materialism, naturalism, consequentialism, etc) that were taken as a given in LessWrong, which seems to lead to a constant recycling of old arguments. In addition, it seems like a more politically charged environment that's not as concerned with the boring parts of aspiring rationality. I don't know if this impression is correct, and I make no judgements about it other than 'variety can be good'.

I think you get something closer to LW in the IRC. Tumblr is definitely pretty far away from LW, as far as culture goes. In the end, I think different communities are going to suit different people. I guess that's why it's a diaspora. It'd be nice if there was a grand list, but those seem difficult to keep up with. As far as new content goes, I think few things beat CFAR.
