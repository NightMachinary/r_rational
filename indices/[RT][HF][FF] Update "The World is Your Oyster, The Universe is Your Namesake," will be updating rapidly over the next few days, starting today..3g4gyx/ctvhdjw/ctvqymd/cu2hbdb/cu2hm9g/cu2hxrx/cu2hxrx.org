It's something I've been pondering for a while now; your replicator wand just gave me a new perspective on it.

I didn't think for a moment this was anywhere near canon, either yours or the SU writing team's. If Gems are meant to have magical, indivisible "souls" then fusion doesn't make much sense. And fragments - pieces of a Gem which are still alive - definitely break that interpretation.

I'm looking forward to an explanation on the Gems-speaking-English thing!
