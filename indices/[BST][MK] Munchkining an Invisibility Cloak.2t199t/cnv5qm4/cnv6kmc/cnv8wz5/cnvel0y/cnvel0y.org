I'm pretty sure it would be pretty dark inside the cloak. The technological cloaks bend the light around the object, so there's no light to the panel.

Also, pretty sure solar panels are pretty inefficient, so it would still not give infinite energy. Wasn't the current maximum something like 30%? But they work by absorbing the light, so there is no way to cheat them by not letting them actually absorb the light.
