Yeah, I love Plato but I wish he was still around so I could yell at him. He argued that what you should do if you had a ring like that was to not use it, but I wonder what he'd say if someone came up to him and said "So, found the ring. Killed off the rightful heir who's been killing people 'for teh lulz', seized power, and now I want your help in setting up a school where we actually educate people instead of teaching them sophistry."
