Can you see out? For the sake of this argument I will assume yes.

This implies that the light coming in is duplicated and sent out. Put a solar cell inside the cloak (or a water boiler depending on the energy levels used), surround the cloak with a large mirror array and a laser.

Laser goes into the cloak and gives of energy, this you convert to electricity, however this is an invisibility cloak so there must be no indication that the cloak is there, so the laser also continues undiminished on the other side of the cloak. It hits the mirror array, passes through the cloak gives of energy, hits the mirror array again undiminished, passes through the cloak ...

BOOM, you have a self powering energy source assuming you can fit something capable of converting the laser to heat inside the cloak.

TL:DR, a self sustaining energy generator. Completely waste free.
