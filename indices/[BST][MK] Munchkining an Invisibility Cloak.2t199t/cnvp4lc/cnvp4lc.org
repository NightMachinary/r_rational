Ugh. Honestly, I'd probably give it to the scientists right away. There's just no way to justify not acquiring the tech as fast as possible, before anything goes wrong for any reason.

But yeah - as others have said, you can get fairly large amounts of money betting on events that you ordinarily couldn't influence.

You can fake supernatural events and you need not necessarily tie those events to your personal self unless you want to. Anything going on that you don't like? God / ghost of Mother Theresa/ etc doesn't like it either now, and can publicly say so. Have fun massively influencing public opinion on anything.

Better yet, just restrict yourself to individuals to reduce chances of being caught. You can also convince all but the staunchest atheists that they are getting supernatural messages to do things, and this includes most important figures. This allows you to accomplish a great deal without getting your hands dirty.

If you have a partner in crime and no life otherwise, you can keep the cloak on indefinitely and be very bold and straightforward about pretending to be a supernatural phenomenon for a fairly long time. I don't think they'd actually try and rip off your "skin" or anything, and it's not weird of x rays show you are humanoid.

You can non-violently influence any public election via shenanigans, or otherwise hilariously thwart anyone's efforts to do anything and make them lose all influence through embarrassment or make them lose all their money without actually harming them.
