Use it for violence. I'm pretty sure one of the Greek philosophers posited that if you had a ring of invisibility (okay, checked it, it's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges][Plato]] and the Ring of Gyges), you would become totally immoral. That said, if I had an invisibility cloak I would presumably also be rich, either because I was able to finance an invisibility cloak or because I have technology that can be used to create an invisibility cloak.

So aside from money, I would use it to get away with things, and if I could get away with things then right now I would be assassinating people. I'm not sure who (haven't researched who needs to die because I don't have the One Ring) but I'm sure they exist.

Use it to enact the world's greatest coup and install all of my trusted friends as powerful politicians. Obtain blackmail material. Cripple certain corporations. Change the world.

And look at naked people. I would be lying if I said that wasn't on the agenda. What about you, [[/u/DataPacRat]]?
