And three players run through you and you can't evade. You fall down and the cloak flew off. Someone screams when they think this player's hand dropped off somewhere but they calm down when they notice there is no blood. You try to grab the cloak, but the guards are there already and you see the audience is starting to come closer...

You wake up on quantanamo bay.
