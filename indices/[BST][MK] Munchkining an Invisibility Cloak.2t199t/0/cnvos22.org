Everyone else has some rather practical ideas, buts lets Weaponize it.

Hack the damn firmware and change it so I can directly affect the output of the quantum dots.

You never gave an maximum amount of light it could output, but suppose for a moment that it can at least hide you if you're between the observer and the sun.

The [[http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/climate/sun_radiation_at_earth.html][solar output at the equator]] is 1368 Watts per square meter. The earth's average albedo is about .31, so we have an output of 834 watts per square meter. Supposing a two square meter cloak, we've got 1668 Joules per second coming off of this thing.

Turn the cloak inside out. Bind a human inside it. Turn it to maximum.

A human being weighing in at 70 kg will increase by about...

.005 degrees centigrade a second, which rather dampens my "Cook them alive as torture" idea. In hindsight, this thing is putting out about what you'd get if you sunbathed in equatorial Brazil, and there's a lack of people melting to death ala Ark of the Covenant.

But you never did give a maximum, and regular old spotlights can put out a lot of heat and light...

Up the maximum output by about 2 orders of magnitude and you've got quick cooker. Assuming the heat sink can keep the cloak itself from overheating, in two minutes your prisoner is long dead and beginning to boil. Useful for the next guy's decision on whether to tell where the rebel base is.

Up it a two more orders of magnitude, and you have a viable weapon. Forget not being seen, you're too bright to even /look/ at. Run up and tackle someone, they'll get burns just from a fraction of a second of contact.

Wrap it around your fist and time it to active when you hit something. Become the superhero THE MIGHTY SOLAR FIST. (Would be pretty cool, actually- Invisibility, Brightness, Energy attacks, all centered around the same BS weapon)

The heat sink itself is pretty valuable, too (Assuming similar power levels I did above)

Given that the cloak is able to /absorb/ a lot of light, and some fraction of that as IR, if the heat sink is controllable, you could flash freeze something wrapped in the cloak by rapid cooling. Emergency cryonics?

Wrap the cloak inside-out around a supercomputer and overclock like hell, or use as an improved cooling system for a reactor-

Hell, just turn it to maximum, toss it in a well-insulated reactor as a heat source and generate electricity. (I am, at this point, assuming xenotech energy sources giving us all this power- and that method seems safer than trying to directly temper with the power source.)
