It sounds like if the technology is good enough to make you invisible, then it should be able to make the cloak look like anything. But the question/post was how would you use an invisibility cloak, not a camouflaging cloak. So I would learn how to imitate famous celebrities' voices and say embarrassing or out-of-character things while standing invisibly next to them.
