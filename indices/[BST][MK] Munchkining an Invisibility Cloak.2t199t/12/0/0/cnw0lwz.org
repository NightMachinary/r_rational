I had that "kill ceos" plan lying around from that thread about getting rid of a name, and it still seems one of the most efficient way of multiplying money. Where else can you even hope to make in the billions quickly besides trading? I suppose we could use invisibility to destroy product plans and cause destruction that way, but getting rid of the CEO does seem the most efficient way to kill a stock temporarily.

It would be even more dark had I included the "how to take over the world with $500 billion" part. I chose that number because no current billionaires rule the world, and surely some with over a few billion have tried, so the amount needed must be greater. Wonder how much the Vatican has.
