First step is to obtain enough money for a reasonable attempt at world takeover. Let's try for $500 billion. We first gain a smaller amount ($500 million, or so) by going into big bitcoin hodlers computers and getting private keys. I'm assuming we'd get only a fifth of the market cap before it crashes. Definitely hundreds of millions. (It ddn't crash /too/ much with the recent $5 million hack.) Use that to get into trading houses, and set up some of the high speed trading programs to make a "mistake" on some trades, which you are on the other end of. (Chase lost $6 billion the other year due to something similar, and everybody believes it.) Let's say we get $20 billion out of this before hst is shut down due to "risks". All in different accounts under many names, of course.

We also steal lots of gold from wherever it is held, making a few billions in the process.

As I've said before on this sub, we can profit a lot if we know when important people will die. Heavily short big companies, then kill the CEOs. Shorts should double your money, options could multiply by hundreds. I estimate 6 months before we hit our monetary goal.

Then proceed to world takeover. My detailed plan on this is not to be posted online until takeover is complete, so you'll have to wait a few years.
