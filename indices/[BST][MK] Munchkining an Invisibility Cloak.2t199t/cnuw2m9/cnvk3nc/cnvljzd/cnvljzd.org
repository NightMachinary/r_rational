No, I bet that less than 1 percent of people own bitcoin, of that most people probably don't have more than a few hundred dollars. Now how are you going around getting these bitcoins, if you go high profile then you'll attract interest from the wrong sorts of people, then your cloak gets taken as evidence and ends up out of your control. Sure you can stay small but do you have any idea how big a billion is, your saying a couple billion so I'm assuming you want a lot, I'm not sure you could steal enough small time accounts in a year to get your big B.
