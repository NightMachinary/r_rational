Market cap of bitcoin is in the billions, and much is concentrated among the top few (1000) hodlers. I'm talking about sneaking into the computer room and copying the keys. Once you have the keys you can spend it from anywhere anonymously over tor.

5 million was stolen just a few weeks ago from bitstamp, without any of this. You do a few larger ones, you get half a billion (and kill bitcoin, but you got your money quickly.) That's the target I aimed for in my other post. That should take much less time than producing in bulk, and is enough to fund the other ways I outlined for making money.
