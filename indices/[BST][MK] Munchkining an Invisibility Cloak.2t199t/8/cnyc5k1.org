First off, Technology like this could be subverted to record information.

The device that can capture not just the amount and frequency of light hitting any point of it, but also the incidence, from as many points of view as the object is large. The information to digitize an environment from a particular cloud of viewpoints is there to process. The information to see around obstacles via scattered ambient light is also there. Given that the surface is also an ideal light source, the ability to chemically analyze anything within line of sight is there, as is the ability to light up a room for analysis without giving away exact location to a known observer.

Note that the display elements are capable of sending different light in all directions at once, from all angles, on all surfaces. The detectors compliment the ability. A pair of things like this could transmit a lot of information, full duplex, multi-frequency, without aiming, in a free space optical system, with as many data streams as can fit in in line of sight, and as broadband as the resolution of the device permits.

Additionally, the device is a virtual lens with capability of emulating any virtual light source in the visible range. The device could be used as a sort of telescope that is pre focused on all points and at all distances within line of sight, with capability to go further via analysis of scattered light. Stepping outside at night would generate enough information to keep a lot of astronomers very happy for a long time, and getting a few good vantage points during the day could be as good as mapping out to the horizon and providing a complete environmental and partial toxicological census using ambient light. The virtual lens capability also makes the previous ultimate Free space optic application that much more useful, as any device, no matter how small, is just as good as a telescope of a particular lens size pointing at any node you can spot, with automatic tracking, and as much illuminating ability as the surface can provide.

The ability to emit light at all angles to any specificity can be used to direct energy onto a single point, or multiple points. Anything in line of sight can face the full wrath of whatever the maximum light output is for a point multiplied by cross-section of the device. The abilities of this sort of not-quite-laser fall into the same industrial and weapon use cases of an actual laser, albeit one that can point in all directions at once and be multiple frequencies at the same time. Manufacturing via laser sintering, photon driven chemistry, and propulsion via chasing an object with superheated atmospheric plasma come to mind. If SHTF, you could set up in a high tower and try dazzling everyone in a ten mile radius, popping their tires, downing their aircraft, destroying their ranged sensors, branding them with the mark of your order, burning their hair, etching your demands on every tree bordering your domain, and just cooking anything that doesn't get the idea to back off. It would only take kilowatts to pull off, unless you wanted to do everything at the same time, but then I suggest some good heatsinking and a mind for just how hot you can get the air surrounding the device.

On the less extreme but definitely creepy side, If you could manufacture these things and sneak a visor or contacts or a wall made of the stuff in front of someone, it'd have the same applications as really good AR gear. Like, potentially, people could go around not seeing real things, seeing fake things, and seeing things that are in a different place entirely. Combine with an audio solution (plasmic heating of air might work in a pinch) and you've got mind control that works as long as you maintain enough control over the physical environment that they don't reach out and touch a discrepancy.

On the subject of AR. A dim room with a small amount of the stuff at a good viewpoint or two could project on any surfaces, while simultaneously capturing a lot of information about a user. Pocket holodeck.

To save energy and provide a more immersive scenario for users in a portable, non-worn, holodeck scenario the material could track users eyes with a bundle of tight little cones of light for retinal projection. A small amount of the stuff worn, if the observers were known, could mask a person in a crowd at very low power, though they might still appear as a distortion in peripheral vision if the person to be hidden only has a few small patches of the stuff.

Things would be more interesting if a crowd of people were hiding from known veiwers using worn or thrown devices, since the scene could be reconstructed for the viewers from a wide range of vantage points, and free space optical communication could transmit the information to other nodes. Potentially, given enough nodes nearby, malicious individuals could be tricked to fall down stairs, crash military vehicles, mistarget air strikes, shoot dirt, or chase targets over open wells.

An invisibility cloak is basically like saying "I don't just have complete optical power regarding any light that touches this thing, I also have formidable optical power over anything that can be touched by light that touches this thing."
