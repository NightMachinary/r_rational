Very unique story from multiple points of view where Batman decides to try and reform villains and generally be a better person instead of using his hate and pain from parents' deaths to fuel a pointless, self-harming cycle of vigilantism. That's what I got at least. Sadly I have to point out a few issues while I recommend it. For one, the immense spelling and grammar issues; if you have issues with unproofed fanfic you will have to slog through this. Prose is very pretentious and reads like English is a second-language and the author is trying to be an inverse Hemingway. Plot is all over the place with inconsistent timing and direction, with soap-opera levels of contrived, thoughtless, poorly justified drama and a /very/ poorly executed instances where a character witnessed/knows something and multiple paragraphs are dedicated to dragging out the suspense of “the thing is important but the internal monologue will not reveal the thing that is important, the oh-so-important thing that will not be described because the thing is important but should not be revealed right now and revealing the thing I am looking at right now would spoil the mystery that is an important plot point about the thing that shall not be named, which is important”. Furthermore in the poor plot handling, characters are described to think or feel one way, and then in a later scene completely ignore their previous state or character growth. The best example I can give without spoilers would be if Luke skywalker was a good guy and then randomly robbed a pedestrian for a phone and wallet and although the story brings it up multiple times to use as a contrived plot device that change in character morality is never justified nor does the robber!Luke ever continue to go down that path or a robbery ever happen again, adding to the sense of “this is really, really OOC”. Onomatopoeia and phrases that are commonly spelled one way, such as “yeah” are consistently spelled unusually, such as “ya” which keeps throwing me off. Continuing from the above on prose, it's hard to read the descriptions or action when every fourth sentence and second paragraph is far too long of a flowery, unproofread, hard-to-comprehend mess. The thing that kills the flowery language for me is that the language is (imo) executed poorly, so not only does it break up the flow, it doesn't add anything back in to compensate. Tl;Dr plot pacing could use some serious work, a few contrived situations with no explanation for why characters act massively OOC, prose is loose, fatty, and unfinished, and it does not appear to have ever received a final editing pass before a chapter went up.
