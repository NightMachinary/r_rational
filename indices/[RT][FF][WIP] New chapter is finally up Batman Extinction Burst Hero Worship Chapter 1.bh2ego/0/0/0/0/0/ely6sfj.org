Thanks a lot for the criticism! This kind of stuff you said is extremely useful to me as an aspiring writer, especially because of how specific your points are.

​

Before I posted this chapter, I reread the entire thing and noticed a lot of my errors and flaws. I've always been bad at editing, but I'm embarrassed at how sloppy much of this story is. Going forward, I want subsequent chapters to be far cleaner, so it would be amazingly helpful if I can send you the next chapter once I'm finished with it!

​

Also, the problems you mentioned concerning prose, flowery-language, or language usage in general, are all issues I've been realizing I need to improve but am, by and large, unsure how exactly to do that. Do you, or anyone else, have suggestions on how I can work on improving those issues?
