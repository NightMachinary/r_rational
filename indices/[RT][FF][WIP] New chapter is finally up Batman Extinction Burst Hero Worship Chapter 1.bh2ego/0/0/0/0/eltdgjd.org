Since I hate dumping on a story without offering to improve what I see as flaws: Dear author, If you're reading this, leave a comment here to get in touch and I will happily proofread the entire story and any future chapters you produce to fix spelling errors and odd phrasing. I love the premise and want to see this as a well-developed story!
