I think HPMOR is a definite must read (as it provides a rational take on a well known universe... it's more like an allegorical tale using your expectations of the Harry Potter lore; this provides a strong contrast to the original works and allows a better understanding of the tropes of rationalism).

Personally I would follow it with either:

- Worth the Candle: An original work based on a mashup of table top role playing games, with an "external" rational character (aka litRPG).
- Practical Guide to Evil: An original work with in-universe rationalist characters and classic fantasy tropes (e.g. rather than the conceit of HPMOR or WtC).
