I'm mostly joking about the spoilers, although I personally thought the pseudonym reveal was an interesting revelation to me of how much faith I put in the recognizable authors here vs objective views of work. I'd dropped Worth the Candle once at the beginning, then got into it later but I guarantee I would've had more patience and given it more credit from the start if I knew who the actual author was.

That being said, there's a ton of widely known knowledge on this subreddit that certainly are spoilers and if I'm recommending a work to someone I'm assuming they haven't read it or anything about it. Those seem like very poor criteria to judge what is and isn't a spoiler.
