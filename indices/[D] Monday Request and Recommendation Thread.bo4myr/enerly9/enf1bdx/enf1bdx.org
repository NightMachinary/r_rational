You might try listening to it through the Worm Audiobook podcast. I think the voices and conversions are generally well done, but the forum sections don't work for me.

You also might enjoy going chapter by chapter listening/reading then listening to the "We've Got Worm" podcast, where one host is reading it for the first time while the other rereads and helps explain it. They do a good job of avoiding spoilers and try not to over predict the story. I found the two very entertaining, and just listened to them alone as a refresher for when the sequel came out.

Obviously I'm a Worm shill, but it's not to some people's taste especially now that "dark realistic superpowers" is a less novel idea. If you don't enjoy it don't try to force your way through, it's far too long for that.

"The Cambist and Lord Iron" is a good shorter read.

Everything by AlexanderWales is highly recommended, the Dark Wizard of Donkirk is a hidden gem, and I'd recommend Shadows of the Limelight last. You need to enjoy the analysis of story concepts and such to enjoy it past a certain point, which the next story does a better job easing into it in my opinion.

Worth the Candle by cthulhuraejepsen is a great story with litrpg elements. The beginning didn't hook me, but now I can't resist staying up to date on it.

The Waves Arisen by Wertifloke, and certainly not Eliezer Yudkowsky, is an excellent Naruto deconstruction. Crazy Naruto world powers treated and used rationally.
