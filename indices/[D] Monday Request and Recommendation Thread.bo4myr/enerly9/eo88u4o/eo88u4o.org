Eh, for me Worm too has been a hard drop. Too repetitive for my tastes, and the fights suspended my disbelief /a lot/ since they are ridiculously close from the very beginning, and at some point I just couldn't buy the protagonist didn't die ten times over in those circumstances.

My favourites, besides HPMoR (the follow up Significant Digits is also good), would be Unsong (not perhaps the most rational but definitely a lot of fun), Luminosity and Radiance, and Friendship is Optimal.
