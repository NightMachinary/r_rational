So, apart from being bored with Worm, I'm not sure which stories you actually enjoy, as a guide to what else you might like.

However, if you want an alternative world-of-superheroes story, there's The Fall of Doc Future. Books one and two are complete, and I think book three is mostly there. Much less dark than Worm, and Flicker's power is awesome, but the psychology can sometimes be heavy going.
