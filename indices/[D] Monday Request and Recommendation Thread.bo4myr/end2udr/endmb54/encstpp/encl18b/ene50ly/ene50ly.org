I'm looking for well-written and engaging nonfiction for the layman in the fields of economics, public policy (especially climate policy), anthropology, social theory, psychology, linguistics, etc. I'm most interested in contemporary or era-neutral subjects.

Examples of things in this vein I've enjoyed:

- Collapse by Jared Diamond

- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham

- Capital by Thomas Piketty

- Ishmael by Daniel Quinn (technically a novel, but I think it counts)

- Hot, Flat and Crowded by Thomas Friedman

- Man and His Symbols by CJ Jung

- Liquid Life by Zygmunt Bauman

- The Omnivore's Dilemma (also, How To Change Your Mind) by Michael Pollan

- The Stuff of Thought by Stephen Pinker

- The Black Sun by Stanton Marlan
