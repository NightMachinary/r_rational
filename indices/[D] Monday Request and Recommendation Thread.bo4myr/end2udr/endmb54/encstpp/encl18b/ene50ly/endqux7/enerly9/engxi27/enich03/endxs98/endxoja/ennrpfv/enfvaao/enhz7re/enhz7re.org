I always recommend Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere because it is well written fantasy with a flavor for everyone. He has an apocalypse/heist trilogy, a steampunk western buddy cop series, an epic fantasy series, and a romance for people that hate romances.

I saw that you like Discworld, have you read Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman? Douglass Adams is another classic.

Necroscope by Brian Lumley, Malazan Books of the Fallen, and Ringworld are all very good serious books.
