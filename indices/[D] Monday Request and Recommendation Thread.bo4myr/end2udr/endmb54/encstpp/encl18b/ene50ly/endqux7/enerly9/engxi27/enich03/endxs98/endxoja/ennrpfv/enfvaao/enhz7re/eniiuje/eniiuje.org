I have read the mistborn trilogy. It had a strange effect on me. It has everything I thought I valued in a fantasy book: good twist full of foreshadowing, unique races, consistent and detailed magic system, cool female character. Yet it felt flat on me. The writing and characters were too flat. Hope sanderson improved...

I read Good Omens and the HItchhiker guide to the galaxy.

Read RIngworld as a kid but didn't particlary like it. Malazan books is a slog to get through according to people but i WIll try. Never heard of Necroscope, will check.

Thank you good sir.
