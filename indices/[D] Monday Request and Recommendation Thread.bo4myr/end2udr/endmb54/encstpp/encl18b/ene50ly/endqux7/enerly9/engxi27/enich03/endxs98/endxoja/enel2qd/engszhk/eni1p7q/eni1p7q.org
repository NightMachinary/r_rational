I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters][He Who Fights Monsters]] and was looking for something similar. This can be in several categories:

1. Whether it be in the Rosario world

2. Whether it is with a character having to make morally questionable choices to survive

3. The MC starts slowly down a darker moral path (doesnt have to be for survival)

Also, as always, looking for more Bloodborne stories to read. I've read Fear the Old Blood, Hunter, and Bloody Tinkers.
