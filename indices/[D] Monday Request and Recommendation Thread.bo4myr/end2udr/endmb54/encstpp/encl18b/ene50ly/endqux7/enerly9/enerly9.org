I'm new to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and I just wanna know some must-reads that I should go through before diving through other titles.

There are a few of which I'm already aware of.

For starters, I've attempted reading Worm (learned about it from [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]]) twice now, both tries ending around arc 12 iirc. Not sure why, I think I just got bored. I think that's post-endbringer, i remember Skidmark and the mall fight. its a big change, so maybe thats why? Idk not sure tho

I know about Mother of Learning from that subreddit as well, and I've just decided with the release of the most recent chapter that I'd like to wait until its completion to binge it all.

Also just found out about HPMoR which I plan to listen through the podcast on spotify.

I'd just like to know of any others

Thanks!
