Not looking for first contact stories. Looking to see two cultures clash that I either already know or can get to know from another context.

One example would be a Star Trek/BSG crossover I once read. It's so long ago though I don't remember if I stopped reading it because it was dead or because some canon unfaithfulness or idiot ball turned me off or if it just became boring over time
