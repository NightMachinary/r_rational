If you like fantasy and lots of world-building, as well as clever magical solutions to problems, then check out the /Codex Alera/ series by Jim Butcher. Short summary (by me):

#+begin_quote
  A Roman legion plus camp followers stumbles into a magical world where they can control the nature spirits, or furies, leading to unnatural powers. Thousands of years later, the pseudo-Roman realm is gripped by a succession crisis. Too many plotters and too many plots all converge on the only man in the country with no furies of his own, an apprentice shepherd named Tavi.

I'm trying to avoid spoiling anything, since a lot of the major components of later books in the series (there's six total) would massively ruin the earlier books. The first book, /Furies of Calderon/, is good but the other five are better.
