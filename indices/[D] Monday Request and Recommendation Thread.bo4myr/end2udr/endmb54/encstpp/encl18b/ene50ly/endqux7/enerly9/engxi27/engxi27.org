TL;DR: Complete works?\\
There's a lot of RatFic updates being posted here, but it's really difficult to keep track of them all. I'm interested in completed works. Do you know of any, besides the ones in the wiki? I read all of the defining works and I think all the recommended complete ones.\\
Thanks!\\
