Interesting list, any favorites in particular?

You might enjoy:

"Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely, it's an analysis of perfectly rational economic model failures, the reasons behind them, and how economically irrational behavior can be predicted.

"Guyland" by Michael Kimmel: it's a social, historical, and psychological look at the rise of "bro culture", "hookup culture", "group rape culture" and some of the current culture of modern 20 something's in the USA. It might be a kind of infohazard if you're in those groups though. I read it right before college, where I joined a fraternity, and it really helped me understand where a lot of the culture is coming from. Notably it informed me that intense hazing and a lot of awful behaviors are relatively new phenomenon which makes a big difference.

"Babies by Design" by Ronald M. Green is an ethical look at human genetic engineering. It's not much policy or execution but mostly what we should do and how to think about the issue logically.

In order of engagement: Babies by design, Guyland, then predictably irrational. I had to take notes throughout Predictably Irrational to make it more engaging for me, this improved Guyland also.
