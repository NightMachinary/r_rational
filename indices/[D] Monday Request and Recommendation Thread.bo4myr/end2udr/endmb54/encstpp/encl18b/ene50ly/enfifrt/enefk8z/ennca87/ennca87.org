Books broadly in this space that I've enjoyed recently:

â€‹

- The Undercover Economist by Tim Harford
- An Invitation to Personal Construct Psychology by Trevor Butt and Vivien Burr
- Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson
- Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequence by Bowker et. al (bit of a harder read than the others, but well worth it IMO)
