Good tips, thanks. I've had that feeling about Klein from the snippets I've read, but I didn't know Harari was pseudoscience as well. It's a pity since I really like the concept of Sapiens. I have Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee on my shelf, might use that as a substitute.

Love Reich, he teaches at my alma mater and I've read a bunch of his articles. Might be time to pick up a book.
