It's not that Harari is pseudoscience, it's just that you don't really learn anything reading him, or at least I didn't. He mixes arbitrary opinion with reasonable perspective with solid fact and doesn't delineate any of these from each other or explain the evidence for any of it. Many of the claims are true, but I only know that from reading other sources that are actually educational.

If someone told you the universe is made of atoms but didn't explain how we know that or what competing models have been discredited, and lapsed into poetic rhetoric when describing the consequences of atomism for our worldview, that person wouldn't be promoting pseudoscience per se but they wouldn't author any good physics books either.
