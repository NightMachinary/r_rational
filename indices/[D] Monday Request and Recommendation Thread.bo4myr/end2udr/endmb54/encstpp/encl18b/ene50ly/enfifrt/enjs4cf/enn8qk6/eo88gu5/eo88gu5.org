  Harari rarely presents evidence for his assertions and his book is more like a bedtime story than an academic text. Thread with some people who had the same problem with the book that I did and various recommendable alternatives to it.

Yeah, agree. Harari doesn't feel very scientific. I enjoyed Sapiens if only for a few interesting ideas (I liked his concept of 'narratives' and his depiction of culture/society as a dialectic engine constantly driven by its own contradictions), but it seems like he's more interested with fitting the facts to his very elegant theories than the other way around. Certainly I think the title of Sapiens is /way/ too ambitious and that truly believing it constitutes in any way an even marginally comprehensive account of human history would be a surefire way to being way over one's head in a thousand historical discussions.
