Jared Diamond has a [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41716904-upheaval][new book out now]] (I'm yet to read it).

Naomi Klein writes on the intersection of economics and climate policy: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1237300.The_Shock_Doctrine][The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21913812-this-changes-everything][This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate]]. She's a liberal.

Matt Ridley touches economics, public policy, anthropology and psychology: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7776209-the-rational-optimist][The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25816925-the-evolution-of-everything][The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22471.The_Origins_of_Virtue][The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16176.The_Red_Queen][The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature]]. I think he's more on the right so he might be a good counter to Klein.

You probably heard about [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens][Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]] by Yuval Noah Harari. He was inspired by Jared Diamond, so you'll enjoy it.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt][Debt: The First 5,000 Years]] by David Graeber is a unique history of money as debt. Just be aware that there isn't a consensus about the origin of money. Check out [[https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/][Shelling Out: The Origins of Money]] by Nick Szabo as a counterpoint.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness][Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World -- and Why Things Are Better Than You Think]] by Hans Rosling. In a similar fashion to Steven Pinker uses data to show that things are not as bleak as we think.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7799004-merchants-of-doubt][Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming]] by Naomi Oreskes.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook][The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics]] by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita. Modern Machiavelli's Prince backed by data.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind][The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion]] by Jonathan Haidt. More people should read it.
