Can you read German? If so, I recommend Schirrmacher's /Payback. Warum wir im Informationszeitalter gezwungen sind zu tun, was wir nicht tun wollen, und wie wir die Kontrolle über unser Denken zurückgewinnen./, which talks about how our way of thinking is being changed by technology. He's very critical of it (undeservedly so, in my opinion) and pretty pessimistic about the impact it will have on society, but he makes a number of good points, and made me question my own behaviour a bit.

There's an [[https://www.edge.org/conversation/frank_schirrmacher-the-age-of-the-informavore][English interview]] covering the main points, if you're not fluent in German.
