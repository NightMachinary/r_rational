[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited][Harry Potter the Videogame: Exploited]] is a fun videogame HP crossover, especially given that it was written years before the Gamer actually came out.

I wouldn't exactly call it "good" because the pacing is truly horrendous, and the way the videogame aspects of it are formatted make it very obvious this was an author treading new ground without a good idea of what works well in litRPG fiction, but it's definitely good for a laugh, and a "historical" look at what very early litRPG fanfic was like.
