You should probably widen your search to include LitRPGs in general, not only The Gamer fanfics.

For Gamer-specific ones, maybe try [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/TheGamer][the relevant TVTropes page.]]

These also have mechanics that more or less feel like that of The Gamer:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11141738/1/The-Gamer-of-Sunagakure][/Gamer of Sunagakure, The/]] --- abaondoned
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7820743/1/Naruto-Ramen-Days][/Ramen Days, Naruto:/]] --- abandoned, the setting mechanics literally forces characters to behave like NPCs under certain conditions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12794658/1/Son-of-Gato][/Son of Gato/]] --- crackfic; charisma-heavy build; pop-culture "psychopath" protag; some Hollywood- / anime-zombie characters.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12314675/1/The-Root-of-Darkness][/Root of darkness, The/]] --- the plot gets all over the place, abandoned.
- +Shinobi, the RPG+ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12433631/1/SHINOBI-The-RPG-Act-1][/SHINOBI, THE RPG/]] --- complete; the plot is all over the place; some elements from Fallout; some idiot balls and other plot devices to handicap and hinder the protag.

None is top quality, but I've trimmed away the really low-quality and boring titles.

There are also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7485060/1/Game-Theory][/Game Theory/]] (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, compelete) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697391/1/Percy-Jackson-and-the-Game][Percy Jackson and the Game]] --- maybe someone who has read them will give a review on those.
