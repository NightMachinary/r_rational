I recommended it on some thread, might as well recommend it here.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/][Lord of the Mysteries]]

Portal fantasy/power fantasy.

The setting is Victorian styled with elements of mystery, Lovecraft and SCP. MC is cautious and carefully prepares. Internal contradictions are unusually low and translation is decent.
