I've come to think of it as the (currently) most adaptive memetic evolution of the Naruto's exam arc combined with [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop][Groundhog Day Loop]] / [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]] trope / motif: Naruto → Chunin Exam Day → Time Braid → Mother of Learning.

1. [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ch%C5%ABnin_Exams_(Arc)#Chapters][Naruto]] (2000--2002) --- it was a popular plot arc, but ultimately not the focus of the overall story, so the story moved on. And the amount of artificially stretched out pacing (e.g. how much Orochimaru / Sarutobi confrontation was milked) harmed its objective quality as well.
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][Chunin Exam Day]] (2007--2010) --- many fresh interesting ideas, but the almost-deliberately crackfic nature of the story, its [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal][Author Appeal]] contents, and lack of self-censure harmed its popularity.
3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] (2009--2011) --- the story arcs and plot still have some unpolished edges to them; and again the author doesn't try to self-censure for the sake of increasing the story's marketability. It straight out was purged from TVTropes, partially [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent#Five_filters_of_editorial_bias][because of fear of losing advertisers.]]
4. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated][Mother of Learning]] ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][2011]]--2019) --- the story's not only made into a stand-alone work by now, it's been designed to appeal to a much wider common denominator and manages this without sacrificing in quality.
