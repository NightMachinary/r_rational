I re-read it recently because it's one of my favourites and was shocked once again at how good it is. I wish I hadn't waited so long, as in my experience it was even better this time.

Anathem actually reminds me a bit of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, in the sense that they're both spectacular stories which have a rough start that scares a lot of people away, and which are immensely rewarding if you get past that. Malazan is several times worse than Anathem, though, as the hump can be the entire first book rather than just a few hundred pages.
