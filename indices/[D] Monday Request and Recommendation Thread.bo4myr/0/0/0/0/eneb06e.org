I really loved the beginning of Anathem. I thought all the information about the world of the Maths, the details of Mathic society, was the most interesting part of the book.

But the other part, I feel very deep empathy with.

I am listening to the audio of Gardens of the Moon more than a year after finishing the series in print. The book is sooooo hard to get through.
