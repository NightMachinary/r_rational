Isn't it though! It's actually pretty impressive that the series has managed to garner the popularity that it has with such an obtuse start off point.

I remember it took me weeks to read the first book, and the second book wasn't much better. I think I only kept going back because of sunk cost falacy; I was young and poor and I had bought the first three books all at once.

I'm glad I did because Memories of Ice is still one of my favourite books all time. That ending...
