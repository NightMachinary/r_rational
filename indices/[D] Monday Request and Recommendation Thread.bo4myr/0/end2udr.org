tl;dr: Anathem is a great novel which you'll love if you're a patient reader who appreciates intelligent characters(who take no shortcuts of thought) and deep af worldbuilding, and doesn't mind (very) slow burn plots front-loaded with a lot of exposition.

The one sentence blurb of Anathem would be: a modern society turns on their smartest and most curious people(think genius level) and sequesters them all into isolated monasteries/fortresses in which they're not allowed any possessions, to procreate, or to do any science but the most abstract. Thousands of years later the book starts.

I'm going to re-iterate a recommendation for [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem][Anathem]] by Neal Stephenson, which I consider like a black swan in science fiction, in the sense that there is nothing out there quite like it. It's a hard SF story which is closer in feel and style to a high-fantasy, hard magic story, with an immense emphasis on ambiance and worldbuilding. Besides the setting, another focus of the story is on intelligent characters trying to solve problems and understand their world and each other through their knowledge and intellect.

The early parts of the book are somewhat reminiscent of the parts in HPMOR where Harry is figuring out magic, only without the magic.

Here's the official summary:

  Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside "saecular" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside---the Extramuros---for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.

  Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates---at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious "extras" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was "collected." But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.

  Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros---a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose---as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world---as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.

Like before, I'll warn people that *Anathem is hard work initially,* and *not for everyone*. It starts glacially slow and for the first couple hundred pages(the book is humongous, almost 1k pages) it's almost entirely exposition, where you're slowly getting familiarized to the protagonist, the world, and most importantly, the vocabulary.

Yes, Stephenson introduces dozens of words, but it's not a made-up language like tolkien or a pidgin like Cloud Atlas(which I disliked), it's almost entirely portmanteaus and cognates of existing words, mostly english and a bit of latin(as an example: Anathem= anthem + anathema), and this is the major sticking point for most readers. From experience I would say if you find the made-up vocabulary annoying and distracting at first(i certainly did) you need give it 70-100 pages for it to feel more natural, and a bit more to get fully engaged with the plot.

The entire reason I'm writing this long-ass comment is because I think this book is really worth it, especially in the context of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s tastes, but if you don't trust the author (or the recommendation ;D) it can be hard to get over the hump to the good parts of the novel. But if you do you'll be searching for a novel like this for the rest of your life(search anathem on reddit and you'll see).
