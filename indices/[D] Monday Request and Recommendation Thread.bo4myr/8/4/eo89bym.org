Someone on Fanfiction.net undertook an amazingly vast project based on the idea of a multi-way crossover between Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Avatar: TLA and Warhammer Fantasy in which a Weyland-Yutani-like future "Company" (original setting) attempts to colonise a distant star system in which all these worlds exist as separate planets: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3241044/Spartan-168-Django][Event Horizon]]. Unfortunately, only Book 1, "Autumn's Frontier", about the Game of Thrones world, has ever been completed, and it's not really a crossover as the only non-GoT characters to play an important role are original. There's some references to the other franchises but that's it. And sadly the whole project seems dead now, which is a pity, because the idea was fun and the writing pretty good.
