There are two versions of the dictator's handbook. I don't remember the alternate title, but you recommended the dumbed down version. I looked at it first on accident and it was grating to read.

I disrecommend Sapiens and especially disrecommend Klein.

Klein is a personality, not a real academic. She doesn't understand economics at all. [[https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2014/11/i-wish-this-changed-everything/][Book review that might illustrate some of her problems.]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/9i8xb1/theres_nothing_natural_about_puerto_ricos_disaster/e6ihnyk/][Heavily downvoted comment thread I once made criticizing an article of hers.]] In retrospect I wish I'd been more conciliatory, but I really dislike narratives of economic inequality that encourage unprincipled conspiratorial analysis.

Harari rarely presents evidence for his assertions and his book is more like a bedtime story than an academic text.

I would recommend Reich's How We Got Here instead of Harari.
