[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8680.Fierce_Invalids_Home_from_Hot_Climates][Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates]] reminds me a lot of Terry Pratchett. Blurb: a wildly contrarian CIA agent is blackmailed by his grandma into taking her parrot back to the amazon rainforest.\\
Legitimately one of the funniest and weirdest books I've ever read.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7165300-the-black-prism][Lightbringer series]] is great all-around epic fantasy, with a satisfying characterizations and narrative. Blurb: A boy's village is attacked and he discovers he's a mage and the son to the most powerful man in the world.\\
In my opinion the best fantasy series of recent times, and it is confirmed to conclude with the 5th book later this year.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402093.Sh_gun][Shogun]], one of my favourite books of all time. Blurb: an english man finds himself shipwrecked in Japan in 1600, the first non-spanish or portuguese to ever land there--at a time when england is at war with both those countries. It's an amazing take on the "stranger in a strange land" trope, where the protagonist is a foreigner explores a completely alien culture he's thrust into head first.\\
Even though it's based on real historical events and people(which it renames), the book does not try in the least to be historically accurate, and even a lot details about japanese culture is BS, like when he talks about ninjas or bushido. It's a testament to how good the story and the characters are that it's a great novel regardless.
