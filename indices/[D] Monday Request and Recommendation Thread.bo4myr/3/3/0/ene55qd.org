I /really/ wanted to enjoy Forged Destiny but I gave up on the story because I just couldn't stand Jaune's character anymore.

  Jaune at one point replaces his brain with the idiot ball and his character never progresses from there. I stopped maybe 120k or so words in, he continued the make the same stupid and childish mistakes he was making at the start of the story. He never grew as a character and reading about him was just a slog. The breaking point was when he killed an enemy solider for executing another soldier. His idealism and naivety was just frustrating after awhile.

Edit:

It looks like tvtropes agrees with me at least:

#+begin_quote
  Jaune for the majority of Book 5, with every personal decision he makes being debatably one screw up after another. Made more egregious as the reasons why his decisions are inadvisable are laid out immediately before he makes them.
