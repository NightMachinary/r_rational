Yea, I also enjoyed Not This Time, Fate. Coeur Al'Aran has a lot of really great stories but I would hesistate to classify all of them as rational, they're still a great read though. I'm currently keeping up with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13073342/1/The-Unseen-Hunt][The Unseen Hunt]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863738/1/Relic-of-the-Future][Relic of the Future]]. His update speed makes it kinda hard to stay on top of all of his stories but that's not a bad thing.
