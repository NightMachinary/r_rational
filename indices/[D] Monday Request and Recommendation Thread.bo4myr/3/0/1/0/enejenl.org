Also note that shinobi the rpg is completely "irrational"(as much as a gamer story can be) from the get go first 3 chapters because the MC got his gamer powers when he was 2 years old but did a 5 or 8 year time skip completely ignoring the gamer system entirely. He only starts leveling up after the timeskip even though it was introduced to the MC as a 2 year old. I called the author out on this glaring plot hole and he even responded "yeah my bad just ignore it"

I recommend son of gato instead.
