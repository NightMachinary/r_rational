It is not. I had it before discovering Worm.

I read Aspects. It's pretty cool, though I feel he didn't get Harry right at all. In fact I didn't read the last chapter due to a bit if dialogue that was so jarring to me it immediately made me drop it. Specifically, Harry tells Rose senior that Albus is gay. Something he shouldn't know or, if he did, would never have revealed that way.

After a bit I thought of simply skipping that chapter and simply reading the ones with the much more enjoyable PoV characters. Which is when I found out there wasn't anything there to skip to yet.
