Not quite a Gamer story, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] is an RPG world AU of RWBY. It's about Jaune who has a non-combat viable class running away to Beacon to attempt to be a Hero in spite of being a Blacksmith.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11992573/1/Multiplayer][Multiplayer]] is another good RWBY/Gamer story where there are multiple competing Gamers and every time someone dies, the game is 'reset' with no clue of how to reach the final ending to stop the eternal looping.

I would be interested if there are any other fanfics where everyone is a Gamer or lives in an RPG AU version of the canon plotline.
