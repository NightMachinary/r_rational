Can anyone recommend books similar to [[http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/][Math Girls]]? It's a phenomenal read about introducing mathematical concepts in a way that helps you truly understand the intuition and pattern behind the formulas. It goes from basic elementary math problems to college level or above and show how it's all related, while at the same time illustrating the process of discovery and proving the theorems. There's also a romantic plotline between the three main characters, but who cares about that? /sarcasm/

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8523001/chapters/19536781][An Ever Fixed Mark]] - A deconstruction of the “soulmate identifying mark” trope, using “Pride and Prejudice.” As some of you here may remember, I was asking questions before about how people here would envision soul-marks working, to work on a story that would subvert the standard tropes around soul-marks. Well that plan's now Dead On Arrival since this story did it damn near perfectly.

I'll be on an eight hour plane flight to London. If you were in my shoes, what would you choose to read for those eight hours?
