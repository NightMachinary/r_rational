Even when the previous story doesn't actually exist. Off the top of my head, FF5 and 10 both featured party members who'd been part of the group that sealed away the Big Bad the last time. (to be clear: they were from events that we only hear about/see in cutscenes, not from a previous game)

I mean, if you're going to have a Grizzled Old Man-type character, it's a great way for them to tie into the setting's backstory.
