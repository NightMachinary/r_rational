  Aaaand... yeah killing Joon is probably the right call for the rest of Aerb? Knowing this DM?

The way I read the DM he has already set up the challenge and made sure that Joon has the opportunity to acquire the tools he needs to face it. I think the DM might be tweaking things a bit to keep things interesting but only to the point of maintaining plausible deniability to any hypothetical observers, but I think any big events which will occur to challenge Joon have already been set underway, and will happen regardless of whether Joon survives up until that point or not.

One observation in favour of this is that after Uther disappeared, the threats continued coming for another 30 years, rather than stopping abruptly. Another is that the way the DM has set up Joon's harem is consistent with this approach to DMing, he set up the possibility in advance, but since Joon persistently acted in defiance of the path layed out for him, it didn't happen.

I don't think that Joon is here because of the rising threat or that the threats are appearing because of Joon, rather they have a common cause (The DM wanted to run another campaign).
