The naming sequence was so tense. Stroke of genius to keep talking about The Cannibal earlier in the chapter (btw love Fenn channeling Reimer there. I just imagine her in Order of the Stick shouting "HA HA! HALF DAMAGE!" at the universe and it working) - I was 95% sure you weren't going to unleash him on them, but then /you kept naming actors/ and I just /knew/ he was about to be dropped. I mean, if he's gonna say Adam Driver there's no way in hell he's not gonna say Shia LaBoeuf.

But then: Arthur Surprise! Or Tiff surprise actually, I didn't recognize Arthur's last name. Let out an audible "oh daaamn" at that. And then, wow that mirror scene. In order to give it the heft I felt it deserved, I read his monologue out loud to myself. Highly recommended. Channel your inner Mike Ehrmantrout for that heavy "outwardly world-weary authority figure finally saying the thing that's been weighing him down all these years" tone. I hope my apartment isn't bugged, or some nebulous deep state org now thinks I've completely lost my marbles.

Aaaand... yeah killing Joon is probably the right call for the rest of Aerb? Knowing this DM?
