So I agree with this and came to the same conclusion, before asking what the goal here would be though? Twig Fenn's elf luck so she and the rest of the group bail and leave behind a member /except/ Joon who conveniently is last in line to get through the portal and decides to stay? If your goal is to get some â€˜alone time' with Joon then I don't think this plan works nine times out of ten. I would guess this plan would often result in Joon bailing with everyone else or everyone going all out to recapture Valencia then bail.
