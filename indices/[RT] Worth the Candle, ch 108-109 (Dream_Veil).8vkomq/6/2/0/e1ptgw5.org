I am pretty sure that elf luck was compromised.

First of all, from Masters' perspective, it was the best sense to attack. Juniper has shown some unexpected ability to see through the illusions, with no exact limit. That meant Masters' ability to fool him /or/ the rest of the part became limited: Juniper would have seen through the illusions, and if Masters targeted his teammates, Juniper would have seen them reacting to illusions. That was true for every sense, /except/ elf luck.

Fenn had elf luck, but Juniper didn't (as far as Masters knew). That meant Juniper wouldn't have been able to see through illusions targeting elf luck. That was the state of the situation --- and then Fenn's sense of danger overloaded.

Is that not suspicious?

Second: circumstantial evidence/the timeline.

  “Something's not right,” said Fenn. “Not just the obvious. A little tingle came on in the last minute or so, and it's getting stronger. You feel it too?”

  I nodded. My own sense of it was far weaker than hers.

/Both/ Juniper and Fenn feel "a little tingle" from luck sense, immediately prior to Masters becoming hostile.

#+begin_quote
  “Ah,” said Masters. His tone was flat, only with a slight note of curiosity. “Elf luck?”
#+end_quote

Masters figures it out.

#+begin_quote
  “You have another sense,” said Masters. “Which one?”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “You couldn't see them,” said Masters. “Now you can. How?”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “How can you still see your companions?” asked Masters.
#+end_quote

Masters /really/ wants to know what sense he needs to compromise. Implies the knowledge would be useful to him, implies the knowledge is necessary for compromisation, implies luck is compromised.

#+begin_quote
  “Something's off,” said Fenn. “Really, really off.” <...>

  “Zero to ten?” asked Amaryllis.

  “Eleven,” said Fenn. “Not sure that portal is going to do it.”
#+end_quote

Fenn feels something /horrific/ through her luck sense...

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't feel whatever she felt, maybe because my luck was so much weaker than her own, or maybe because I had so many other things on my mind.
#+end_quote

... Juniper /doesn't/.

--------------

To recap, Masters likely could compromise any sense if he knows to target it. He knew that Fenn had luck sense, but had no reason to think that about Juniper. Juniper's luck sense was enough to pick up on what Fenn's luck sense registered as "a little tingle", but then he didn't feel anything at all while Fenn was experiencing sense overload.

As I said, I'm pretty sure elf luck was compromised. Given that, what is the likelihood that some kind of external threat /really/ arrive when Masters was faking the arrival of an external threat?
