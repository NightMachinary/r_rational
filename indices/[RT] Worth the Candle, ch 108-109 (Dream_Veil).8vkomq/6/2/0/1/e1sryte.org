Obvious question: Why would Masters have "no reason to think that about Juniper"? Joon gave away his ability to feel elf luck when he confirmed the first tingle that allowed Masters to figure out that elf luck was being consulted. So why doesn't Masters use that information later unless he's intending to keep Joon there?
