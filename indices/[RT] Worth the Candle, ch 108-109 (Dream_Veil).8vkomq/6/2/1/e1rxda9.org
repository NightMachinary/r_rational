I'm going back and forth but I think this is correct. I couldn't find a single statement from Master that appears to be false. He says "It's not me." Another reason Joon's luck may not be tripping is that whatever is coming is not a threat to him but is a threat to Fenn. Does luck only care about personal threats?
