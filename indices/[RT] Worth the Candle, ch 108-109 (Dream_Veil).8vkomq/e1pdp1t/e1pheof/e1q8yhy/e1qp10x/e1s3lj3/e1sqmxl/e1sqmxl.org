Oh, but you /can/. Just focus on the social, not the technical.

Where do chapters originate from? From the author. It stands to reason that the author would have the most accurate information on exact update time. And he could be bargained with! Just offer [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] something he wants, in exchange for advance warning regarding new chapters.

To outplay people trying to post pre-emptively, you could try to agree to randomize posting time somewhat, and notify [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s moderators about links pointing nowhere should they appear in the meantime. But this doesn't happen too often, so perhaps it's unnecessary.
