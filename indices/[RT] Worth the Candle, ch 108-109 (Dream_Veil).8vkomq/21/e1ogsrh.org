  The Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny was one of the smaller athenaeums, which meant that it â€˜only' had a hundred thousand students, divided up into a handful of colleges. It was a hell of a lot of people even before you added in all the faculty and staff, all of them packed onto the tip of the mountain.

Do you think the colleges are all on the mountain, or spread out in different countries? If it's the first, that's a lot of power to give the kingdom that hosts each Athenaum, and would make it harder for farther flung nations to send people for training.

The latter would make more sense, but would make each individual Athenaeum less impressive from a narrative standpoint.

On another note, Joon staying behind alone to save Valencia is likely to skyrocket her loyalty even further, especially with how easily it rises for her. I'm guessing we'll see an example of loyalty level 30 soon.
