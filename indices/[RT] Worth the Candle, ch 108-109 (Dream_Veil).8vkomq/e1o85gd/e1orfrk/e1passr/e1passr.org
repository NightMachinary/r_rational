Thanks. I'd agree that AO3 is a much harsher audience. It also tends to be harsh in a way that this subreddit rarely is; it's pretty typical for people on AO3 (at least for this work) to comment about "the author" as though they have a clue who I am or why I made the writing choices I did. That's not really a way that I tend to engage with works, nor is it a way that I like seeing others engage with works (even those I didn't write), nor do I think it's terribly productive unless there's a strong case to be made one way or another, like from biographical details (and even then). Judging the internal mental state of other people is very hard, all the more so when you're looking at something they created rather than speaking with them directly.

I tend to approach AO3 comments in batches, and then skip past the stuff that doesn't look like it's going to be something that I would want to respond to. Sometimes there are corrections or clarifications I want to give, sometimes there's actual discussion, and sometimes (rarely) there are typos. I went through a period of just ignoring comments entirely, but I've been trying to get better about A) dealing with negative feedback in a way that's mentally and creatively healthy and B) giving people responses that I think can enhance the work. I've had some success with it so far.
