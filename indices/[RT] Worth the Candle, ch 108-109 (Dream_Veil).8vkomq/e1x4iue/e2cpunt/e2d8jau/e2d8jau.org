Absolutism is a very dangerous thought pattern. Yes, those were hostile, but to what degree? Master's aim was, quite obviously, information. None of his hostilities were lethal or even damaging (unlike those of Joon). Put yourself in the shoes of someone who carried a task he didn't even fully understand for half a millenia, and all his actions become quite reasonable, if a bit excessive.
