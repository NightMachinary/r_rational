Some random thoughts:

- Joon didn't mention seeing anyone else's soul in the room with him. First thoughts - a non-anima illusionist? or he's really far away? Or he's fooling soulsight? Or he's actually a sentient entad a la Bethel? Or something else entirely is going on?

- The illusionist claims to be named Masters. Clearly this is a Worm reference, because the illusionist is a Master 12.

- We don't know the illusionist's real name, gender, appearance, or anything else, at any level we might consider absolutely certain. They probably doesn't have any assistants or anyone else in the building. They might be pretending to be trained that monastic discipline in order to make faking facial expressions easier - if they have trouble responding accurately by simulating facial expressions in real-time.

- Speaking of that monastic order, they are Worth The Candle's DÃ»nyain, and nothing they could tell me, with their iron-clad control of their faces, would convince me otherwise.

- Val saving the day would be awesome, she needs to save the day more, she hasn't really yet saved the day nearly as much as I'd like.

- Joon has a limited amount of soulsight time left. Looking for unidentified souls and seeking methods whereby he can end them might work. Some of his gem-based blasting magic, perhaps? I don't even know.

Overall, the plot twist with regard to dream skewered here was great, 10/10. And the illusionist battle looks like it'll be a great mindscrew, so I look forward to that. His opponent controls the vertical and the horizontal, but he still has a few tricks to play.
