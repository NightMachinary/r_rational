I feel like Arthur's story is increasingly leaning towards showing the way that Joon /could/ go. A theme of the story seems to be holding on to the past and letting your current relationships and life deteriorates because of it.

Joon very obviously was badly affected after Arthur's passing, and now it seems Arthur never moved on from his desire to get back to Earth. Hinting that he never really made the most of his life on Aerb, still seeing others as NPCs.
