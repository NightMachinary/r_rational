Arthur's fixation on the narrative probably brought about the escalating consequences that Masters recounts. I feel like contrasting Uther's narrative focus to Joon's decision to let go of the narrative's weight might be a clue into the nature of the "game." Uther may have been playing with the wrong strategy, so to say, because fixing Aerb's issues was never the intended end-game for Arthur (whereas it might be for Joon, who has a reason to undo all the suffering he helped create).

I've had a theory that this game is a type of therapy. So if we work with the conceit that Arthur was sent here for some therapeutic reason, what issues did Arthur have? The only things I remember are: (1) he was the god of stories without endings and in the same vein (2) he always waffled and deferred confessing to Tiff. So maybe his issue was that he couldn't commit to an ending and the narrative kept being deferred because he went every which way.
