Sure, but it's the kind of risk that I think Val might take. She probably has complete faith in Joon's ability to defeat him, and she knows she's safe; there's no reason for Shia to kill a sack of potatoes.

More rampant speculation: Arthur was the first and until Joon pulls it off as well the only person to defeat Shia. The "illusion of Shia -> oh shit it's not an illusion?! -> team up" arc would be a cool fakeout.

No doubt I am completely off base. That's fine, because I enjoy being surprised.
