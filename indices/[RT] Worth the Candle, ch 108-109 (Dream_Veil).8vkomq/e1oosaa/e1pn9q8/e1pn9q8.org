Mhh... I don't know. There was definitely some shenanigans happening after the second keyring (I'm pretty sure Amaryllis didn't /really/ suggest they give him info), but I think there was a real external threat that somehow incapacitated Masters at the end of the chapter.

Let's see... Juniper has access to soul vision, which I'm pretty sure Masters can't fake, which means all their movements definitely matched what we saw. So the illusion was auditory and /maybe/ elf luck at most. There was definitely a portal, the others went through it, Joon didn't. Given that info, it's likely Valencia didn't go either (else she'd have dragged Joon with her), which means she's trapped somewhere.

I think the part at the end really is the illusion cutting off. Maybe it wasn't, and Masters cut himself off mid-sentence on purpose... but I don't think he's /that/ good. He's confused, he's dealing with what he thinks is Uther 2.0 and his new Knights, Joon has shown an ability to see through some of his illusions, and Masters doesn't know how the ability works and what its limits are. The scene really makes sense if you assume Masters is grasping at straws there (unlike Fallatehr, who was smooth and deliberate even after he was exposed).

I'm calling it now, this is what happened:

- Masters cut off most of his illusions when Joon touched his friends.

- He tried to convince them to stay, by man-in-the-middle-ing their dialogue.

- He was taken out, either by Valencia, or by an external force.

- Everyone except Joon decided to leave, for the reasons we saw.
