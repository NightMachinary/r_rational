Except Masters doesn't know the team well enough to create an illusion of them acting in character. That's why he had them just standing around being puzzled like Joon was.

Most telling is Mary's comment about voting at the end. I doubt Uther was running his group as a democracy, based both on him being king and from what we've heard about his actions in Aerb. And Aerb doesn't have a democratic tradition that it would make sense for him to make that guess.

So, it seems like the team Joon thought he was interacting with was really them. And we know they really left because he couldn't have known to fake the solo mode achievement. (We also know Valencia is incapacitated or elsewhere, for the same reason.)

It's possible he faked the luck sense that Fenn felt, but I can't see how he could have been sure enough that Joon was going to stay behind, which was his most pressing concern at the time, if we assume no outside threat.

It is possible he noticed Fenn's reference to Joon having luck (bad opsec there), and he may have suppressed Joon's sense at the end in the hopes he would stay. But none of the rest of the possibilities seem reasonable given what we know of Masters's capabilities.
