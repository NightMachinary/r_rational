Not all /Mother of Learning/ updates are posted by [[/u/Xtraordinaire][u/Xtraordinaire]], only about 80%. Is it necessary to specify the author? If you want to cut off (very rare) discussion threads, adding "Chapter" would be a better to do it. But there are occasional worldbuilding updates by the author, so I'm not sure it's even necessary.

Alternatively, [[/u/Xtraordinaire][u/Xtraordinaire]] should step up and finally decisively outcompete all other MoL-posters. The last I remember, there was some kind of bot warfare? Perhaps it would be sensible to escalate further.
