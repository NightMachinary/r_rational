We didn't know that the dream skewered were from 2017, only that they were from Earth. And then most people aren't from North America/Europe, where Shia Labeouf is popular. So only a tiny fraction would even know the name, much less mention a somewhat popular actor when there is little reason for his name to come up.

Although this raises the question I asked last update of how the knowledge of Shia Labeouf got passed on at all, if the people who say it are murdered. How could it happen that the syllables are not only put together correctly randomly, but the name is passed on through some obscure method that is the only one that works?
