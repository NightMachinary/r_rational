He likely follows the rules for the game. Meaning when fighting Shia, you have to cause him injury in a number of isolated events a number of times equal to 5 + 5n, where N is the number of people in the initial group, then an additional 5 for every single person he kills. Given that if the rules are followed, each injury you take lowers your success chance for harming him by 16%, and you have a flat 16% failure rate to start. The only way to escape would be to leave the location, which is difficult given that if you go five minutes in safety, he can bend reality to attack you.
