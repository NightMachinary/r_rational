It's heavily impkled he kills everyone, but a quick skim didn't show Amaryllis saying directly that he kills absolutely everyone.

Saying his name once doesn't guarantee summoning him, but if he isn't summoned then why would you link the word to anything? Nothing happened.

The only thing I thought of was using elf luck in some fashion, because it can give the elf information that they otherwise shouldn't be able to know. Someone is about to say the name, and a nearby elf shoots their hand out to stop them? Kinda implausible.
