I was pondering that Val might be able to avoid the consequences of calling down Shia---but then, Mary did explain that she had to hear the name from a record-player /recorded by a now-dead person./ As in, even if the record-player is itself a sack of potatoes, the name could have somehow still been traced from its playback to the person who recorded it, had that person still been alive. Val might not die if she calls the Cannibal, but the Cannibal might trace the name from her to Joon.
