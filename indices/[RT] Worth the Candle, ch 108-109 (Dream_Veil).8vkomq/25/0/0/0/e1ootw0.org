Anytime! I'll be commenting on the patreon thread each release (if I can) so you can get a batch of fixes out before it hits the general public. No pressure - some are obviously just style edits.

If you do patreon releases the old way but with "people with the link can suggest", I'll do it on the original document (if that helps)
