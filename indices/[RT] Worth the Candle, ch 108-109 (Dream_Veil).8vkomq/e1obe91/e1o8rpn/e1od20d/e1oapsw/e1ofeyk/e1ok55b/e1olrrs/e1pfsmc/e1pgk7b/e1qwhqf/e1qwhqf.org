i took from that scene that the recording may be somewhat old. the guy is dead either as a result of the recording, subsequent experimentation, or old age. doesnt matter he's dead so the chain is broken. As to whether the chain can be traced back from val... that depends on a discussion we had last thread as to wether val's null pointer error name is how she bypasses things in the game layer...
