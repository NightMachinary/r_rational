Self Insert. While can mean the literal (I, the author, am dropped into the story), has various degrees. For example, Joon has some clear similarities with Ben Friesen / Alexander Wales / cthulhuraejepsen - he's very very arguably a self-insert of some flavour. I've seen the definitition stretched as far as "a person from our mundane earth is dropped into another world" - for example, a Russian special forces soldier dropped into Westeros or something.
