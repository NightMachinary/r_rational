My preferred state (most interesting narrative) would be if our party happens to be equipped with radios / walky-talkies (afaik, these exist on aerb).

Now, they would be in a very interesting position: Communications Joon-> party cannot be interfered with, but comms party->joon can be modified. Masters can listen to everything.

Now we need a protocol for peaceful (almost neutral ground) negotiations. First, joon will repeat back everything he hears, both from party and from M; the latter is necessary because M is presumably not physically speaking at all. In other words, the party can catch all deceptions. In regular intervalse, and especially before every irreversible decision (e.g. revealing new info to M), Joon queries the party whether any deceptions occurred: If they spotted deceptions, tell e.g. the last name of Harry Potter's male companion; if they spotted no deceptions, tell the last name of his female companion.

M is informed of this protocol. He is informed that negotiations will end if he fakes any communications. If he must interfere, he is to replace by [redacted], which would be considered shitty but less hostile than replacement by lies.

Ultimately, Joon has no way of fighting. If M has any sense, the room is rigged to collapse into a lava pit, and J cannot quickly find the exit anyway. If joon finds val, and she is presumed immune to illusion, then the same protocol applies.
