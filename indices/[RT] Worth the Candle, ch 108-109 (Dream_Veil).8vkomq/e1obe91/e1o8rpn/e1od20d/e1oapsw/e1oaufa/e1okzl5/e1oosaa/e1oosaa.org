There's no bigger threat.

We have little reason to believe anything past the second keyring actually happened. That outcome was pretty convenient for Masters: Juniper's allies have left, and Masters is now alone with him, up against an enormous threat. Any bets on them striking an alliance of convenience next chapter, during which they would come to trust each other?

Elf luck was compromised. Masters likely could take control of any sense if he knows it is relevant, and he figured out elf luck even before becoming hostile. Scaring them into leaving, then fooling everyone sans Juniper into thinking that Juniper is visibly leaving with them, was entirely doable.

They screwed up their identity confirmations, should've been continuously exchanging private information, inserting it in phrases and such. Faking that would've been next to impossible.

(I'm not sure what's up with Valencia, though. If Masters couldn't affect her and she was fine, she wouldn't have left with the rest of the party, since she would've seen Juniper not leaving. I'd bet on her being incapacitated in the room, then taken through the portal by the rest of the party. Would explain why no-one else hesitated to leave her behind, and why Masters expected only Juniper to stay.)

  I couldn't feel whatever she felt, maybe because my luck was so much weaker than her own, or maybe because I had so many other things on my mind.

Or because Masters didn't know to fake it for him, hmm? I'd assume he would have noticed an eleven on a zero-to-ten scale.
