I really, really liked these chapters. A couple of thoughts.

We now have an in-story candle. Is it "worth the candle" for Uther to return?

"a candle he said would light his way back to me" "The candle has continued to burn, to no effect." "There's a decent chance that I'm still alive. If I am, I imagine that I'll find you soon enough."

Is Uther coming back now? Is he the 11/10 that Fenn felt but Joon didn't?
