So, last time he was adjusting his expectations about the quest based on the fact that he received it at level 2.

If he had actually gone there at level 2, he would have lacked all the things that let him pierce the illusion, and he would have been thoroughly taken in. Presumably that would not have been a Game Over, because the DM does actually want him to succeed, just without hand holding. He would have told the illusionist what he knew about Arthur, possibly even about his meta power. And that would /not/ have meant an unseen and unfelt dagger in the back for the safety of the world.

So, perhaps that means that the illusionist should be considered a potential ally?
