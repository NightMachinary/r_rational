Remember, he wasn't even bodily transported or created - his old body had an identity that was just murdered by the DM and overwritten with Joon. Him being just a brainscan of Joon is pretty easily plausible - even if he was 'transported' it's probably still a copy kinda in the same sense as a Star Trek transporter actually making copies and just killing the original. To put someone's mind into another person you'd have to copy the first person's brain and place it on the second's. Then whether or not it's being 'teleported' or just 'copied' is if you decide to kill/delete the original copy afterwards.
