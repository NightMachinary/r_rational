  I'm not sure what's up with Valencia, though. If Masters couldn't affect her and she was fine, she wouldn't have left with the rest of the party, since she would've seen Juniper not leaving. I'd bet on her being incapacitated in the room, then taken through the portal by the rest of the party

Masters has had 500 years of experience to become a master of other magic as well as illusion, he also has access to various powerful entads. He could easily have moved her away from the rest of the party with that
