If 'Masters' is an illusion, making it an illusion of a creature that doesn't have much facial movement/strong reactions is quite clever, as it means you can neglect the finer points of that part of the illusion without raising suspicion.

Going another level of recursion down, you also have to not neglect it completely, so they'll not be suspicious at the fact you're improbably-perfect at controlling your reactions. I imagine the inexpertly-trained outnumber the experts, as with...well, most things.
