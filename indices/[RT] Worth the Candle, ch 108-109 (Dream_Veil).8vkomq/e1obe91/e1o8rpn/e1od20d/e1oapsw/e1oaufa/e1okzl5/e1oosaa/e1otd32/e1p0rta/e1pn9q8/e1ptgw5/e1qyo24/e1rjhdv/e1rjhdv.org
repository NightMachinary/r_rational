My initial guess was that he used Valencia to separate them.

Say she is lying unconscious in the middle of the room. He could show her to the rest of the party, but continue blocking Juniper's perception of her. They grab her and put her through the portal --- and now they don't have any reason to hesitate escaping, unlike Juniper. Masters creates an illusion of Juniper walking through the portal, replaces actual Juniper with Masters' image, for Amaryllis to talk to at the end, and sees everyone except Juniper leave.

(We don't even know if the portal is actually closed, by the way. Perhaps Masters used an illusion to "close" it faster?)

However, on second thoughts, it's conditional on Masters knowing/gambling on Juniper's inability to see her, which means he would be able to figure out soul sight, which means he would be able to fake it, which means he has absolute control again and no reason to scare them off.

So I'm not sure.
