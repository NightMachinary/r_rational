Ah, I did not know that. MoL is not one I've been following.

My main reason for including the author is the potential edge case where someone in the future decides to post a story with a similar name. It may be unnecessary for MoL, since the name is fairly unique. Using the site or url options may be a way to exclude unrelated content as well.
