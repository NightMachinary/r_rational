I agree, I am mostly speaking as Devil's advocate, I also dislike the way that Masters went about it, he didn't act like a man seeking information on a long and arduous job, he separated them and ambushed them with incomprehensible and unknown magic, using it to deceive and disorient them to make them more malleable to his demands. Almost no one in this series ever tries the carrot before the stick, and Masters is definitely usinging the stick here lethal or not.
