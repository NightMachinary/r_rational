I think Joon's behavior was extremely idiotic in 109. He was just too hostile and wary. He didn't consider first wat Masters even wanted - he only spoke to escape, not actually exchange information. On the other hand, despite all that wariness, he only thought about defeating/escaping the centuries-old extremely powerful wizard within his own exclusion zone, instead of, you know, negotiating his way out. And he didn't consider what this meeting - his first meeting with a person who personally knew Uther - means from the narrative point of view.
