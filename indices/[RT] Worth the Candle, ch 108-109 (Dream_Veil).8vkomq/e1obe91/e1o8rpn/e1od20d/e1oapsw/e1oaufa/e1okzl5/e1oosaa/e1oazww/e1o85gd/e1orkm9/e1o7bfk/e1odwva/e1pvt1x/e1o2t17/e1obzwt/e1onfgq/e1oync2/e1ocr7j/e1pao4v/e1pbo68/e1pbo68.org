Illusion magic seems more like Master /and/ Stranger. He is controlling the illusions, but they don't seem able to do much by themselves, per se. The Stranger aspect is more useful from a tactical standpoint, as it informs people facing him that you should be prepared for deception and 'mind games' and the like, not mind-control or minions. And of course, the PRT rating system was created from an in-universe tactical perspective, not for rating 'accurately.'
