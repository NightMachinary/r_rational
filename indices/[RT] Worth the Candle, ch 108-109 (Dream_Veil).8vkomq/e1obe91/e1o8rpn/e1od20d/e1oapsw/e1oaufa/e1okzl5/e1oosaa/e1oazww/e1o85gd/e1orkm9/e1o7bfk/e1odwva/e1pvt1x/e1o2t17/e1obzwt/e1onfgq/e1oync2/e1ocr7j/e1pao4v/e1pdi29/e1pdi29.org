Hey long time listener first time caller, quick question, has there been any discussion in the past about how weird it is that the world contains elements that Joon invented after Arthur's death, like Fel Seed? My assumption was always that the world was built at some point from Joon's work, and then Arthur was brought in at some point and then later Joon was brought in, and the DM guides them around. But Fel Seed indicates that there are major elements that were still being added to the world in between Arthur's and Joon's transits, assuming Arthur entered before his death.

Anyway, w/r/t this chapter, I'm super happy to see someone dealing with illusion magic in DnD as the game-breaking power that it is, and tying it strictly to the I/O channels for the brain. It reminds of imachination, and I was always really happy with how that turned out. Great chapter, great story.
