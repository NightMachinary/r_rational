So far Joon has always been given level appropriate encounters. The story even lampshades it too... but if the DM wasn't railroading, how could a level 2 quest like this possibly be completed at the appropriate level? Unless the quest itself changes according to PC levels?

Then again, now that I think of it, its probably more like viridian city gym. Undertaking the quest was never really possible until appropriate progression was unlocked.
