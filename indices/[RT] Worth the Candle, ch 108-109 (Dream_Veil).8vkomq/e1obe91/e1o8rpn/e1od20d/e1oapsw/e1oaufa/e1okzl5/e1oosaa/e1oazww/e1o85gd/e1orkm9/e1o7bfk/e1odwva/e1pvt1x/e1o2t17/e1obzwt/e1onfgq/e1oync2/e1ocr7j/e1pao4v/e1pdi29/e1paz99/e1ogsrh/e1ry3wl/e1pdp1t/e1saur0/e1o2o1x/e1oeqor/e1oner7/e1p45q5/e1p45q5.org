Not for these chapters, but in early chapters, sometimes you say 'Fuchsia' and other times you say 'Fuschia'. The former is the correct spelling.

As a bit of trivia, the colour is named after the fuchsia plant, which according to Wikipedia took its name from the 16th century German botanist Leonhart Fuchs. So it might have to be a coincidence that the same colour has the same name on Aerb.
