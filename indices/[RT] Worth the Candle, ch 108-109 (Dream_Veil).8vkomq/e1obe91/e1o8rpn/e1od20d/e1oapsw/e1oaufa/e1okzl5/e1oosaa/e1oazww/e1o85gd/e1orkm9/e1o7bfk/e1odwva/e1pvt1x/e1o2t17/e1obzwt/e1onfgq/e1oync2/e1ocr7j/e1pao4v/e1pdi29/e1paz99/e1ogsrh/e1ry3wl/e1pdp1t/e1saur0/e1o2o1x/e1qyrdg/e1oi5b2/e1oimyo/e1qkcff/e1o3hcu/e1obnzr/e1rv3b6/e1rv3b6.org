its breaking my heart, arthur is the villain...

i mean of course hes the villain, but...still. i wanted them to be best bros, or for uther to be party member #7, but...no...he thinks aerb is fake and thus worthless (ignoring the compatibility of the virtual and the real) and either is going to be an antagonist on aerb, or made a deal with the dm (who im like 90% sure is straight up alexander wales) to switch places with juniper.

and i mean arthur's had centuries to think about all this stuff so itll be all too easy to convince joon, and itll be all to easy for him to be so set in his thinking that joon could never ever convince him
