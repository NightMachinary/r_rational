He has a pretty understandable viewpoint though. Arthur, both from his perspective and Joon's, attracted countless horrors that threatened the world.

It's very believable that someone would notice that, and the fact that the threats petered off after Arthur left, and be very leery of a successor popping up and starting the cycle again.

Honestly, he might be doing the world a favor by killing Joon. The DM has promised that he won't railroad Joon, but Masters doesn't know that, and the DM has already shown just staying idle isn't really an option for him.

On another note, he mentioned he wasn't sure if Arthur could lose, and noted that despite winning every time, and talking about fate and narratives, he nonetheless /always/ seemed to give situations his all. Maybe his low-key demand for information was an attempt to bypass whatever factor let the chosen one always win, by making Joon not try very hard to escape?
