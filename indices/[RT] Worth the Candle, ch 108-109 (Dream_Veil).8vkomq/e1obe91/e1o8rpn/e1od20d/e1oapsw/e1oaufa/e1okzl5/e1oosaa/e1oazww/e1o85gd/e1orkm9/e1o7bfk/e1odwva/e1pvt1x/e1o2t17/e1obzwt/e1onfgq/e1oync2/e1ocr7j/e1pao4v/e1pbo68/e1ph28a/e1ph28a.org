I think Master figured out Joon was using soul sight, because he couldn't see Val and the Master correctly identified what Val was. One way out is if Joon can gain access to illusion magic he might be able to level up fast enough to start seeing through the illusions.

But this might be a challenge Joon is not meant to defeat. It happens in DMing. Joon got this quest at L2 when he would have had zero chance.
