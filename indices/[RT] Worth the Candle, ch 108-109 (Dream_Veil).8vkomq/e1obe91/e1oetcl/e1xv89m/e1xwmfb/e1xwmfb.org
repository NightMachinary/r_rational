Yeah, but she also said that if you start looking at Uther's work as a whole, you start noticing how weird it is that he made so many different works in genres so far apart, with almost nothing in common, and usually the stories would fit Earth's culture better than Aerb. Especially since Uther's works would be the only ones that would pop up as almost direct equivalents.

(eg Star Wars being written in an era full of pulp science-fiction movies and stories)

If nothing else, the "Star Wars"-"dream skewered" connection would be better known.
