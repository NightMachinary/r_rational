We know Amaryllis learned it from a machine that was endlessly repeating it, safe because 'everyone involved' was long since dead. The people who set that up probably heard the name when someone else said it and they were lucky enough (40% chance for a single utterance) that the cannibal didn't show up.

Repeat going back until you find yourself asking how people found out the infohazard in the first place. They didn't know it was a name, which rules out a few possible origins, but it could be that someone wrote it down, then died, and then someone read it, took it home, said it, and died. From there it isn't hard to see how people could figure out what was going on, after enough trial and error.
