I doubt they would 'know' Star Wars and the rest originated from Earth. The simplest explanation is that things that are 'real' on Aerb manifested inside the dream for those people. This is even explicitly theorized about early in the story- joon says that he recognizes parts of Aerb as things he made, and Amaryllis suggests he instead imagined 'real' Aerbian things inside his dream.
