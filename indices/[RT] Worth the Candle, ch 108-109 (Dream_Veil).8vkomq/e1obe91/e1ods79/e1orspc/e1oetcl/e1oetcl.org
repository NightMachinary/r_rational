Not necessarily. There was strong evidence that there was no dream-skewered who'd lived past the eighties (else everyone would know that Star Wars came from Earth). There was moderate evidence that there was no dream-skewered from after World War II, hence the lack of electronics, or that nobody before Joon noticed that the world they were in seemed pretty similar to Tolkien-inspired fantasy.

But there could have been a collection of dream-skewered from all over Earth, from different time periods. In fact, it would have been more surprising if all dream-skewered had come from the same country and time.
