Worrying thought. If the library suggests that the world ends in 5 years, could it be that instead of some apocalyptic event that Joon just finishes the campaign at that time? No more adventures, means the DM stops writing the story.

That or in 5 years everyone just switches to Kindles (yep, probably just eBooks. Nothing to worry about guys).

Side note: I loved Fenn and Joon confusing each other by talking about the animated/live-action transformers movies respectively.
