Now I'm paranoid that Val left with the group, and Master simply didn't drop the the illusion concealing her. I don't think that she was forced to leave the room the party was in since:

- Val is an out of context problem between her immunity to most magic/poison/conventional weapons and her martial prowess. To take her down you'd need to prepare a specific counter before hand, (or be lucky enough to have something on hand, which is possible with access to Uther's vault)

- Master seemed to be trying to avoid harming Joon's companions since he potentially valued Joon's cooperation, further complicating any attempt to take down Val.

- What ever Master potentially had set up which could have dealt with Val, would also have to also be ineffective at preventing the deaf and blind party from escaping.

This leaves two possibilities, Val left voluntarily (possibly to chase Master), or she didn't leave the room until Solace opened the portal (I don't think she's invisible next to Joon since that seems like it would prevent Joon from getting the achievement).
