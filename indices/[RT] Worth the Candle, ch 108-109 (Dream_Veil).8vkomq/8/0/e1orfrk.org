Same. Kinda mindblowing, too, as I tend to spend some half hour after every new update basking in the joy of knowing there's more WtC for me to read later, when I feel like it. I usually wish to extend this interval more, but then curiosity catches up and I'm fucked for another ten days.

Speaking of which, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]], If you're reading this, it probably means I'm dead, the map to the lost city is inside the globe in my library. But that's beside the point. I just wanted to let you know that I've seen how people are sometimes incredibly, unreasonably and unduly assholes to you and WtC on A3O, and you should just ignore them. But you said that you aren't able, so maybe it will lift you up to hear that I know you do amazing work, you got great talent, and I keep the last chapter of WtC always open in another tab in order to refresh it with what is frankly an insane rate. Don't stop being awesome.

P.s., I think there's a fair chance some small percentage of my money will inexplicably find itself on your patreon account, as soon as I earn enough to buy my own food.
