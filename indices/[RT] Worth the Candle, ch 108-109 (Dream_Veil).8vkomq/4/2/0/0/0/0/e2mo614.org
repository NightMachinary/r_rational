I am Russian and I strongly suspect that the term discussed is попаданец, which doesn't have any "self" implications in the first place. It's just that there's no separate term (that I can think of) for self-inserts specifically.

Попаданцы actually tend to be dropped into past even more often than into fantastical worlds.
