  Awww, but I like the idea of an institutions dedicated to studying SI characters!

Yeah, I did too. I spent some (probably too much) time on a version of the chapter that preserved that, but it hadn't been part of the master plan, and in the end it seemed too much like me trying to have fun with a side concept that didn't add too much to the story. Not that I'm averse to that, but it wasn't pulling its weight.

I think the idea I liked the most was that of second generation dream-skewered who had been born into Earth culture but only known a life on Aerb ... but that would be hard to slot into the narrative in a compelling way, and there's no reason that I can't just do that as its own separate story.
