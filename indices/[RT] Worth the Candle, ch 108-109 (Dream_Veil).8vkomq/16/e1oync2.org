Did someone say they miss the paranoia from the Fallatehr arc?

I'd bet a gram of gold that that achievement was a bit of sly DM trickery and Joon isn't really /alone/ except in the narrative sense since only he can break the illusion. I'm working off the suspicion that Masters figured out Joon's soul sight (or simply applied the illusion on every level he knows) because it seemed unlikely that Solace suddenly pulled portal-making out of her rump when she previously mentioned a tree and Masters questioned it.

If true, this suggests illusionism and social fu (ability to imitate voices convincingly) is a frightening combo. Depending on how fast Masters can process different people talking in real-time and falsify a version more fitting for his purposes, you'd be completely unable to follow the true conversation, especially if he's letting in-character "real" responses slip through to muddy the waters. Going over the conversation (if my theory's true), there's quite a few lines near the end that could've been fudged before everyone got the illusion of Solace making a portal and Joon "saw" his party jumping through. Masters might be powerful enough to create an entire scene in his exclusion zone (which now that I think about it, might be why he had no choice but to do Uther's bidding after 20 years).

  Speculation and Scrutiny was, in many respects, the junk drawer of the athenaeum system. They were the â€˜hey, that's weird ...' athenaeum, the place that studied all those little bits and bobs that people wanted to fully understand.

Why does it feel there's a lot of Uniquities solicitation for Spec grads?
