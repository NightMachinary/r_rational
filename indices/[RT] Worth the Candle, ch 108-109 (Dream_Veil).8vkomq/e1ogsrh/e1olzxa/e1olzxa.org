  If it's the first, that's a lot of power to give the kingdom that hosts each Athenaum, and would make it harder for farther flung nations to send people for training.

This is alluded to in ch 37:

  This was then backed up by the athenaeums wielding their power against the various polities of the empire when they tried to defect from ‘sensible' intellectual property laws and/or certification schemes. Most of the athenaeums had scholarships and departments devoted to placement of their students, which meant that there was a carrot labeled ‘we'll pay your young people to come here' and a stick labeled ‘we won't send you graduated mages', but with a lather of diplomacy on top of that basic reality. On top of that, most of the athenaeums were filthy rich and nearly nations in their own right, which meant that they could (and did) use all of the standard tactics that corporations used on Earth, like pumping money into politics, having people write editorials complaining about a politician or policy, filing lawsuits, or doing other things like that.

Essentially, travel (and in some cases, tuition) is often paid for by the athenaeums as a way of leveling the playing field and giving greater justification for why they should remain the primary places of learning for their particular field.

The relationship between an athenaeum and a kingdom is often more like that of a giant factory and a small town; the factory is good for the town, but it's also got much more muscle than the town does, and their relationship can sometimes be a little on the abusive side ... if it's not just a case of the athenaeum being the one in direct control of the kingdom.
