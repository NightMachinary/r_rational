I'm a little sad we didn't get to see and probably will never see ACTUAL CANNIBAL SHIA LEBEOUF in Aerb. I mean, when Masters started listing off actors, I did not know why but I thought it might be back on! Then, nope, 180^{^{o}} to a similarly satisfying plot-related turn of events.

I'd love to see some in-universe horror-comedy mix, and I have a feeling our beloved author would pull it off well.

Maybe the cannibal could make an appearance in an April Fools chapter or something of the sort?
