I'm not sure if the timeline actually works for this (I don't think the story so far contradicts it, but I haven't carefully fact-checked) but I'm currently wondering if a lot of the events that happened after Arthur's death in the real world happened on Aerb during the period where Arthur was active. It requires shenanigans with the passage of time, but we already know that those happened given the much longer time gap on Aerb than on Earth.

If so, a lot of the nonstop shit that Arthur had to deal with was drawn from Joon's campaigns during his self-destructive period, and Joon is (unintentionally) responsible for a lot of Arthur's decline.
