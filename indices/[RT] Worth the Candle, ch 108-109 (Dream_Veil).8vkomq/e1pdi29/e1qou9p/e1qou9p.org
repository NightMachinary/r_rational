joon might be the DM since those notes are on his legal pad in his handwriting. meaning this all takes place in the future and he's playing with his younger self.

this world is probably a simulation, meaning joon and arthur could just be simulated recreations of their earth minds and bodies. any reason to think this isn't happening thousands or billions of years post arthur's death?

i guess...it just seems so unlikely for them to have been transported rather than copied. it already seems like the DM has the power to create people and modify their memories, goals, etc.
