I am so excited for solo mode! I think this is just the thing this story has needed for some time now . I don't think Arthur had gamer powers similar to Juniper's, he could just learn stuff 140 times faster?( That would be a rough estimate given the information that he could learn a new language in a day), also, when Juniper managed to break the illusion with soul sight Masters didn't understand how he managed it given that he couldn't at the beginning, which may implies that Arthur couldn't make modifications to his skills on the fly as well?

So Arthur basically told Juniper that he doesn't believe Aerb is real? he saw the people closet to him as NPCs?
