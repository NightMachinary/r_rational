I remember there was [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject][a lesswrong post where people shared their favorite textbooks]]. You could use that together with your favorite pirate site to get all the course material you need.

The post is a little old so it might be out of date. But your teachers sound like just the sort of lazy bastards who would teach the same thing over and over for years, so you probably won't miss out too much if you use old books, especially for a math course.
