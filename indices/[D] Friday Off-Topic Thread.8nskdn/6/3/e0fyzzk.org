As someone who have done an undergrad both in Denmark and in the States there's a huge difference on this specific point. In the states part of the grade was on attendance exactly. In Denmark on the other hand, it is required that all material are available online such that people can study at home if they learn better that way and attendance is optional.

I and my small country find your request quite reasonable.
