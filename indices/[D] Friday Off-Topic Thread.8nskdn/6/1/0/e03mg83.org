Hey, teachers who go on tangents are cool!

But yeah, teachers often have this thing where the best teaching methods they could use conflict with the teaching methods where they have the most involvement, so they end up doing something bastardized between the two extremes.

I've spent a few years in a project oriented coding school where we were free to learn everything at our own pace, schedule our own hours and decide how we would tackle project however we felt (within project-based bounds like "use this programming paradigm for this project"), and my first year there felt life-changing.
