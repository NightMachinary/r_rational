Is it unreasonable to ask for for all your undergrad course material(?) so you can study outside of class, review it by yourself, have it handy instead of tediously going to class, copying it and the such.

I've asked for it and was denied. I was even told that in the 10 years with about 950 undergrads yearly nobody even asked for that, which in retrospect seems unlikely. Why wouldn't any student want to have the whole material nice and orderly? Maybe it's a better question to ask why the teachers don't want to teach?

Do note that I have some gripes with education coming from my own experiences, so maybe I'm not being reasonable here.. but.. can anyone tell me why not? I've asked around in my class, and was told that it's in order to get you to pay money, but my best counter to that was "brand dilution". I guess there's also the whole capitalistic competition too, but mentioning that feels like going to a party at a minefield.

Other possibilities are that I've chosen a bad school (my algorithm was basically "closest thing to home") or that I just suck. Admittedly I do have little enthusiasm for this course. I'm also feeling a bit cranky/ranty while writing this, and kind of feel lonely in having this opinion, while simultaneously feeling like everything I say is a (silly/unreasonable) complaint.

EDIT: it's a math course, if it matters.
