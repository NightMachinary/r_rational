Wait, what do you mean, you don't have access to your course material out of class? Don't they give you / sell you math books and stuff? Are you supposed to prepare for exams exclusively by reading your own notes?

If so, yeah, that sounds like a really shitty system to me. I don't know whether these practices are common where you study (I know they aren't in France), but it does seem really unhelpful.
