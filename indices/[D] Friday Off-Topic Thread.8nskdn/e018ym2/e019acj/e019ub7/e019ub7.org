They sell math books, and use the exercises in them for homework. So you do get some exercise, but the course material is given to you /only/ while in the class, so you have to come to class, copy it down, do the homework, I'd say it's pretty similar to high school. Buying the books from them kind of feels like a ripoff, honestly.

What I (ideally) wanted to get was a list of subjects, information about the sub-subjects (algebra -> subject within algebra, etc) and probably some exercises about them. Basically, give me the material the teachers have, which they then teach you.

By the way, do you think I'm being unreasonable? Can you give any criticism? I'm thinking I'm being too unreasonable here for some reason but can't discern /why/. Maybe I should have put more effort rather than be lazy two thirds in, but.. I dunno. Maybe I'm in one of those "no matter how hard you'll try it's not gonna work" situations. Sorry if it's a a weird question -- I've been trying to correct my self-centeredness and I'd hate to miss a potential improvement.

I live in Israel -- not sure if that matters.
