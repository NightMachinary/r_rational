I'm probably not the best person to ask, since I hate all forms of bureaucracy, and I especially hate institutionalized education like the kind you're describing (especially especially schools that sell you their course materials in the era of wikipedia).

But yeah, it sounds like you're getting scammed. Do the math books they sell you not include the background needed to solve the exercises? Most high-school-type course books I'm familiar with are 25% lessons 75% homework.

Anyway, if the teachers aren't willing to give you the course material, you could try to find it online, but it's harder if they don't give you a lit of subject (what does the course syllabus even include?); you can also try to find another student of a later year and ask to borrow their notes, or even just a list of subjects.

But yeah, you're not unreasonable for wanting to learn at your own pace; school is just a shithole of a creativity grinder that is strongly incentivized to give you as little personal freedom in the way you learn as possible. No offense meant to any teacher or school administrator reading this.
