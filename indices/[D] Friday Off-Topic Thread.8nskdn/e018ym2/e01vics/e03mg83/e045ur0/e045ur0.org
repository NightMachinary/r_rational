It was somewhat frustrating when you were trying to find out what we were meant to do on the deliberately vague assignment (because the /real world/ doesn't always provide you a mark scheme).

"Dr Professor, do you have a moment?"

"Yes, but I'm very busy and important. It will have to be quick."

"Are we meant to bamboozle the widget or merely perturb it?"

"I remember when I first bamboozled a widget, one of my colleagues lost a finger. Did you know the the hospitals in 19th century Russia..."
