Oh God, this takes me back.

It drove me /crazy/ how many of our lecturers believed that learning was some kind of emergent property of us writing notes in a lecture room, rather than thinking: "How can I most efficiently transfer knowledge to these people".

We had one lecturer who would hand write notes on an overhead projector, leaving us to copy them down. I would have to tell him to move the page up every minute because he'd go off to screen.

And giving us practice questions, would be like /telling/ us the answers to the exam!

Another guy didn't provide us any practice problems, even though his predecessor had created quite a few, and the slides were identical to his (luckily I got them on the black market).

The /head of teaching/ was the worst. He made a big deal about how he wanted to avoid being "the Sage on the Stage" and ended up spending most of his time going off on tangents and telling anecdotes.
