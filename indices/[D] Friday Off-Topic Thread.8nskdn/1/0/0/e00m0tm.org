  Write a really good story in a really popular fandom.
#+end_quote

I'm really thinking more along the lines of, "write a really pandering story in a really popular fandom."

My one chapter, half-assed worm/naruto crossover oneshot has almost as many favorites as the story I put effort into for an unpopular fandom. I'm not /that/ bitter about it, because I did know going in that the fandom I wanted to write for wasn't hugely active, but I am a little bitter.
