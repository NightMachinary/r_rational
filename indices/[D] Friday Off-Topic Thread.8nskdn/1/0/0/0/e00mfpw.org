The problem with pandering is that people only come for the pandering, and if they're not pandered to, there's no reason for them to read anything else. Whereas if they come for the quality, themes, characterization, etc., then they might go seeking out other stuff. Fandom gets them introduced to you, other stuff keeps them reading. In theory, at least.
