Part of what sucks about ff.net is that communities are nearly exclusively focused on the work they're centered around. This is, in the vast majority of cases, pretty sensible, but compared to the system [[/r/rational]] (or SB/SV) have, it makes writing a story in a relatively inactive fandom daunting. Even if your potential audience is pretty large as a share of the people on the website interested in what you're writing, the vast majority of this audience simply isn't going to be continuously checking a mostly dead section. For example, I have no doubt that there group "people who check the Re:zero section" is only a very small fraction of the group "people on ff.net who would enjoy reading a Re:zero fanfic."

Having a large amount of people who follow you as an author is a way around that. Those people will see what you write, and while they won't necessarily want to follow it, it's still a signficant amount of additional traffic.

*So lets say I wanted to get as many author-follows on ff.net as possible. how would I do that?*

With the caveat that author-follows are only useful insofar as they get people who'd read what I /actually/ want to write to see those works when they otherwise wouldn't.
