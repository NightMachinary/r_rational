So two updates from me. First I'm in the process of moving to San Francisco. I'll have to see how that goes and report back. While on planes and hiking around the city I've also been listening to /Enlightenment Now/ by Steven Pinker and really enjoying it. Once I get more settled I'd like to read it in addition to listening. What have others thought about the book? I think he under states the potential for catastrophic danger. In particular, he argues that since modern technology takes a great number of people to develop the potential for dooms day weapons is small. I think that while this might be true about developing this type of technology it's getting easier and easier to do extreme damage with just information and information is really hard to contain especially when it took a large group of people to develop. The reason the Russians were able to build a nuke so quickly was because American scientists gave them the info they needed.
