1. Write a really good story in a really unpopular fandom.
2. Write a really good story in a really popular fandom.
3. At the end of the popular fandom story, link to the story in the unpopular fandom, citing similarities in them, and subtly or not-so-subtly nudging people to go check that other story out, or explain that you don't write for fandoms, you write for the story.
4. Post in places like [[/r/rational]] that are less concerned with individual fandoms.

I'm not actually sure that would work though, needs testing.
