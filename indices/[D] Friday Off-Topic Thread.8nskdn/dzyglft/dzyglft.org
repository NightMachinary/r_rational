I'm going to be in San Francisco for grad school again, come late August, and a conversation earlier this week made me realize that I could ask around on the thread here to see if anyone knows someone who might be interested in renting out a (very small) space.

Almost everything that I own is in self-storage, and it'll stay that way, so all that I really need is a couch (or, to be honest, a floor: I can sleep fine on that too). I'll be on campus for most of the day and will be entirely absent (e.g. won't even be back wherever I'm staying) at least three nights out of the week.

A place to put some clothes and the opportunity to shower in the morning would each be a plus, but are not necessary: there are showers and lockers on campus, which is how I managed to get by last semester (when I didn't have a place at all).

Doing something similar with AirBnB would cost me $600/month but that obviously comes with additional amenities that I'm not looking for, so I'm hoping to find someone who'd be interested in making some extra cash for the minimalist setup that I described above. ~$400/month would be optimal, and is in line with what I've found by plugging in average SF rents into couchsurfing calculators.
