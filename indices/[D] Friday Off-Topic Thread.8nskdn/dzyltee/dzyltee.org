Recently I've been thinking about the way thoughts are formed and expressed. I haven't gone into much detail because I am not very knowledgeable about neuroscience or anything related to that. So you can stop reading this if you're expecting something informative instead of just some dude rambling.

But more specifically, I was thinking about how my thoughts are almost always expressed in my head as words. And not just words, but complete sentences. I don't know how common or uncommon that is, but I have heard anecdotal accounts that some people don't think this way. That instead they just think more in line with abstract concepts and images, rather than constantly forcing their thoughts into the structure of words.

It occurred to me, that maybe fully forming my thoughts into words was actually holding me back in some respects. Because I have a tendency to repeat the same lines of thought over and over again, sometimes looking for mistakes in grammar or searching for the perfect words to express the meaning I'm looking for. But since these thoughts are completely internal that seems like a complete waste of time.

So as an (informal) experiment I decided to try my best to stop myself from thinking with words and instead just try to use concepts to express my thoughts.

That didn't really work. I think thinking in words is too far ingrained into my consciousness to complete do away with. But I was able to stop myself from constantly repeating and trying to perfect my internal dialogue. It takes a bit of concentration (almost like a meditative thing) but I'm able to stop the repetition and sort of cut myself off from finishing sentences when I already know how they're going to end. (Note: sorry if that makes no sense. It's kind of like... there's this louder voice in my head that repeats my thoughts after they've been focused into complete sentences. And this smaller voice that is actually forming those sentences. I've kinda figured out how to shut up the louder voice before it's done, so long as the smaller voice understands the meaning of what that sentence was going to end up being... hopefully this note didn't make it more confusing)

As a result of this, my thoughts tend to be faster. I'm quicker to switch away from subjects, instead of dwelling on them after all relevant information has already been considered. And the most surprising result has been that my breathing seems to flow a lot more naturally when I'm not constantly replaying my thoughts in my head in order to form them into full sentences.

It seems as if normally I have been subconciously linking my breathing up to the internal dialogue in my head. I take breaths at the moments when I would usually be taking breaths while talking. But when doing this experiment, I've found that I just breathe at regular intervals without any conscious thought. And it's surprisingly quite relaxing. I didn't even realize I was doing it... but apparently thinking about your breathing is kind of stressful in comparison.

There are downsides to me thinking like this as well though. The main one being that I don't seem to be able to remember things as well. For example if I try to read while doing this my recall of what I'm reading takes a hit. I seem rely on that instinctual repetition to remember things. Also, my mind naturally slips back into its old pattern of thinking if I don't pay enough attention to my thoughts, so it takes constant reminders to continue thinking this way.

My overall take away is that I'm wasting a lot of "mental energy" with the way that I normally think. And to some degree I'm probably stressing myself out trying to make sure my thoughts are full sentences before they're fully formed.

So if you read all this, I'm curious: do you also think in complete sentences, or are your thoughts more abstract? And if you do think in complete sentences do you also find yourself repeating words and phrases over and over in your mind trying to "perfect" them?

If you don't think in complete sentences, could you try and describe what your thought process is like? I'd be interested in knowing how other people's thoughts differ from my own. Though I imagine it would be hard to put into words.
