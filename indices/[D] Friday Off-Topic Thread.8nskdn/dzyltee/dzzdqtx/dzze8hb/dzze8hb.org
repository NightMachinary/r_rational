I wonder if after a while your brain would adjust and it would be just as natural for you as speaking in English.

I also wonder if you were completely immersed in the Afrikaans languange where it was all you used to talk to other people and you became fluent, would your brain naturally switch to thinking in Afrikaans without you deliberately forcing it? Or would you always have that slight translation lag regardless?

Interesting stuff.
