The impression I get is that my brain would adjust over time - and with increased fluency in Afrikaans. I suspect that, if I were for some reason completely prevented from thinking in English and forced to use Afrikaans, then I'd probably be able to think almost as swiftly in Afrikaans as I currently can in English within a week - simply due to learning to reorder my thoughts into the right order (though there would still be a vocabulary lag until my Afrikaans vocabulary catches up). Mind you, I haven't actually tested this.

If I was immersed in Afrikaans completely, then I'd start out with a translation lag on both my hearing and my speaking - I think I'd soon start thinking in Afrikaans once I became sufficiently fluent simply because when I talk, I'm thinking about what I'm saying, so if I talk in Afrikaans a lot then the option will be there and if I hear a lot of Afrikaans then there will be a point at which it's just easier to reply without ever translating it out of Afrikaans in my head.

What I found more interesting, though, was how it gave me a glimpse of a layer /underneath/ the internal voice. There were /unvoiced/ thoughts in my head - it was like pulling up the corner of a tapestry and seeing the clockwork behind it. There's something going on in there, under/below/behind the conscious level, and that 'something' is somehow an integral part of how my mind works... and until I tried this experiment, I didn't even realise it was there. It's a bit like what you said about the louder voice and the smaller voice, except without the smaller voice; there /are/ raw concepts in there, they're just not (directly) available at the user level.
