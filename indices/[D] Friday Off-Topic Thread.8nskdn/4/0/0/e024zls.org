  That was a pretty boring excerpt, am I missing something?

It's an amusing (yet logical) counter to a common hero argument about self-sacrifice, that I hadn't seen before. Maybe the last line isn't as clear as it could've been?

If the point of self-sacrifice is to make it clear you don't consider yourself special and privileged just because you're important, then once you've signalled this (by credibly volunteering), you shouldn't actually go through with it.

  Also, what is a glowfic, why are they an acquired taste, and why is it not worth acquiring?
#+end_quote

A glowfic is a kind of rational-adjacent roleplay (frequently involving crossover fanfiction). Historically it derives from Alicorn's rationalfic [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] (itself inspired by HPMOR). It's usually two characters being delightfully reasonable at each other while not much else goes on plot-wise for pages and pages.

It is generally not worth diving into because it's very long, of variable quality, with a considerable amount of "filler", and with characters that are completely overpowered for their challenges. It is optimised for exploring personal interactions, not advancing plot in a satisfying manner, and that's not going to be for everyone.
