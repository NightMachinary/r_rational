My speculation is that our conscious mind /is/ linguistics... that it evolved as the compression algorithm required to turn reality into stories in order to communicate complex experience and become the profoundly social beings we are today.

So yes, when I'm consciously thinking it tends to be in complete sentences because I'm essentially rehearsing what I'd say if I tried to explain my thoughts to someone else. When I'm working on something complex with my hands - playing the piano, say, or practicing sleight of hand - my thoughts aren't verbal. They're frequently spatial or structural. They're also very difficult to communicate without doing some dedicated, verbal thinking: maybe if I used this finger, maybe if the wrist bent that way, maybe if my hand tilted so. The actual experience isn't verbal at all.

I wouldn't call those behaviors and efforts "unconscious" exactly, but it's really an entirely different system which I can choose to consciously analyze but don't strictly /need/ to in order to get better at those tasks. In fact, it's usually slower and less fun to interrupt it with linguistic processing.

But I'm limited in how much I can teach, learn from, or collaborate with someone else unless I do.
