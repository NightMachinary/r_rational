I totally know what you mean :) I think this is a skill that can be developed with practice, and that this is some of what's going on with some kinds of meditation.

I think it's relaxing to deliberately be nonverbal sometimes - like how sometimes I lay down and close my eyes for a few minutes after being awake for most of the day, and at first I'll feel like my visual system is still wound tight with activity, amping up the contrast on minor variations in the shade of black. But then after a few minutes that feeling goes away, and I can get up and feel a lot more refreshed.

The time it's easiest for me to act on the "pre-full-sentence thoughts" is simply when I'm busy with something else, but usually that's not quite what I mean.
