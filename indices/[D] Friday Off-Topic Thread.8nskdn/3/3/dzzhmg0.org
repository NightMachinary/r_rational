I know exactly what you mean with continuing a sentence even though the idea is already complete in my head. I tried to stop myself from thinking in words when meditating, but the process seemed to go deeper and deeper and I felt I was far from the root of the issue. I haven't spent too long on it, so I won't be much help, but it's nice to hear that someone else also thinks the same way!
