I'm a Frenchman who's been living in the UK for a while, and my thought processes have almost entirely shifted to English. Granted, the difference between the two languages is a lot smaller.

I do a lot of internal thinking in the form of "communication", me trying to explain a thought to an imaginary (and usually silent) person. So I complete sentences, and sometimes even repeat myself to try and find a more elegant phrasing. I don't think I want to drop the habit anyway; I find it aesthetically pleasing.

Speed reading is using a tool that forces you to read faster than your inner voice can keep up with, thus presumably saving time. [[http://spritzinc.com/][(Try various speeds here.)]] It is indeed possible to vastly outpace your inner voice and still process ideas (though not as well, says research).
