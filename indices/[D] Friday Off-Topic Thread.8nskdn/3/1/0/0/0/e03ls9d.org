That's fun when it happens.

Something I notice: most of the English I hear and read is American TV shows, action movies and web fiction, often medieval-fantasy or superhero stories; and most of the French I hear and speak is for social activity.

So now, when I think about social things I tend to think in French, but when I'm pissed or when I think about action movie stuff I tend to think in English.
