  But more specifically, I was thinking about how my thoughts are almost always expressed in my head as words. And not just words, but complete sentences.

Yep. My thoughts are the same. Stream-of-consciousness narration, mostly (with /very/ occasional image as illustrations).

Incidentally, I tried an experiment once that you might be interested in hearing about. Now, the narration in my head is in English, this being my first language - but I can speak another language (Afrikaans). For purposes of this experiment, there are two important things to bear in mind: (1) My Afrikaans is passable but not great; and (2) Afrikaans and English have a different word order (specifically, Afrikaans is a subject-object-verb language as opposed to English's subject-verb-object).

So, I tried thinking /only/ in Afrikaans for a while. It was... odd. My mind was still preparing the thoughts in subject-verb-object order, even as I was forcing my internal voice to use subject-object-verb order - there was a distinct sensation of some parts of the thought getting prepared in advance and then having to wait until their part of the sentence came around. (Also, having to continually stop and remember the word for X slowed my thoughts down quite a bit).
