Wish I could, but while I'm moving to the area I both have a very small area and a rental agreement that wouldn't allow it.

What are you doing for school though? Honestly there is very little that would convince me to go to San Francisco after looking for housing here for the past week. Everything's just so expensive. Especially compared to Ohio where I'm from.
