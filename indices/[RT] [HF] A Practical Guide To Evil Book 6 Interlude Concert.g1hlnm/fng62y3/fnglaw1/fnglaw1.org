The power level makes a difference. Rogue took out a Count, but now Rogue and the Artificer are having problems with a Lord, Archer fights off a Baroness here, Hakram and his squad take out a Duke, a Duchess, a Countess, a number of regulars and at least some part of the Prince's power...

Cat took out a count or a baron on her way down, two barons/lords /(titled, but not great)/, then another count on her lonesome.

So yes, the power level here is much higher.
