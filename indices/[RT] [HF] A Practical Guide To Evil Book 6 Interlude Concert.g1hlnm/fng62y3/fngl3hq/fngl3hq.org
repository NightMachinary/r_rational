Well, You have weak Heroes with a weak story overmatched by very strong foes, with no army to back them up. Mirrorknight's group had second and third raters as magi, no priests, no leader. Hakram of two books ago wouldn't have been able to slay a Duke of the fey. Roland's group had a spellthief (perhaps without magic) and an artificer.
