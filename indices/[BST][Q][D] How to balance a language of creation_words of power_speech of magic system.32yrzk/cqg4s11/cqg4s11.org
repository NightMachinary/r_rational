Things to read:

1. The /Young Wizards/ series.
2. Anything by David Eddings.

In the Young Wizards books, anyone can learn the Speech. Wizards are granted Enacture by various Powers. The Speech is simply an utterly unambiguous language that was used to describe the universe into existence. Anyone can use it, including to make untrue statements. Enacture allows you to repeat the 'description becomes truth' trick /at a cost/. There are aspects of True Names, more complete descriptions are better, a wizard lying every (in any language) is /very unwise/, etc. Higher Powers are a core part of the setting, both the benevolent, the unsafe (all of them, really), and That One we don't refer to. Every culture has a story about it, though.

David Eddings has written the same story a few times now, and it's almost reverse-fanfic where it gets better each time. /Eragon/'s magic system is a transparent ripoff of this, just as it uses Pern's dragons and LotR's setting. Magic allows you to do things, but the cost is energy required to do it without magic. Draw on too much, and you die.

General principles:

- Native speakers will have a reputation for being incredibly twisty. They're not being sneaky - you just get very very good at omission and meaninglessly precise and qualified statements.
- Things get a lot easier when you can avoid any statements that have an effect on the universe.
- It's better to have it rely on the power and knowledge of the speaker than a cosmic listner/atlantean magic engine/etc. Consider: "Every human is happy". Does it work correctly, work incorrectly, throw an error, or do nothing? What about "This sentence has the best possible effect"?

You also want to be very precise in definitions. Does =that house is on fire=

- Set the house on fire? This would typically require an imperative phrase...
- No-op, because it isn't?
- Never get spoken, unless you believe it to be true?
- Never get spoken, unless it /is/ true?

Get around the munchkins by having something ironic preempt false statements. After the first few dozen scientists have premonitions of DOOM//do not mess with Truth//heart attacks/labs explode/etc trying to say variations on "$hypothesis is true"... 1.5 bits per human life could deliver some interesting info, but it's not trivial to use.
