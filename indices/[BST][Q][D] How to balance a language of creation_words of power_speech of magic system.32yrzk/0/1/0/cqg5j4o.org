"Jane thinks dogs are dangerous."

So in Muran, you can't actually say that. You can say "dogs are dangerous", but you can't have a sentence nested within another sentence like that. English can do this to arbitrary degrees - "Jane thought Fred said Mary had proven dogs are dangerous."

Edit: I should note that this, like a number of features of Piraha, is incredibly contentious among linguists. There are only three hundred or so people who speak Piraha, and only a very small handful of academics who study it.
