Just to add to this discussion, my cognitive science teacher told his class that ambiguity is an inherent feature in all languages, because to be precise requires including so much information that a random sentence starts to look like a lawyer's contract. Therefore, languages evolved to take the advantage of background information two speakers with a common language have to minimize the amount of necessary information. Any language without ambiguity would be more like a programming language instead of a natural language.

TL;DR - Ambiguity allows us to say only the needed information for quick communication (1 sentence vs. five paragraphs) and the listener resolves the ambiguity with common background knowledge. Any language without ambiguity is not a natural language.
