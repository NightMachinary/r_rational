You might set it up so that the language only takes effect when you /fully/ describe the phenomenon, and this is often hard to do. So you can't just say "That house is on fire", because the language slices reality in non-human patterns, and therefore has no concept of 'house'. Similarly, it can't condense the idea of the house burning into the simple phrase 'on fire'. Instead, you have to deliver a long-winded statement that precisely selects the chunk of reality that is burning, what exactly burning means for the various materials, maybe put some constraints on it about how the system evolves over time. And getting any of these things wrong causes the effect to fail.

So basically it becomes really hard to speak the language precisely without being close to omniscient. As a result, the only 'spells' that work are long chants with very clearly defined effects. The caster has to memorize the whole thing, and learn various mental tricks for making systematic changes. For example, you learn a fireball spell, and then you need to learn various tricks for telling it to go in a specific direction, possibly involving pulling out a compass or a sextant or something, and then adjusting your speech accordingly.

...I just realized that my whole post is simply reinventing Rick Cook's /Wizardry/ series, where a programmer finds himself in such a world and writes an interpreter (based on Forth, of all languages) to help him do spells that no one imagined possible. Maybe you should check that out instead.
