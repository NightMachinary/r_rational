I'v got so much on my plate right now, but my best work is often the random off the cuff stuff I pen up at random so we will see.

In particular I'm kind of interested in the experience and dynamic of a world where people have been struggling with to utilize these 'words of god' or whatever and then a native speaker just ends up being discovered/drops into the situation and the social and dramatic ramifications of such a being who is besides their voice being overwhelmingly potent and their knowledge of the spells greater and more intuitive then any other they are just 'some guy' by any other standards.
