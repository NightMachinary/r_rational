Hum, I love the ramifications answer, thanks for all the thoughts that's really wonderful and I hope it was fun writing it out.

I really like the more inherent poetry that seems to be suggested by your paradox loopiness.

I'm thinking maybe people have a kind of 'sense in their mouth' or 'in their mind' of when their approaching a statement that will be dangerous or kill them. Also the removal of negation is really a fun culling of language flexibility that I find interesting and it does resolve a lot of things potentially.

The whimsy of the magic is quite nice and I think you catch onto a really useful thing which is having proper nouns be really sparse and you have to sort of assemble a description instead to target things.
