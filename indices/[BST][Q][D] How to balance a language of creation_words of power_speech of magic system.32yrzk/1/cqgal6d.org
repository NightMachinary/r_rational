Make it a self-resolving paradox. A sort of living, quickfire, self-made prophecy system with an X factor. The use of it would be intuitive, but hard to study by those not initiated in the codex. Those who use it pull remembered words into weird phrases, with odd translations given after the fact that hint at a communications system made by beings not at all human. A dead language now spoken best by those people with a certain skill or talent, invoking impossible-seeming "magic" or altering probability, but only allowing one to speak in that language the literal truth of reality as it is and will be.

Not everyone can say everything that is true, as they'll screw up the syntax or maybe just not have the intuitive grasp of the language to even say if the coffee in their cup is hot when it clearly seems to be. It is truly "magic" in this way, and hard (though not impossible) to experiment with so casually. Sometimes, the language itself seems capricious, almost as if it actively resists those most interested in scientific poking. The language seems to "like" some people more than others, too, and different people find it easier to use in different ways.

The point is, you can't just try to say things all day to see if they're true. The statements just eventually all stall out, even things clearly true, your tongue unable to form the syllables. And if you try to say something that isn't true and can't seem to be made true by your abilities, and you really force it, you'll not just stall, you'll outright fail to say it properly, the words forming a garbled mess of noise. And then you'll die.

And then what the dead idiot tried to say still either is or is not, does or doesn't happen. Hard to say what a failed phrase even does in that case. Maybe a determined mind giving up their life for an impossibility sometimes works. Maybe it would have happened anyway or was already true, but they just got the mystical grammar subtly wrong while stubbornly forcing it. Or the "living" but unchangeable language itself really hated that person. Or they accidentally said one of the rumored "death phrases" that just burn out your brain.

Point is, unless you unironically prefer Romeo and Juliet as a model for your relationship, don't scream out in Enochian (or whatever) with all your heart that "she is still alive!" the moment your girlfriend /seems/ to bite it, eh?

--------------

Functionally, this would be a language that is literally proscriptive over reality, and paradoxically by reality as well. You can only say true things and cast true spells. Say, "fire hits them." Very rarely, or with a very skilled mystical grammatician, that might mean a fireball comes from your hands, flies across the room, and hits someone that you indicated with your gesture.

More often, it means someone gets mad at you casting at them, rushes you, but then stumbles and falls head first into the fireplace. Did you get the object and subject backward? Not clear. It doesn't happen the same way every time, and the variation isn't your intent or pronunciation but what is possible for the speaker's context and some unknown but rather limiting X factor that might be the will of a sentient magical system. No bringing down the moon, for example. Trying too hard will just get you fatally tongue-tied.

--------------

This makes for two interesting types of "mages":

1. Those who can get proactive future results by seeming random chance but do much bettering at finding truth results on present or past subjects. After long research and study of a subject or situation, they'll try to say it is a certain way and it usually will be. Did they determine this through logic or magic? Hard to tell. But their results are the truest things possible. Big effects stall more often than not for them.
2. Those who can get "supernatural" results that seem to scoff at physics, but usually with more unpredictable and chaotic effects. Often, even small and simple phrases stall on them. They have trouble with introspective types of use of language, and work better at causing things to happen externally and going forward.

A big plot hook is figuring out who is which, and why some people sometimes swap from one type to the other.

And, of course, someone will say something that seems impossible or like it would be a really Bad Thing without thinking and without seeming effort. So were they describing some impossible future that would have happened anyway? Did they cause the Bad Thing by saying what they did? Good plot hooks abound.

--------------

To make things balanced instead of out of control, you can't answer complicated questions with a "yes" or "no" and thereby resolve deeply nested queries, nor can you guess at things that might be possible by trying to say lots of things that might be true. That's a good way to trip into a nosebleedy early grave. You can say something like, "what is written here is true." But it doesn't always work, so you'll get a lot of false negatives. And the more you try to do at once, with books or stacks of notes, generally the more likely it will stall on you. And for some reason, the word for "truth" is more fluid in magical tongue than even in English.

It should also be obvious that no modern technical words exist, and borrow words do jack shit. And maybe the language doesn't include the concept of null or empty sets or zero, either. That should cover most magic exploits for knowledge about P vs NP, magical guessers, genie computers, and such.

I'd also suggest making saying negatives or exclusions completely impossible. So you couldn't say, "No Living Man," or "Only Women," but if you could manage to say, "I *Can* Hinder John," you'll get a shot at doing just that without an Evil Genie effect of all people named John somehow being affected. Usually, most of the time. Magic isn't malicious, but it is exact and dangerous to depend on. "I am proof against all blades," might make shaving rough and still do nothing against a punch dagger, for example.

And remember, no negatives. So you'll have to make statements about returning to previous states, not undoing or negating something. Tricky, and sometimes not very exact.

On the other hand, no extra effects occur, like with malicious genies. You get exactly what is described, if you get anything at all. If you say "I find 10 coins in this box," they won't each be the size of a house and fall from the sky, crushing you and the just opened box. A coin is as your understanding of the language makes it, as are the other concepts. You don't, perhaps /can't/ use magic language words you don't understand rather well. And you don't get that sort of thing that wrong. It is more like a computer program in that way. Which just defines how dangerous it is, if you think about it.

Oh, and no human genders, gendered nouns, or gendered pronouns. Just to make targeted casting and friend-foe identification in the field lots of fun. Emotions work really well, though. And there seem to be three gender-like concepts that don't map to humans or anything else truthfully /at all/, and thus are very hard to talk about comparatively in a language with no negatives. One of them seems to involve larva, a word like "host", and not in a way related to the other two unknowable genders. Few spend much time in ancient language gender studies without going mad, or at least totally off stuffed bell peppers for some reason.

Make all adjectives really weird sounding, and positive remember, and all nouns sound sort of off when written out for the reader in English. Like, a person might be intuitively described in the heat of battle as a "desperate land-pig friend with long whiskers". And yes, they have a mustache, but they aren't fat or otherwise pig-like to anyone else. Not even the caster, after they've had time to consider it. Odd.

As for the world? Depends on how common everything is, and how well known. Some ideas.

- People will claim things are magically true that aren't, because only those who both know the magical language and hear it spoken in person will know it was a true phrase being said and that later claims are accurate.

  - Thus, "the king is evil" won't be something everyone will automatically know and trust to be true.
  - But every one of his Dukes might pay to have this and other things found out.
  - Expect secrets to be easier to keep than in some magical systems. Rich people will have just as easy a time finding things out, but specific people (think, Snowden) might leak certain secrets in ways that people will believe.

- Gagging all prisoners seems a reasonable precaution, but is really, really dangerous to do on an unconscious and unsupervised person. People die in real life from this, and they won't be able to eat, so it makes mass imprisonment hard.

  - Magical and corporal punishment will be used a lot (think, at best, cutting out tongues) and capital punishment would be more common than long prison sentences, for this and other reasons.
  - It also makes legal defenses really hard for people who can't write, as no one will allow a prisoner to speak. Escape will be easy for those skilled and quick-witted enough who can still say magical words.

- Certain things will be considered unspeakable, at least in magical language and in public.

  - Expect free speech rights to be more like gun control, with even normal speech more carefully controlled or in-your-face protected.
  - Religions based around language might be common, even non-magical ones.
  - Speaking magical words at all might be seen as basically assault, and anyone doing so in public arrested quickly. Certain phrases will definitely be considered attempted murder.

- Tech is likely to be swiftly accelerating, through a living magic language might have a vested interest in not allowing too much investigative use of magic on research.

  - This could actually retard technology, if everyone looks to a magical solution first instead of a technological one.
