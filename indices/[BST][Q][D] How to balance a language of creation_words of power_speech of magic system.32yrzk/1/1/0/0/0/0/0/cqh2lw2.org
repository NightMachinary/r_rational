This reminds me of David Eddings' /Elenium/, where it turns out that magic is literally just requesting miracles from various gods (who get worship out of the deal). Which leads to some hilarious moments when the Church Knights realize that they've spent years praying to pagan gods, because the "one God" is too stuck up to grant routine powers.

And importantly, people the gods /really like/ might not have to ask in a dead language with correct grammar to get a result - plain english works, if there's good reason. And sometimes they get proactive interventions, wanted or not...
