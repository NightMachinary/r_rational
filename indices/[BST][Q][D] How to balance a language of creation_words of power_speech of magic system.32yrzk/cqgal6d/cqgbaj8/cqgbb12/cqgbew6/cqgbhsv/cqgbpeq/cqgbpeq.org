The fun extra-credit question is:

/What objectives could magic itself have?/

Lots of good answers. Could be just desiring more scholars speaking magic or possibly a rescue by its makers who can detect widespread magic use /and are already on their way/. It might be trying to engage skilled users, dropping hints and warnings that things aren't what they seem and are about to get Really Bad soon.

I think it being amoral from a human standpoint and not really caring about most speakers is a given, though it could still have favorites.
