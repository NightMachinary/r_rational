I don't think you even need to go slightly-narky genie on this one. Just someone shooting you with a crossbow or rifle, or triggering an improvised explosive, from outside your very obvious moving "despair before" zone. That's pretty obviously evil, after all.

Any larger interpretation would likely just not work. I'm imagining the magic language itself as a rational actor and constrained, non-bound genie-like entity.
