People have mentioned a lot of possible solutions, so I'll throw a different one that I think might be a fun twist: the evil djinn trope. Basically the intentions of the caster do not play into it and whatever loopholes the magic caster leaves in his spoken spell have a very good chance of going against them in some way.

So in your example, No living man may hinder him, but a female or an inanimate object will likely lead to a major problem in the near future - the writing would be fun in that the reader could look at the spell someone cast and try to predict what ways it might go wrong for the caster. Saying "that house is on fire" may simply set a tiny fire that barely does anything and poses no danger to the house, or turn the entire foundation and yard into a sea of fire that the house floats on. And so on. So casting magic becomes an incredibly dangerous thing that is done in emergencies or under very, very careful consideration of possible outcomes.
