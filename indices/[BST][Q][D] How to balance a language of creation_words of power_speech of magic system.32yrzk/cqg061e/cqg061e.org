Eragon's elves have something like this. They're living in a post-scarcity society, albeit one that's isolated and slowly stagnating.

One way to constrain it would be to affect the culture - to prevent contradictions, there's an inborn power hierarchy - Jill's True statement has a rank of 4318, so if she contradicts Jack, whose rank is 4367, her words are implicitly more True by virtue of her birth, and so her statement persists. The /other/ way to do would be to make contradictions incredibly dangerous - if Jill says, "That house will always be on fire", and Jack says "That house is not and never will be on fire", the house is both on fire and not on fire. The chain reaction consumes the lifeforce of both invocators and populates the house with Contradictory Flame, which both burns and does not burn down the house. The house is both burnt down and not burnt down, so now it's a Contradictory Zone and liable to drive you insane if you stare at it too long.
