  But if there is a language of magic that got me thinking what's it like if your native speech is literally the words of power that can shape the firmament of reality?

NO.

You do NOT want a toddler learning this as their first language, reshaping reality in nonsensical ways, getting whatever they want just by saying it, and unmaking its parents the first time they tell it "no".

The language of magic must not be the first language for any person. No one may learn the language of magic before reaching a certain level of maturity, and the ability to form phonemes is not a sufficient lower bound.
