Generally I'd think usage of the 'SPEECH' is probably viewed as a sign of danger, power, status but also highly culturally or legally restricted.

However I think at the very least the 'written' form of the speech is meaningless and it probably does not actually have a written form tied directly to it officially, I'd more expect that various people have invented highly precise phonetic alphabets.
