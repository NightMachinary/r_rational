  everything said in the speech is true.

That could be interesting, if it was literally impossible to speak a lie and attempting it altered reality to match what you said.

Some restrictions I'd apply:

- Altering anything takes energy of some sort, altering too much is dangerous.
- People don't use past tense. Altering history takes more energy than they can use, so mistakes are dangerous
- future tense is discouraged. You never know when the energy drain from the statement will trigger (eg: "the house will burn down" could trigger at any time before you die or the house is destroyed by other means)
- declarative sentences only. "Burn down the house" can't be said in the language, only something like "I want something to burn down the house" (and if you didn't want it before, you do now).
