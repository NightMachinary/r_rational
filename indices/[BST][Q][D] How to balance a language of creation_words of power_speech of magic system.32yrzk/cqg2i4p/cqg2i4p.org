I'm reminded of "True Name" based systems, where to command a thing you have to know its secret name, and learning those names is a long and arduous task (because, for example, you can't just command /The Ocean/ with a single name, and must instead learn the individual True Names for every distinguishable body of water... your power thereby growing as a function of how many names you know).

More generally, making it somehow difficult or time-consuming to learn the language of power, perhaps to the extent where a lifetime of study/practice will still leave you only knowing a small and specialised subset, would be one way to keep a lid on the power level (and create different 'flavours' of mage depending on what they focussed on learning)
