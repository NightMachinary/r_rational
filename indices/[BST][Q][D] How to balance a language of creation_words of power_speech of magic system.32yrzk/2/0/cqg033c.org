Hum, A thought I had after you mentioned tenses is that there is probably a 'range' to the effect of a statement. mainly only what is present and can audibly 'hear' the language can be effected.

I'm curious if it's possible to make a language that can be used that does not actually contain past or future tense. Or that it can only give future tenses in terms of something like timers of discrete events from now.
