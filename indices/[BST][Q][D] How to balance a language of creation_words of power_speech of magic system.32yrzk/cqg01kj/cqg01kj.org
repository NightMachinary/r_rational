Since no one's mentioned it yet, I'll throw the /Inheritance/ cycle's magic system out there.

- You do magic by essentially telling magic/the world "throw this rock over there", in the language of magic.
- The magic does, in some sense, read your mind; you can /say/ "throw rock", and the magic will read your mind to figure out which rock you meant and where you want it thrown.
- If you don't know how to phrase something in the language of magic, you can't do it.
- Doing something with magic takes as much energy as doing it via normal means. Overexerting yourself /can/ kill you.
- The energy cost also scales up as you go further away. I assume the author put this in mostly for balance reasons.
- You don't do magic accidentally, so /just/ saying "set the door on fire" won't set any doors on fire unless you actively 'tap' your magic. This is something you train.
- The language of magic is a plain old (/actually/ old) language, though it's quite complicated.
- It is impossible to lie using the language of magic. If you try, you just won't be able to say it.

There's more to it, but that's pretty major spoilers, so I'll put it in a [[http://pastebin.com/vCrznGeb][pastebin]].

Anyone can learn magic, though most people have a very little energy available.

There's also mental magic, which is rather similar to how Legilimency and Occlumency are described in HPMOR. Any person can learn defense (on a basic level, focusing very hard on a brick wall will do), and I don't quite remember for offense. Battles between mages often turn into quite literal mindgames, because just killing your opponent (by popping a vein or pinching a tiny nerve) is actually quite easy, and MAD is not hard to achieve that way.

It's been a while since I read the books and I'm rather tired, so I may have missed something. Feel free to point out any mistakes.
