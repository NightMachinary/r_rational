One of the magic systems in my novel works like this, but it's very heavily restricted. Some of these points are spoilerish for [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]], so if you're reading that, you may want to avoid reading too much of the stuff below.

Most of these points have been covered to some extent, but as a game designer, I like to think in bullet points. Maybe some of the ones below will be useful to you. =D

- Vocabulary. In a world where this is possible, it's possible specific words may not be taught to people because of the power they hold. Other words may be well-known, but illegal to use.

- Syntax. It's possible that the language only functions if words are used in a specific order, or that they have different functions based on how they are used within a statement.

- The burden of complexity. A system with a lot of hard rules for syntax and restricted word usage is going to be a lot more difficult to optimize. This makes it that much cooler when the protagonists figure out ways to do it anyway, imo. =D

- Cultural restrictions. I covered this briefly when talking about laws or "secret words", but there are all sorts of reasons why people might not use specific types of magic for cultural reasons. Religion and other superstitions, for example, might make the culture believe there's a reason you shouldn't use specific words, sentences, etc. Even if there aren't explicit laws, there could be organizations that attempt to stop the use of specific types of magic.

- A power source. Where does the magic come from? For example, in [[#s][Forging Divinity]]

- Costs. This is simple enough - what's the cost of using magic? Do people have mana pools? Do different words have different costs?

- Limitations on combinations of factors. For example, even if a word for "time" exists, maybe it's impossible to combine it in any way that would allow for time travel. This may be because there's a source of magic that doesn't allow certain hard rules to be broken, other more powerful effects are in place that prevent specific types of magic from being used, etc.

Edit: As an extra note, in case you weren't already aware, there's a [[/r/magicbuilding]]. You might want to check them out! =D
