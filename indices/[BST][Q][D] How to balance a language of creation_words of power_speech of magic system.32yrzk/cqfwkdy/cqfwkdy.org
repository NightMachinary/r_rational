My first thought is that if you want to make an actual language like that, you're going to have to kneecap it a whole lot so that it's not broken right out the gate. I don't mean kneecapping the ability to impose words on reality, I mean making changes to the language itself so that you can limit how it expresses itself.

Múra-Pirahã is an indigenous language from Brazil. If you believe all the claims about it:

- There are no words for numbers, and only two words for quantity which correspond to "a few" and "many".
- There are no words for color, only words for "light" and "dark".
- There is no distinction between singular and plural.
- It's impossible to be ambiguous about how you came by information. You can't say "Betty shots herself in the head", you have to say something like "I see Betty shots herself in the head" or "Someone tells me Betty shots herself in the head" or "I deduce that Betty shot herself in the head".
- No recursive sentences.

Anyway, this is a stripped down language - about as stripped down as anyone has ever found. You'd want to make your magic language into something like that, lacking a number of words that would break the magic wide open and accelerate it into being nonsensical. You can add in some other things like the Hopi language's (supposed) lack of a past or present tense.

That's just a first stab at how you'd have to constrain it if you wanted a good story. You might try a different tack, like having an unknown language that gets discovered slowly by the protagonist and delivers creeping power in that way, but I don't think that you'll get much mileage out of simply having a language that absolutely enforces its truth on reality.
