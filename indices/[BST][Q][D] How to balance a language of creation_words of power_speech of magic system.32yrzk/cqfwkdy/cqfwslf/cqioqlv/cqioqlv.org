Make it a pure language, fully developed. But the power comes from your soul, or your life. Complexities add cost, and such you can say the word "fire" and cause a fire, but with little control over where. The house is on fire. Would light every part of the house on fire at the same time. If you use up too much power then you die, and the words only come true based on how much power you had. It would only be taught to people old enough to deal with that, and it would teach people to be very careful about their words, maybe to the point where noone says a sentence without practicing it several times and studying it for an hour or two.
