Paring down does seem like it could help a lot, and would even give a good reason for why learning some other language is valuable. But at the same time quite possibly very confusing if your used to speaking in words of power.

Another thing that I thought would be useful is the whole 'unintended interpretation' rule that seems to always plague prophetic statements of immortality. In other words the language is not necessarily solidly concrete as you would expect and so it has a lot open to interpretation and thus the precision is not really there to control results unless you construct a kind of epic poem that has to layer the more noisy possibilities up over one another until you can get something that consistently does what you want.
