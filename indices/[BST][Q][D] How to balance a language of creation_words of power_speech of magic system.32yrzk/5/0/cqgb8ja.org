The twisty speaking nature of a native speaker I had not fully thought of but that actually makes a lot of sense, I had been naively assuming they would have trouble understanding bold faced lies and deception. But that combined with them speaking around things in minutia and almost labyrinthine statements is hilarious. They seem sneaky but they actually have difficulty recognizing a liar till they have had some time dealing with none-native speakers.
