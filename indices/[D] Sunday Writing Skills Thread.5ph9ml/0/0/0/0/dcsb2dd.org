I think I was a bit unclear. It didn't help that my examples tended towards the melodramatic.

I was talking more about the scene in which the initial interest is established. That /could/ be a first impression, but it could also be years after knowing someone, when a certain event or twist in perspective incites the first bit of interest or curiosity.

But feel free to disregard the importance of the above. I think it still holds, but is much less crucial if it doesn't have to be so immediate.

From what you described, it seems like you'll have enough of a buildup/buffer to establish a rapport and relationship before the dramatic gesture. A lot of which can be established with shifts in their understanding and expectations of each other.

To be overly simplistic, ill use hypothetical cut-outs to avoid using characters I'm not familiar with.

Vampire *A*; Boy *B*.

*A* can go from seeing *B* as:

#+begin_example
  A puppet meant for a self-aggrandizing fantasy -> an endearing pet -> a useful servant. 
#+end_example

Likewise *B* can go from seeing *A* as:

#+begin_example
  An eccentric rich employer -> confident mentor -> mysterious vampire -> elderly lecher. 
#+end_example

I doubt any of these possibilities are things you haven't considered. But more important than the ways the characters change in regards to how they see each other, is 'how' it happens.

I think a sense of natural progress is the most important thing to make the relationship/gesture feel 'earned'. All the better if there are smaller conflicts of personality and misunderstandings that lead to shifts in dynamics.

Like to use your example of William renting Red a room in the hotel after seeing his run-down situation.

*B* could be flattered, and see the goodwill of what's being offered, but it could also smell to him of pity. Feelings of defensiveness could grow into resentment when confronted with the daily personal experience of opulence. A sense of distance, the chaff of dependence, and a sense of being subsumed into a life greater than his own.

When this is expressed or sensed by *A*, he finds it adorable, then annoying as it fails to subside quickly. A thinks of his fantasy of loving a human, and goes out of his way to maintain the relationship far beyond where he'd usually cut *B* away for the insult.

*A* offers gesture after gesture of affection, finally opting to give him gifts of the more traditional sort, filled with spiteful affordances and symbols.

*B* realizes (because of the reaction of his peers or because of his understanding of his job depending on where this fits into the chronology) and sends back equally biting and sarcastic gifts in turn. Cobbled together from a combination of his meager resources and the materials from the *A*'s gifts to him.

*A* is surprised by *B*'s skills, and makes a genuine effort to understand what is going on with B instead of just playing the playful role of a romantic lover. He expresses admiration for *A*'s skills. *A* is surprised, expecting punishment or censure. There is communication/understanding.

Situation resolves with *A* paying for his own room and board by his own deserved means, rather than off of his boss's generosity (maybe moves to a less upscale residence). Both ending in different circumstances with rather different views of the other.

In any case, it looks like there is plenty of space for the relationship to develop, and tt doesn't seem like they have to be fullblown loving each other by the time the ritual war exchange takes place (which looks to me to be the main point where the question of anything feeling 'earned' might come into question. Like where legitimate sacrifices and vulnerabilities are required).

(Sorry if this is mostly unhelpful. It might not even really be what you asked. At a certain point I was kind of just using it as an excuse/exercise to try and explicate my own thoughts for my own sake rather than to help.)
