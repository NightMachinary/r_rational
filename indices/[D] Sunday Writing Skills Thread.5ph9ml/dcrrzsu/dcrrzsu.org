So, I'm writing a yaoi vampire story and I've realised that I'm missing a heck of a lot of stuff at the beginning that actually makes the couple falling in love, well, realistic / feel "earned". Does anyone have any tips about this sort of thing?

The advice I found online seemed to be for the stories where the couple gets together at the end, so it was advice on how they should act during their adventures together and whatnot. But I want my couple to get together at the /beginning/, and the rest of the story to detail how their relationship develops and changes? (Particularly with the difficulties of the human being in love with a vampire / slowly going through supernatural transformations until (spoiler!) ultimately he becomes a vampire himself).

Also I have no friggin' idea what to use for a title. General tips? I haven't googled that yet so feel free to let me wait until I've actually looked into it a tiny bit.

In other news I met my beeminder goal, which was an awesome achievement!
