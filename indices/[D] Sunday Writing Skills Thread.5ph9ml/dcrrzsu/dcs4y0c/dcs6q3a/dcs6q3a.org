Thanks for that - a lot to think about.

The big problem is that it's a vampire/human relationship, and the vampire obviously has a /very/ different cultural context than the human does, and I think if I wrote from the vampire's point of view so we could see what he was /actually thinking/, the relationship would look /awful/ purely because a 1500 year old vampire does not see a three month relationship the same way as a human does.

The reason for this being an issue, specifically, is because the vampire is the one who has the immediate attraction, but the human (POV character) slowly gets swept off his feet....

I also am pretty sure my "first scene" doesn't have the type of immediate magnetism that you're talking about. I do a lot of time skips and most of the action happens six months after they get involved, so I don't want to dwell on the courtship more than appropriate.

I hope you don't mind me thinking aloud here (and if you feel like offering more specific advice, I'd be very grateful!).

Point of View Character: Red, an American deserter from WW2, scraping together a living doing odd jobs in Rome.

Love Interest: William, a 1500 year old vampire, once Clovis I, king of the Franks; now, a vampire doing vampirey things. In Rome to view an opera by a famous vampire opera-writer-person. Vampire operas have intricate plots and usually go for days, sometimes even weeks.

William meets Red when he's working, and offers him a job. William's motivation is that about twenty years ago his last servant died or quit or whatever, and the opera was about a vampire and a human falling in love, and that romantic notion appealed to him so he was like "maybe I should give that a try" and then he saw a handsome human and was like "yes, I am going to try with this human". Red's motivation is that he needs the money. William starts giving Red odd jobs, including something that is important to vampires - scouring market stalls for rare, valuable, or interesting items that can be used as part of their odd gifting culture. Red is very, very good at it, he feels like he has a purpose, and is proud of himself.

William is odd; William's friends are odd; but William makes kind gestures (cooks him meals, I want to add a scene where he rents him a room in the same hotel when he finds out that Red is living in a run down place, and another scene where they walk through Rome together and William gives him a sort of tour.) Kind of want to call back to the "tour" after the vampire revelation, with Red being all "So the reason you knew so much about Rome is because YOU WERE THERE?" and William is all "No, it was a great, ancient city when I was young. I finally went here about four hundred years ago and learned all this from a tour guide."

Another romantic gesture of William's: Red screws up a ceremony, badly, with another vampire. The vampire is well within her rights to have Red killed. William begs her not to, and ultimately kidnaps one of her servants and "declares war" (really: a ritual gifting exchange) on her, which is a big sacrifice for him.

Since this is already super long, for reasons I won't get into, they end up breaking up, Red returns home with his sister, and just finds himself drawn to markets and trying to buy the best items he can, as well as realising how settling down and getting a wife and kids is not the life he wants when he could be with William. William had of course decided he couldn't live without Red and had gone to the USA looking for him, they are reunited, happily ever after. (Red becomes a vampire in the third "volume", in c.2017)
