No, I really appreciate what you've given me. I especially like the part where you reassured me that my plan seems like an achievable vehicle for prose!

I am also quite surprised by how much I appreciated you using A and B instead of the characters' names - on reflection I remember in other conversations I've had about the universe that it's oddly grating to have people suggest hypothetical courses of action for the purpose of illustration as you did, but they're just /wrong/ for the characters, and using A and B sidesteps that nicely.

Everything you've written makes me want to write more from William's point of view, even though it's so /unromantic/ and maybe, written out, would possibly even read downright abusive in some ways. Still, I think from a 'rational' point of view, such things would be interesting to read; and I look at their nascent relationship as similar to a pet/owner relationship in that William provides Red with all the attention, assistance, and love that Red /wants/needs/, rather than the amount of the same that William was /capable of providing/. And, really, what /is/ wrong with that?

Also, you've implicitly pointed out something that I haven't quite addressed: William is too "perfect" in what I've written so far. He doesn't make mistakes. My concept of vampire intellects is much as tk17studios' concept of Andalite intellects - being capable of paying attention to several things, several thought processes, independently and simaltaneously. So I said to myself, "William is too intelligent to make mistakes". He's maybe too intelligent to take the wrong route to Corsica, but he's not got the knowledge or the ability to relate to humans that might have him seem strange, or to commit social faux-pas.

So, thanks for all that help! I appreciate it.
