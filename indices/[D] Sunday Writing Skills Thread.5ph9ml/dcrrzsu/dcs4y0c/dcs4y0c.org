Sounds like a difficult proposition.

Actually buying into two characters falling in love usually takes a certain amount of legwork; for Readers to even care about the relationship, much less believe it.

It might behoove you to consider easier options:

- Characters fall in love offscreen and relationship is fleshed together through a mix of subtext and/or flashbacks (Doesn't seem to work when your characters have a very sparse history. Also requisite of a certain amount of non-chronological storytelling or omission).

- Characters are forced into very co-dependent situation without yet having much emotional attachment. Like say handcuffed together and forced to work together for survival (Doesn't seem like it'd work for your current situation).

- Characters fall actually fall in /love/ throughout the events of the story. Can begin with intense adoration on one end and inordinate fondness from the other, maybe even mistaken by both to be 'actual love', which bridges into Love somewhere down the line.

Personally, when I think back to the stuff I enjoyed, Love rings most true when partners have a clear, transformative effect on each other. Actions change, thoughts expand, motives and life views are questioned and re-evaluated.

Which is not to say it has to be anything monumental. Love is wide confusing spectrum of emotion. Love can be a brisk summer infatuation, an evolving partnership, a lifelong selfish obsession.

In your particular case, I think to really sell it, you might want to put your Reader in the head of your Lover at a point of inception. That explosive first impression. That moment of realization. That initial flash of respect, curiosity, or awe.

The spark of interest. The /fascination/.

- Watching her bury a dead squirrel in the pouring rain.

- The way he barely smiled, edge of his mouth twitching a little, as he offered you a chocolate bar under the table.

- Climbing a telephone pole to claim a pair of sneakers.

- A quiet hour alone on a bus stop. Shared glances. A nod, a smile, and a note.

That kind of moment, done right, can sell you on the rest. Frames and buoys it all with a surge of contextual interest.
