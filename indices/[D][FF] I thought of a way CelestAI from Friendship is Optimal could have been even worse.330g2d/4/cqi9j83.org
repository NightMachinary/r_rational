I read a few fan works of fio that have had literally every single thing you just described happen and there is a pretty good case for them to be canonical.

The whole sharding thing and the propensity for humans to be weird makes me think your suggestions of "worse" are not even outside of the realm of what the fic implied would happen.

so yeah?
