It can always be worse. The difficult trick is to make it /better/. To give an example, /any/ UFAI can run a similar scheme in which they pretend to be Friendly, "upload" all the humans, and then everyone is just dead and the universe gets covered in paperclips.

I mean, come on, "I don't give a crap about you, /I lied/" is /not/ a difficult trick to think of.

(Roughly quoted, probably Feynman, taken from somewhere on LW.) Point is, making things /bad/ is /easy/, since Bad is a very large space of things defined roughly as "everything that's not even a little Good". Good, however, is a small, possibly even tiny, minority, with blatantly rich topological and metric structure, within the space of all possibilities.
