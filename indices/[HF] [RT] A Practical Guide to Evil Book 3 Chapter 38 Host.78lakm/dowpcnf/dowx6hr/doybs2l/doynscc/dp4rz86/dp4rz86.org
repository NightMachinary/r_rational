Thanks a lot for writing this. I'm enjoying this discussion.

But I think you have misunderstood one of the key parts of my arguement (maybe I should have been more explicit), which is Kegan has no feud with the Summer so has no motivation to bleed her forces further in *the battle against the Summer*.

  Cat does have a few cards she can play to force Kegan to join her Yes, Cat can use your counters to force Kegan to join the battle against the Diabolist. But not very useful (apart from 3 & 5) in persuading to battle agianst the Summer.

First point -> yeah, I'm not contending that Daoine is not desperate to stop the Diabolist.

Second point -> I'm also not contending that Daoine has no reason to coordinate with Cat to take down the Diabolist.

Third & fifth points might be motivation for Kegan to go to battle with Summer and be in the good books with Cat. I admit those.

I think fourth is beside the point I'm trying to raise.
