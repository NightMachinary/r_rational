Good analysis. Ok, so she can't take on the Diabolist on her own.

However, she basically has no feud with the Summer so has no motivation to bleed her forces further. Therefore, let's assume, with the cost to train the Watch on her mind, she refuses to go against the Summer thinking that with the support of Winter, Cat can win on her own. If that's the case, since Cat needs her to track down the Diabolist and match her forces, then Cat would have no choice but to go on her own, right?

My basic point is that Cat has no negotiating power over Kegan since she can't threaten to not deal with Diabolist, so she is bound by that responsibility to accept help from Kegan when offered but can't force her. Notwithstanding a potential partnership at the end of the War - Kegan swearing to Cat instead of the Tower or something.

My argument might be bit wonky, but I thought it would be interesting to look at objectives of the players and their [[https://books.google.lk/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false][power in negotiating]] to achieve those objectives.
