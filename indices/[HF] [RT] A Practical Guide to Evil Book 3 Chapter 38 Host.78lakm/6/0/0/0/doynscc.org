Huh, pretty interesting line of thought! I'm not sure if the counters that come to mind actually address it fully, but I'll give it a go.

  My basic point is that Cat has no negotiating power over Kegan since she can't threaten to not deal with Diabolist, so she is bound by that responsibility to accept help from Kegan when offered but can't force her.

Cat does have a few cards she can play to force Kegan to join her, though I am unsure how effective they would be:

- First of all, we don't know the full relationship between the Watch, the source of their power, and how Diabolist's ritual is affecting it. There could be other considerations at play; the ritual could weaken the rest of the Watch, or it could be killing the lesser god that powers the Watch, or any number of things. Whatever is happening it's severe enough that Kegan is willing to muster 20,000 troops to rescue the 13 members of the Watch who are being used. That implies whatever Diabolist is doing, it's got a large impact upon Daoine.

- While Cat and Kegan both want Diabolist beaten, they want it for different reasons. For Kegan it's to rescue the Watch (and punish Diabolist). For Cat it's to free Liesse (and kill Diabolist). You are right when you say that Kegan could simply sit back and watch Cat go after Diabolist anyway; but that doesn't mean Cat will free the Watch or stop using the ritual. Kegan only knows Cat by reputation (and by the reputation of Praes) before the two forces join up - she could easily imagine Cat's goal is to take Diabolist's weapons for herself like most villains would do. Heck, that's practically Malicia's goal already! By providing troops she both ensures that there's a better chance of stopping Diabolist, and that her troops will be rescued after.

- While unconquered during the Legions' war against Callow, Daoine did still agree to pay fealty to the Tower. As such it's expected that they work with the Praesi when the need arises.

- Cat's not entirely without other options she could tap if Daoine backed out. She could renegotiate with Winter for additional support; she could request help from the Tower, especially since Malicia is now buttering her up and Wolof's rebellion is finished; she could turn to other sources for troops such as summoning devils (although this is not recommended when facing a Name all about summoning devils). Daoine is a strong part of her force, but not a majority of it.

- Also, think of the costs for Daoine sitting this out or turning on Cat. After Diabolist, the Free Cities, and Procer are settled, there will be a lot of veteran troops in the Legions eager for more blood. And Daoine makes a prime target, especially if Diabolist's ritual weakens the Watch. Sitting out now means Daoine is in a more precarious position down the line.
