  She has enough army strength to take on Diabolist on her own, right?
#+end_quote

No, I don't think she does. When they first reach Arcadia, [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/23/chapter-25-advance/][Daoine has 5k Watch members and 15k regular soldiers]]. This number is definitely [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/18/chapter-32-close/][decreased by the end]]:

#+begin_quote
  On our side, nearly six thousand. Nauk's two thousand men at the beginning of the campaign had been whittled down to a bare five hundred. *Most of the rest were Deoraithe regulars and fewer legionaries, though the Watch had allegedly lost a tenth of their number.*
#+end_quote

So, assume that if Nauk lost 1500, the Watch lost 500, and of the 4000 other casualties, the majority were Deoraithe regular troops. That means Kegan's personal force is down to 4500 shock troops (the Watch) and maybe around 12,000 regular troops... and that's before the Summer Queen nukes several hundred combined forces at the end of the chapter, and doesn't count any losses from earlier fights in Arcadia.

In [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/07/villainous-interlude-exeunt/][Villainous Interlude: Exeunt]], at the start of her fight with Summer, Diabolist's forces included:

- 1000 /walin-falme/ devils (tall bat-like devils that fly and attack with spears or swords)

- 3 "ancient devils" said to rival Fae royalty for power

- A captured Duchess of Summer used to power her rituals.

- At least 10,000 soldiers. Using later discussions, it sounds like she had closer to 18,000.

- A city full of refugees available for blood sacrifices as needed. In Chapter 33, Cat mentions that the city's population is around 100,000, so the majority are likely civilians.

- A flying freaking city.

- Her father, probably one of the most powerful non-Named mages in the country if not world.

- Her own Name, which lets her kill thousands of fae at a time and go head-to-head with two high royals and fight to a draw.

Now, she loses some of this force; half of her devils die out, [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/chapter-35-questions/][two of the ancient devils are killed, and thousands of her troops die (but are then raised from the dead to continue fighting)]]. But she still has all the other advantages. The Deoraithe have only the Watch (awesome, but limited), no Named, and no real ability to mobilize and get to Liesse without the help of the Legions' war machine and supply lines. You asked:

#+begin_quote
  What is her motivation to go in to the grinder with Summer?
#+end_quote

I think it's because she can't take Diabolist on on her own, and moreover she can't mobilize and move her force across Callow without the consent and/or assistance of the Legions. And Cat's portals cut the travel time from several weeks to several days. Allying with the Legions is the only way she has a chance of succeeding.
