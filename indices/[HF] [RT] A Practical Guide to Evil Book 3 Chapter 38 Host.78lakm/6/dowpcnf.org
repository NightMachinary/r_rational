I was thinking about the Duchess Kegan. What is her motivation to go in to the grinder with Summer? Her objective is to free the Watch members and revenge, right? She has enough army strength to take on Diabolist on her own, right? (even if Cat gets defeated by Summer without her forces) I guess one factor is she lacks magic power?
