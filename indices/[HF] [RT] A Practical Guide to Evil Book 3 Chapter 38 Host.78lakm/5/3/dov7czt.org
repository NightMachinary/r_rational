Ranker is the goblin Marshal of the other Legion that's marching with Cat. We got a PoV from recently. Her second in command is Afolabi. Cat doesn't like Afolabi because he has ties to the Wasteland families, but we haven't seen his true colors yet. All we've seen him do so far is clean Cat's pipe and talk to Ranker. Kegan is the Duchess of Daoine, a province allied with but mostly independent from Callow. The Daoine army is called the Watch and they're like the Human Rangers of this world. They have some pact with some mysterious deity that Akua is currently messing with. Commander Adair is her second command and the putative General of the Watch. We haven't seen him do anything before, nor does he do anything here. Grandmaster Brandon Talbot is the leader of the Knights of the Broken Bell, Cat's new Callow Cavalry.

Everyone else is part of the 15th.
