Here's a quick and dirty primer:

*The leaders*

- Duchess Kegan Iarsmai of Daoine: Pretty self-explanatory. She's the leader of Daoine, a mostly independent section of Callow (they were unconquered by the Legions, but agreed to swear fealty to the Tower). Daoine itself has an elite fighting force known as The Watch, who seem to have stronger abilities due to their connection to a god of some kind. Watch members were kidnapped by Akua/Diabolist to use as ritual fodder to make her city float. Kegan wants them back.

- Commander Adair: Kegan's right-hand man, oldest friend, and leader of the Watch. Not much info on him; he was mentioned briefly in the chapter "Commanders." Seems less willing to work with Praes and Cat than Kegan.

- Grem One-Eye and Istrid Knightsbane: Mentioned by name, but not actually at this meeting. +Both are marshals (higher rank than general)+ (Corrected thanks to [[/u/TideofKhatanga]]) Grem is a marshal while Istrid is a general, and they control the first and sixth Legions respectively. Istrid is Juniper's mother.

- Marshal Ranker: Commander of the fourth Legion. Female goblin with a burned hand.

- General Afolabi: Commander of the 12th Legion. Doesn't trust Cat and was put in his place in a previous episode, but Malicia seems to have influenced him to behave better. Soninke race.

- Brandon Talbot: Grandmaster of Callow's heavy calvary Order. Callowan noble, distrusts Praes but follows Cat.

*The members of the 15th Legion*

- Juniper: Orc nicknamed the Hellhound, general of the 15th Legion. Terse, intelligent, and a stickler for rules. Has a bit of a hero-worship crush on the Black Knight. Daughter of Marshal Istrid.

- Hakram: Named the Adjutant, Cat's right-hand man. Has a skeletal hand, poor skills at hiding his booze, and many paramours due to being the first Named Orc in generations. All around best bro.

- Aisha Bishara: Staff Tribune, de facto political negotiator for Cat due to her noble upbringing and knowledge of politics and Praesi. Taghreb race (Corrected; thanks [[/u/skwint]])

- Ratface: Nickname of Supply Tribune Hasan Qara. Taghreb race. Acting quartermaster (?) for the 15th. Gets Cat her wine; has issues with Praesi nobility due to his upbringing (bastard son of a noble father who keeps trying to have him killed). Used to date Aisha.

*Not at the meeting but discussed or involved.*

- Pickler: Not at the meeting, but brought in the table for it. Goblin female, head of the 15th's Sapper corps. Both Nauk and Robber have a romantic interest in her. She likes testing her new designs for siege weaponry.

- Akua Sahelian: Not at the meeting but discussed. Named the Diabolist (formerly Heiress), proud owner of the flying city of Liesse. Cat's current arch-rival.

- Masego: Not at the meeting because he'd rather set himself on fire. He probably meant that literally. Named the Hierophant (formerly Apprentice). Lost his eyes during his Name transition but still can see with the artificial ones he made from his magical glasses. OTP with Archer in my head canon.

- Zombie the Third: Cat's third horse in as many books. This one is a pegasus from Arcadia that she stole during a fight.
