Istrid is a general, not a marshal. There's only three Marshal of Praes at any given time and the third one (a Sonninke IIRC) stays in Ater due to being in charge of keeping the Wasteland in order. A mission which recently involved killing most living beings in Wolof.

Also, we had a look at the last Named Commander of the Watch in one of Cat's Name dreams. IIRC, it's at the end of book 1 when she prepares for the Grand Melee.
