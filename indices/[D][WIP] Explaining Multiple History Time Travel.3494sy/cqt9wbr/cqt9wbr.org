I don't like the idea of going forwards making you stay in your current timeline. It's making time-travel inconsistent for no real reason. I can understand there being a different method of time-travel that doesn't make a new timeline and only works for the future, but whatever method you're using to create a new timeline and send yourself earlier in it should work just as well for creating a new timeline and sending yourself later in it.

Why not just explain it before the story starts? Is there any reason the explanation has to happen within the story?
