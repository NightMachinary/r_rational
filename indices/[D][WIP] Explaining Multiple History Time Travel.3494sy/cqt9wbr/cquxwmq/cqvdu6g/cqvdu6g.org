Time travel to the future works the same as the slow path. It should work the same as going to the past. Travel to the past and the slow path work differently because they're completely different methods of time travel.

It's not inconsistent to the point of being self-contradictory. If the only difference between going back five minutes and ten minutes is when you arrive in the new timeline you create, then the only difference between going back five minutes and going forward five minutes is when you arrive in the new timeline you create.

  It's /inconvenient/ because it means there is no way to go "home". But it is consistent.

I don't think you quite understand what I'm suggesting. I'm saying that if you start in timeline A, then go back and end up in timeline B, going forward should take you to timeline C. That's even more inconvenient than the normal way.
