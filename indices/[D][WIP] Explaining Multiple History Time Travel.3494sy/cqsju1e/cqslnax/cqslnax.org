The very first attempt at writing this book came about four years ago, and most of those narrative challenges didn't exist, because no one actually time traveled (with only a few exceptions). I believe the primary plots were:

- A small group of weeaboos is in training to go back to Edo Japan as part of the homebrew retroactive colonization movement (leaving behind everyone they knew in life)
- A college-age girl gets a letter from her future husband telling her to seek him out (sending something like that back is a common anniversary tradition)
- A detective is closing cases before they happen
- A long-form reporter who was fired from his job because of poor expected future returns tries to infiltrate the company responsible for time travel
- Someone makes an assault on Chicago through time travel

There might have been some others. It was kind of a mess. But the point wasn't to have people traveling through time wily-nily, it was to show a modern society where time travel was a reality - immigration to the past, emigration from the future, rapid technological progress and massive social upheaval.

Time travel laid out some of the challenges to characters, and sometimes cut branches of possibility, but time traveling backwards into the past creates duplicates if you don't go far enough, and abandons the world that you once knew, which all the characters took seriously.

Obviously if/when I write this story again I'll be paring it down - there's not really a need to have eight or nine viewpoint characters who all have their own intersecting plots - but the point is mostly to use future information, and have the plot follow a single one of the repeatedly forking timelines.
