You can read some of that in [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZ5xBiQhyBy7iCgt1P7PHq8EuoHZvtU0bUd4qBlj3aw/edit?usp=sharing][/Timeline/]], which is a short written in that setting with some reused characters, or in the (probably to be completely rewritten) first chapter of /The Murder That Wasn't/ linked in the OP.

But it's not just that the detective has gone five years without actually putting in the work of solving a case - everyone has. That's just how police departments work now. The city balances the enormous staffing needs of the "first iteration" versions of themselves with the low staffing needs of the later iterations which have probabilistic foreknowledge. And though you go into work every day knowing that today might be the day that /you/ have to be the first iteration, the one working blind, it's sometimes hard to remember that. Every day is just a matter of going down the optimal path that your side-along selves have written for you, or working on cold cases so impossible that you literally couldn't solve them if you devoted a dozen lifetimes to them.
