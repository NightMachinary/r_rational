The one you left from. The other person's arrival or non-arrival in the past would have already split the timeline at a point in the past, and it wouldn't change the timeline you were 'assigned' to. If you also traveled forward in the other timeline, then that you would also arrive ten years in their own future, unless something specific about that split caused you to do otherwise.

Think of going forward in time as exactly the same as the stasis version, just that you aren't physically present for the duration; if the timeline splits while you are 'out' (by someone traveling backwards /to/ that period) you split with it, but nothing else can affect you during that period. Changes to the past before you left affect you exactly the same amount as they affect anything else, regardless of when they came from.
