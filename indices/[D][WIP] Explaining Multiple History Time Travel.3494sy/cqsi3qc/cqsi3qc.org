I think a bit thing would be showing both timelines.

So you show whoever going back in time to their new place. You have them do major changes in time- set off a nuclear bomb in Berlin to kill Hitler or whatnot. They later look at some statue they melted and destroyed.

Then you have the person's family in the future looking back at history books to see if anything changed- nothing does and when they visit Berline the statue is still there, and someone remarking that that's expected as they are in a different timeline.
