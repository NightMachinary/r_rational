Eh? It is perfectly consistent. You travel back and are now in a new timeline. The future of this new timeline is your future. Traveling forward drops you in that future just the same as if you just sat on your ass and waited. Inconsistency would be if it dropped you back in the future you left.

It's /inconvenient/ because it means there is no way to go "home". But it is consistent.
