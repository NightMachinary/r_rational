It seems that if you want to have a Naive Newcomer, the easiest way to do it is have them be an immigrant from a timeline that doesn't have time travel. They could have been brought from the pre-public time travel past, or someone from another timeline who ends up traveling to the past, and then back to the future, only to find a timeline where time travel is incredibly common, rather than just invented.

Another option if you don't want the Naive Newcomer to be a main character, could be that one of the time travelers goes to a time period where time travel isn't common knowledge, and has to explain some things to the locals.
