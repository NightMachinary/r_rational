I'm curious about your plan to overcome some of the narrative challenges of that model of time travel - seems like it makes it difficult to put together coherent character motivations when their time-travelling actions can never help the people they care about in their original timeline.

You /can/ change stuff as a way to help out the inhabitants of your new branch of the timeline, but butterfly effects are liable to mean that the resulting world is changed sufficiently that you don't find exactly parallel copies of anyone you knew before. Further, to anyone who doesn't travel alongside you, you've just disappeared - exited the universe, never to return, and they can't even "come after you" because when /they/ jump back, they'd end up segregated off in their own branch of the timeline.

Unless your main characters are very careful and coordinated about always time-travelling as a group, it seems like a rather efficient way to permanently separate and scatter them into their own individual timelines, which makes any kind of traditional story /tricky/ at best. Not saying that there's no possible story to be told despite those difficulties but as I started out saying at the top, I'm curious what your plan is.
