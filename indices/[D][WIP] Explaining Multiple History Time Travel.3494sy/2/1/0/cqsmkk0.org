That makes sense, I hadn't really considered the angle of the 'viewpoint' universe being the one that receives various arrivals from the future, rather than following an individual or group using time travel repeatedly.

Your detective puts an idea in my head - if he sends his past self a note after every case, telling himself the solution then it creates an exponentially branching tree of timelines with different versions of himself who have, to varying degrees, been assisted by those notes. And one timeline of "all the note branches" where he's never had to genuinely solve a case in his life... but then with every successive branching there's a new 'twig' on that branch that has, for the first time ever, failed to receive a note, and suddenly needs to learn to detective from scratch without letting on that his perfect record is kind of a sham...
