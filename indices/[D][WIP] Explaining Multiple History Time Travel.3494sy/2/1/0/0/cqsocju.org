Hm. While this wouldn't solve the problem entirely, the detective might ameliorate it by sending back complex mysteries (on the order of the ones that he's solving IOTL) that must somehow be solved in order to access or put together the notes for the case.

Or alternatively, he trusts in his own forethought and lack of crippling laziness and simply sends back the notes about his cases but also sends back the mysteries so that these other iterations of himself can work on them. Either way, while observation and people skills may not remain so sharp, the detective will at least be kept thinking in the right ways.
