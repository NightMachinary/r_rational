Narratively, I'm not to sure.

Reality-wise, I think the interesting thing happens when there is more than traveller.

Because the issue here is that this basically isn't distinguishable from a person spontaneously coming into existing with a memory consistent with what you might observe from a time-traveller.

Because it's not distinguishable... they're the same, right? (The way you tell two things are not the same thing is that they're distinguishable, the way you tell two things are the same thing is that they're not).

Which means that /other/ time-travelers (whether the implied "I" is one as well or not) just kind of... show up, with no otherwise-defined cause, or other-wise defined reason.

So you need to figure that out. Because it either /is/ for no cause, in which case it's random, and thus you either figure out how that works with regards to chaos and entropy (ie, it doesn't), or there is a cause, and that "create an entirely new timeline" doesn't quite hold up.

My usual rubric is that causally looped information is as accurate as it is tested, which means time-traveller arrivals occur when it is sufficiently likely for a series of subsequent events to result in a time-traveler showing up /now/... but that doesn't quite work in a new-timeline situation.

Ramble, ramble - Stories are interesting because of how they effect people; and usually, that's plural. Figure out what it means to have more than one person traveling under this model, and how the two+ time-travelers interact and effect each-other.
