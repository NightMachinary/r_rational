Well, I think part of gaining trust is leaning on that trust as little as possible. You trust someone to pay you back a lot more if you know they're the sort of person who doesn't borrow money lightly. It's also sort of a gradient. Even a master craftsman of genre fiction like Charles Stross can't depend entirely on the goodwill that he's built up, which means that I'm far, far away from that.

Maybe what I mean is that you should always behave as though you don't have trust or interest.

As for having something just for this sub, which has a much higher than average tolerance for weird scifi ideas and stories that have to be puzzled over ... I'll give it some thought. My big (perhaps overly) ambitious plan was to have a loose cycle of time travel books that cover all of the basic models. /Timewise Tales/ is in rough draft right now, and uses static model time travel, and the plan was to have /The Murder That Wasn't/ as the branching model novel (and a third ripple model novel to round out the series). But if I can figure out a way to do a novella instead, maybe I'll go that way.
