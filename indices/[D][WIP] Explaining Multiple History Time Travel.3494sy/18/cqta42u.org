I was distracted by your mention of /Terminator/ originally.

Places where you might reasonably expect infodumps on people who already know it:

- Government briefings
- Advertisements and brochures
- School
- Technical documentation

Other ways you can exposition:

- Start with a scene appreciably before your main story, when the thing actually is new. Then shift to X decades later.
- Just plain narration.
- Follow a parcel as it's being delivered.
