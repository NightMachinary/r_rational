You'll of course use the same time-tested storytelling technique by which anybody ever explains the mechanics in their story --- by beginning with a short, lower-stakes arc that demonstrates all the important rules that will get used later in the book. A concise little example test-case that shows me your rules in action will always beat just telling me those rules.

Thinking of some other time-travel novels (though admittedly not your model), /Kindred/, /To Say Nothing of the Dog/, and /11/22/63/ each start out with a very brief jaunt to the past that serves as a simple example to show us readers the relevant rules, before their characters embark on much longer adventures into history.
