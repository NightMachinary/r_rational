You got it across in 3 dot points, I doubt infodump is going to be much of a problem. You could probably get most of it across through terminology such as branching. There's also the point that when people other than the protagonist time travel then they vanish and the current timeline stays the same. You could also have it explained in a monologue where the character is planning the jumps they need to do.

It seems strange that travelling to the future doesn't split the timelines like it does going back.

The time-travel system should probably open a short-term two way portal, that helps distinguish multiple timelines from other forms of travel
