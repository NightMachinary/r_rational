Why try and explain the rules? why not just tell the story from whichever perspective you choose, and let people figure it out themselves? i mean by the end of the book they will have a set of observations which would either show the rules you predefined or they would match other possible rules, but that won't matter too much and i can't really see how that would hurt, unless your are trying to write a rationalist story and want people to be able to join in from the start, as opposed to after a while when they will have sufficient observations to be expected to have figured the rules out already..
