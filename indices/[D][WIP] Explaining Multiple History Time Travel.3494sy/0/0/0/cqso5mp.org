Hm. Do you never start with the audience's trust even if you've developed a previous reputation?

For example, if I were to read Charlie Anon's story and get confused, I might set it down. But if I were reading a story from /you/ and I got confused, then I would keep going because you've established a reputation with me for well-crafted stories and worlds, so I'm going to keep going with this.

Are you meaning something else when you talk about how an author never starts with the audience's trust or interest? If not, this just might be a story that is for, ah, the veteran Waleswatcher (as we might call those of us who are always on the lookout for a new story from your corner).
