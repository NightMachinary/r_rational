The two primary reasons that anyone stops reading something is that they're bored or confused. The worry about not making any attempt to accommodate is that they'll get confused and stop reading before they get to the point where they think everything is going to make sense. It's my personal opinion that you never start with the audience's trust or interest, and if you just assume that people will figure out all the stuff that you've decided on (even if you make sure that there's only one valid interpretation) you risk alienating a huge amount of people.

So I do think that having the audience pick things up as they go along is valid, but you have to be careful about how you do it, so that they don't realize that they're being fed information. The question is keep them from getting confused without interfering with proper storytelling.
