This wouldn't get around the issue. In the first place, the timeline still gets erased. In the second, you can prove that the timeline gets erased in that people can obtain future information, and that no one is observed randomly becoming comatose, or at least at much lower frequencies than provable time travel occurs. I suppose it could just copy you, but you could also note that attempting to use the power does not have a 50% success rate. On the other hand if it did, I suppose this mechanic would be very likely, but characters would be able to differentiate between them and I am suggesting using one for narrative reasons.

/Note: I am assuming you are refering to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimetravel][Mental Time Travel]] since that is the only thing I can find to reference that story./
