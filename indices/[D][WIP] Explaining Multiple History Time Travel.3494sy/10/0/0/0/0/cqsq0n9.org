No, I never read the story. As I mentioned in the disclaimer at the end of my post, the TVTropes link was the best page I found with information on it. Anyway, that mechanism is easily differentiable from the ones I mentioned.

For the second point, while people do occasionally suddenly fall into comas or spontaneously die, you would be able to differentiate this from time travel induced comas by the frequency at which the spontaneous coma/death occured in the population at large relative to the known incidences of time travel.
