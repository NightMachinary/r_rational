Huh? Are you referring to this statement:

#+begin_quote
  While we have witnessed many people coming back in time, no one has ever observed someone else (other than themselves) leaving to go back in time in any timeline. This implies that going back in time kills everyone from the point you went back to onward, and would make doing it a Serious Ethical Violation which the government might talk about quite a lot, in the same way that while everyone knows smoking causes lung cancer, there is nonetheless an advertisement on every hour reminding you of it.

The OP's description of time travel very explicitly says that the universe someone leaves from does continue to exist, and indeed, in the setting people are aware of others leaving to go branch off new timelines in the past all the time.

The link in OP's description describes a number of different varieties of time travel, of which he has picked one for this story. Maybe you're looking at one of the other descriptions?
