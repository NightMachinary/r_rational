I think the difficulty lies not so much in explaining the precise rules of time travel, as it does in explaining the implications of those rules for the world you're building. It's easy to give those three bullet points, it's harder to explain about what this implies in terms of information theory and colonization from the future.

So the worldbuilding needs to get done first, and then you can figure out how to explain it.
