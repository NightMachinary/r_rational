Okay whaddya think of this example?

The protagonist is watching a talk show. The hosts are interviewing a man who won the lottery. There is a .01% chance of winning. They ask him about his unusual method of playing, and he says that he kept time-travelling back and playing until he won. In fact, there is a whole community of gamblers who continually does this, with lotteries and other games of chance.

The host points out that for every branch containing a winner, there are 9999 losers. The man agrees, but he calculated beforehand that /on average/ he only had to spend one day looping before running through 10000 tickets, so he was sure of victory.

The host points out that each of the 9999 losers must be doing the same thing and further increasing the number of both winners and losers, which means that the number of timelines in which he never wins the lottery remains constant, with winning and losing timelines both increasing in number until the unluckiest losing timelines eventually get bored of repeating the same day so many times or run out of subjective years to spend.

The man replies that /actually/ he thought of that, and there are only 10000 possible tickets, so /each/ of the timelines he splits into is guaranteed to find the winning ticket /eventually/ so long as they themselves keep splitting timelines.

The host harrumphs, and says that even if those 9999 losers keep diligently playing, it's /still/ a matter of chance whether one finds oneself in the split timeline or the original timeline, and this means that every loss must create create at least one permanent loser who is never able to successfully travel back in time again due to sheer bad luck. And this means that he has created a fairly large, ever increasing population of /permanent/ losers in addition to winners.

The lottery winner looks thoughtful, and the remainder of the discussion turns to whether or not, now that he has found the winning ticket, he owes it to his past self to travel back in time and buy that winning ticket /again/ in order to increase the number of branches in which he reaches the winning ticket, despite having no personal interest in doing so and wasting subjective hours in the process, and whether or not pre-committing to that course of action beforehand would truly have been beneficial from the perspective of his past self. The host asks the audience if they would be willing to go through with this, and to mail in discussions of what situations they think time travel is worth it.

The protagonist ponders the issue, and the owner of a casino is just beginning to weigh in on how this new gambling trend might effect the business when suddenly...

PS - one necessary tool for lottos in this universe assuming no quantum dice is that they must not disclose which ticket is the winner, even from the future. You can find out whether you won, but you can't go back in time to give someone the winning number. Also, I didn't carefully think through the implications of this so I might be missing something big and obvious which changes everything, this is mostly just one possible method of introducing rules and implications in a totally plot neutral setting before starting the plot.

PPS: I think the implications here are complex enough that it's not weird if people in this multiverse need it explained to them sometimes. Things that naively seem like good ideas could easily end up creating lots of copies of a Bad End, for example. I bet they would have time-travelling councilors who think through this stuff for people, who could also serve as mouthpieces for you to explain confusing stuff.
