I'm getting a distinct impression that this is actually more of a case of 'everyone but the protagonist' are actually pretty rationalist.

Taylor in this is seriously messed up by her power, but in a different way then she is in canon. Instead of the collected omniawareness of the insect control she is being more and more focused in depressive self loathing due to her dual form power.

I'd hazard this might be rational fiction but more because it could turn into a character learning to be more rational from a pretty low depressed and paranoid teenager on the internet baseline not rationlist to a more intelligence and rationalist teenager with super powers bad ass.

This remains to be seen however in the fiction so far.
