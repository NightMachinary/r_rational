Well, no, the superheroic equivalent of EA is more like what your Taylor is doing in Fling A Light (though still not really), but this fic got a gold star from me for having Taylor actually think about what her advantages were and how they could best be used to make the world better, rather than just defaulting to joining the Wards or the undersiders or something. I'm not really sure there's a better thing to do with Night's powers than kill a bunch of evil people that nobody else can kill, but maybe there is something obvious that I'm missing.

I do think that readers would like this Taylor a bit more if they read a bit more than the first chapter, but it isn't your faults if the story doesn't grab you, and it this recommendation was generally pretty unsuccessful.
