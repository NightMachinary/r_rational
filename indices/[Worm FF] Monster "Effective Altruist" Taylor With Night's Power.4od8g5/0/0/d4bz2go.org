Yeah that's fair. It starts en media res with a fight against Nilbog, which I'll absolutely grant doesn't demonstrate the most interesting facets of the story. Once you see more of Taylor's thought processes in daily life it does end up seeming rational-ish, imo. The "Effective Altruism" bit is that Taylor has a power in the story that is unsuited to normal heroics, and has thought explicitly about what she can do with her power to have the greatest positive impact on the world, the result being a list of S-Class threats she plans to assassinate. Predictably, her actions have consequences she doesn't predict.
