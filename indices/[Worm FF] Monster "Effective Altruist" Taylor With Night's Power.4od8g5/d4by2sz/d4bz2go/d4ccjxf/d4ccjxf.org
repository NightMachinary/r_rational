Really, though, is the superheroic equivalent of EA really about fighting the /most evil/ supervillains? That seems akin to deciding to curing the most painful diseases in cute puppies, rather than actually trying to get the most bang for your buck.

I don't really get how Night's power isn't suitable for a conventional superhero. Sure, she turns into a horrible monster, but since no one can actually see said monster, that doesn't really matter from a PR standpoint. Throw in a stage magician theme and you could practically do birthday parties.
