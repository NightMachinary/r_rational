Again I pretty much agree. Or at least, the world mostly makes sense. I don't think it's the problematic that Taylor isn't currently super rational. It seems like she's trying, that the author is aware of the mistakes she's making and that she'll be punished for them, and that she'll learn as the story goes on.

I guess I just like the story/concept/writing and am more willing to stick with it and give it a chance than most. It is clear though that it isn't a central example of rational fic.
