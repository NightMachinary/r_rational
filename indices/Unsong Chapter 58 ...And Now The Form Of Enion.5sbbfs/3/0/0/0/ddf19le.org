Okay.

I challenge you to find /one/ piece of writing by Scott where he talks - indirectly or directly - about how it's important that you don't worship/praise/believe in God (besides Unsong if you interpret it that way). If you don't find one (I didn't, and I've been reading his writings since 2012), is it all that likely that he would write a really long book making that kind of point?

Whereas there are lots and lots of writings in which he talks about ethics including multiple ones about how unbearable all the suffering that he has witnessed as a doctor is to him.

So I stand by my stance, Unsong is on some level about ethics and many other things in /our world/ - the ethical portion is about how to deal with all the suffering and death that exists now and in the future, finding out the systematic and other reasons why the world is in such a condition and finding out ways to alleviate those things in any way.
