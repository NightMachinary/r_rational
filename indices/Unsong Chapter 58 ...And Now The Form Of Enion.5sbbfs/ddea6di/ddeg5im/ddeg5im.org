The reason I like this quote so much is that he doesn't say anything that is untrue, all that differs from the norm is how he chooses to value different things. Things like "No one will die because the atoms that were in their bodies will still exist" or "We are all one" are only true if you stretch the terms used in them so much that they become useless if you used them the same way in any other context.

Whereas Derek Parfit clearly acknowledges that when he dies, his self will vanish, if you use commonly understood meanings for those terms. He admits that there is really something in the real world that almost all people associate with the word 'self', he just chooses not to place so much importance on that thing (at least this is what he claims to do).
