Almost two weeks ago I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/66pqxb/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dgkmwo1][posted here]] about how confused I was that I didn't seem to like the anime film Your Name despite it doing basically everything right. I couldn't even claim to think it's overrated since I couldn't pin down what about the story didn't satisfy me despite adoring how well-told it was. Now I think I've figured it out and the reason it took me so long. Particularly with anime, I'm used to not liking perfectly good movies that fail to emotionally resonate with me (Spirited Away) and loving flawed films that did manage to connect with me (The Boy and The Beast).

With Your Name, what happened was that the film was resonating with me, but was tugging on emotions that I still don't comprehend and didn't gain any new insight into so I felt hollow. While I have been able to fill in most of the gaps in my emotions that my autism left me with, I still don't understand romantic love. Romance is still the only genre I haven't had any interest in exploring, I have usually responded to romantic subplots with passive acceptance, and the romances I have found engaging almost always focus on what happens after people fall in love rather than the initial connection.

Then I realized I have been in two short and shallow romantic relationships in my life, both of which the other partner initiated and I ended, and that I have made no effort to begin a new relationship, despite wanting to be in one, largely out of fear and uncertainty of my feelings. As such, I think it is important that I take steps to improve this aspect of my ability to interact with my fellow humans and personally benefit from it, but I'm not sure how. My usual way of exploring my psychology is through fiction, hence my interest in this subreddit, but if even romances I like have failed to give me insight into romantic love I don't know what will.
