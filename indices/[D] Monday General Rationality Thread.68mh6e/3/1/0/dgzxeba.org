I know, but I don't think I am. I don't feel like my romantic feelings has "restrictions" similar to the ones I know my sexuality has, I just lack a comprehension of them. I have felt romantic attraction to people, but I'm afraid to act on it because I don't understand it. I want to experience romantic love and I have no reason to believe that I can't. I may have even experienced it before but failed to recognize it.

If I were aromantic, I assume I would think of Your Name as another good film that didn't click with me the way it did with others, but if that were the case I think it would be easier to accept my feelings toward the film. I've felt like I was missing something from myself that I needed to appreciate stories before, but I have never felt like the missing thing should be there instead of accepting that I just didn't have it.
