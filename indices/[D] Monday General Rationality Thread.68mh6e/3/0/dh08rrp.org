Romantic love is tricky. I think TV doesn't describe it well at all, and I don't read romance novels so I can't help you out there (I'm writing one, though, but that's another story...). The things that really do capture romantic love are the threads you see on [[/r/askreddit]] from time to time, you know, the "husbands/wives of reddit, what are your romance tips?" "how did you know she was the one?", "what is your number one tip for a happy marriage" - all those sorts of things. They're /real/ and they're wonderful.

Not being on the spectrum myself, I am not sure if my experience will help you much, but it might so I may as well share it.

So, when I was younger I went through a bit of questioning my sexual and romantic orientation like I think most people probably do. I'm pretty well settled on heterosexual (or heteroflexible?) and polyamorous now, but I added and removed labels a /lot/ from the ages of about 16-20, particularly when I was about 18.

I didn't start dating until I was 18, and the first guy, who I dated for about a year (let's call him Scott), was great. He was kind and respectful and also a giant nerd, /but I didn't feel anything for him/, like, romantically. I liked being around him and kissing him and all that, but after a year I didn't feel anything romantic. We eventually broke up after growing apart over the summer but remained best friends for about a year before I [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)][split on him]] hard and kind of ruined that entire friendship.

Anyway, the reason I share that is because at the time I identified as asexual, and while I was dating Scott, I was like, "is this romantic love? It's not, surely? I'd know it if I was feeling it?" and I was /terrified/ that I was aromantic as well.

But in my case - not in everyone's - that wasn't how things ended up. I started dating my husband and three months in I fell in love, like completely and totally. It's a wonderful feeling that can't be adequately described. I've fallen in love several times since then with various people I've dated, and it's wonderful. I relish it.

But if you'd asked me when I was 18 or 19 if that would ever happen, I'd probably frown and say, "I hope so, but I don't think so". I was awkward and felt like this whole romance thing was a world beyond me, and I was just completely and utterly inexperienced. But when it happened, it took me by surprise because I was convinced I wasn't capable of it.

In terms of /how/ to /do romance/, well, that depends on your age. Also your gender. I'm happy to offer you advice if you're a heterosexual woman but I'm guessing you're not, and dating as a heterosexual man is a completely different beast.
