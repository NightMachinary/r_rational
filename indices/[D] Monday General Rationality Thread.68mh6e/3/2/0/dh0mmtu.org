Not everyone liked the romance and that's fine, it has flaws, but my feelings were contradictory so I couldn't pin down whether I did or didn't like it. I've concluded that I /should've/ been invested in it since I liked literally everything about this movie in spite of the flaws, but wasn't invested due to my lacking the emotional understanding to connect with the story rather than any issue with the substance of it.
