I've generally avoided stories that focus primarily on romance since I rarely felt satisfaction from watching them. Most of the exceptions for me have been about a couple /after/ they've already fallen in love. However, I did end up loving Yuri on Ice, so apparently I have the capacity to enjoy the kind of romance that's a bit...silly.

Your Name was just the first romance I've seen that where the couple barely spoke to each other and I didn't think that was a problem. I was absorbed in literally everything related to the romance except for the romance itself. I didn't get invested in the core emotion of the story the rest was built around and I couldn't find a reason for it so I got introspective.
