I recently made a LW post on how the typical akrasia framing misses out on a lot of the nuances.

It might be interesting for people trying to figure out how to solve problems like motivation, procrastination, etc.

Basically, my point is that solving "getting your shit together" problems requires being specific about what problem you're trying to solve. Obvious, I know, but I hadn't explicitly verbalized it as such until recently.
