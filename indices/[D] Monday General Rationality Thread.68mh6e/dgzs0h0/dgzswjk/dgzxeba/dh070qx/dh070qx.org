I never did understand romantic feelings myself. How do they differ from other feelings that I have for my friends and family? I have been in romantic relationships, or that's how other people would classify them. All of them evolved from friendships. Mostly feelings of enjoying spending time with the other person, caring about them and their life, wanting to know more about them. And enjoying physical contact as a subset of those. All of those I feel for friends/family with varying intensity. Am I missing some emotion that I don't feel, that makes romantic relationships different?
