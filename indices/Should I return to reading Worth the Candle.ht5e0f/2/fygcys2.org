Honestly, I kind of like the narrative thing, because we're never /entirely/ sure whether it's actually true, or just something Juniper is seeing due to his own background. Maybe Aerb does run on Joon-style narrative. But maybe it runs on Arthur-style narrative, which is subtly different. Or maybe it's neither; it's just that Joon and Arthur came close to getting the framework right.

Essentially, we still don't know if there are underlying frameworks that Joon is missing entirely, which could become problematic. He seems to have found something which is broadly correct, but the world is stuffed to the gills with weird shit that can suddenly leap out and be horrifying. We already know that there are memetic agents, memory-wipers, and ways to alter people fundamentally. How do we know that such things didn't happen to Arthur - and might have /already happened/ to Joon and co?
