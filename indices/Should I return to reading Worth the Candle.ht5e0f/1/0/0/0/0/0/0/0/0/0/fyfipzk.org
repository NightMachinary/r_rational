The prose is very poor, and every character's dialogue felt the same. Nobody had a unique 'voice'. And honestly I didn't find the world or plot very interesting outside of a few details (i like psychic spiders). That comment, "i like psychic spiders" is honestly the only good thing I can think of to say about the 80~ chapters I read of that story.
