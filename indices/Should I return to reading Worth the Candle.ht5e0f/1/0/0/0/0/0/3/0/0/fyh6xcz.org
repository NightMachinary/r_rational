As a fan of MoL I can definitely say that it has its share of weaknesses (so does WtC), and I suppose these can be a deal-breaker for some people. I.e. regarding the plot, the tension was pretty low for a good part of the third arc, once it was determined that the red robe has fled the loop.

That said I was one of the "Wow, this story was a great ride and I'm so sad it's over! ....here's hoping for an epilogue!" people, and the person you're replying to had completely missed the point behind these comments (the point was, we want more of the good stuff, not that the story was bad. If it wasn't we wouldn't be asking for more, duh).
