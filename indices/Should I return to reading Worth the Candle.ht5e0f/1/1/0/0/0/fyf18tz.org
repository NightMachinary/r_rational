Nah, every single LitRPG out there right now is written in a terrible, stilted, amateurish style. I've tried basically every single popular one and that is what always ruins them for me.

It isn't a matter of making the plot more rational or anything like that, it's just the fact that for 99% of them they are the authors first work in any genre. And it shows.
