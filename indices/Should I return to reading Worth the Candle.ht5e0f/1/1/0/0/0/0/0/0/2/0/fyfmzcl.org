TWI is becoming a weird anomaly. The author keeps getting better, even as the story keeps getting larger and larger. I think arc 7, the latest, is by far the best. It's just inhuman to not get burned out, run out of ideas, or lose the plot after 5 million words.

But, it's a long haul to reach the very best material. My advice: if a particular character annoys you, just skip their sections. A lot of readers apparently do that for characters they find disagreeable or morally objectionable.
