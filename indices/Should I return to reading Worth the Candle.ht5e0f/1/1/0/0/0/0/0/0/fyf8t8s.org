The Wandering Inn started off as quite unremarkable, even boring / frustrating, but it's my absolute favorite now. I'm basing that solely off arcs 6 and 7, but I think it's fair to consider the latest 2 million words of a 5 million word fiction. The problem is how a new reader would get into it. Skimming? That's unique to webfic; no traditional fantasy author ever had to worry about spending their entire career on one ongoing story, and they all have notoriously bad stories / series that got buried under new stuff (e.g. Glen Cook's Dread Empire versus the Black Company).

Similarly to TWI, I tried PGtE and bounced out early on, but never gave it another chance. We've been arguing all through this thread but I suspect we're actually seem pretty similar in terms of taste, so I guess I'm going to pull up my socks and give it a real try. Thanks (if I don't hate it).
