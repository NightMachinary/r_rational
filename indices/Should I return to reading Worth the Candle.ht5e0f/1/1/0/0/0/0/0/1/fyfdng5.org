Totally agree about the wandering inn. It started out as a weird little 4/10 story but now it's the height of my day whenever a new chapter comes out. Mostly the the negative things i see from other readers is that it's too long or that pirateaba changes character perspectives too often. But all the people that say that just don't get the story or the format it feels like. It's a huge story and it's gonna take years and years to tell it properly. I read all the popular stories on here and love the wandering inn as well. Not because it's rational but because it's just good.

Im not an english speaker and I was a little drunk but this looks fine to me. I had to give TWI some love.
