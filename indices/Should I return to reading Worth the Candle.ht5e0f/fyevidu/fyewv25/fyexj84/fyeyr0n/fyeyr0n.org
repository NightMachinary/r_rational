Eh, I wouldn't call everything else garbage, not by a long shot. I think LitRPG is actually much harder to rationalize and turn into a believable story than the broader fantasy genre, because it's inherently about something trivial (a game) that has no reasonable purpose for existing (especially looking at the grimderp System Apocalypse stories here).

WtC kind of slides around that criticism by acknowledging that the world is fucking ridiculous and utterly broken, and that the reason for that is that it's a poorly cobbled together collection of ideas from a single person, and also only exists to antagonize that same person. In other words, it didn't find a "solution" for the challenge facing the genre as a whole, it just created a very specific solution for itself -- and that solution still has the potential to fall apart when the story reveals the full justification for it.

Some other stories are trying to create fully-fledged worlds that matter for more than a single character and/or provide a solution that would work for the whole genre, and I think that's worth points for effort, and mega points for success, if any should actually succeed.

... goddamnit I word too much.
