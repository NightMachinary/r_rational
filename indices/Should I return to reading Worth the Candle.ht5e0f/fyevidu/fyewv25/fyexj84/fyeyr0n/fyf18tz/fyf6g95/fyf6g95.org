That's true in general. But I also think the average quality of new stories has risen over the past year. Compare something like Seaborn or the Menocht Loop to the top new fictions from 2-3 years ago on Royalroad and I think you'd agree they don't deserve to be put in the same bucket, even if you still don't like the two I named.
