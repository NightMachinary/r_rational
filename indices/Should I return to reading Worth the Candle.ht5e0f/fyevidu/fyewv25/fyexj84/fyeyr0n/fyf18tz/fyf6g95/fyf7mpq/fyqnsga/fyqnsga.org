Interesting...I haven't looked at it in a while. Can't remember exactly where I was up to (there are sooo many different points of view) but I think it wasn't all that long after the Doctor walked out on the battlefield. And Erin recently shut down the portal to a lizardman city because the city officials were complaining that it was a security breach, and then they wanted to seize it for themselves.
