Oh, I looooooooved the worldbuilding in Twig. It's an amazing premise that nobody else has succeeded with the same way. I don't mean to give the impression that I hated the story, I ate up most of it. But every single fight or emergency, they only escaped by the skin of their teeth, and the escalating pattern ultimately felt predictable for me. That's not a pattern I see in all fictions, or even most.
