Oof, Worm's author is offender #1 when it comes to writing predictable challenges that scale to exceed the power of the characters by the precise amount needed to be nearly impossible. He's gotten worse about it over time, too. I tried to start Ward a couple weeks ago and had to nope out after the first fight, because it was just a frustrating, shitty mess of "ooh I'm slightly too strong for you".

I actually felt like WtC was partially based on wanting to call out the narrative theory cycle that produces that kind of stuff. And that was even fun, until it went on for too long.
