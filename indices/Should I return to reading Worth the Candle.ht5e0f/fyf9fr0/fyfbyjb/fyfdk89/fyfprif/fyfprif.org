I actually think that was the intention of the entire conclusion to that book. To demonstrate once and for all that Juniper has reached a level beyond comprehension/mortal levels. I'm not sure where the author is going to go with it, but I think the exclusion zone with Doris is better in the end because of it. That we are back to him solving problems with guile now that he has demonstrated that most simple martial challenges in the world are binary for him (either he will obviously win, or obviously not).
