I think he is going for it as well, but I think he is doing it to subvert it.

The way I view it is that it was necessary for the narrative theory to be addressed in character due to the plot. But further than that I think it's a predictable sequence for a little while because the author is trying to make sure we "get" how the meta-narrative system works (kind of like PGtE, if you've ever read that, but in a more acknowledged way).

I'm not quite sure when you stopped, but after it's established to an extent the author begins to subvert it and play with it. Because now that the characters are aware of it, it's no longer a useful way to predict what happens sort of thing. If I knew when you stopped and what specific parts you took issue with I might be able to better answer if it gets subverted or not.
