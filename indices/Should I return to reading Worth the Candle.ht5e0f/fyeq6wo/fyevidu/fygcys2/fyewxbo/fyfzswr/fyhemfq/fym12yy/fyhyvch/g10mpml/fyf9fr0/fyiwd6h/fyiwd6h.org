If you're into literary rpgs I'm liking Elemental Arena. I'd place it in the same bracket as Delve. Elemental Arena is above in pacing, perhaps as it's earlier on in its development and still has a kind of frantic energy that comes from a life or death story, but I also really like how well integrated the system is into Delve's world.
