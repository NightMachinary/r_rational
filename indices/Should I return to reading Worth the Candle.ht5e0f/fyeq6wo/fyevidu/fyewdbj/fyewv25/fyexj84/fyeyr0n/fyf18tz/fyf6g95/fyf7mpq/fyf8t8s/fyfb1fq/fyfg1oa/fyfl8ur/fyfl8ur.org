Gotta chime in that you need to read Practical. The first arc is a little slow, but particularly from book 2 onward it's absolutely on another level compared to anything else on TWF or on Royal Road. From your comment I may need to give Wandering Inn a 3rd try, I kept getting stopped at the first or second chapter. Honestly it being insanely long is a plus for me, I keep knocking out million word stories in a week and as long as I know it gets better I'll probably stick it out. The writing in the first chapter and a half is almost painfully stilted though.
