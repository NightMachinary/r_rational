For sure I can agree with that, stuff like Delve, while not actually "good" is 10000x better than some of the older stuff that was almost unanimously praised at the time. The authors who have been at it a little while have been getting better and better too.

For example, The Wandering Inn was barely readable to me at first and I dropped it like 5 times during the first couple arcs but I think it's genuinely good now, I look forward to the releases every week. Practical Guide to Evil was really roughly written at first too and I love that one now as well. For both of those though, Wandering Inn started off LitRPG and is pretty much just a fantasy story now, and Practical guide was always just fantasy. The litrpg genre is getting better but still just really rough.
