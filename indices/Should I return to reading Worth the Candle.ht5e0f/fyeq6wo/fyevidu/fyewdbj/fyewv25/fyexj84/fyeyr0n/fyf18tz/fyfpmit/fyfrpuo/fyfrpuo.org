The webfics, not all LitRPG, that I have open on my phone right now (meaning I'm at least mildly interested in another chapter) are The Wandering Inn, Wake of the Ravager, Delve, the Zombie Knight, Seaborn, A Journey of Black and Red, Blessed Time, Returning, and the Menocht Loop. Some other stuff I like, such as The Gilded Hero, update so infrequently that I periodically forget they exist.
