Yeah The Wandering Inn is wonderful now, it's just like a smooth, addicting read every chapter. There aren't many serials out right now that scratch the same itch. It's long-winded but I honestly prefer that in a serial. The author is insane no idea how she churns out 40-60k words a week this consistently.

But yeaaah I've never been able to recommend it to a friend lol. "Just lightly read/skim the first 1 million words and it gets great I swear!" Not the best sell.

And yeah I'm pretty convinced our taste is very similar, hope you didn't get the impression I was arguing angrily or anything, just a good discussion. I would thoroughly recommend PGtE, it's the same situation as Wandering Inn where the first 1/2 arcs are very mediocre but it gets much better. I think I've heard English isn't the authors first language and if true it makes perfect sense, it becomes more and more fluid as it goes.

Won't say it's my favorite or the best web serial out there but it's very good and worth reading if you like fantasy.
