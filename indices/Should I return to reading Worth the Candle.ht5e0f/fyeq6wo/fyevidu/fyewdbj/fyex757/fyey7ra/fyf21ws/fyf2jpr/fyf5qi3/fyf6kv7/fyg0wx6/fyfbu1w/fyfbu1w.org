Agreed honestly. The ending was very, very poorly done as well but was pretty much universally praised on this sub.

It was really lukewarm praise though lol like people felt really bad that they were disappointed. Like 90% of the comments on the last chapter were things like "Wow, this story was a great ride and I'm so sad it's over! ....here's hoping for an epilogue!"
