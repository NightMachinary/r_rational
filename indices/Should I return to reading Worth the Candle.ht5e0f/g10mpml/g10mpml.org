While in the begining of the story, the difficulty of encounters was obviously being scaled to his combat power, more it seems that obstacles are being crafted to challenge his own growth. To pass a specific obstacle he must overcome one of his personal failings, instead of just figure out how to hit very hard.

While to a point can be a different brand of predictable, I think it still allows a varied and shifting story.
