Having read it:

- There is less rationality than Game of Thrones
- It is high fantasy, with excessive amounts of magic, gods, etc. Not really that similar to Game of Thrones in tone in a lot of ways.
- The characterization of various people in the story is mostly pretty weak; The individual characters aren't as strongly written and differentiated from each other as one could hope for.
- There's a lot of extremely extensive and interesting backstory, there is a complicated series of plots that are each not terribly complicated on their own but there are like fifty of them.
- The first book, Gardens of the Moon, is dramatically weaker than the others in the series. The books are independent enough that you could start with book 2 and 3 before book 1, to see if you liked the 'better' Malazan writing first.
- Setting elements are unique and interesting.

Overall, there's a lot to like, and a lot to hate. I would suggest it for readers of the fantasy genre as a whole, but I do not think it has much real rationality in it, so if you specifically look for that you will be disappointed. I would caution against buying the entire ten book set at once - a library to get book 2 and see if you like it would probably be your best bet.
