Not rationalish:

There are at least 3 'Mastermind' type characters (and at least another pair of 'trancendent' characters tying to play the same games) and their effectiveness is all by hand-waving, and not by on-screen thinking and plotting skills. The closest there is is a secondary character who is a financial genius who does some interesting plotting to take down an empire's economy via actually understanding it better than anyone else and that is mostly just one (later) book.

Interesting complex fiction, and really nice building of an ancient history with impact felt in the current setting, but not anything like 'rational' characters.
