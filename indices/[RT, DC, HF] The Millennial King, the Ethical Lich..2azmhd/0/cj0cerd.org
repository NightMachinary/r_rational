I usually have something like this in my D&D games - really do like necropolitan societies and doing away with the strict alignment rules of D&D. If you can make undead and they don't hopelessly corrupt the soul, then you really should, since they're a source of cheap labor and it's possible to collect them in ethical ways. (In my own campaign it was the Blood Queen, a vampire of immense age who also happened to be smitten with necromantic magics. She was the least evil of the pretenders to the throne.)
