That's a pretty good outline, but I think that the WMD is a bit much in terms of surprise reveal, a bit cliche in the realm of "extremists discarding their own morality to destroy the enemy". Simply gradually assimilating into the culture should be enough to make $protagonist turncoat, after an appropriate amount of self-reflection.

Once she accepts the following facts as true, she'd be operating in her own nation's best interests by opposing the "bomb plot".

Arran'ak would collapse if all the undead were wiped. Arran'ak's ethical church would be the best possible force to oppose the unending war against necromantic crimes in her homeland. Automated labor, rather than making it possible to subjugate the peasants, has the chance of creating the first example that world has of a middle class.

For a human element, $Protagonist could work a guard/preistess as a primary asset, develop feelings for them, and try and fail to convince them to take the final step into being an undead high member. Only they became that state earlier (maybe with a bunch of red herrings of the actual change date) been disguised with a strong illusion, and $protagonist can't figure out when her asset's "soul" was "destroyed".
