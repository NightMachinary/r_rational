Here's a pitch for you.

$protagonist has been sent by The Kingdom of Light to serve as a sleeper agent. She gives us the newcomer's perspective of the Kingdom of Arran'ak, tinged with a lifetime of training about why everything necromantic is dark and evil. She inserts herself into a secretarial role for a young necromancer.

Eventually she begins to come around and see that while necromancy certainly has some bad feelings associated with it, it's not strictly evil. She still goes on various missions in service of the Kingdom of Light. (The B-plot is something about a new kind of necromancy that allows communication with the dead to gain their assent to be used as corpses which would greatly swell the ranks of the undead, and allow exchange with other countries that have a wealth of skeletons in the ground.)

Late in the game, $protagonist is informed that there will be a weapon of light deployed against the undead which will effectively end the Kingdom of Arran'ak - it's only after she's told the necromancer she's apprenticed to that she learns the weapon that the Kingdom of Light is going to use is indiscriminate, and will kill /everyone/ in Arran'ak. From there, it's a race to stop the weapon/bomb/whatever from firing (preceded by a moment of truth for the $protagonist, I guess).
