I'm pretty sure it's just a little-used trope - the inversion of the trope where society looks like a utopia at first glance and is later revealed to be a crapsack world (seen in much of Philip K. Dick's work).

As a side note, I've always wanted a rendition of /The Sword of Good/ that was an actual full-length novel that took its world building a little more seriously.
