I really think a setting like this would make for an epic foundation for a fully fleshed out fantasy novel, especially if the story started out making the lich out to be an evil overlord who's enthralled a nation, and the narrator gradually makes concessions, accepts that various squicky things might not be so bad, especially with checks and balances, and eventually starts considering how to spread the new way of life with minimal fuss.
