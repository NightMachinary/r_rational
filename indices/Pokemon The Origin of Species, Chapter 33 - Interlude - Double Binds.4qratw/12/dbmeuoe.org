Been bingeing the story and looking at the chapter posts. But this is the first where the post wasn't archived. :D

Been really enjoying it so far. ~I like how you introduce the rational/empiricist themes more subtly than many authors do, and the characters haven't had ridiculous levels of success from the beginning simply by being more rational.

Also really excellent worldbuilding. You've managed to make the pokemon setting as depicted make internal sense without contradicting the main parts of the canon. But also given it a lot more interesting avenues and depth.

Only minor ciriticism would be in characterisation, I'd have difficulty describing the main characters much other than by their loose role in the story. Doesn't meaningfully affect my enjoyment of the story though.

Re Chapter 33

Interestingly we seem to see far more in battle switching in this interlude than in the battles before. That and the references to sweepers, etc makes em think that competitive battling in this is going to look more like the real world competitive metagame than the anime. Which makes sense if you have competent people competing and refining their techniques over time. Though the pokemon switching in the real world does depend heavily on type pairing, which seems not to operate the same way in this world. A potential overlap between Red and Blue's

Its good also to get a sense of how someone becomes a gym leader, and how that interacts with the Champion system. Still not super clear what the elite 4 do. Dooes a trainer have to beat them and the champion like in the games? Or is the champion decided by a tournament like in the show?

It occurs to me that we haven't really had a good in-universe explanation of why gyms specialise on a particular type of pokemon. Given their role as defence and training centres that would seem a disadvantage.

The after event review is also good and gives us a sense of how competent the movers in the setting are and how seriously they take incidents. I often hear people decry that sort of beaurocracy but it can be very useful.

Is “ no doubt as to efficacy the of ACE /training/” a typo or is he referring to the training programme rather than the trainers?
