Go deeper. Giovanni apparently had a plan to acquire, use, or study the fossils using the security personnel he would provide the excavation camp with. That plan had to be scrapped because the other leaders banded together.

Unless this is an Indy Ploy, Giovanni effectively set up a win-win situation. Either the renegade succeeds and he get the fossils he wanted, or he fails, and Giovanni falls back to the security personnel plan, only now he has a legitimate excuse to expand his leader domains, setting a precedent for future excavations.
