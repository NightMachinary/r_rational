Semi-canonically (IIRC, it's the case in the manga), the scientists that work on regenerating the fossils are either funded by or in the employ of Giovanni. Even were that not the case, I'd be surprised if he didn't have a hand in their actual research. They may have use in any research on Mew he was doing.
