  That and the references to sweepers, etc makes em think that competitive battling in this is going to look more like the real world competitive metagame than the anime. Which makes sense if you have competent people competing and refining their techniques over time. Though

Yeah, the anime's so full of weird move usage and type matchups, even at the top level of the championships, that I pretty much ignore it when thinking of what a competitive meta would look like in favor of examining the games (with some exceptions, like the power of pokemon like onix)

  Dooes a trainer have to beat them and the champion like in the games? Or is the champion decided by a tournament like in the show?
#+end_quote

It'll be more like the game.

  It occurs to me that we haven't really had a good in-universe explanation of why gyms specialise on a particular type of pokemon. Given their role as defence and training centres that would seem a disadvantage.

Yeah this hasn't been explored yet, but basically it's a mix of cultural norms, personal preference, and promoting a wide range of "experts." You don't want your best trainers in the region to all be specialized in training just 3 or 4 types of pokemon, after all: while a gym leader's "real team" consists of every kind of pokemon, their specialty ensures that they're the go-to expert on a given type, incase one is needed.

  Is “ no doubt as to efficacy the of ACE training” a typo or is he referring to the training programme rather than the trainers?

He's referring to the programme, yes :)
