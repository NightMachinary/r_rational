Good depiction of the Cerulean Cave this chapter, I must say. Really got the impression the game tried to give you from it, that it's supremely dangerous and deadly for almost all trainer who try and explore its depths. Was half-expecting the humanoid figure to be Mewtwo, honestly, but then we'd be down two humans :P

Giovanni really showed his charisma here too, it was quite interesting seeing him bend people to his POV just by suggestions alone.
