This. This is why I can't promise more frequent updates. This chapter was going to be about 6,000 words. I thought I might even publish early this month. Final count, about 10,000, and I still didn't cover everything I wanted to!

Ah well. Hope you enjoy it, and all feedback welcome!

My podcast with [[/u/AlexanderWales]] is ready to launch, and I'll be hosting and linking to it on [[/r/rational]] and my website this weekend. Thanks again to my patrons for their continued support, and I hope to get even more content up there soon!
