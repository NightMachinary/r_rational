This actually made me so happy :) I love psychic Pokemon the most, especially the beginning evolutions. Though I have one question; from the cartoons I watched growing up, it looked like Sabrina was basically an Alakazam herself, but in your story, Mewtwo says human psychics barely deserve the name. Just how powerful (in terms of, lets say, Pokemon levels) can human psychics become in Origin of Species, and are all psychics born equal or, even if you have the gift, is your potential decided by genetics?
