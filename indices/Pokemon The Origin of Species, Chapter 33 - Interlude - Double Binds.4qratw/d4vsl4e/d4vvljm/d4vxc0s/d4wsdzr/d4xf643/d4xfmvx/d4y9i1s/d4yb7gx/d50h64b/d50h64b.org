I'm interested to see how intelligent other psychic types are, personally. Could you converse effectively with an Alakazam? Would you be able to make friends with a wild one in the right circumstances? Questions like these. I know it's been stated at some point that psychic types aren't all they're made out to be in the games and anime, but still... it will be interesting to see.
