I think the issue is that we assume that Red lives in a rationalist piece of fiction, where /everyone/ has been working intelligently for some purpose. Thus, talented and powerful psychics must have already made a lot of progress in the area of understanding pokemon in that regard. In fact, I think Prof. Oak has an Alakazam and can use it in his research. I think it's safe to assume that people have already picked all the low-hanging fruit in the field, so he would not gain much for himself or for the field of pokemon research by blowing all of his assets on intensive psychic training.

Also, that would mean he would have to miss out on adventuring through the region with Blue and Green while he trains. ;)
