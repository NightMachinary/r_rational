  Could you converse effectively with an Alakazam?

Not really: as Giovanni said, alakazam is the smartest pokemon around but its problem solving skills are akin to a 3 year old child's. Think chimp/ape level intelligence.

To me a world where pokemon are intelligent enough for human communication, even if it's only a few species, is a world that looks so drastically different from canon games or anime or manga that it's barely recognizable. For one thing I don't see how humans can possibly survive with such incredibly powerful and intelligent beings around, especially before pokeball tech was invented, and for another, even if they do, the whole concept of essentially enslaving sapient creatures would sort of have to be the main focus of the story.
