Good point. However, I think it is still a fair point that Red would have a significant edge if he developed his psychic powers. I don't mean he should put his journey on hold and pay for lesson. I just think he should be taking a more active approach towards working at unblocking his psi potential while he journeys. Like maybe he could have asked the psychic who he spoke to if there were any exercises he could do on the road to help take down his mental blocks and develop his abilities, or he could be shown to be planning on catching a psychic pokemon, so that he can get used to mental communication; stuff like that, so that it doesn't feel like that plot element is going to be dropped for a while.
