This. This chapter is why I can't wait for Red to progress in his psychic training; not only is the ability extremely useful, it adds additional 'colour' to the character's narrative that I really like. Plus, if this is how useful being psychic is to a trainer, I can only imagine how useful being psychic would be to a professor, whose main goal is to understand Pokemon. Its the one pet peeve I have with this otherwise flawless story. I feel like Red is underestimating how incredibly useful his psychic talents are, if developed properly. To me (not that I'm some kind of super smart rationalist or anything), psychic powers would be worth a hefty investment.
