Really enjoyed this chapter. The gym leader chapters make a nice break from the travelling trio. And it's really interesting to see some of the other roles they perform on top of testing trainers.

Giovanni comes across as a very smart antagonist, that will use his position and charisma to get things done. Should be interesting to see how things develop.
