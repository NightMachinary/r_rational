I'm considering GURPS primarily, although I'll need to do some more research into it and other systems to find out if there's a better fit, but GURPS is generally my go-to for settings based around games. There are usually indie systems out there made for pokemon, naruto, or whatever, but they're usually not freeform enough for my liking.
