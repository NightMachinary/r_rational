You know, this is one of those stories that I'd be nearly as happy just getting slice of life updates from a bunch of characters as actually progressing the plot. The world is honestly kind of fascinating.

As an aside, [[/u/DaystarEld]] do you have a list of pokemon (non-spoilery, of course) you've written up that could be found in the various regions? I'm... considering GMing a pokemon game for some RL friends in a world approximately contiguous with this one, and that'd cut down on the prepwork I need to do before hand. No worries if you don't have one handy, though.
