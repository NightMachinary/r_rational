#+begin_quote
  light hits the ivysaur and immediately *cover*
#+end_quote

Should be "covers".

#+begin_quote
  Misty never felt so alive
#+end_quote

Missing full stop.

May also want to change it to "had never". "And John never died." doesn't sound the same as "And John had never died." If you did make that change, the line before it would need changing too.

#+begin_quote
  sending her *tentacruel* many limbs
#+end_quote

Missing ='s=.

#+begin_quote
  before the reporter *open* her mouth.
#+end_quote

Should be "opens".
