Yeah, it is fiction, I think the author wrote it as if passive-aggressive manipulation was a game of perfect information like chess where the best possible move against a grandmaster will be the same best possible move as against a novice, so the AI just needs to play against itself to improve and never needs to simulate weak opponents.
