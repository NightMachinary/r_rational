The problem with brain preservation is suppose it's utterly impossible to revive a brain. Then they've just committed committed suicide. And like the person above said, many people are capable of tricking others. Say you're advocating to an elderly person to go for brain preservation. How do they know you're more trustworthy than the person trying to sell them a trust share in Florida?

Brain preservation is a risk. A lot of people choose to not take that risk and just stick with what they know for sure is safe, because it can be hard to know if that risk has an 80% chance of success or a 1% or a 0.000001% chance.
