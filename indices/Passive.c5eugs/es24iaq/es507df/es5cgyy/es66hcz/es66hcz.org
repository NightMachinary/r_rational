Sure. And there's a couple arguments on this that are little known.

Personally, I think the odds that brain preservation will "work" is 100%, at least assuming the frozen samples survive until a future era and a future society is interested in reviving them.

That's because I'm using a different definition for "work". Specifically, I assume the future society could generate new human brains from scratch, with random neural weights. The proof that this is feasible, is, well, nature can do it.

Then each bit of information recovered from the frozen sample is a constraint on the random samples of neural architectures and weights.

The "noodle baking" part is your own living brain is really not storing information faithfully like you think, each recall of your memory and personality is really a random sample from a possibility space, with the stored values acting as constraints.

Viewed this way, there is an enormous number of very detailed constraints you can recover even from a badly frozen mess done a day after death.

Now, sure, better preservation is much better. People preserved well will be able to accurately recall their own memories, have personalities so close to the original to be indistinguishable, etc.

But for the worst victims of their death, it'll be similar to recovering from combination of dementia and stroke. Except the difference is, unlike elderly people, patients recovering with brand new digital brains that work better than their human hardware ever did, will actually be able to recover.
