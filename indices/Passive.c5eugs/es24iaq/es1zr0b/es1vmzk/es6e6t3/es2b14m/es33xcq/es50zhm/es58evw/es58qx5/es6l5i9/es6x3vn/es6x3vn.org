Disagree. Specifically, these breathless papers are producing models that work...80 or 95% of the time, depending on the specific problem.

This isn't superhuman performance, it's just human performance or very marginally better.

Problems where you have an objective measurement against your heuristic are ones where superhuman performance is possible.

Can go into more detail later.
