/Maybe/ . While it makes good sci fi, present AI technology has a very key limitation.

​

/You have to be able to objectively measure a correct answer/. This has wide ranging consequences. This means present technology is capable of solving things like the movements of a robot in a warehouse or object manipulation, even in dirty and chaotic environments. This is because you can accurately simulate these environments and in the simulation, accurately score how well the AI's policy is doing against a heuristic for success. This allows the AI to continue to improve, and given enough time and an accurate enough simulation, it will eventually improve to superhuman levels of performance. (in terms of heuristic scores. Obviously a badly designed heuristic will give you an AI that is amazingly consistent at doing a shitty job)

​

Note that the simulator can use AI itself, where a different AI system is doing it's best to make the simulation better reflect the behavior observed in the real world.

​

The reason such a simulator cannot yet be used to make a super-persuader is you need an accurate simulation of a human being in order to do this. This is probably achievable, but it will take a /lot/ of data. Note that this "simulation" I am describing isn't quite what you are thinking, you wouldn't be simulating an actual human mind, just modeling the probable responses a human being will have to any line of argument you might make.
