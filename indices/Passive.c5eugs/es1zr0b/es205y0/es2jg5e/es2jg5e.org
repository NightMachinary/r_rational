Yep. The one big upcoming technology I'm most interested in/scared of is superpersuaders. There won't be any radical change-- advertising techniques have been getting better and better for decades, if not centuries. But once the most powerful governments and corporations have techniques so sophisticated as to convince individuals, not just demographics, to do what they want, I fear what will become of everything from commerce to culture.
