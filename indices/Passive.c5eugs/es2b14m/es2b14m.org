Interesting humor, an AI that can convince people disagreeing with it will cost much more that their continued existence, just by manipulating their sense of guilt. Or the sense of shame? I'm not sure, maybe combination of them. It's not realistic, of course, since people will put down their feet unwilling to entertain the thought of surrendering their interest. Especially when said interest is their own life.

Good humor nonetheless.
