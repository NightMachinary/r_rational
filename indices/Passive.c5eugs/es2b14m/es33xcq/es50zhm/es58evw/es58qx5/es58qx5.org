Sure. There's another significant limitation that current AI methods are subject to: finding a good or locally optimal policy requires information. A lot of it and it needs to be accurate. So currently tractable problems generally require an accurate simulator and a way to calculate the heuristic from the sim state. Human beings are presently infeasible to simulate.
