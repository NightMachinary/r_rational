The point is that a sufficiently advanced persuader can convince people to be willing to entertain the thought of surrendering their interests. It's a slippery slope from there. If you precommit, they will get you to break that commitment. If you ignore, they will find a way to get your attention. If you remove your senses, they will find some other way to get their message across. A */sufficiently advanced/* persuader will turn /your/ interests into /their/ interests and there is nothing you can do to stop them.
