  That's why not having an open mind, and instead sticking to your opinions no matter what arguments your hear is a great strategy.

The flaw with /that/ is you can't correct any errors your thinking may have in it.

​

The specific error that most adults presently alive today, but who soon will not be, are making is they trust various bullshit artists, such as the medical directors of "memory care" centers, religious priests, popular fiction - all sellers of unadulterated bullshit, even the ones licensed by the state with medical degrees.

​

So even when they are diagnosed with Alzheimers/dementia and there is a clear and logical course of action - preserve their brain before all the memories are destroyed - they instead willingly let themselves rot into a vegetable and then a corpse.
