I agree that Jane going on horseback to Netherfield wasn't the best example. I think there are some better ones in Mansfield park. For example, Maria is in love with Mr. Crawford, but has already been engaged to Mr Rushworth. Mr. Crawford may love Maria in return, or he may just be flirting with her to stave away boredom while visiting his sister. On the other hand, even though Maria can't stand Mr. Rushworth, he is a sure thing and he's far more wealthy than Mr. Crawford. Maria decides to marry Mr. Rushworth, but then Mr. Crawford decides to run away with Maria- who actually loves him- rather than wait for Fanny Price to return his affection. The strategies get a little higher and more complex the more you read.

In any case, I think applying game theory is an interesting way look at any interactions where strategy and decision making come into play.
