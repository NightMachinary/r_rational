Eh, I don't particularly agree. "Having a strategy" and "Doing Game Theory" are not at all equivalent. Everyone, Absolutely Everyone, does things that they think will result in good outcomes for themselves. Game Theory, or Rational Thinking, is about figuring out the rules of how those outcomes follow from strategies at a basic level.

"If Elizabeth goes on horseback and it rains then she will have to stay the night. If she stays the night she has a higher chance of getting married." Uses logic to gain an advantage, but that's just ordinary thinking. A Level 1 play using Yudowsky's definitions.

A game theory approach would involve some amount of probabilities, or people reacting to a strategy and knowing that it is in fact a strategy. Game Theory with only one player immediately deteriorates into "pick the strategy with the highest score." It's not really Game Theory.
