Excellent chapter, one of my favorites so far! I really cannot get enough of the top-notch banter. I know I am repeating myself from my last comment, but as intriguing as the plot promises to be, I'd love this story even if it were just 100% comprised of ordinary school life and constant witty banter. The characters really do have a life of their own. I wonder, does Mooderino just effortlessly come up with these amazing dialogues or is there a lot of hard work behind them?
