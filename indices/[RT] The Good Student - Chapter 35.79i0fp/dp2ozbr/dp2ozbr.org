  Pencil. What do you see? You see a pencil, correct?

Not if I have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia][aphantasia]].

  [Nic] was trying to portray himself as the hero, acting out of noble purpose. It was hardly that. In truth, he wanted [Dizzy] to know he was saving her, to sob over his grave, knowing he had sacrificed himself for her.

Hmm, that definitely reminds me of [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-19][something]]...

  The door banged against the wall as it was flung open and Nic ran in. [Simole] had called him and he'd come, not knowing what he'd find, what danger he'd face. Foolish boy.

  He didn't see her or the doorway. She could make herself known to him, but there was something about his despair at finding her limp, lifeless body that she found perversely pleasing.

Damnation. If the latter segment was from Dizzy's PoV, it would have made Dizzy x Nic romance so much more morbidly fascinating. As it is, it doesn't give much ground even for joking about either Dizzy or Simole and Nic deserving each other.
