I appreciate your review but it honestly seems to me that you didn't bother reading the info where I specifically stated it was an alternate universe fanfic. It doesn't follow canon and will deviate the more you continue reading. You seem far, far, far too stuck on the idea of "it has to be like canon" instead of actually examining it for it's own merits...

Also, canon Naruto had Sakura courting Sasuke occasionally. I mean, there was even a story arc between her and Ino about who would get Sasuke's affection during the in-between periods of the Chuunin exam storyline in the CANON story.

Suffixes are used haphazardly in real life Japanese culture. They don't use sensei and other such terms all the time.

Anyway, thanks for reading and letting me know. I agree with your point about it moving too fast. I basically was but it was important to explain certain events. I'm not sure you actually took the time to finish it at all judging from your lack of comments on the latter portion and obvious misunderstanding of the AU nature since I did go into AU territory upon Zabuza's arrival into the story.

But thank you all the same; I don't want to sound snobbish. I really am grateful you took the time to read it.
