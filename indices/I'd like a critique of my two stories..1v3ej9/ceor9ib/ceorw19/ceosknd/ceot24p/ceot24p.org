Yeah, I can see your point.

The purpose was actually to start with something familiar and slowly add the changes over time but I guess that didn't pan out too well, lol.

The 13000 words were entirely unintentional but I figured that people on fanfiction.net love reading and the larger the better. That was my thought process back when I wrote the chapter. I wasn't proven wrong for the most part but I did make it too big. I apologize for that.

As for courtship, I'll just let you know that it's part of the reason it's an M-rated fanfic. I tried to go for a more medieval type of approach as far as the culture. The canon story doesn't make sense as far as cultural norms go so I tried to make it more realistic.

The shinobi are the equivalent of the military as such they grow faster as a reaction to being put into a dangerous life. In ancient cultures, people had marriages at age 13. That seems absurd to us now but back then it was the norm. That was part of the reason I did it. The canon Naruto series had Sakura and Ino trying to date Sasuke at every given moment in the early storyline so this wasn't even too far of a deviation.

Suffixes do have a meaning but I think you're overstating how often they're used. They'll be used as a greeting or when someone is very formal as a matter of decorum but on a personal level and especially in combat situations; I don't find the use in formality realistic. I feel this is doubly true if we're speaking of kids.

I don't plan on having any sex scenes in any descriptive sort of way. I planned to write a timeskip like the canon series if I had made anything like that but I felt expressing how normal the idea of dating at such a young age was part of their culture. I honestly did base it off seeing the canon series too.
