I think you should have considered the pacing issues of your story more closely. Your chapter 1 was ~13,000 words (not counting author note). It was basically a retelling of a story your target audience already knows with a super!Naruto. The fic could change a lot after that and improve and become something new that noone has ever seen before, but if you ask people to read 13,000 words of shlock before that happens a lot of people will abandon ship at some point before hitting "Next chapter". Or even the end when things start to deviate. 13,000 words is seriously about 4 chapters of Harry Potter (that number of words puts you at about the border between of Chapter 4 and 5 in The Sorcerer's Stone, for example, and represents over 1/6th the word count of the whole book). Start in the Wave arc or something instead and you could have cut the length before you get to something new and interesting down substantially. First impressions are important. If the first page of something doesn't grab me, the odds I will make it to the end of the chapter are low. If the first chapter has nothing good in it, the odds that I will go to the next chapter instead of going to read something else is pretty slim.

As far as courtship goes, my writing was probably a fairly visceral reaction mostly to Naruto's use of "Nobody but his lover had ever intimately touched him like that." in your first chapter. If you had substituted girlfriend instead of lover it would be substantially less creepy. The idea of romantic stuff is not so bad, if perhaps better played for laughs than played straight, but the idea of 12-year-old characters actually having sex is really not something I am interested in reading.

Edit: Suffixes not being used has a meaning, as does using san vs chan vs kun vs etc. If you use them rarely, you can't use not having a suffix appropriately. It just reads really strangely, to my eyes. A lot of light novels' amateur translations for example actually just preserve all suffixes from the native japanese and in those the dialogue has them pretty much always using -san/-chan/-kun suffixes when characters talk to each other, which is fine. Or you can go a more complete 'official' translator route and go from "Naruto-baka" to "Naruto, you idiot!". But mixing the two seems weird to read.

I did finish the first chapter, but i stopped picking out elements to nitpick for grammar, word choice, random hyphens, etc. part way through. I didn't read any of the later chapters, so if they are amazingly different then... I don't know, perhaps you should have lead with them and let the prologue go hang? Or summarize hard and only write as much of the prologue as actually changes a lot from canon?
