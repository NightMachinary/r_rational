I guess I'll just start writing, but not in order. I do want to design it all from the start to avoid pointless plotlines and filler (and plotholes) but just doing plans instead of actual text is slowing it down to essentially stopped.

On the other hand I just wrote the last scene...of the sequel. This is going to take a while.
