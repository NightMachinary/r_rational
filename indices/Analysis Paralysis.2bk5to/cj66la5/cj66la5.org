Definetly the right place, though you should have added [Q][D] in the title.

Have you written the rough draft for a whole chapter? You might get a better idea on what it needs if you do. You can then go back filling in and removing details as needed.

Also, don't stress out too much. If you're posting to a fanfic site, you can get immediate feedback from us on how you can improve. You can then revise the chapter if you want, and you'll better know what to do for the next one. Right now the most important thing is to get stuff out there to start up a feedback loop.
