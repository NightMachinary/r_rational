Couple of suggestions for you based on how I do things. Obviously, YMMV:

- Write something. No matter how blank you are, you can write a sentence. Even if it's intensely stupid, just putting words on the page will help you keep going.
- Don't worry about writing chronologically. I had a particular scene that just *would not* come out. So, I skipped it and wrote the bit that came after it, figuring I'd go back and write the hard scene later. Turns out I never did and it didn't matter.
- Set yourself a tight deadline and stick to it. I publish a new chapter of 2YE every Saturday, period. The discipline really helps prevent analysis paralysis; you know you have to write something, so you do.
- Don't worry about outlining and planning too much. I've been doing 2YE almost entirely through discovery writing -- I have an overarching plot arc in mind and I have specific events I want to work in, but I have no idea how I'm going to get from point A to point B. It means I enjoy writing it because I'm really just taking dictation from my hindbrain.

The discovery writing has had some really interesting effects. Loki was never intended to be part of the story. He just wandered in and made himself at home, and he's gradually taken up a larger and larger role. He's now probably my favorite character.

Also, sometimes my characters surprise me. I had this big war planned, lots of battles and drama, [[#s][and then]] without talking to me about it.
