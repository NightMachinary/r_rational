You could tweak the story to make it believable.

For example with point A if you want him to be more believing make him somewhat religious, worshipping Kami and believing in Kotodama, and as such somewhat open to some of the premises of magic. You can delay his awakening while he handles that.

Point B, since you're wondering how things lasted that long have some degree of decay. Have Yami set up an unstoppable combo of death, explain it clearly to Yugi, and then have elements... fail, melt into dust.

Point C, since presumably Yami is planning this, have a card monster do it. Maybe the wizard. Have him set off a trap, causing part of the ceiling to fall in, and then charge in to push Yugi to safety. A moment's recognition, eye staring, then he runs off.
