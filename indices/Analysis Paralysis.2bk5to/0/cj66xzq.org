It happens to me quite a bit - I have a large number of currently unfinished projects for that very reason. Getting over it ... well, the solution to the majority of writing problems is "just write", and the solution to most of what's left over is "fix it in post" - or to put it another way, "just edit".

So it depends on the natural of the analysis paralysis. I tend to steal relentlessly when I find myself stuck on details like names, which are always tricky (less so in fanfic), and I've gotten in the habit of grabbing the closest television show or movie and picking something from deep in the credits. I steal from my own life quite a bit, and model characters on people that I've known (or myself). If you just pick something at random, you can always fix it later on when you're editing if it ends up being stupid or not working - though the bigger the thing, the harder it will be to fix. Since you never have to go with the first draft, sometimes it just makes the most sense to stick in whatever the first dumb idea is. My other trick is to brainstorm solutions, number them, and then roll a die. If I don't like what the die says, that tells me something about what I should actually do.

If you've got some examples of the things you're trying to think up, I might be able to help more.
