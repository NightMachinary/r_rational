First chapter outline from memory rather than overextensive notes:

- Yugi goes on Egypt excavation with grandfather (probably illegally).
- Somehow, Yugi gets separated in a way that is believable and doesn't make him look stupid.
- Yugi finds the Puzzle and touches it. Yami is inside it and challenges Yugi to a shadow game in exchange for the way out. If Yugi wins, Yami shows him the way out. If Yami wins, he kills Yugi and takes over his body.
- Yugi goes through some sort of shadow game / obstacle course with Yami's traps. No idea how that will work. I'm thinking physical traps and danger rather than magic stuff, but that sort of flashy thing might be better suited to a visual medium rather than text so I'm not sure. Also I have no idea how to design traps that last for thousands of years and still work.
- Yugi succeeds, Yami doesn't kill Yugi. Yami explains the basics of how the Puzzle works. Yugi is technically the owner of the puzzle from the moment he touched it, but he doesn't know that it's protecting him. By agreeing to the game he consented to the risk, so if he'd lost Yami could have killed him even if Yugi's body couldn't be physically damaged by the traps. If the terms of the game were slightly different, the traps also could have harmed him physically, but Yami didn't want to take over a mangled nearly-dead body.
- Yugi doesn't need to physically keep the Puzzle with him, and once claimed, Millennium Artifacts cannot be stolen. He leaves it in the tomb because he can teleport it to him any time he wants. For now he keeps it a secret that he's the owner. Follows Yami's honest instructions out of the tomb, finds his grandfather. They go home.

After that, miniarc involving school or local town tournament for some prize. Throwaway villains from the school, explain the card game, etc. Yami takes an interest in the game when he recognizes certain cards based on history that happened during his time. This miniarc will actually be very hard to write because it will focus proportionally more on the card game than characters and plot.

Pegasus throws a tournament and invites three students from Yugi's school to it (Bakura, Kaiba, Yugi). In the letter he subtly implies that he knows about Yami, which is surprising since Yami/Yugi haven't told anyone about that.

MI6 starts with the Millennium Key. The Key played a critical role in information gathering during the cold war, and MI6 recently learned of the existence of other similar tools and that Pegasus had some connection to them. M reviews Q's report on the Millennium Key, briefs Bond on the situation, sends him in undercover as a competitor in Pegasus's tournament. The real plot begins.

Problems:

- I dislike the obligatory OMG the magic related to the premise of the story is real freakout speech that I'm inevitably going to need a few times. Not sure how to believably minimize that. I don't want to go all out Death Note and have him just believe it unquestioningly, but I don't want to have him be annoyingly skeptical either, because while it would be rational given his knowledge, it would just slow down the plot. Maybe if Yami doesn't tell Yugi who he is at first and Yugi thinks he's an actual physical person. That would delay the problem.
- The shadow game has to be compelling. It has to be difficult, but not impossible.
- Yugi has to get separated in a believable way. I could just make his grandfather an asshole and run ahead and turn out the flashlight as a prank but I don't think I want to go that way.
- Depending on how that works, the dialogue when Yugi reunites with his grandfather could be awkward.

That ended up even more detailed than my notes, but whatever.
