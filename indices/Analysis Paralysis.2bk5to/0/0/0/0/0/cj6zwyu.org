You don't necessarily have to say "The dark magician then saved Yugioh." Just something like "He felt a thud as the stones fell and then was slammed to the floor. His vision blurred and his head pounded. Above him he saw intense blue eyes. Then, in a flash of purple, the person was gone." Foreshadowing, like with pokemon and Ho-Oh in the first episode.

Unless Yami doesn't have access to him or whatever. Or you really don't want to use him.
