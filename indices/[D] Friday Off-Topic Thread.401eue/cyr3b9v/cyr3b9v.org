Please [[https://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3zpqku/holy_crap_the_otherkin_vs_transactivist/cyq1vt6?context=6][evaluate my evaluation]] of [[http://www.annelawrence.com/brain-sex_critique.html][Anne Lawrence's evaluation]] of Chung's and Hulshoff Pol's relevance as rebuttals of Zhou's and Kruijver's results regarding the size and cell count of the BSTc as an indicator of transsexualism in particular, and as rebuttals of the entire theory of 'brain sex' (brain gender), that is brain features that strongly indicate gender identity (while not excluding the existence of brain features that strongly indicate genetic sex and sex hormone exposure), in general.

I previously only read Hulshoff Pol's study regarding gross brain volume as a result of cross-sex hormone exposure and presumed that gross brain volume was the trans-indicative feature being proposed by Zhou/Kruijver, and that Zhou and Kruijver were the only results relevant to the 'brain sex' theory. I made this assumption in good faith of Lawrence's intellectual honesty and credibility as a presumed scientist (though she has an MD in anesthesiology, a PhD in sexology, and an MA in psychology, she does not in fact appear to be very scientific).

I was hesitant of Lawrence's intellectual honesty and credibility, given her wholehearted acceptance of Blanchard's typology of transsexualism as either 'homosexual' (androphilic) or 'autogynephilic' (gynephilic) and etiology of transsexualism at least in the latter case being conditioning from autogynephilic masturbation. This typology and etiology is unsupported, insulting, and harmful, and it's a bit of a nightmare to hear that Lawrence is (was?) in WPATH and Blanchard is (was?) on the DSM-V committee regarding gender. I was willing to bite the bullet, however, so I stopped my examinations at Hulshoff Pol's results and the fraction of Lawrence's critique that was presented to me and was prepared to accept that 'brain sex' as a whole was debunked.

I should not have. After a perfunctory visit to /Wikipedia/ for biological indicators of transsexualism, I discovered that not only was Hulshoff Pol completely irrelevant to Zhou, Kruijver, and Chung, not only did Zhou and Kruijver control for sexuality /and/ cross-sex hormone exposure, contrary to Lawrence's misrepresentation, not only did Chung not raise serious doubts about BSTc size and cell count as an /indicator/ (though it still indicates reversed causality, as the BSTc becomes differentiated in adulthood (though BSTc may still be part of the direct etiology of dysphoria itself)), and not only does Chung itself theorize a brain-anatomical explanation for BSTc's delayed differentiation, there are now /four additional studies,/ three on brain structure, one on brain response to pheromones, that all support the 'brain sex' theory. In other words, the TERF site that the quote was probably pulled from denouncing 'brain sex' and the presentation of Lawrence's critique in TiA as "debunking" 'brain sex' is outdated at best.

So, first of all, presenting Lawrence's critique as a "debunking" of 'brain sex' in general without doing further research is intellectually dishonest. If you don't think to check the Wikipedia article for more up-to-date results, you're not even /trying/ to reach the truth, you're trolling for the first remotely plausible thing supporting your preconceptions that falls into your lap. Second of all, Lawrence's critique is intellectually dishonest itself. Her "second most plausible explanation" relies on invalidating the reported sexuality of the Zhou/Kruijver subjects by appealing to autogynephilia: the 'homosexual' (androphilic) transsexuals were mistaken in their attraction to men; they were instead attracted to themselves having sex with a man as a culmination of womanhood, and so are instead 'autogynephilic' transsexuals. This is blatantly motivated reasoning, and relies on the unsupported autogynephilic etiology to support the typology.

Her "most plausible explanation" relies on an even grosser misrepresentation. Her entire debunking relies on exposure to cross-sex hormones explaining the trans-indicative difference in BSTc volume and cell count. To do so, she points to Hulshoff Pol, which reveals that gross brain volume is affected by exposure to cross-sex hormones, and that cell count is a probable affector in brain volume. The problem with this is of course that Hulshoff Pol does not in the slightest look at the size or cell count of the BSTc itself, so it cannot be counted as an overturning of Zhou/Kruijver or a non-replication. Indicators of genetic/gonadal sex do not contravene the indicators of gender identity. In addition, Zhou and Kruijver themselves address exposure to cross-sex hormones! This is only covered as a complete afterthought to the "debunking," with Lawrence minimizing their importance, referencing only two controls and ignoring the other ~six, including among them a trans-indicative transgender with no orchiectomization or cross-sex hormone exposure whatsoever.

The biggest problem, however, with Lawrence's explanations, is that they rely on Zhou/Kruijver being undermined by Chung and rendered irrelevant by Hulshoff Pol. Hulshoff Pol, however, is irrelevant, Chung does not undermine Zhou/Kruijver as an indicator, and subsequent results continue to point to 'brain sex' as a valid etiology of dysphoria, though neurological intersexedness itself is underexplored and itself has an unknown etiology. Lawrence's explanations are in light of a debunking that was entirely illusory.
