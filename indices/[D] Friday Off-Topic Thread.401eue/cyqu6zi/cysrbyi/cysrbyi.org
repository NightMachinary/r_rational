My personal preference is for ~12kw chapters, which would be a bi-weekly update schedule. I can live with weekly, but it won't hold up as well as a binge-or-reread breakdown.

From a perspective of maximising community interest (eg, here) monthly is too long; faster than weekly is too fast. Either per week or alternate weeks is good here too.
