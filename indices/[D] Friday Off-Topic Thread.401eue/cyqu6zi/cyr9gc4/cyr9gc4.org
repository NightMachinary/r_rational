Once a week is fine, biweekly just so as well. One week keeps the previous setting freshly enough in mind that I am not confused/need to reread the previous chapter. Also is often enough that I perceive it as regular update, hitting more of my dopamine/anticipation rewards.

1000/day is just unsatisfactory, I feel.
