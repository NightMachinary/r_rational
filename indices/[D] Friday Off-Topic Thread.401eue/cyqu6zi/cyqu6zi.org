What's your prefered chapter length for a web serial?

If I can write roughly 6,000 words per week that I'd be more or less happy with putting online, would it be better as:

1. 6,000 words once per week
2. 3,000 words twice a week
3. 1,000 words six times a week
4. 24,000 words once per month
5. Just finish the thing and publish it when it's done
