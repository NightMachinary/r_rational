I finished reading Frankenstein's Monster today. It's a good book, and deserve its status as a classic, but it maybe hasn't aged well. Leaving aside all the stuff in the side bar, it takes place in a world where people who experience something traumatizing can fall sick with fever and delirium for several months. More than once. Also, spoilers for the rest of the comment, I find it difficult to sympathize with Frankenstein. He spends months putting together a body (without using corpse parts) hoping to create life, then when it awakens he is so terrified of it that he locks himself in his room for a week hoping it will go away. Which it does.

Then months later when it confronts him and begs him to recognize it as a thinking, feeling being who wants to be good and doesn't want to live alone and shunned in the wilderness, he calls it a thing of evil that shouldn't exist. So... it kills his friends and family and taunts him until he goes mad. After hearing several times over the years that the monster isn't evil, I wasn't expecting it to go all Monte Cristo on him.
