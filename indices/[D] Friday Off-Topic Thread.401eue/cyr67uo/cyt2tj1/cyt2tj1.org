In Frankenstein, the obvious theme is you shouldn't dig up corpses and string them together to create life because /no/. (Which I don't really agree with.) But the deeper theme is that Frankenstein didn't create a monster out of corpse parts. He created one out of mistreatment and neglect. I think the author meant to show that Frankenstein's real mistake was in being unable to accept his creation and treat it decently. This extends to real life in that, while people aren't creating literal monsters out of dead bodies, they ARE creating monstrous human beings due to the way they treat them.

I wouldn't call the monster good. But I would say that it's turn to evil was understandable, in the same way that I'd say a serial killer who became that way due to years of abuse is understandable. Acceptable? No. And it's probably too little too late at this point, so put them down. But it's less their fault and more their environments. You're a product of it, after all.
