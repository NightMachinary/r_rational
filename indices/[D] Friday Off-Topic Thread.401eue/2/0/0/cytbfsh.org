  They also did not test non-transitioned transsexuals
#+end_quote

There was one non-transitioned person with "strong cross-gender feelings," and they placed in the trans-indicative range (though there are two male outliers in the same area).

#+begin_quote
  subjects who had been exposed to only brief periods of cross-sex hormones, with some being as short as a month
#+end_quote

S1 had an adrogenic tumor for "more than 1 year," S2 had an estrogenic (totally real words) tumor for "at least 1 year," S5 was orchiectomized and had "antiandrogen treatment" (?) for the last two years. FMT stopped taking testosterone three years before death. S2 as well, but FMT and S5 in particular placed strongly in the male range, S5 attaining abnormally outlier levels, and S1 also placed strongly in the female range.

It is the weakest part of the studies, to my frustration. A lot of subsequent studies used transsexuals with no exposure to cross-sex hormones, however. Luders had 24 untreated MTF samples for the right putamen result, Rametti had ?? untreated FTM samples for the fractional anisotropy result, and Berglund had ?? untreated MTF samples for the pheromone response result.

One problem I don't like is that Zhou/Kruijver use the same samples. Gender-linked INAH3 was found in [[http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/12/3132][*Garcia-Falgueras*]], though LeVay also reported a sexuality-linked INAH3 in men. They used the same samples, with four additional MTF samples, however. They possibly used different control samples as well, and may have gotten more S samples, I didn't check.

An interesting result I'm finding in Garcia-Falgueras is that they measured total brain weight, which I imagine corresponds to gross brain volume, and that total brain weight does not correlate with the volume of the uncinate nucleus nor the subnuclei they were measuring. This was probably done in response to Hulshoff Pol's results, as it was published in 2008, two years later (they even categorize by Blanchard's typology and find no result, this may have even been done in response to Lawrence and friends). So there is at least reason to believe that the BSTc and INAH3 would not relate to gross brain volume. I will update my skepticism accordingly, however. The dearth of control T samples is a major problem with these results.

Replication with more experimental and control samples would be ever-so-lovely. I hope MRI develops enough to be able to distinguish the BSTc and INAH3, and possibly to count cells, because a major hindrance to these results is that they have to be obtained post-mortem. Otherwise I would gladly volunteer. :P

Thanks for the in-depth response!
