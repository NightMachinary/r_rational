Okay, I read through the studies. I have no particular dog in that fight. Let me break things down so that I can understand them a bit better.

  There's a thing in the brain called a (BSTc). It's larger in men than in women. MtF transsexuals have a female sized one. Sexual orientation doesn't make a difference and neither do adult hormones.

  I did the same thing as Zhou, but where Zhou did volume of BSTc, I did a count of neurons. I used the same subjects and got the same result, but with the additional finding that FtM transsexuals have a male sized BSTc.

  We took a look at this BSTc thing you were talking about. Men and women /do/ have differently sized BSTces, but they're not different until puberty. Transsexuals report that they're the wrong gender before that. So we don't really know why that is, but our best guess is that something causes people to be transgendered before puberty and that thing also causes the BSTc to be different, maybe. But that's not what we were really studying.

  Transsexuals have brain volume according to their born gender. This changes with hormone therapy to the transitioning gender. Maybe this is causing what Zhou and Kruijver were seeing?

  The brain-sex theory is totally busted, thanks Hulshoff Pol. This means that what's really going on is that some transsexuals are that way because they think becoming a woman is the height of their sexual fantasy, and other transsexuals are that way because they think that's the best way to have sex with the opposite gender.

So ...

You're right that Lawrence is a fucking moron without an ounce of intellectual honesty and deserving of no credibility (my words, not yours). She's sensed weakness and jumped on the opposition so that she can champion her own pet theory. "You say X and I say Y. Here's some evidence that it's not X. Therefore it's Y." This is a crystal clear false dichotomy and she should be ashamed to have published that paper.

/But with that said/, I think you're being driven by your personal biases. The Zhou/Kruijver studies do control for cross-sex hormones, but do so in ways that I find extremely suspect and non-conclusive. Namely, their six transsexuals had been on hormone therapy for many years. The studies then compare those transsexuals against subjects who had been exposed to only brief periods of cross-sex hormones, with some being as short as a month. The BSTc volume/count might change over /years/ of hormone therapy but not over /months/. This is a hypothesis they did not test, nor control for, nor mention. They also did not test non-transitioned transsexuals, which is another significant weakness of the two studies. Further, while their controls were exposed to cross-sex hormones, they weren't exposed at the same dosages, in the same ways, etc. It's apples to oranges in far too many ways.

Hulshoff Pol /is/ a serious blow to Zhou/Kruijver, because it kicks one of their legs out from beneath them, mainly their contention that hormone therapy couldn't possibly be the reason for the difference in BSTc volume/count. In fact, I would say that it becomes likely that hormones are responsible for what Zhou/Kruijver saw. The only saving grace might be that the interval period for the Hulshoff Pol transsexuals was four months, which is less time than for two thirds of their controls. But since it's another apples and oranges comparison (this time, total brain volume to BSTc volume/count) that might not be enough.

That leaves you with the subsequent results you mentioned, which I haven't read. But if you want my opinion, Lawrence is a crank trying to advance her own Freudian agenda and Hulshoff Pol does cast significant doubt on Zhou/Kruijver (though I wouldn't call that a debunking of brain-sex theory, nor would I say that the hormone explanation for their results is necessarily correct, not without further study, this time hopefully with more and better data).
