What would be a good source of advice for someone looking to change careers? I've been an engineer out of school for a couple years now and I'm pretty set on going back for a computer science degree. Unfortunately, I've had a lot of trouble finding getting advice or someone to discuss it with because IRL I don't know anyone in that field or who's done something similar; so far I haven't gotten much from browsing, [[/r/careeradvice]], [[/r/compsci]], or real life university advisors.

Edit: Oh, and [[http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page)][Cognito]], which was recommended a long time ago by Yudhowsky during one of the Author Notes of HPMoR, sounds like it would've been perfect but they moved on apparently.
