Ok, then. Time for a couple of suggestions. If you're going to go back to school, maybe you should specialize in computational statistics and/or machine learning rather than in "computer science", which is usually taken to mean something more like "computability and complexity theory" at the postgrad level and "software engineering" at the undergrad level. You should take a look at some comp sci fields that don't involve statistics, to see if you like them. Many of them (computability, complexity, programming-languages theory) are more "rigid" and "logical" than statistics. Let's list some out:

- Theory (computability, complexity, programming-languages, graphs, algorithms, combinatorics, etc.). Generally more reliant on discrete mathematics and rigid proofs than on statistics or continuous analysis. You need to know at least the undergrad basics, but you don't need to specialize in it.

- Computational science, which often mixes in continuous math and non-computer sciences in something of the way statistics does.

- Systems (which I work in). Operating systems, embedded, hardware engineering, networks, databases. To work anywhere "real" you'll definitely need to know about databases.

- Software engineering. Fuck that shit, IMHO, but it does pay to know the undergrad-level basics just so you can work somewhere: build systems, version-control, testing practices and frameworks.
