I had planned on finding a program that was especially good for one of those fields, but I thought it was just that- a specialty. So the major would still computer science and I would still be required to take all the pre-reqs that implies? Which, although I have only light exposure to those via skimming textbooks, MOOCs, concept Youtube videos, etc. I'm actually interested in learning the general curriculum as well.

I can dig a little deeper into the specific fields, but then any advice on the next step? For example, I had the vague plan of getting a job in an area with a good comp sci program and working while getting company to pay for the pre-req programs and building up qualifications to actually get into a good program (not necessarily that one). Any suggestions, corrections, or other factors I should consider?

Edit: Also, thank you again for taking the time to do this.
