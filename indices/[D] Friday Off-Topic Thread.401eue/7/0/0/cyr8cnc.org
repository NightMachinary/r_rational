I considered that, and I have no aversion to being a code monkey for a few years if I thought that would let me move into an excellent software/data scientist position. But it also seems to me that as a hiring manager, while skills are important (so for example, if I build up my portfolio full of data analytics and apply for a data scientist position), any good company will still pick someone with the degree + internship/work experience + portfolio compared to basic coding experience + portfolio. Having decent coding skills + enthusiasm/portfolio doesn't seem like it would stack up against a formally educated person going for the same position. Is that incorrect?
