Why are you getting a CS degree? An engineering degree should be fine for most CS jobs, unless you are working on ultra optimizing algorithms.

And why programing? Just bored with your degree work? What is to make a hiring manager think you won't get bored again.

Try interviewing for interesting jobs, if they fail you because of a lack of degree then I'd recommend school. My advice is just skip the middle part and go straight onto interesting game work. Or even a boring programming job, to use aa a resume stepping stone.
