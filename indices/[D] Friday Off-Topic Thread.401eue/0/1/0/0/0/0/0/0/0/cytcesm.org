That's not my question. Most of those links say, unsurprisingly, that gambling is more common among poor people / poor people are overrepresented among gamblers.

My question is whether poor people spend more on entertainment than well-off people. Intuitively, that's unlikely to be the case - obviously well-off people have more money to spend, so are more likely to have expensive hobbies. If it turned out that it's indeed the case, then we could conclude that poor people /could/ get more efficient entertainment by spending on whatever the well-off people are buying.

But if not, then is it really surprising and/or wrong that poor people are overrepresented in moderately-cheap-per-instance entertainment like lottery, alcohol or tobacco, and underrepresented in expensive entertainment like theatre, fancy dinners, etc?

Let me reiterate: my thesis here, from the beginning of the discussion, has been that rather than poor people being 'irrational' in spending on lottery etc, they're fulfilling the need for entertainment in whatever ways they can afford. The solution to that is not taking away the entertainment they can afford; it's making them less poor so that they can afford better entertainment.
