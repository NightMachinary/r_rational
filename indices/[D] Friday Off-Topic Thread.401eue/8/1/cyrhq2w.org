I use Google Docs for short fiction (<30K words) and Scrivener for long-form fiction. Scrivener costs money, which I think is probably the only bad thing about it. It also might be a little too heavyweight, depending on how complex you're going and how many notes you want to keep.

I've also gone really basic in the past and just used Notepad, but now I only do that if I want to clear my head while writing.

(I'm not of the opinion that software matters a ton.)
