I use Microsoft Word, simply because it's basic and popular. I'm sure there are better options, but it's just what I have on hand. For me, and my writing (basic as it is), the only extra tools I usually find myself needing is spellcheck/autocorrect. Not because I can't spell, but because I'll mistype a fair amount, especially if I'm excited about the current sentence/paragraph, and having them correct /alwys/ to /always/ saves me some time.
