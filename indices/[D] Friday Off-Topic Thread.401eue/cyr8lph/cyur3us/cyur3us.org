I'm assuming your company bases signs off of birth month, rather than star position at time of birth? Regardless, if it doesn't already, it'd be cool to include a feature where customers can swap between viewing the reading for their sign that accounts for shifts in Earth's starscape over the past c.2000 years, and the reading that doesn't. Might even get a marketing campaign out of it: "Astronomy meets Astrology".
