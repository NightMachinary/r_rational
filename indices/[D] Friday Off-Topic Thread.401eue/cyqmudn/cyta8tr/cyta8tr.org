If I know the plot of something beforehand, I usually end up wondering whether my experience would have been different had I not known. This isn't all that serious, but it is irritating; I've lost an opportunity I can literally never have again. On the other hand, I can (and usually will, if something was any good) rewatch something after ward to experience it with foreknowledge.

I do suspect there's a sensation of sudden insight that's lost if a twist has been spoiled. I enjoy reading fan theories that seem to put everything into a new context; why shouldn't the same be true if they're within the work itself? A joke isn't as funny if you're told the punchline first.

I also enjoy guessing what might happen, especially if I'm watching something with friends and can come up with silly theories - this is effectively spoiled if I know the whole plot beforehand.

With all that said, I will often spoil things for myself simply because I think that having my curiosity satisfied is more valuable to me than the experience of potentially experiencing something "unspoiled". It's not the most important thing ever.
