  If I've had that part of the plot spoiled, then I get to do that foreshadow hunting the first time I experience the story. This isn't a bad thing.

This doesn't come up in very many stories, but being spoiled can prevent you from going /misdirection/ hunting. If you already know what the solution is, then you wouldn't even notice how an author can play off of your preconceptions to mislead you without ever lying or noticeably covering something up.
