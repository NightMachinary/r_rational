So I was watching the Supergirl pilot last week. It was disappointing in a number of ways.

But specifically, reading some of the rational stuff here and With This Ring has dampened my potential enjoyment more than it would have otherwise.

Supergirl gets into a fight with a super-strong guy with an ax. After getting sliced up with it once earlier in the show, during the final fight, she gets the ax away from the guy. So does she:

1. Use the ax against him?

2. Break it immediately?

3. Fling it away into the ocean, or otherwise remove it from the immediate fight?

4. Stand around posing for the camera, and then allow the bad guy to pick up the ax and try to chop her with it again?

The answer is of course (4).

It is not quite the level of stupid in season one of Flash, where he's fighting the two guys with hot and cold guns. There, instead of using his super speed against what are two baseline humans with fancy guns, he stops a distance away from them, allows them to keep shooting him with the fire and freezing beams, and /slowly/ walks between the bad guys until the hot/cold beams are pointed directly at each other, and then zips away, which allows the guns to shoot each other and get destroyed.

I could kind of forgive this if Barry hasn't already demonstrated fast cognition (by reading a book in a second or so), if he had at least been spinning around at the time, allowing his hot side to be cooled off by the cold side and vice versa. But instead he's just going to rely on his regeneration, and try to suffer as much as possible. It was literally the most painful way to end the fight.

Or he could have just stayed away and pelted them with rocks or something that doesn't require him to be continuously be frozen/burned.

I'm now used to Paul/Pavel/Grayven plotting a FTL transfer, zapping the bad guys with a railgun (or something less lethal if appropriate) and getting it done with a minimum of fuss. Spoiled, I am.

Edit: grammar.
