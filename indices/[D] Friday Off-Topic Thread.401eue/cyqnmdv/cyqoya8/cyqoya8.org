The Flash is my favorite superhero, and I watch the show, but I find it so painful sometimes. Why is the guy with super-speed getting physically punched by people who only have super-strength? He's demonstrated the ability to move fast enough that he's a blur, why are villains still capable of landing a hit? They've slowed him down a lot on the show as compared to the comics, but he's still fast enough that guns should be useless against him too. In the period between them lifting the gun to aim and having it pointed at him, he should be somewhere else. It's frustrating.

I've been watching Supergirl, for some reason, and find it about on par with other comic book shows, which is to say lacking in both intelligence and worldbuilding. The Red Cyclone episode pissed me off enough that I haven't seen anything after that, but I'm a glutton for punishment, so maybe I'll at least read some reviews of it.
