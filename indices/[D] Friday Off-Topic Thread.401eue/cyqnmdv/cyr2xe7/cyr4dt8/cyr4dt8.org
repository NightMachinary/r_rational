Readers tend to like long battles that form their own little story arc. A pleasing fight should have some rising action to it, a few twists and turns, and a climax.

And you can totally have that with two people seeking a quick, final victory! You can get that ebb and flow from characters utterly intent on pulling out all the stops and fighting each other to the death with no regard for anything else.

The problem comes from inexperienced (or bad, or lazy) writers who want that drama but aren't able to think up a good way to get it. So they have the hero throw away his gun and "settle it honorably", or something stupid like that, which is lame. It's ignoring one half of the balancing act between pragmatism and drama, when if you're good enough, you can have both.
