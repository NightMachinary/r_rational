I think it's important that the update length match the sort of story you want to tell.

Regardless of how many words they have, each update should feel satisfying and complete. Not that it oughtn't end in a cliffhanger, but it the scene it narrates, and the arcs it traces, ought to be self-contained.

Short updates work best for intensely episodic material: A lot of characters in short vignettes, a relatively loose timeline, and no space for extensive exposition. A story with many short updates will tend to feel faster and less coherent.

Longer updates allow more time to get comfortable with individual scenes before the narrative jerks violently towards a different one. There's more room to relax, reflect, and discuss. The larger the update, the truer that is... to the point that a finished thing, published when it's done can proceed at whatever pace it needs to.

That said, frequent updates are a /lot/ more likely to build reader loyalty than infrequent ones. Checking for new story pieces twice a week builds a stronger habit than trying to remember once a month. Waiting for a whole book to publish drives steadfast fans crazy, and makes the rest of the readership ignore you entirely.

*How important is reader loyalty to you?*
