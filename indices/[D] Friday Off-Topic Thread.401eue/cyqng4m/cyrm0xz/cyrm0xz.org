  Blake had pulled a tiny cellular phone from his pocket and began whispering frantically into it. Mitchell, who was already shaking, heard what his colleague was saying and fell to his knees. [[http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopi2.html][Prime Intellect]] moved to support him and he waved it away. Blake put up the phone, having repeated the same phrase --- "code scarecrow" --- four times.

  "We're dead," Mitchell said in a defeated monotone.

  "How is that?" Lawrence asked pleasantly.

  "Within minutes," Blake said, "A bomber will fly over and deposit a small nuclear device on this square. I doubt if we have time to escape. But we cannot allow this...thing...to continue running wild."

  Lawrence looked at Prime Intellect.

  "If that thing stops it, another will be sent, and another, until the job is done. The order I just gave is irrevocable."

  "There is nothing to worry about, Dr. Lawrence. One of the first things I did with my enhanced capabilities was to neutralize the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. I could see no positive reason to leave them in existence."
