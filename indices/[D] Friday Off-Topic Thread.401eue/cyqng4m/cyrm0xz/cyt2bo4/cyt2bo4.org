I really like this story from a conceptual standpoint, although there were parts that had me wanting to smack myself. In particular, while I find the concept of "Death Jockeys" an interesting one, for a world run by an Asmovian AI, I felt like it was very much torture porn. Plus I hated our protagonist. That bitch seems to be the epitome of the "Back in my day..." old woman, turned Up to Eleven.
