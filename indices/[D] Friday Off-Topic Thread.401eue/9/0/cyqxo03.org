If the plot development is, as Aristotle recommends, both surprising and inevitable then finding out about it in advance will be almost as satisfying as finding out in the moment. When it feels good, and the story makes sense, then I want to go through it again looking for the foreshadowing.

If I've had that part of the plot spoiled, then I get to do that foreshadow hunting /the first time I experience the story/. This isn't a bad thing.

If the story isn't worth experiencing a second time, if the development comes as a shock because it's surprising /rather/ than inevitable, if results don't match set-up and there's very little foreshadowing to uncover... then I'd still prefer to have that development "spoiled" so I can get my disappointment out of the way and enjoy the story for what it is.

There can be enjoyment in being surprised by a non sequitur like there can be enjoyment in being startled by a jump scare. I've personally enjoyed both from time to time. I /prefer/ deeper sorts of emotional and intellectual attachment. The latter really can't be spoiled.
