It really depends how invested I already am in the story. If somebody had told me how HPMOR turned out in the weeks leading up to the conclusion, without the whole story being available, I'd have been annoyed.

But the spoiler you posted for Time Braid above doesn't concern me in the slightest, since I've never read Time Braid, and have no particular reason to care about the story.
