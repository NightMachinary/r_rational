I care mildly strong about spoilers, 6-7 on 1 (totally indifferent) to ten (cut off internet and hasnt left appartment since september to avoid spoilers for new star wars).

Its tied to general novelty value one experiences I guess. I tire quickly of known things, dont get a new rush on rereading twists.

On the other hand I know someone who gets excited about every single cow thats on the roadside on a 3 hour road trip through cow country....
