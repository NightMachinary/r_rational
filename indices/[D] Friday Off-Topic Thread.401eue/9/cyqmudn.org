How much do you care about spoilers? Do you avoid them? Are you indifferent toward them? Do you actively seek them out?

--------------

I don't care at all about spoilers, myself, especially since I do so much re-reading of books. Just a few hours ago, for example, I was reading for the second time the incredible climax of Chapter 66 of Book 2 of /[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898][Look to the West]]/ ([[http://pastebin.com/1gcLRhRm][Pastebin of summary and relevant excerpts]])--and, even though I'd known what was going to happen beforehand, it /still/ sent shivers up my spine. Likewise, I was just as thoroughly amazed by [[#s][Sakura's climactic clash in /Time Braid/]] in my last five readings of that book as I was when I first discovered it. I have less information on television series and movies, since it's rather rare that I take the time to re-watch anything--but I can't say that I care about spoilers in those media, either.
