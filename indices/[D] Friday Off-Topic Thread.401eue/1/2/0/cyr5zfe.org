Yup, I agree with all that.

Even if he doesn't avoid being in the line of fire ahead of time, he should still be able to just dodge bullets. It would be the equivalent of baseline humans dodging cars, in terms of closing speed vs. his perception speed. His opponents aren't typically going to be able to re-aim to track him either.

Speed ought to beat just about everything... if you have enough of it.
