Caster and Ryuu are definitely quite fucked up. I've never read the manga where they show up (as it hasn't been scanlated, I'm guessing due to the low popularity of it, as there's already animes and light novels out) but I've seen a few pics. It's......I wish I knew how to describe it.

Also Sakura....yea. I've literally felt bad IRL about what happened to her, and have an irrational desire to save her. It's interesting that real world tragedies often won't phase me, but a little, fictional girl got to me. :\
