  That's a really broad question, if you can narrow it down somehow so I have an idea what you're looking for I'll try to answer it better.

Well, I'd sorta meant, which subfields of "computer science" do you have experience with, and which ones do you actually like.

#+begin_quote
  Specific fields I've dug into and enjoyed: 1) Data science, which is the one I have the most actual work experience with and have studied related fields (statistics, etc.) to get to work. 2) Natural Language Processing 3) Machine learning (neural networks, etc.) 4) Artificial Intelligence/Quantum Computing, like everyone else.

Those are basically all the ones that involve statistics. Have you tried any that don't involve statistics?
