  I had planned on finding a program that was especially good for one of those fields, but I thought it was just that- a specialty. So the major would still computer science and I would still be required to take all the pre-reqs that implies?

Yes, but specializing doesn't just help for your specialty, it helps for (in my experience) getting enthusiastic about stuff and going in-depth, which then gives you reason to learn more general-purpose stuff in-depth too. It's a virtuous cycle.

  For example, I had the vague plan of getting a job in an area with a good comp sci program and working while getting company to pay for the pre-req programs and building up qualifications to actually get into a good program (not necessarily that one).

That... sounds pretty good.

  Any suggestions, corrections, or other factors I should consider?

Call up someone in the department you end up wanting to get into, and ask, as an adult to another, what the requirements are. Chances are, if you've seen science stuff before, you're a leg-up on most applicants to undergrad programs already.
