That's a really broad question, if you can narrow it down somehow so I have an idea what you're looking for I'll try to answer it better.

In general, computer science is attractive to me because of the abstract theory/design it involves, combined with has real-life applications / philosophy related to it that helps me reinforce it better than other sciences I've been exposed to. In the other science classes I've taken, the level of abstraction was never as high and I think that may be one aspect that attracts me the most. The coding/trouble-shooting is inherently something I enjoy so far, as well.

Specific fields I've dug into and enjoyed: 1) Data science, which is the one I have the most actual work experience with and have studied related fields (statistics, etc.) to get to work. 2) Natural Language Processing 3) Machine learning (neural networks, etc.) 4) Artificial Intelligence/Quantum Computing, like everyone else.
