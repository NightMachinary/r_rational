That's fair. Background: In the last few years I determined that I really strongly enjoy computers/programming and am fascinated in the science behind them to the point where I take MOOCs and do side projects (website building, Project Euler, games) and at work I jump at any chance for VBA, data scraping/analytics, process control. I follow a pretty broad range of science topics, but computer science is the one that I find myself consistently excited about. And last, as I mentioned, I have a dearth of anyone who can relate / talk to about it, so it's a lot of hours spent satisfying myself that takes away from everything else.

My goal is to put myself in the position where I'll at least be doing something I think is exciting (I know work isn't exciting in general, but I'd like to at least be doing work that will let me take some of those side hours away to be spent on friends/family/other interests, plus be in an environment I would actually meet people with similar interests). In my current engineering field (chemical engineering), any job I'm interested in requires a masters anyway- I figured this would be short-term harder but long-term a better fit.
