That depends. Plenty of companies would prefer a guy with a formal engineering degree than a random code monkey. (I was in a civil engineering shop that had a bunch of PEs and CS collaborating on civil engineering code). And honestly a good hiring manager will discount degrees compared to intelligence.

However, I will admit that an HR department will do exactly what you say. So focus your search on smaller companies that don't have an HR dept screening them. Or even talk to a recruiter/headhunter. They get a bad rap, but they get paid (by the company) for getting you hired.

Going to school isn't necessarily wrong, but the opportunity cost (lost wages + fees) seems steep, as compared to the cost of just looking a bit longer for a job.
