I'm aware and I worry about that as well- I've been saving heavily for the two years I've been in industry to prepare for that, but again it seems like a short-term cost compared to long-term gain (due to a higher peak), plus it would be a more likely to succeed / direct path.

I also may have a skewed vision of this because many of my friends are going to medical/veterinary schools and are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt now.

Edit: I don't want to convey that I'm ignoring your advice- I'll definitely look into smaller companies that are just looking for coders, I think that'd be a great place to begin. I had thoughts of using that opportunity to move to a state with good computer science programs, gain state residency, and trying to do volunteer research to help with the application. If in that time I find that there's a better path / I enjoy what I'm doing, I'll reconsider.
