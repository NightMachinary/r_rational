I did this, well I'm finishing my thesis now, but it took 3 years of full time skill due to lack of programming pre-requisits. (BS Ienglish MS Comp-Sci this spring assuming sucessful defence)

You should be getting mid level engineeing pay, and it's going to be hard to even get hired as a mid level programmer, so question 1 is do you want to do it for a pay neutral to negative switch that cost three years. It'll probably only be pay neutral if you can get picked up at a higher level that your professional programming experience, rates, but that can be done (it helps to intern there and make them forget your an intern and not a full time programmer) That said I like it.
