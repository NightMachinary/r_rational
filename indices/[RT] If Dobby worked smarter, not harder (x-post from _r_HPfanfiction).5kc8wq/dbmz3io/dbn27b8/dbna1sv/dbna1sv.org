I feel like Dumbledore is wrong, though, or perhaps playing a different game or even trying to comfort Harry. Clearly, prophecies do have power, or people wouldn't believe them enough to make them self-fulfilling. The fact that Harry's in particular was self-fulfilling does not mean that it is worthless, and does mean that, at the very least, a rational Dumbledore who suspects that Voldemort isn't quite dead yet should keep Harry close.
