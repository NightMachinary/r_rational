  If prophecies have no power and this is well known to the most powerful wizards, there's no reason for Voldemort to have acted the way he did.

Except that, Voldemort was raised by muggles. He /doesn't/ know that prophecies aren't binding in the slightest, otherwise he wouldn't have been after the prophecy orb in book 5 at all.

For that matter, Harry doesn't know the prophecy isn't binding either; like I said, Dumbledore has to explicitly tell him that the prophecy has no power, and that it doesn't have to come true. It's just a prediction.

To be fair, Voldemort did try to avert the prophecy as soon as he learned about it, by trying to kill Harry Potter; seeing as that ended in his being inexplicably exploded by baby Harry, and the same Harry thwarting him 10 years later, and then killing his basilisk, he could be forgiven for thinking that the prophecy somehow has some magical influence on things.

That gives me an idea, actually...suppose that, aware that Voldemort may believe that prophecies are immutable fact, Harry and Dumbledore executed a swap of the prophecy orb to replace it with a fake that claims 'and the Dark Lord will be destroyed, with utmost certainty, unless he repents for his bloodshed', or something like that?
