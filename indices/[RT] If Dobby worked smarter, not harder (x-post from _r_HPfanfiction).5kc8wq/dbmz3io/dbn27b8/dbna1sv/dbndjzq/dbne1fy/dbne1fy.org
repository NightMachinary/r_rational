That certainly could be, but then why does Voldemort worry about the prophecy in the first place? Yes, cannon Voldemort made some boneheaded moves, but he's generally perceived as being cunning and terrifying, so I am willing to fob the biggest of those (Goblet of Fire) off on the author. If prophecies have no power and this is well known to the most powerful wizards, there's no reason for Voldemort to have acted the way he did.
