I don't know if this is a real thing, but the way it is represented by the author, Voldermort has an easy time of totally fucking up the wizarding world, so much so that, with what seems like a pretty small group, he almost wins a war vs an entire nation of wizards (noted that the wizarding population is small, but still).

I don't know if there is a term for this, but its almost the idea of "No pain, no gain" or "Nothing worthwhile was ever easy", this idea that Voldemort, from his perspective, must have something difficult to defeat to actually win.

Hence the idea of a prophecy might very much fit into preconceived notions he had of what fighting this war might take, and that is why he gets sucked into, what in hindsight, is pretty ridiculous series of events.
