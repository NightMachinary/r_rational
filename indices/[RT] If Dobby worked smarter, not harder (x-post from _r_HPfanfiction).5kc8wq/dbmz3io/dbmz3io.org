I feel like a rational (But non-HJPEV) Harry might still not decide to go to Beuxbatons. For one, this wouldn't be official, and as a result he might not even be able to get in. Second, he has no friends in France, and literally the only people on the entire planet who have ever been nice to him are at Hogwarts. Third, Dumbledore definitely would not allow Harry to go to another school, as he still knows the prophecy and is entirely reasonable in his belief that keeping the vital prophetic child safe near the most powerful light lord in the world is a good idea.
