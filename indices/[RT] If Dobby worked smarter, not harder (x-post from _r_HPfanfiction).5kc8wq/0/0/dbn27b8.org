Uh...you do remember that in the books, Dumbledore explicitly calls out the prophecy as bupkiss? Horcruxes, Chapter 23, Half-Blood Prince?

It's not the binding instruction that everybody in fanfiction seems to treat it as; it's /only/ a prediction that only comes true because Voldemort tried to avert it in the first place.

You might be interested in the fic that bendertotes made out of my mini-fic, by the way; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12266465/1/Don-t-Be-a-Dobby-Downer][look here]].

It's really just a fix fic, with more world-building than plot, but it has Dumbledore and Dobby and everyone else doing rather sensible things.
