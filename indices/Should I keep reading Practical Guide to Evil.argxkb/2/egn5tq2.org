Catherine will always worry about her actions, but she ain't a hero nor someone who considers herself a good person. Her morals operate on "no one gets to kill Callowans except for me".

She will do things that make you blanch. She will do things that will make you cheer.

Her friends will banter and her enemies commit atrocities.

And the Black Knight will continue to be glorious.
