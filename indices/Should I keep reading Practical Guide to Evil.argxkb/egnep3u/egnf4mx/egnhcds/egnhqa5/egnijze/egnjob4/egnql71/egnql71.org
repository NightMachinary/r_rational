TGAB is like a palate cleanser if you dislike evil characters, grimdark settings, and character death. It's like the anti-Worm. I really enjoy the banter in it, and the world building is fantastic. The story has been teasing a big payoff when it reveals exactly why the gods are bastards, but 15 volumes in and there are only some educated guesses.

It does have some major weaknesses though, which keeps it contentious on this sub. The first few volumes definitely feel like the author was trying to find his style, and most of the characters feel similar in voice. He gets better as time goes on, but the narrative structure can vary greatly volume to volume. The cast of characters is big and since hardly anyone dies, it just keeps growing. That can mean you may hear nothing of certain characters for months or years at a time... And it's not at all uncommon to not remember who they are at first when they reappear.

Finally, personal preference territory, but some readers seem to disapprove of the author's perceived social and political views. I honestly don't have a problem with having a huge, diverse character list, but some see any inclusion of LGBTQ characters as frustrating. That said, the story is so huge, anyone who criticizes the story in, say, the first 10 volumes has probably had a counter example to their criticism show up by now. Then again, odds are they wrote it off years ago and now are rehashing outdated points. Take opinions with a grain of salt if they comes from someone who made up their mind and stopped reading early on.
