  Arachne Tellwyrm and Trissiny ever become likable in any way.
#+end_quote

Eh, kinda. Arachne's defining characteristics are: badass, pain in the ass, stubborn, and super powerful. She can be very kind when she wants to be; she can also be incredibly cruel when she wants to be. And usually even when she's being kind, she'll still needle at whomever she's "helping." She's a walking contradiction in a way, because she's smart enough to know she can't keep doing whatever she wants without consequence and actively tries to live with that in mind, but she's so set in her ways that her first instinct is to rain destruction down until she gets her way. She kinda strikes me as a baby boomer who knows Millennials are the future and her own views are becoming outdated, but is constantly trying not to get pissed at them for messing up and not doing things how she would do them.

Trissiny definitely becomes less prejudiced and pig-headed, but she's still one of my least favorite main characters. She's not a Mary Sue, but she checks a lot of the boxes, and that just doesn't appeal to me much. Out of the freshman class Gabriel definitely becomes the most developed over time. All of them get additional screentime and fleshing out, but an entire book later on gets dedicated to Trissiny and while I enjoyed the worldbuilding in it, I mostly found myself frustrated about not going back to my favorite characters until the book ended.

  Worse, the author seems to think Gabriel is in the wrong and what Trissiny did isn't that bad, which is mental.

I haven't read the first book in a long time, so I don't recall having this impression, but I promise that EVERYONE calls Trissiny out on her behavior later on. Trissiny herself being her most vocal critic down the road. Her behavior here is the watershed moment that defines how her arc and growth will develop from here on out.
