I wouldn't mind seeing some more diverse characters then I've seen so far up to 1-16, but there's enough going on that I don't find myself too bored with the ones I don't care about. I'm not anti-LGBT by any means, I just don't find any writing about it to be compelling at all. At least with hetero romance I can relate, but I usually avoid even that. To me it feels like too much of the meat of some characters is tied up in stuff I don't care about, so I'm looking forward to the extended cast.

Anyway, WAYYY too much rambling about myself. How long is a volume? Would a given volume be all of 1-X, or 2-X etc? If so, how long is a normal volume?
