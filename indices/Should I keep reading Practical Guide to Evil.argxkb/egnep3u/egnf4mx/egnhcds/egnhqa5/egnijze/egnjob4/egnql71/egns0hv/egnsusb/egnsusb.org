Ah, I misused the terms; there are 15 books, but it's usually 4 or so books per volume, and we're on volume 5 (book 15) now. The books can vary immensely in scale. Book 3 is the shortest by chapter count (10 chapters) while book 12 is the largest (64 chapters). No clue on word count for each of those, however. There are also a variety of side stories (59 chapters so far) that can be read at any point in the series as they mostly take place before the events of the main plot, but are probably better when you're through the first 10 books (first three volumes). They don't spoil anything, but you probably won't know all the characters or understand the context for their events until then.

The complaint about the the social and political views stuff seemed to boil down to some common refrains:

- Simplifying complex economic issues to "do these simple things and society will become better."
- Every non-hetero character or pairing is portrayed positively (or at least as a victim, never a villain or aggressor)
- Masculinity is portrayed as toxic and heavy-handed, feminism is portrayed as just and virtuous.

As said, all of these have been countered at some point, but they are the most common criticisms I've read (and continue to read) by people who gave up reading in the first half of the series. I don't find any of these overt or biased enough to detract from the series overall, but your feelings on the matter might vary from mine. Honestly, the only thing that broke my immersion were some references to pop (nerd) culture. There was an early one mocking Drizzt which I found pretty funny. When [[https://pdsh.fandom.com/wiki/Jenny_Elsewhere][Jenny Elsewhere]] shows up, when World of Warcraft became part of the canon of the universe, when dryads became enraptured by jazz music from /Cowboy Bebop/, and when light sabers started making appearances, it got to be a bit much for me. Thankfully most of that was confined to only a book or two.
