Catherine is sort of similar to Taylor from Worm in that her morality is very much shades of grey. There is some degree, as well, of protagonist-bias towards viewing Cat as moral. She does some terrible things, but she also does some great things.

Remember that in this context "Evil" = agency and free choice while "Good" = unthinking worship of the gods. More or less. Cat certainly doesn't worship the Gods Below or Above, and there's a reason a lot of readers went into a lot of discussion about the possibility of her somehow creating a "Neutral" third faction.

In short, this is NOT a book about a character falling down the slippery slope of Evil, so if that is your concern, don't worry about that. She's not really going to become a paragon of virtue at any point either, though. Cat is practical and seems to have a knack for subverting the narrative tropes that drive the world, and she can be ruthless in pursuit of her goals. But it's not a slippery slope story.
