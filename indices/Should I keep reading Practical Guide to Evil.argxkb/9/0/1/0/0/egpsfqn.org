The story is basically following Cat, being the antithesis of Evil, but shoved into it feet first and having to make the most of it while sticking to her end morals.

It may not be your cup of tea, but I wouldn't say she is sliding down the slope. Just having to cope with situations where she's between a rock and a hard place, with the frying pan about to tip hot oil over both, and some inept goblin lighting a fire beneath.
