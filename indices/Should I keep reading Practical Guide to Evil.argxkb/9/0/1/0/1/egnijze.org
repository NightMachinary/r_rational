My first comment was a bit tongue-in-cheek, but you did mention in your OP that you've already read a fair bit of the story - 8 chapters should be more than enough for a taste.

You seem to dislike the dark moral trajectory, so my point was that the title doesn't exactly increase the chance that the main protagonist will turn into a beacon of morality in the next chapter, right?

For what it's worth, I don't mind evil characters, but I did not really enjoy this story. Given that you also don't seem too enthusiastic about it, and that there are many imo better rational fics that gets recommended around these parts, I'd see little reason to continue with this one if I were you.
