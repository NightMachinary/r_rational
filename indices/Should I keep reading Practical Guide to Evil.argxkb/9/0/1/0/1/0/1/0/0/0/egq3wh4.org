SPOILERS YO HO

Unrelated question, but I just got to 2-1 and I'm wondering if Arachne Tellwyrm and Trissiny ever become likable in any way. Worse, the author seems to think Gabriel is in the wrong and what Trissiny did isn't that bad, which is mental. Gabe's being a lot more reasonable in general than everybody (incl. the author) seems to think, from my perspective.

Oh and Tellwyrm just psychologically tortured a vulnerable man into suicide just to send a message. He did bad things, but then again he knew since 8 years old that he would get literally eaten alive (which he saw in person at that same time) if he didn't go along with it.

Basically, some of the characters are batshit and horrible people and the story doesn't seem to realise this and treats it like they're in the right. It's pissing me off.

I could just be mistaken, and I'm sorry to unload this on you, but I needed to write it out somehow. Do you know if my problems are ever addressed? Even just an in story acknowledgement of "Yeah these are horrible people" would be enough. Instead it's like Hot Magic Elf Lady can do no wrong because murder is quirky and fun, and only matters when it happens to young girls.
