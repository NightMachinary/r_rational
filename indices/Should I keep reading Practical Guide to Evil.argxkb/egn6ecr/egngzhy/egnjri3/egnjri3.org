I don't live in that setting, though, and I feel like it's reasonable to dislike a story based on how it makes you feel as a result of morals. I personally don't think I should need to engage in miniature worldbuilding to find characters likeable, I prefer them to just be either likeable or unlikeable based on my honest reaction to them.
