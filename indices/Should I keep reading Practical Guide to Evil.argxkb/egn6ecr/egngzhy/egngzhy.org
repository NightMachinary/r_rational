Spoilers for Worm and PGTE Something that is very important when comparing a work of high fantasy or mediaeval times to one based in a modern relatively progressive world, the baseline for morals is completely different, this applies extra to works in which morals are defined by a higher power or god, in PGTE the morals that the main character grew up with and learned as she matured are vastly different from the morals we were taught as we grew up, murder is much easier to consider in a world with wars that a character may have to participate in happening nearby, to the people that grow up in these world's, the idea of killing for what you stand for is the same as dying for what you stand for, is Cat a little to quick to choose killing as an answer to her problems? Maybe, but I don't think that makes her definitively evil based on the moral baseline of the setting. It's important to judge anything within context, and although Worm and PGTE have a lot in common, I feel like they are both rather good in vary different ways.
