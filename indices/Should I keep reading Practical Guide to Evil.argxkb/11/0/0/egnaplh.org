A forewarning, just in case anyone doesn't pick this up: this is a worldbuilding comment, and thus mostly nitpicking.

A story doesn't need to define why there is technological stasis. The real world didn't need some dumb explanation about progress being impossible to have thousands of years of pre-industrial technology. By defining /why/ there is technological stasis, an author has created the concept of technological stasis where it previously didn't need to exist, and that throws up a whole bunch of complications, especially if your protagonist is clever. Like: why hasn't anyone done this clever thing the protagonist has done before? Or: if someone else was stopped from doing this before, why is our protagonist granted special exceptionalism? You /can/ answer these questions, but without technological stasis, you don't need to. APGTE answers those two questions very well, but it didn't actually need to at all. Moreover, by introducing the concept, it's creating an unresolved (or unresolvable) conflict. Black is legitimately distressed by the Red Letter, and then he drops on us that there's nothing anyone can do about it? The guy who is currently throwing up a huge middle finger to the gods is going to lie on his back like a puppy? It's rational, but it's not emotionally satisfying in the slightest, and it really does a lot of damage to his character.

I find it kind of funny that you're implying, by saying that progress isn't only technological, that there isn't /also/ this massive sociopolitical stasis in APGTE. The Dread Empire has remained mostly unchanged for /fifteen hundred/ years, and it's only with Black that things have started to shift. Sure, there's the in-story justification of Names, but Names didn't necessarily have to lead to sociopolitical stasis - it's not the only logical conclusion from the premise. After all, even though it feels like the tropes of modern fantasy stories have been around forever, they're only really a couple of centuries old. This stasis puts a massive constraint on worldbuilding because there is a big gap in what historical events are relevant to the plot - it's either stuff that happened hundreds of years ago or stuff that happened in the last three decades.

Again, I greatly enjoyed my time with the story. It was really fun to read, and it has a lot of great moments. I plan to continue with the rest of book four and five sometime very soon. But I feel like it was in spite of some really glaring worldbuilding oversights which made the story feel a lot less satisfying than it could have been, purely because of the historical context. I think, at the end, when Catherine and co. have made some real, irreversible historical change through their actions, my opinion on this will ease up a bit, but until that point, it feels like the chance of them changing anything is tenuous.
