Ah yeah, you might want to turn back on this one. Catherine's slippery slope is a little less tolerable than Taylor from /Worm/, for me at least, because /Worm/ spent the majority of time with villain-on-villain battles, and put more effort into making the heroes genuinely flawed (but interesting) characters. APGTE has a little bit of this, but for the most part, Catherine and her allies resort to killing (first) to solve most of their problems, she spends a lot more of the time fighting much more sympathetic characters, and the fact that she behaves rationally in a setting that's purpose-built for narrative plot devices stops feeling clever about the time she and her friends shoot the head off of a pompous hero during his monologue. (after that point, it just feels like she and her legion of terror are going around kicking dumbass puppies) I still think it's worth reading, because I had a lot of fun with it, but if you can't stomach the fact that Catherine's character arc is as predictable as a rigged carnival game, you might not want to continue.

(Side note for everyone else who has read the story: you get an explanation for the setting's technological stasis pretty early on, and I can't be the only one here that /really fucking hates this/. The setting itself is interesting, but the fact that there's really nothing anyone can do to get out of the medieval squalor kind of puts a damper on any achievement. I stopped reading at around the end of book three while I was waiting for book four to end, and I really hope that this changes sometime in the final two books.)
