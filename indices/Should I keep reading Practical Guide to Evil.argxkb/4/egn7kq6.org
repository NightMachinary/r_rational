I'd recommend you keep reading. There's a difference in-story between evil and *Evil*. Pretty much every character has to make the best of their circumstances, and sometimes it involves copious amounts of murder when people just don't listen to reason. But Catherine never stops thinking about whether she's right or wrong, or debating the morality of her actions vs alternatives she had/didn't have.
