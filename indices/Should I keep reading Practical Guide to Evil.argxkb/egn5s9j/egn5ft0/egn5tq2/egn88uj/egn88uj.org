Spoilers for up to Chapter 12. I think I made it vague enough that you can read the spoilers, but you might want to wait until after reading that chapter. She'll do something very evil in Chapter 12. Don't expect anything much worse than that. It gets mentioned later on as one of her biggest regrets; she thought it was necessary at the time, but in the long run it wasn't really.

Another vague spoiler, for an example of a notable atrocity: A certain group massacres/enslaves tens of thousands of people. After defeating them, she has the people directly responsible crucified. Hundreds of them

In any case, the story isn't really about a good person becoming an evil one. It's more about trying to create progress in a world that's designed not to go anywhere. Or maybe trying to make something that will last in a world where a single person could potentially have the power to destroy entire cities. Main character doesn't commit any horrible atrocities lightly, at least. No slaughtering civilians/non-combatants, nothing evil done without good reason.
