That's my point. The title of a story doesn't always define what it's about, so you can forgive me for thinking Practical Guide to Evil might not be full of evil. If anything, the title seems more like a comedy. What you're talking about is literally judging a book by its cover.

Unless you were just making a joke, in which case I've misread things.
