Idle musing: if at a point where you're worried you might regret if you continue reading, it could be worth throwing the dice by reading a few of the latest chapters, or else arbitrarily-chosen chapters much later than your current position. If it increases your inclination to read other chapters, then benefits outweigh costs; if it decreases your inclination to read other chapters, then there are only benefits and next-to-no costs (where 'costs' are spoiling of events which you would otherwise want to read).

For myself, somewhat echoing [[https://www.reddit.com/user/werafdsaew][werafdsaew]], I tend to (ideally) read for as long as I enjoy something, then drop it if I start no longer enjoying it. Ah, but if there's a fiction which I've enjoyed overall and later find I'm not enjoying, I'll often drop it for the time being, then much later read the latest chapter occasionally, then resume reading if I find it fun. At that point, reading backwards through previous chapters, again stopping the filling-in if reaching a point from the other direction not found enjoyable.
