I just finished binging over the last couple weeks and caught up yesterday. Depending on what your threshold is for "down the hole to evil", you will probably be ok. That being said....the author needs an editor REAL BAD. There are a ton of sentence structure mistakes in nearly every single chapter that are usually just enough to make me re-read the sentence a time or two to figure out what they intended but occasionally make a sentence completely unintelligible. A fresh set of eyes to help catch those would make a world of difference. As I just finished the binge, it obviously wasn't bad enough to make me quit the story, but it would be nice to not have to get through those every time.
