I'm halfway through Book 2 now and still haven't quite gotten sucked into it like I was hoping I would be. It has some good moments though, and most of the good guys you meet are kind of annoying so you want Catherine to win.

I've never thought of Catherine as chaotic evil however. Every time she gets ruthless it seems justified.
