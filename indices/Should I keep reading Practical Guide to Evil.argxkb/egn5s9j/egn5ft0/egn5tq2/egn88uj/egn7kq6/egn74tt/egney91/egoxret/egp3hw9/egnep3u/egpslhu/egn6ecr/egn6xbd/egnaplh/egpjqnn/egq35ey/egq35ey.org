I don't think I phrased that well. A rational story doesn't need to invent an explanation as to why there is a medieval level of technology for thousands of consecutive years, when a better, more robust one can be found in nature. Science takes time, superstition is easy, people are poor. Creating an explanation for "tech stasis" that is more complicated than that is injecting complication where it doesn't need to exist, and can interfere with the sanity of other pieces of the story. And it also strikes me as kind of petty. Like, the author is so proud of the setting that they've made that /nobody other than the protagonist/ has permission to change it.

So what if the evil nations are innovative? So what if, in two-hundred years, they learn how to invent machine guns or something? The /present/ of the story shouldn't have to be concerned about that. The only thing that needs to be explained is why they don't have machine guns already. The author of APGTE chose "technological stasis" and then wrote an infuriating gnomes-did-it explanation, which reads like the book version of "because I said so". But the author could have just as easily, I don't know, removed the ridiculous requirement that the Dread Empire be a /fifteen-hundred-year-old/ institution (because it oozes rationality to say that the caricature of an evil, unstable empire is more stable than 90% of the nations that exist in real-life history), or started them off with stone-age weapons, or claimed that the constant war and changing leaders impeded progress, or even better, a combination of all three.

So the argument is that, by inventing an explanation for technological stasis, an author is extending a simple problem about explaining the past well into the future of the story, for the sake of a setting that /didn't really need any help/ in order for people to suspend their disbelief about it.
