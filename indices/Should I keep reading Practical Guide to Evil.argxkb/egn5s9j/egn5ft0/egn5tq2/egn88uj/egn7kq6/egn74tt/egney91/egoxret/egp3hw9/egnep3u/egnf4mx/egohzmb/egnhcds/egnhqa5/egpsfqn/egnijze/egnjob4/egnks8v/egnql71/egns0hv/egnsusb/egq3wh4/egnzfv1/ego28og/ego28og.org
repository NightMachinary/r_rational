Absolutely! To avoid spoiling those who haven't read yet:

1. Economics is a tougher one to tackle, because a lot of time things just kind of "work out." Still, the role of the Eserite and Vernisite cults does help explain why some issues we have in reality don't have as easy a time cropping up in TGAB. Eserites tackle bullies (so rich nobles who would otherwise force businesses and commoners into submission aren't allowed to easily do so); Vernisites ensure that capital is always flowing (so consolidation of wealth is a sin against the God of Money, and when her members run almost all the banking industry, they call the shots).
2. Basra. 'Effing. Syrinx. It's not fair to place all the world's sins on her, but she's a terrible person and an easy example. But there are other cases where this fails too. Plenty of non-hetero characters are sexual aggressive; Eleanora is a rather "grey" person morally; Tellwyrn as well; the dryads are perfect examples of sexual creatures who can be very aggressive and seemingly villanous; November is openly in love with Trissiny but pisses off everyone around her. And there are homosexual relationships with issues too; Basra is the easy one, but Toby had a bully take advantage of him in the past.
3. Basra shows Avenists aren't all virtuous, but she's hardly the only example in the cult. There have been mentions of misandry among other Avenists too, and Trissiny's first big trial in character growth was learning to look past her inherent preconceptions and biases - which were inherited from and enforced by Avenist theology. Any Avenists aren't the only feminist cult; Izarites are feminists too. And their cults are always at odds about what feminism really means, with the impression that neither of them gets it right. Syrinx is horrible, but it's become clear that Snowe is almost just as bad... and let's not forget Justinian is an Izarite. And while Shaathists are obvious examples of toxic masculinity, Ingvar's entire story is about positive masculinity (and a positive portrayal of someone who is trans) and how Shaath's teachings have been warped by lies. Even before we get that far in the story, there are positive examples of Shaathists as well; even when polluted by toxicity, sometimes manly men who love hunting and violence can be forces for good. Andros, for example, is the bishop of his cult and yet mostly even-tempered (though still dogmatic).

So yeah, plenty of counter examples exist. The only real credit I can give to these kinds of examples is that at first glance, they might not have had counterexamples right away. And perhaps the author read the criticism and expanded the story later to add them. Or... maybe it just took time for things to gradually be revealed. There have been a lot of twists and turns over 15 books!
