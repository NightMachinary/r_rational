Consider 2 characters, X and Y. Let us suppose they are arranged about a set of words in one of the following ways. XY "spoilers" YX or YX "spoilers" XY. Replace X and Y with > and ! and you get >! "spoiler" !< !> "tags" <! for one of of them. If you can't remember which, you can use both together. symbolically: XY YX spoiler XY YX; literally: >! !> spoiler <! !<
