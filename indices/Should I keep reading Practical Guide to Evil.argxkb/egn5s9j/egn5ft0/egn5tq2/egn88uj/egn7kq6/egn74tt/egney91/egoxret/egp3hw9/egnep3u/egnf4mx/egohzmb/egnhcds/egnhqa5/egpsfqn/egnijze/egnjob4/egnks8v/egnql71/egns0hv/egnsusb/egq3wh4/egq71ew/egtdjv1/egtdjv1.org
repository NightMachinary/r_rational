Besides what AurelianoTampa mentioned, there are several times in the story where Arachne will be called down on her methods. Just as in real life, she is just an individual with her own biases that deals with the world as she sees fit, with the added issue that she is so powerful she can do some very damaging things, but she will be called on her sometimes hypocrithic ways and even meet some (arguably) matches down the road.
