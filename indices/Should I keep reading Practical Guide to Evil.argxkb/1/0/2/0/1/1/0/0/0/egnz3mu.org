Wikipedia on this is pretty good:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion#Cause_of_death]]

It's not really known how people died, but asphyxiation does seem the most likely in most cases. If not positioned for asphyxiation, the victim would die of dehydration if they had no wounds, inporbability.
