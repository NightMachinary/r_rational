Just tested it on my own phone, got through fine.

Though I will note that for the first half hour, this link did not work. See, I was in a real hurry to get it out, as I had to rush out for something by 7pm (NZ time).

I managed to finish my last edits, set up the doc, get the links up. Overlooked the whole 'uploading the chapter' thing.

Edit: Couldn't find anything on the web about FF having trouble with links for mobile, and I've confirmed that the link in the header is definitely the correct one. Afraid I'm out of ideas, mate.
