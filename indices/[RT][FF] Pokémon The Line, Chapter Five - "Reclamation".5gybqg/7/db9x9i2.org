I don't understand how the secret codes work if every match is broadcast surely every trainer going up against Giovanni would be well aware of his secret code and what a scream means.

Edit: True in the next match too. You'd want a secret code that changes constantly.

I'm always a bit peeved that Red wouldn't have heard of a classic famous example of someone misleading someone else with a pokemon, that seems incredibly basic. Bluffing is first level stuff.
