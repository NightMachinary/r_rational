Huh. So instead of this being a world which is arbitrarily darker and more vicious than canon, things are this way as a direct result of events occurring pre-canon. I don't think I've ever seen this one done before. I am now sad that it has taken this long for someone to think of it and do it well. This is really cool, looking foawrd to more.
