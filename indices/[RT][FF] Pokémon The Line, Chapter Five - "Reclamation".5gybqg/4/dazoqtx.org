As yet unclear whether Giovanni will be in any way as villainous as canon (and that's as it should be - we only just met him), but there's a definite edge to him; my internal voice consistently dropped an octave when I read his dialogue compared to Red's.

Great stuff. Glad to see this return to active writing.
