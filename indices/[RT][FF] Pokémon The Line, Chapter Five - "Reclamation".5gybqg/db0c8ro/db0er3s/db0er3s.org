I personally believe that the twists going on in the first two chapters were brilliant, including the Pikachu subversion. It pokes fun at canon, while acknowledging the true danger of feral pokemon in this universe. Sometimes being smart means gracefully accepting defeat, like Red did. If he had pulled some kind of miraculous comeback to get behind Blue it might have made a cooler scene, but less of a lesson and character-establishing moment. It would also have felt like an ass-pull to be honest.

Blue is indeed cooler and clearly a genius, which makes the rivalry even more interesting compared to the genius vs genius dynamic shown in Game of Champions. I can't wait to see how/if Line!Red will be able to compete with his rival.

I agree with the issue about the start of chapter 4, I had the same initial impression. I wonder if it was intended?
