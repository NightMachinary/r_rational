Just read all of the current chapters and wanted to preface this by saying that I do like this story. It's interesting and fairly well written. The start of Chapter 4 is a bit confusing though. It made me think that Red's nidoran had died. I like the setting and the characters have some personality which is great. I'm keeping an eye on it and hope to see some enjoyable development.

However I do have complaints.

I can't help but think that Red is just not very smart, hard working, or ambitious. This leaves room for his development but I'd rather be able to relate to him from the beginning and see his development into something beyond my expectation. We are told that he's all of that yet everything that I've read just proves the opposite.

Red has been given an incredible start and his performance has been disappointingly underwhelming. He has yet to take things into his own hands. He seems to be simply following the path outlined for him. He does what he's told. He hardly seems to have original thought. And, so far, his defining characteristic is his immature outbursts.

The stuff that we hear about Blue, that is what I want to see from Red, at least the same degree of ingenuity. Blue circumvented his circumstances and caught and trained his own pokemon before even officially getting his own. Sure he was using experienced pokemon and it was behind the back of Prof. Oak but so what. He did it on his own. Blue stole eevee from under everyone's nose and still managed to gain public approval. Illegal, yes, but impressive nonetheless.

What did Red do? Given the opportunity to use a newly caught wild pikachu, he did nothing with it and simply waited a week for his already trained squirtle. Yes it would be stupid to embark with a practically wild pokemon and that was obviously laid out, but, I would have loved to see him acknowledge it and attempt it anyways. Maybe attempt to train him on his own while waiting for the squirtle to arrive AND take them both when he'd set out, or at least play with the idea. What did we get instead? Red sitting his butt down for a week and we hear nothing more about it.

Red's conversation with Giovanni was particularly hard to read. Nothing against the prose but both of their characterization are unlikable Giovanni is forgivable as he's the potential antagonist but Red as the main character is less so. Red is a hot headed, immature brat and Giovanni is a overly pompous jerk who is full of himself. It would have been nice if Red was simply feigning ignorance during their discussion about Jasper's match but he wasn't. Giovanni having to continuously remind Red that he's is extremely competent and a gym leader for a reason just made me even more disappointed at Red.

On another note, I'd love to read the mechanism of pokeballs since it apparently digitizes pokemon but they are still able to somehow break free during a capture. Or more information about how potions work (nano-machines?).

Keep up the good work.
