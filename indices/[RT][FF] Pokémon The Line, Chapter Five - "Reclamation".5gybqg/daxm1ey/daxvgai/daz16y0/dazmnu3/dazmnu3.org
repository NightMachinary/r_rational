You're welcome! I was checking this story for the promised update almost every day back in September and am glad that you got back to it. To elaborate on my point, it was clear to me how you were walking the line (hehe) between portraying Red's cleverness and his inexperience and actually appreciate the latter showing. It makes your Red more unique, in different ways than Game of Champions!Red and Origin!Red. It just seemed to be somewhat forced at a some points of the conversation, as you surmised.

On a side note, I found your world-building and especially the pallet part to be brilliant as usual.
