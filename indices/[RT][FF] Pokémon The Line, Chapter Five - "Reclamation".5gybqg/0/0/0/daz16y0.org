I can certainly understand the disappointment. Line!Red is definitely not Origin!Red, largely because I believe DaystarEld has done that in a manner far greater than I am capable of. Line!Red is reasonably smart, but he is not a genius, and lacks experience.

Writing the Sandslash part of the conversation was actually the portion of this chapter I agonised over the most, as it's a tricky line to walk. In the end, I decided on the slightly less-brilliant approach when I placed myself in Red's position for a while - he's quite intelligent, but this is also his first meeting with a man of tremendous power and considerable dread. He's feeling a lot of pressure, and I felt that if I had been in his position, I would have flubbed the question.

Red is not /incapable/ of working this question out himself - rather, he came into the conversation with a preconceived notion, and when it was broken he was too flatfooted to think it through properly. On reflection, this does not come across clearly enough in the text, and this'll be a priority on any retroactive edits that are made.

Thanks very much for the feedback, it's much appreciated. (ping [[/u/Golden_Magician]] - I'm not sure if Reddit sends alerts for once-removed replies to comments)
