I agree that the pikachu subversion is great. We don't need more pikachu fanfare. The problem is what we're told of Red's character and what we actually see him do. As I mentioned, why didn't Red take pikachu with him? He already knew that Blue had two other pokemon when he started off. There's nothing in the rules that we know of that said you can only start off with one starter. Training a pikachu from start would have been a great challenge. He's 18 and learned from Prof. Oak. He should be fully capable of taming a pikachu on his own. Instead we get nothing other than the setup for a joke. That's fine but it's still disappointing.

And then we get to Red actually leaving. We're primed to expect vicious aggressive pokemon in the tall grass but what we get is all the pokemon running away. WHY? This is further contrary after the dinner with Giovanni and his speech on the war and the "bloom". Red has yet to be shown to be in any real danger when everything about this setting is telling us that danger is everywhere.

Other complaints: Why didn't Red catch both nidorans. They were both injured. It should have been an easy thing to do. Why did he pre-commit to only catching one? What's the benefit? We already know that pokemon can and will probably die. That's all the more reason to have as many as you can get. Yes it takes time and effort but it's not like he was going to gain anything by not catching both, especially when he had such a hard time encountering them just before.
