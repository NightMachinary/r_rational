Hi!

Thanks for the thoughtful comments. I really appreciate you taking the time to give your thoughts on a number of issues.

The confusion at the beginning of Chapter Four was /definitely/ not intentional. When writing, I had felt it sufficiently established that Nidoking's condition had been stabilized, and the opening line was intended to serve as a hook. Looking back, I can see how that can be confusing. I will see if I can rewrite the opening in such a manner to avoid that particular conflation, while preserving impact.

Red's character has been something of a challenge for me. I've been leery of making him too intelligent and brilliant, largely because I personally tend to get annoyed when a young inexperienced protagonist shows up out of nowhere and immediately grasps everything with perfect clarity. However, having recently looked back over the last few chapters, I'm coming to question whether I may have gone too far in the opposite direction. His dialogue with Giovanni, in particular, is likely going to be retroactively edited to make him a /bit/ less of a dunce - though not drastically. I intend to revise the finer details of Red's intellect after the completion of Arc I (at time of writing, two chapters remain to be published).

  why didn't Red take pikachu with him?

I like that someone picked up on this. The idea isn't even dismissed by Red and the Professor, it simply doesn't occur. Yet, having a second starter Pokemon - especially one of an entirely different and complementary type - is /obviously/ desirable. But Red is not immune to internalising the status quo. Trainers begin their journey with /one/ Pokemon. They have /one/ starter. This is Just The Way It Is, and it's so deeply ingrained that even the Professor regards starter choice as an either/or proposition.

  On another note, I'd love to read the mechanism of pokeballs since it apparently digitizes pokemon but they are still able to somehow break free during a capture.
#+end_quote

Not quite. The Pokeball is merely an electronic shell, encasing an Apricorn. The Apricorn is what does the actual capturing - the Pokeball itself is capable of translating the contents into a machine-readable code (as well as some supplementary features), but the Pokemon is not digitized. Permit me to quote from the text:

#+begin_quote
  There had been much effort in recent years to develop tools which could alter Pokémon through direct manipulation of the code. This had been widely speculated about ever since the development of electronic Pokéballs - if Pokémon could be converted into binary data, surely we could manipulate that data to improve, perfect, duplicate, even invent Pokémon.

  And since Pokéballs could be used to store inanimate objects, the phrase “post-scarcity society” had been spoken with increasing fervour and excitement. It was an exciting prospect - but the Professor had quietly told Red not to pin his hopes on it. His colleagues at Silph were of the opinion that the technology was decades away at best, utterly unfeasible at worst. Reading the contents of an Apricorn in code form was one thing; altering that code and pushing them back into the device in a way that manifested as desired was another altogether.

  We're primed to expect vicious aggressive pokemon in the tall grass but what we get is all the pokemon running away. WHY? This is further contrary after the dinner with Giovanni and his speech on the war and the "bloom". Red has yet to be shown to be in any real danger when everything about this setting is telling us that danger is everywhere.
#+end_quote

Pokemon in Kanto /are/ drastically more aggressive than they used to be. The only wild ones we have yet encountered, however, are along Route One, which has been a major worksite of the Reclamation. Their aggressive instincts have been heightened, but they are still functioning cognitive beings, and the Pokemon near Viridian have learned harshly that humans = extreme danger. This is elaborated upon in the next chapter.

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't Red catch both nidorans. They were both injured. It should have been an easy thing to do. Why did he pre-commit to only catching one? What's the benefit?
#+end_quote

The other Nidoran was long gone once Red had captured the first. He placed a much higher priority on capturing the weakened one due to its critical condition, the victor flees when Admiral attacks, and subduing the defeated one takes more than a few seconds.

Also, I seem to have referred to the Apricorn as an 'Apricot' in that passage. My God, this thing needs a solid edit.

Again, thank you for taking the time to write out these concerns. Your feedback has been tremendously useful.

Cheers!
