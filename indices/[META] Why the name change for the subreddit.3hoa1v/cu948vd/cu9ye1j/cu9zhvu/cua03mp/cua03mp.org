I tend to agree with keeping the primary focus of [[/r/rational]] as rational fiction. I just prefer that it be done *organically*, rather than by decree. If people come here to talk about rational fiction, great.

IMHO If they come here to talk about other things rational, that's fine too. If people are consistently upvoting fiction more than pure rational discussion, then the [[/r/rational]] subreddit is clearly doing exactly what it is intended for. There's nothing to stop us from poking someone who constantly broaches pure rational topics and pointing them at appropriate subreddits or forums for the discussions they are clearly most interested in.

Rational fiction covers so much ground that it's painful for me to see any safe-for-work discussions on rational topics turned away. A discussion I see here tomorrow might find it's way into a chapter next week.
