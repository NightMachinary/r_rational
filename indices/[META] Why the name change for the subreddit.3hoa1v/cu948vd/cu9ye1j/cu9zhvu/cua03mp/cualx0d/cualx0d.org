I would reply to that "then they could have that dicussion on the LessWrong lounge subreddit" except that subreddit is mostly dead, like you said. I would then suggest putting the discussion on LessWrong itself, but I'm guessing that they're too stigmatized and have too many coincidental superficial similarities with cults for a lot of people to feel comfortable there.

I think we should keep the main focus on rational fiction, but keep the weekly offtopic threads. You do realize that on reddit, you can have subthreads within subthreads. It might be nice if threads were more organized by subthread topic, but you can always just browse a bit or press ctrl+f and enter (a) keyword(s) to find interesting discussions on the off-topic threads.

That being said, this is still a VERY inconvenient arrangement. Earlier subtopics are going to be seen a lot more. I'm wondering whether it might be a good idea to have /two/ offtopic threads per week rather than just one. Also, is there some way to allow community editing of an OP to include keywords for different topics that are started within a subreddit?
