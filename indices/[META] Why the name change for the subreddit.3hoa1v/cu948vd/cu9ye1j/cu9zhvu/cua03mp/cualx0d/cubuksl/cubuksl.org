  I would reply to that "then they could have that dicussion on the LessWrong lounge subreddit" except that subreddit is mostly dead, like you said. I would then suggest putting the discussion on LessWrong itself, but I'm guessing that they're too stigmatized and have too many coincidental superficial similarities with cults for a lot of people to feel comfortable there.

Posting there makes me feel like I have to triple check everything I want to say, then there will still be something wrong with it. It has a harsh and aggressive tone, making it an unenjoyable place for a conversation. Which is why I don't post there any more.

High quality of discourse, but at a cost.
