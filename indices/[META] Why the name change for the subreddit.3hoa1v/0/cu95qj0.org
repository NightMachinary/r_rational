This is a subreddit for rational/rationalist fiction, or fiction that would otherwise appeal to people who enjoy that kind of thing, or people wanting to talk about (or produce) rational/rationalist fiction. It is not (and has never been) a subreddit for the discussion of general rationality.

This subreddit was taken over sometime in early December, 2013. Before that, it was completely dead. The sidebar was written at that time; it contained much of the same stuff that it does now. The title and description of the subreddit described it as "Rational Fiction". All the content posted here was rational fiction, or close enough. If you do [[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Frational&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A11%2F1%2F2013%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F30%2F2013&tbm=][a Google search restricted by date]] you can see some of the first entries.

The page /title/ (the thing at the top of the tab/window) has always been "Rationalist Fiction". The "name" (the thing that shows up next to the link back to the front page) was recently changed through CSS, but that doesn't materially affect things. ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20140710045453/http://www.reddit.com/r/rational][You can check the earliest entry in the Wayback Machine from the new era.]])

I would argue that this subreddit has always been about entertainment rather than promoting the art of human rationality. I agree that there is an undercurrent that humans are flawed and can do better. I don't believe that the goal of this subreddit was ever self-improvement. As one of the first people posting stuff way back in December 2013, I can say that I never thought of what I was writing or linking as self-improving. Nor did I have those goals in mind with my writing.

*tl;dr:* The name change just clarifies what this subreddit is focused on, rather than making any change to policy or focus.
