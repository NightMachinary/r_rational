In my opinion, the steady growth and relative health of [[/r/rational]] mostly has to do with its focus on rational fiction. All our most upvoted things are rational fiction. Sort by [[/r/rational/top]] and you'll see that it's very nearly entirely fiction; by votes, this is the stuff that people are interested in.

If [[/r/lesswronglounge]] is limping or dead, I think trying to fold that same functionality into [[/r/rational]] is probably going to be detrimental to the health of [[/r/rational]]. That's entirely aside from the philosophical nature of subreddits as having distinct focuses; merging [[/r/cats]] and [[/r/bigcats]] together wouldn't be smart, even though they have overlapping (but distinct) interests, because it dilutes both and makes it more difficult for users. All that aside, if you want to talk about general rationality, there /are/ places like LessWrong itself /and/ we have the Friday Off-Topic thread if you really want to talk about it with this specific community. I wouldn't even be opposed to having a general rationality thread (Monday being the best place for it, because I've been mulling over adding a third thing to the week's schedule), but I anticipate that we'd get very little discussion and participation there, which is why I haven't done it.

I'm not opposed to having a debate on the matter, or taking a vote, but I'm going to be one of the primary people on the "keep it about rational fiction" side.
