Wow, how does each chapter keep surpassing the high standard of the chapters before it?

Only now have I made a connection between this version of Charlie/Wonka and The Warden of Superjail, a tv show that I never watched but was morbidly curious enough about to read the Wikipedia article for. Basically he's a Wonka-inspired reality-bending magic user that punishes/tortures/kills the inmates of the eponymous Superjail. Am I associating things that aren't really that similar, or do you think that was an influence? Or is there a wider trope that Superjail was also pulling from of a whimsical, colorful, eccentric, super-powerful being which is either alternately or simultaneously very cruel and very cheery?

Small typo that technically isn't incorrect: I'm betting the store which Charlie purchased the chocolate bar from was indeed not moving (at least relative to the rest of England or the United States), but if it sold paper products, it would be a station*e*ry store rather than station*a*ry. Though I'm not sure why a paper store also sells chocolate? Unless that's just an oddity of the original book that I don't remember/was overwritten in my memories with the scenes from the films where Charlie buys the bar from a candy store.
