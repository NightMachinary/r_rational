The world is fair. Good people get rewarded, bad people get punished.

This implies those who get punished were bad, those who get rewarded were good.

Which in turn implies, the one who deals out punishments is the absolute moral authority.

In other words, might makes right.

Bud also, to win the factory one must defeat Charlie, and become the new absolute authority.

It's a vicious cycle.
