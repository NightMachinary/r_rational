Ooooooooh fuck. I was not expecting that incredibly sharp look into Charlie's entire being, followed by Keerthi, the real protagonist, stumbling upon the horrifying truth. The simple moral tale of naughty children being punished, and good children being rewarded, but you pull the curtain back and think about exactly what themes that implicitly pushes, the worldview that each child /deserved/ their misfortune. God, this story is a brilliant interrogation of the original story. The transition into the horror genre doesn't even feel unnatural.
