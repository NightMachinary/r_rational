This story is a very pleasant blend of the utterly bizarre and the emotionally real.

I think the story is going to shift here. Previously, it was a group of people on a tour, and they were sort of competing to win the factory. The kids were playing against eachother, and Charlie was the judge.

Now, the kids are on the same side, and they are trying to get out of this before they get killed. Winning would be a nice bonus. And a nice temptation...

So, I think Tide, Keerthi, Lim, and Mahhuaki work together to keep each other safe, with Charlie growing increasingly frustrated, because this is a game with one winner, and these naughty children refuse to die. At the end, Lim sees an opportunity to betray the group and win the factory, but I don't know if he takes it or not.
