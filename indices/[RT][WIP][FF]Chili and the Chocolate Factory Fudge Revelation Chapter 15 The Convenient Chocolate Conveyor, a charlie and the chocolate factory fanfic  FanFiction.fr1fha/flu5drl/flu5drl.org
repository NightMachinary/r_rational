  “Hm?” McGonagall said, sounding a bit surprised; perhaps she hadn't expected that question either. “That was Professor Quirrell. He'll be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts.”

  “I had the strangest feeling that I knew him...” Harry rubbed his forehead. “And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand.” Like meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically wrong... that wasn't really it at all, but Harry couldn't find words.
