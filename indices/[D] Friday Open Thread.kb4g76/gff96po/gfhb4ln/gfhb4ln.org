Congrats! My new boyfriend just recently told me he was going vegan again, and it's just thrilling to have more people in the fold.

I am excited to have you. It's great to have the cognitive dissonance leave your brain, and feel yourself able to consider things more genuinely. That was the most unexpected benefit.

Make sure you pay attention to your nutrition - people overblow how difficult it is, but it's not trivial especcially if you started from a bad diet. I read the book /Vegan For Life/ a few years back and found it very accessible.

(Do you have any idea who it was? I wonder if it was me - doubt it, but I did post some stuff about veganism early in the year)

EDIT: here's a thread two years ago where I discuss it with some people: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8az3ug/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/]] - so probably not me, then!
