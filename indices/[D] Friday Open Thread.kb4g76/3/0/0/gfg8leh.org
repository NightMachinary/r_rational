That infographic is excellent! but I find that a full commitment is much more tenable; until this year I was of the mindset of just reducing consumption under the idea that if everyone reduces consumption and influences each other to reduce consumption, it is more impactful than if only a couple people stop completely.

But, I found that instead of influencing people to reduce consumption, instead the people around me influenced me to increase consumption. Since stopping completely, the opposite has been true -- the people around me have started going vegan as well.

What really pushed me to full commitment was that even a small fraction of the average consumer's lifestyle still has a _massive_ impact on the animals -- dividing a decade of unnecessary suffering each year by two or three is still unacceptable.

Plus if one is to campaign on behalf of the animals, too, it is even more important to have a full commitment.
