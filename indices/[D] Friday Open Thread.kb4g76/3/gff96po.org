I just want to thank this sub from the bottom of my heart;

I'd always known that animal agriculture was harmful, but around the beginning of this year someone here prompted me to do a utility calculation on just _how_ harmful, per person, the impact was -- something on the order of ten years of worse-than-death suffering per year per consumer, plus many other negative externalities

This is the most important thing this community ever brought to my attention, and perhaps the absolute highest impact area for effective altruism due to the sheer scale of suffering, as well as environmental and climate damage, so thank you
