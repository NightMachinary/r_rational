I've been getting into old-school RPG randomizers. Played SMRPG (great!), Earthbound (good but pretty intense), and FF6 (so many rough edges but a lot of potential and impressive work by the dev). I'm going to tackle FF1 randomizer next, but I'm still psyching myself up for it a bit.

Routing for RPG randomizers isn't as interesting as for adventure games with item-based progression, like Zelda and Metroid. However, randomized equipment and stats and stuff give them a more reliable source of things to randomize that might be interesting, so more of these games turn out at least okay than that genre. Randomizers for Metroid-esque games tend to yield unapproachably hardcore results, while most Zelda-esque games have hub-and-spoke world design that doesn't randomize well (with ALTTP and LA being the big exceptions).

I think game randomizers might become mainstream in some way in the next few years. The communities are very organized and committed, and a lot of them are growing. Simultaneously playing a game while figuring out routing decisions is a pretty fun mental juggling act (the part this community might be interested in). And randomizer races make an entertaining spectator sport due to their mix of skill and random elements.
