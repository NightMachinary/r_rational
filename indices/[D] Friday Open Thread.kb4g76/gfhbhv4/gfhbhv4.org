I don't want to go into details about the darkest and most personal parts of my life, but I need to share this.

My therapist said something in therapy yesterday that basically hacked my brain and made me go from thinking $STIMULUS was a sign of my defeat to seeing that $STIMULUS was a sign that I had been victorious beyond my wildest dreams. Which appeals to my ego and my competitive drive.

I asked her what therapy she does to me, as it doesn't seem like the descriptions I've heard of CBT, and she says it's psychodynamic therapy which idk it works on me so well and I'm so happy.
