  "There's no question this has been a neglected issue," said Jones, who has drawn on lessons from his long career in public health epidemiology and disease prevention in sounding the alarm throughout Massachusetts and with former CDC colleagues over the past few years. The first step, he said, is "letting people know what the risks are - particularly when they can be substantial, life-threatening risks that can kill kids."

  One of the clearest signals emerging in the scientific literature is the connection between cooking with gas and childhood asthma - a disease suffered by people of color and lower-income groups at much higher rates than the rest of the population. A 2013 meta-analysis of 41 studies found that children living in homes with gas stoves had a 42% higher risk of experiencing asthma symptoms, and, over their lifetime, a 24% increase in the risk of being diagnosed with asthma. That study confirmed, in turn, what a 1992 meta-analysis found: Children exposed to higher levels of indoor NO2 (at an increment "comparable to the increase resulting from exposure to a gas stove") had an elevated risk of respiratory illness. More recently, a 2018 study from the University of Queensland found that in Australia, where 38% of households rely on gas stoves for cooking, more than 12% of the total burden of childhood asthma was attributable to their use.

  Meanwhile, troubling new findings suggest that exposure to NO2 - the primary pollutant of concern from gas appliances - could compound the dangers of the novel coronavirus in communities that are already at higher risk of infection and of dying from the disease. A recent peer-reviewed study led by researchers at Emory University examined Covid-19 mortality data in more than 3,000 US counties, and found that long-term exposure to elevated NO2 was correlated with a higher risk of death from Covid-19 - and that NO2 appeared to be more dangerous than particulate matter or ozone.

  The hazards now have a growing chorus of scientists and public health experts insisting that better and stricter oversight of burning gas indoors - a health threat that has been hiding in plain sight for decades, they say - can no longer be ignored. "It's fundamental and imperative," said Jones. "We ought to get up on the rooftops and shout about it."

  The cumulative evidence was enough for the venerable New England Journal of Medicine to publish an editorial in January recommending that "new gas appliances be removed from the market." It was co-authored by Howard Frumkin, a former director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which is responsible for investigating environmental drivers of illness and promulgating guidance about those risk factors.

  Despite such calls - and despite compelling evidence that gas appliances can produce levels of air pollution inside homes that would be illegal outdoors in the US - indoor air quality remains entirely unregulated in the US today, and gas appliances largely maintain their industry-manufactured reputation as "clean." The Environmental Protection Agency only monitors pollutants in outdoor air. And while building codes typically require natural gas furnaces and water heaters to be vented outside, many states lack requirements that natural gas cooking stoves be vented to the outdoors.
