Thanks for sharing this!

I've been trying to improve my indoor air quality for the last few weeks and I've been completely oblivious to my gas stove. /Of course/ burning hydrocarbons in an enclosed space is bad for you. But it's been completely invisible to me until now, especially when using it to boil water.
