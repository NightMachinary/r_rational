Also, most people probably assume that turning on the fan in their range hood is sufficient, even though a non-insignificant percent of them (not reading the article again, feel like I remember it was between 30% and 40%) don't actually vent to the outside and instead just filter the air, which is fine for larger particles that people can detect like smoke and the smell of food but does basically nothing for the smaller pollution particles that cause the real problems - they just get recirculated it into the home with the filtered air.
