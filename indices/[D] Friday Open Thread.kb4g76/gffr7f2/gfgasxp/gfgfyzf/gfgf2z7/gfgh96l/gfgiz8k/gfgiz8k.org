The kitchen in the home I lived in from 3-years-old to 19-years-old was in the middle of the house and didn't have a single window in it. It was a newly constructed home when we moved in. Not everyone has a window in their kitchen. And even if "having a window in the kitchen" is the norm, not everyone thinks that way - I actually feel like opening a window to vent out the kitchen every time you cook probably isn't the norm for most people. People like the smell of cooking, and I don't think people in general would think they needed ventilation unless they were cooking something particularly pungent.
