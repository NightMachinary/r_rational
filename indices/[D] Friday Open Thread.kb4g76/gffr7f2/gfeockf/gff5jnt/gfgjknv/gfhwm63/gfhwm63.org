Seconding /Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool/. I haven't read the other, pre/post natal nutrition is even more socially hazardous than regular nutrition. I'd have your wife read it if possible, although ideally you both read everything "parenting" anyway.

Cribsheet is full of good information and entertaining, but it's biggest benefit is making you a more robust parent. It helps you understand and evaluate the millions of different pieces of advice and parenting philosophies you're going to hear.

Good luck!
