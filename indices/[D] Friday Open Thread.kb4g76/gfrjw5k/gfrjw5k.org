A note for anybody who reads, or used to read, Pyrebound: I'm aware it's been like four months now. I've written and rewritten update 15.4 so many times I've quite literally lost count, each time deciding after four or five pages of writing that it just wasn't how I wanted to tell it. I could also bring up school or work or what-have-you, but mostly it's that I'm getting close to the end and I want to be very careful about sticking the landing here.

I just finished the semester, and looked forward to spending break finally finishing the update. I got home from work yesterday, popped open my writing laptop which had worked just fine that afternoon, and got a warning that a cooling fan wasn't working right and if I tried to run it I'd risk melting the processor or some such. Fun. So, yeah. I'll get the thing fixed and hopefully that will be before school starts up again. Argh.

Bottom line: I haven't given up on the story. It's just run into one hell of a rut. Thanks for your patience.
