Thanks for the great recommendations, I've read Expecting Better and I really like the book and find it to be a great general resource but I do appreciate the additional data in Debunking the Bump especially since it goes deeper into topics like pathogens, toxins, etc... The footnotes are rather interesting to read in that book.

I'd say that both of those books are definitely what I was looking for. Good thoughtful evidence based discussion of pregnancy.
