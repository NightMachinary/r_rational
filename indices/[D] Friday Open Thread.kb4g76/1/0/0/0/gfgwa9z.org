Then you will probably really like these two books! You will probably also like Penelope Leach's "Your Baby And Child" when the time comes.

I am also going to offer two pieces of totally unsolicited advice:

- Get two dozen cloth diapers. Not to use as diapers; to use as "burp cloths" (aka something for a baby to regurgitate or dribble mostly-undigested milk onto, which they do more or less constantly for about six months). I'm not kidding about two dozen.
- everyone will be judgmental about literally everything. Ignore them. As long as your baby is fed (breast milk vs formula matters not at all compared to fed vs not adequately fed), is kept warm enough, does not suffer spinal/cranial damage, and is given affection and enrichment, you're doing fine by the baby and should worry about making sure you and your wife are happy and loving each other.

Anyway, mazel tov! Welcome to the parent club! We talk about nothing but our babies because the sleep deprivation means nothing else actually serializes properly to disk!
