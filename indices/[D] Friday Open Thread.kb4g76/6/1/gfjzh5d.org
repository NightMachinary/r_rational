Stuff people here might like:

- [[/r/AskHistorians]] - Everyone knows about this one by now right? I'd love to have a way to subscribe to a week-delayed version of this.

- [[/r/badhistory]] - What historians feel like mocking is often more informative than how they answer earnest history questions. Also funnier.

- [[/r/badmathematics]] - Not as active as badhistory, and corrections on bad math aren't really that enlightening, but they frequently find some pretty funny things.

- [[/r/rational]] - I assume everyone reading this likes this sub. I'll admit I'm mostly here for the friday open thread at this point.

Funny animal photoshops:

- [[/r/hybridanimals]] - Sometimes verbal puns, sometimes (far superior) visual puns, sometimes creatures you can steal for your D&D campaign.

- [[/r/birdswitharms]] - It's just the same joke over and over again but it's a good joke.

Gaming stuff:

- [[/r/speedrun]] - The speedrunning community reliably puts out amusing or impressive things.

- [[/r/proceduralgeneration]] - Neat eye-candy, sometimes you learn something.

- [[/r/roguelikedev]] - More interesting than the main reddit roguelike community. But like most gamedev subs it's slowly becoming a bunch of devs trying to content-market their work to each other.

- [[/r/voxelgamedev]] - Neat eye-candy, sometimes you learn something.
