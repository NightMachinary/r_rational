I cannot strongly enough disagree with this recommendation. Some schmuck going on Joe Rogan to talk about how you shouldn't follow the standard vaccination schedule? This is not a person you should pay any attention to. This is a person whose opinions you should actively avoid, in fact.

(General rule of thumb: does a person making recommendations that aren't "follow the standard vaccination schedule" provide a reference to a meta-study supporting their position? No? Killfile everything they've ever said.)
