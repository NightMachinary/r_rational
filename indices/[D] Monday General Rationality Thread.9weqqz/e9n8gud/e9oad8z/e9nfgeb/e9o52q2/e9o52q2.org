A newton is a unit of mass, equal to about a tenth of a kilogram (100g). Assume, for the moment, that you have a tomato that weighs one Newton, or just over 100g.

To left that tomato by one metre would require one joule of energy.

Now, watts are joules per second. An engine capable of one watt of power is able to provide enough energy to lift that tomato one metre in a second.

--------------

+So, you have an engine that can produce P watts. Your engine weighs Q newtons.+

+Acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8m/s. So gravity is pulling your engine down at Q*9.8 watts. In order to be able to lift your engine, P must be greater than Q*9.8. (That's assuming no losses due to friction and other inefficiencies).+
