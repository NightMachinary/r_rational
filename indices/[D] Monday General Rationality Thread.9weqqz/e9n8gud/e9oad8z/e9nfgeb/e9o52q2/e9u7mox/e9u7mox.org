Power is energy output per second. So for example if you have a car, you need:

- a certain force (or torque) to cause it to accelerate (and add something on top to overcome friction), which means

- a certain amount of energy to make it accelerate of a certain amount (since accelerating means going faster, thus increasing its kinetic energy), which means

- a certain amount of power to accelerate /in a certain time/.

The energy required to send a car from 0 to 100 km/h is always the same, if the car weighs the same. But a car needs more power to output that energy in a shorter time - which is crucial to performance if, for example, you're racing.
