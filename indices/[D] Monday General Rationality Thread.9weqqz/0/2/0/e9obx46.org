  A newton is a unit of mass, equal to about a tenth of a kilogram.

No. A kilogram weighs about ten (9.8) Newtons on earth, but kilograms are mass, and Newtons are force. Weight is the force from gravity.

If you go to the moon, your mass will be the same, but you will weigh much less.

To get some intuition for the difference, play around with a medicine ball. Even if you keep the ball on the ground (so gravity doesn't come into play), it's very difficult to shove it around. This is because the mass of the ball resists acceleration. Now pick up the ball. Feel how it tries to escape from your hands and return to the earth. That's the weight.

  So, you have an engine that can produce P watts. Your engine weighs Q newtons.

  Acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8m/s. So gravity is pulling your engine down at Q*9.8 watts. In order to be able to lift your engine, P must be greater than Q*9.8.

Acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8m/s^{2.} Meters per second is velocity, which is a change in position over time. Meters per second /per second/ is acceleration, which is a change in velocity over time.

Q is already the force from gravity. Q = (mass)⋅9.8m/s^{2} . You don't need to multiply in the acceleration again.

Even if that were the correct formula for the pull of gravity, the units don't match up.

In base units, 1 watt = 1 kg⋅m^{2} /s^{3} whereas Q⋅g is in units of kg⋅m^{2} /s^{4}

And it should be intuitively clear that the force from gravity can't possibly be measured in watts. Watts are a measure of the rate of energy transfer. But even a motionless rock is being pulled on by gravity. If gravitational force were equivalent to energy transfer, then we wouldn't need to futz around with all this fossil fuel stuff; we could just harness motionless objects for free energy.

See my comment above for the full explanation, but the surprising answer to OP's question is that any engine can theoretically lift itself if you can build a large enough propeller.
