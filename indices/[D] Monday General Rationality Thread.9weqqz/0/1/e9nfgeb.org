It's been awhile since I did physics, but I'll see what I can do.

  why don't they use newtons for engines and electricity instead of watts.

According to [[https://www.traditionaloven.com/tutorials/power/convert-newton-metre-seconds-to-watts-w.html][this website]] I found by googling 'watts versus newtons',

1 Watt = 1 Newton metre per second.

This suggest that they do different things. Here's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Distinction_between_watts_and_watt-hours][Wikipedia]] on the subject:

  The terms [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics][power]]) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy][energy]] are frequently confused. *Power is the rate at which energy is generated* or consumed and hence is measured in units (e.g. watts) that represent energy /per unit time/.

  Does the acceleration really depend on speed?
#+end_quote

If a car can 'go from zero to 60 in 5 seconds' that's acceleration. Between physics/calculus you can tell how fast the car is going not only on the /fifth/ second, but also in between 0 and 5 seconds. (And how [[https://www.quora.com/A-car-starting-from-rest-accelerates-to-50-0-m-s-in-5-00-seconds-How-do-you-find-the-acceleration-and-the-distance-covered-by-the-car][far]] it drove.)
