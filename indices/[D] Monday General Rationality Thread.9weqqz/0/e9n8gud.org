I'm really feeling like an idiot for asking such a stupid question, but can someone explain concept of power (physical) to me? I just don't get it, why don't they use newtons for engines and electricity instead of watts. Does the acceleration really depend on speed? I always thought car accelerates slower at high speed just because of friction, aerodynamics and imperfect transmission. I don't get what in car construction would make acceleration depend on speed. Aren't all speeds in the world relative? I would understand if it would only relate to cars, but energy seems like the universal concept - it's conservation of energy, not conservation of force - and I really don't understand why.

Originally I didn't care until one day I wondered if engine of particular car could lift it off if I attach propeller to it (like a helicopter). For that I would need to know just one thing, how much newtons does that engine make, but somehow there's no info on it and it feels like I'm really missing the point.
