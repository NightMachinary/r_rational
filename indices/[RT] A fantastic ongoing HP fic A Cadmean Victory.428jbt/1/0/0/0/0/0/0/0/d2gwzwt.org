Ah! I'm glad it made your day. The Cupboard is an excellent story, and one of the fics I recommend people who are just getting into fanfiction.

Like Cauterize and The Twine Bracelet, it's a mundane fic. Unlike them, it is a fully fleshed out short story with action and a conclusion. As a character study of Dudley and a raw, sharp attack on the Dursleys' parenting, it stands alone in fanfiction. Everything written about their parenting and its impact on Dudley is solid, from his own acceptance (at first) of their doting nature, to the aggressive response they have when he starts to think for himself. They still love him, though, and there's even a great father-son moment in there:

/"No thanks. I need to be up early tomorrow to exercise, and I'm not really used to alcohol and all-"/

/His father snorted. "Save it for your mother. Remember, I went to Smeltings too."/

It's good close-up 3rd person, too. Of course, Vernon is referred to as "his dad" or "his father" always, because that's who he is. And whatever flaws Vernon may have, in this moment you think, "oh, right, he's still a father" -- and what's more fatherly than sharing a drink with your teenaged son in the kitchen on the sly?
