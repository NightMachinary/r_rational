You're not wrong, by any stretch. It suffers from serious pacing issues and there are some definite Gary-Stu moments in the beginning. On the other hand, dark!Harry fics almost always exceed my cringe-quota, and this one does a good job of showing a more realistic side to the Dark Arts.

I'd say the fic starts embracing its rational side around chapter 60, but if you don't like it by chapter 30 it's not worth your time.
