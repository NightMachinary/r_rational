Oof, that's a bit of at all order considering it's 90 chapters and 450,000 words. That's roughly the length of Harry Potter books 1 through 5 all together. Assuming fairly uniform chapter length, you want us to read 300k words waiting for it to start embracing its rational side? or 150k words (a little under Philosopher's Stone + Chamber of Secrets together) to see if it's worth our time?

It might actually be a great fic, and I'll check it out, but I certainly won't wait until I'm most of the way through the Harry Potter series in word count for a good part.
