I really disliked the characterization of Harry in this one, especially his clinginess to Ron's family. While I am not able to identify whether it's rational or not as I don't have enough knowledge of PTSD, it really felt out of place for a 30 years old man being bossed around like that and accepting it and even embracing it.
