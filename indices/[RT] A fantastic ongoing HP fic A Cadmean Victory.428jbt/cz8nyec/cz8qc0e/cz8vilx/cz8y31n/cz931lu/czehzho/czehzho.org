Most people have really unusual (read: awful) taste in fanfiction, so it would be good to consider suggestions from multiple people. I happen to tautologically like my own taste in FF, see if you enjoy it.

Here's what I like from HP Fanfiction:

*Drama*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] by Lady Altair - Canon-compliant, post-DH. Prepare to feel emotion. /"Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] by CheddarTrek - Post-DH, canon-compliant. Prepare to cry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8369495/1/The_Cupboard][The Cupboard]] by FranticArmoire - Canon-Compliant. Prepare to be wowed. /What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7069833/1/Geminio][Geminio]] by Portus - Possibly my favorite fic. Canon-compliant, but ALSO... well, I can't talk about it, cause spoilers. /Some things never change, no matter a past which no longer sleeps. This is a lesson Alastor Moody must learn first-hand./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6199615/1/The_Fire_Omens][The Fire Omens]] by chase glasslace - Dark, rich, and full of meaning. /'Incendio is the first incantation that Tom ever learns.' Europe in the eye of the storm. oneshot/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3612995/1/][Unholy]] by Lady Salazar - Probably the best portrayal of a "Dark" Harry that I've seen, but it's still a Dark Harry so don't read it if you don't like that. /There are some things the human race is not meant to know. Harry didn't care instead, he made it his life's purpose to learn them./

*Comedy*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes - One of the most hilarious comedies I've ever read. The writing is hilarious, but lacks some technical polish. My favorite comedy. Pokes fun at fanfiction in general, in addition to being great. /The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon - One of the best-written fanfic comedies out there, a must-read for anyone interested in HP Fanfiction. /Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday]] by Twisted Biscuit - Canon-compliant, almost. Slice of life. Not usually my thing, but it has its humorous moments. /A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11583668/1/I-ve-Always-Wanted-to-Use-that-Spell][I've Always Wanted to Use that Spell]] by White Squirrel - Pretty much canon-compliant, quite humorous, loses some strength partway through but still excellent. /McGonagall finally got to awaken the statues in the Battle of Hogwarts, but she wanted to do it for a long time. Given all the times she missed her chance, it was no wonder she was so eager when the time came./

*Adventure*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3991385/1/Sherlock_Holmes_and_the_Ravenclaw_Codex][Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex]] by Pavonis Mons - Canon-Compliant, crossover with Sherlock Holmes. Entertaining and riveting. Set in the Victorian England. /A Sherlock Holmes mystery set in Victorian Hogwarts. A valuable artefact has been stolen from Hogwarts School, with a Muggle student the only suspect, and Headmaster Black summons Holmes to retrieve it. But the case is not as clear cut as it first appears/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] by Aesop - A good exploration of memory charms and the statute of secrecy. /The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe./
