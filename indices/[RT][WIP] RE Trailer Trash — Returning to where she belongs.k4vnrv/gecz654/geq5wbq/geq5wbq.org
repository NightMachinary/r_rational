If you're willing to read fanfiction, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] is a pretty good take on a repeating timeloop around A Song of Ice and Fire.

In particular, it does a great job exploring the world, especially the less used parts not well covered by the books.
