Well ... those three. I don't really keep a list as such but other good ones include (movies): Timecrimes, Triangle, Coherence, Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day, Repeaters, The Infinite Man, Predestination; (books) Life After Life, 11/22/63, [[https://bbs.pku.edu.cn/attach/80/a2/80a255d7a8fc70db/Ted_Chiang.pdf][The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate]], The Man Who Folded Himself, All You Zombies ... that's off the top of my head, I'm sure I've missed many good ones.
