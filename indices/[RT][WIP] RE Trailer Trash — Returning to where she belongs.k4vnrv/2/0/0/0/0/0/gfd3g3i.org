I've been following and enjoying The Menocht Loop since mid-way through the loop. Nice to meet you here. It has good progression and is very interesting post-loop.

I'm fully read up on all the stories I listed. The author of Blessed Time has two other stories I like more, Tower of Somnus and Burning Stars, Falling Skies.
