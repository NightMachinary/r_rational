I'm a sucker for loop stories too. I haven't found a way to search for them on Royal Road but here are some I found just because they are highly rated.

- The Perfect Run - MC can set a save point to return to when he dies, future earth with superpowers
- The Menocht Loop - Starts in a loop and doesn't know why, magical world with technology
- Blessed Time - Gains a looping power with active activation and limits. magical fantasy world

Honorable mention (Not looping but using knowledge from previous lives)

- The Many Lives of Cadence Lee - Reborn into a different world each death
- Magic Smithing - Reborn once, from earth to a magical world
- Sylver Seeker - Reborn into the same or similar fantasy world
