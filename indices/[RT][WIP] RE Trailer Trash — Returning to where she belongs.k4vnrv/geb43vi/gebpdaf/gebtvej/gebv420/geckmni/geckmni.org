Someone's not selfish for not wanting to live a life of fame. The OP's description of her decisions didn't mention that chance of failure is the reason for "not trying" or wanting to live a modest life. For someone who follows the rationalists subreddit you sure do like to make false assumptions. Spend less time judging someone's lack of knowledge on a words meaning and spend more time reading what they wrote.

Also do you truly believe having future knowledge of Microsoft's products actually gives you an advantage when trying to successfully replicate what Microsoft did? If so then you are crazy and really shouldn't be commenting on the rationality of things.
