I'm not sure there is much that a random nobody could do to prevent the September 11 2001 attack, unless they were both willing and able to convince others they were a time traveler.

Remember that the U.S. intelligence community /knew/ that a terrorist attack was likely imminent. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US][Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]. What could you or some other person without any intelligence or government connections do? Tell them you know the date and target? Why would they believe you, and if they did, how would you explain it? You need to /convince/ them, not just send an easily dismissed anonymous note (assuming you can successfully keep yourself anonymous which isn't certain given /after/ the attack the full force of government investigation is going to be very interested in that note they received /beforehand/).

The problem of exploiting other future knowledge suffers from the same issue, specifically that most would not have the proper leverage to do so in their past lives (especially as a child, as vanishingly few children have any leverage at all).
