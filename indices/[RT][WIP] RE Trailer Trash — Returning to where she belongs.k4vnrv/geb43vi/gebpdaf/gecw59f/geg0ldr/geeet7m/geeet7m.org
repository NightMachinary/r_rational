Her rescue of the officer stands out as a great example of how Tabitha isn't wasting her chance.

The main character's original life was traumatic and isolated. Her second run not only gives her much-needed healing; it also improves the lives of her loved ones - both through her example, and in more direct ways, as she connects with and helps them in ways she was unable to when she lived through these events.
