You don't need super powers to meaningfully help people. There are hungry children that could be saved with portion of your expenses, but more importantly there are not enough people to help everyone. Even if you don't want to go to Africa to maximize your impact, there must be a need for social workers where you live. You can be someone's superhero without being bitten by radioactive spider.
