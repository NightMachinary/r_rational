I think there's a middle ground between selfish and selfless you're skipping over here. The standard of behavior expected of others by most is not that they must sacrifice their life or freedom to help others or else be deemed "selfish".

I also think you may have not properly considered how useful future knowledge isn't. It basically amounts to one (very) good prediction; if your timeline is fixed then you can't change anything anyway and if it isn't then every change you make moves that prediction further away from accurate. I don't think it makes you "uniquely qualified" except perhaps for one or a few major changes. After that, the accuracy of your prediction is probably reduced to just another good prediction. Should you wait for a major attack before making /any/ changes? Is your memory of your past good enough that you won't butterfly away anything? What if some slight change makes the attacks happen a day earlier in this timeline? Consequentialism would ask you to weigh all the outcomes of your actions. How do you weigh the chance of butterflying away a possible (but slight) chance to avert a major attack against all the (much more individually minor) good your actions could do in the mean time, but a strict adherence to anti-butterflying would prohibit?

And you still have the problem of being /able/ to make that change (the "leverage" issue). In the original example, I think it's entirely possible the MC could expend every effort to attempt to help but still have no major effect (people dismissing her warnings), but /still/ face all the same repercussions. Even if you think it worth it to sacrifice your life/freedom to help others, do you feel the same way if the chance to help is very slight but the costs will stay the same?

You don't need to be from the future to know how to help others. And, most likely, it is within your power to sacrifice your health/comfort/etc to do so more effectively. Are you going to?
