  The best strategy I've heard: Call in an anonymous bomb threat to the NYPD on the day of the attack. There's a good chance they'll evacuate the towers before the planes hit them. You won't stop the attack itself but you'll probably save a lot of lives.

Bit late reply yeah, but my counterpoint is, the anonymous call may be heavily researched later. You would be implicating yourself with prior knowledge of a terror attack. The consequences would be.. problematic. You would need to try something akin to using a proxy, facilitating something to muddle the waters is an absurd way and get the message across.
