She doesn't remember what year it happened.

#+begin_quote
  /Nineteen ninety-eight. What happened back in nineteen ninety-eight?/ The only major event she recalled from those years was the big plane-hijacking, that terrorist attack on the twin towers. And, for the life of her, she couldn't recall if it'd happened in the year two thousand, or the years just after that. It was, after all, a lifetime ago. The phrase nine-eleven stuck out in her head. /Maybe September, of two-thousand and eleven? That's further off than I expected./
