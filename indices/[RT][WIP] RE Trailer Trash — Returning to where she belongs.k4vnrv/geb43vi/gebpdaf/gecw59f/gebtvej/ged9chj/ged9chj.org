I guess we'd need to move that to the munchkinry thread, but I'd say the most low effort thing would be to write a book/blog/pgp signed messages about the future (and publish it anonymously). The accuracy of the predictions should make people read it at some point, entrepreneurs who implement ideas from it will have success and soon the contents will be in everybody minds. Then maybe they'll do something about future wars, climate change, pandemics etc. earlier. If they don't --- they had enough information to decide. W.r.t. to butterfly effect just preface the book with a discussion of that and that it just a version of the future where the book doesn't exist.

There is also huge societal value in just saying that stuff works or doesn't. Battery+CPU tech can be optimized till everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket. Electric cars with 400 mile range are possible. Solar cells can be improved till they produce energy cheaper than fossil fuel energy. Research can be more focused and there is less waste on dead-ends like e.g. hydrogen cars.
