None that the previous comment didn't already. I've read all of them so far besides Cadence, Perfect Run, and Magic Smithing, but I hear good things about those, too. My favorite on the list is probably Blessed Time. Full disclosure that I write The Menocht Loop; it's less loopy than some of the mentioned options. If you're really looking for time loop exploitation Blessed Time and Perfect Run are probably what you want.
