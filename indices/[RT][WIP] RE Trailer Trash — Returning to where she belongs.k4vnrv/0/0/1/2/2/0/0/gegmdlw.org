  I never said anything about fame and I would probably agree that it'd probably make sense to try to avoid being famous.

I was referencing the original description that spawned this thread. Are occurring theme I notice with your comments in these threads is you lack understanding of context.

  Over someone who does not? Yeah, why not? It doesn't guarantee her success but I can't see how it is not any kind of advantage at all.

You wouldn't be competing against someone who doesn't have the same knowledge. You would be competing against all of Microsoft's competitors and you would be competing with Microsoft directly. Microsoft didn't "win" because of some revolutionary product, stealing the core ideas of windows and their products doesn't give you an advantage ESPECIALLY not if before you went back in time you weren't a professional developer and entrepreneur.

In the case of a 1v1 competition where each party has the same resources the future knowledge would potentially give you an advantage. But that's not how the world works in almost any circumstance. Even as a professional developer myself I would have a 0% chance of being able to do what Bill Gates did if I was able to go to the past. Almost anyone who thinks otherwise has protagonist syndrome and overestimates the impact of future knowledge in situations like this.

  I can't think of a nonselfish excuse for helping oneself instead of with 9/11.

Other people have already made good points on this subject. But again, no it's not fucking selfish to better your life and to correct the mistakes you made before. It's called personal growth. Furthermore the original description you replied to that started this thread never mentioned anything about not doing things to better society.

  Tabitha is focussed on what's important to her --- having a good life --- rather than trying to exploit future knowledge for power and fame.

You are ASSUMING the actions taken by the character based on your own preconceived biases causing you to attribute selfishness to the above statement. Hence why I mentioned you making false assumptions.
