I haven't read the more recent chapters, but I'm most confused about how we pivoted from a hypothetical about something she might or might not be able to affect in the future using her future knowledge, to something you seem to imply has occurred in the story and she chose not to intervene. The story takes place in 1998. Has it timeskipped 3+ years?

I do not share your blas√© attitude towards how easy it is to avoid government notice, especially in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack. I think the fundamentals of our disagreement is that you act like it would be risk-free for her to try and intervene, even in a "bare minimum" fashion. I think you underestimate the resources of the U.S. government when it wants to know something. [[https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf][The 9/11 Commission Report]] is 585 pages, and this is a /summary/ of unclassified or declassified information. There are undoubtedly untold reams of data known to U.S. intelligence agencies about everyone involved in the attacks. At the very least using a burner phone would give investigators a time and general location. But remember that the WTC was the target of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing][an earlier terrorist attack in 1993]]. They would probably have recorded bomb threats, so now they also have her voice and a lot of background sounds to forensically analyze. Even if they did not record it, the operator would remember what she sounded like. But even this is an example of the question of leverage. The MC is a poor juvenile in 1998/2001 (prior to the widespread adoption of cellphones, especially by the young). Where is she supposed to get a burner phone, how is she supposed to pay for it, and what measures can she use to ensure it cannot be traced back to her? Burner phones can be traced, if you are not careful to obscure the trail or use criminal contacts that won't flip on you; investigators can find out where it was purchased and ask to whom it was sold. There would be many investigators whose entire job it would be to follow this one trail.

All of this would not matter if the MC is willing and able to reveal their status as a time traveler to the authorities, but there are some problems with that. Firstly, it is unlikely she would be believed. It is much more likely investigators would believe she had contact with one of the terrorists and knew the information that way; or that one of her parents, relatives or friends did, thus getting them in a lot of trouble too. When she insists she's a "time traveler, really", this would likely be seen as a lie, and quite possibly gain her and/or her family a quick trip to Guantanamo, or at least a similar U.S. based facility. And yes, there were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_juveniles_held_at_the_Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp][juveniles]] at Guantanamo, and yes there were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_detainees_at_Guantanamo_Bay][Americans]]. If they don't believe her, the /best/ she could probably hope for is commitment to a mental institution. On the other hand, if they /do/ believe her, they now have a resource that can give them information about the course of future events for the next 45 years. Do you really expect they would leave her to live her life? Or would you say she has the obligation to make this sacrifice? There is a reason most time traveler characters don't reveal themselves.

Furthermore, IIRC, she /has/ already saved one life, just not from a terrorist attack (from a shooting I think). It was a while ago I read it, so please forgive me if I got the details wrong, but you seem to have forgotten that, or possibly that people sometimes die in other ways than terrorist attacks. People save lives every day - these everyday heroes like firefighters and paramedics were particularly celebrated in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but perhaps you've forgotten that too. You don't need to wait for a terrorist attack to save people and she already has done, when she acted to swiftly call paramedics and save someone's life.
