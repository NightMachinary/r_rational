Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. At the absolute bare minimum she could've entered the tower and tried to persuade one person to leave. She could've called in a bomb threat to the building after the planes took off to try to get the building evacuated - calls on a burner phone with gloves aren't very easy to trace and even if it was traced it would be clear that she was trying to rescue people. That doesn't prevent the attack but even trying and completely failing is indescribably better than going "fuck all of them, I need a pedicure" or whatever.

  The problem of exploiting other future knowledge suffers from the same issue, specifically that most would not have the proper leverage to do so in their past lives (especially as a child, as vanishingly few children have any leverage at all).

Proper leverage to rescue even one person from disaster? She could at least try. And she will get leverage by developing Windows and google.
