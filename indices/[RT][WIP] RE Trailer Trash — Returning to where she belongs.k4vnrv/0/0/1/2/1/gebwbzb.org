  There are history books and news articles. Most of that stuff people probably wouldn't remember but most people would remember the terrorist attack on US and MJ legalization. Windows was released in '85, that's ~10 years of dev time to get a jump on the most successful computer product in the world.

How would you actually exploit any of those things? You are unexpectedly transported back into your teenage body in the '90s. You have only whatever resources you had at the time. Nobody is going to take you seriously about anything for years.

Windows wasn't successful because it was a brilliant computer program. It was successful because Bill Gates had money and connections back before DOS was a thing.

The sensible thing to do is get your life right. A lot of us had shitty teenage years for various reasons. Fix those things and set yourself up to succeed in the future.

  Putting all that aside, you implied that she didn't even try anything. Sure, it's possible that none of what she tried would've resulted in anything useful but the chance of failure is not a good reason not to try.

A high chance of failure is an excellent reason not to try. I don't buy lottery tickets because the expected pay is below zero.

If I were transported back to 2001 I /might/ try to prevent 9/11, but I would be /very/ careful because telling people details about a forthcoming attack on the US would be very suspicious when the FBI started taking me seriously in retrospect.
