What does selfish mean?

Practically speaking, most people wouldn't be able to make much impact if they jumped 50 years into their own past. I'm only 36, so obviously I can't remember 50 years ago, but even if I were jumped back 20 years I wouldn't be able to do much aside from a few good long term stock picks (and you have to have money to make money in the stock market).

That's not even getting into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#Sensitivity_to_initial_conditions][sensitivity to initial conditions]].
