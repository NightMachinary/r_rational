I agree. But meaningful help that someone with superpowers is able to provide is worlds away from meaningful help an internet random is able to provide. It's like asking Bill Gates to build a hospital vs some random off the street to build a hospital. Or asking a human to help out an animal vs expecting the animal to solve problems.
