Isn't the answer to such questions always 'somebody doesn't get their learning neural net/seed AI quite right before sticking it into a time loop, and we all die'?

Less flippantly:

- I expect many, /many/ zero-day exploits to occur starting six hours before Mr. Magic gave out time machines. Disconnect all devices from the Internet and hope you aren't too late (you are).

- The global economy crashes horribly. If the markets somehow manage to survive, there's probably now a six-hour (minimum) wait for any transaction.

- Spy agencies can recieve data from six hours into the future. Expect Minority Report-style police teams to show up seconds /after/ crimes have been committed.

- Disaster relief teams have up to six hours to prepare for instant response.

- Weather is predictable with perfect fidelity up to six hours ahead.

- Sufficiently motivated thieves can fence their loot /before/ stealing it.

How do the mechanics of time travel respond to precommitment to violate causality unless <improbable event> occurs? Can we use exploits like in chapter 17 of HPMOR (instant factoring of large numbers), or is there some 'do not mess with time' filter that intervenes?

HPMOR and some of the proposed solutions to the final exam talk about some of this in detail. I recall [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] has some detailed time travel exploits w.r.t. disaster response.
