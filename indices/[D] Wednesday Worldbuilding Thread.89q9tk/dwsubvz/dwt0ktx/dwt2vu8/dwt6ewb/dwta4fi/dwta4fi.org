  There are some interesting alert systems you can set in place for unexpected deaths - if someone is in a car accident, automatically send the name and cause of death back six hours. If the system receives a given name, send it back six hours later even if nothing happened in your time line. People who pay attention to this service should in theory never die due to sudden accidents (assuming you have an easy way to avoid whatever happened). Now in addition to 'sick days' at work you have 'death days', where you stay home because otherwise you'd get in a fatal traffic accident. If done right, deaths due to car/train/plane accidents, surgery, heart attack, drowning, and more can all be avoided.

This is a really quite brilliant way around the "no changing the past" thing, wow.
