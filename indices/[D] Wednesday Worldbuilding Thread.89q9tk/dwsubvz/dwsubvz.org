Time travel is difficult and expensive...or at least it was until some insane wizard teleported into our reality and made it easily available to Muggles in our world.

You have Time Turners as they are used in the Harry Potter books where anyone can travel back in time, but history can't be altered since all time traveling results in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop][Stable Time Loops]]. Arbitrary restrictions are no going back more than 6 hours into the past (even if you used a different one in the past to attempt 6 more hours), only one person can use a device at a time, and they are easily accessible (for at least the first few days before anyone tries to control their supply).

There is no other magic available; I'm just curious what impact Time Turners would have on our society.

EDIT: Feel free to also answer how you think society would develop if this ability has been around for a long time rather than it just miraculously appearing one day.
