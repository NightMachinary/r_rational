Let's say that the first intelligent life to develop in a galaxy grows bored of its Dyson Swarms and Arcturian Fire Brandy and decide to devote a significant portion of their resources to fucking with fucking with the fledgeling species that develop after them. Not to the level of landing in flying sausages and probing them, but more the kind of thing that would make a planet's astronomers look up and think /Hmm, that's odd.../ without immediately concluding that extraterrestrial life is to blame. What sort of cosmic-scale pranks could be played that could reasonably be detected by any new civilization (i.e., no perspective-dependent ones like messages in the constellations)?
