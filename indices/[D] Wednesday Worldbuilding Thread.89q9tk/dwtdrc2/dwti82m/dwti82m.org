Numerous superstitions are now true such as breaking mirrors give you 7 years of bad luck. Minor to major feats of magic are now possible depending on how good of a stage magician you are.

Very charismatic individuals will start cults to convince others that they are very charismatic to increase their ability to convince even more people to just trust and believe in them in a feedback loop. The end result are all royal families being virtual gods with the very common ability of the divine tongue of persuasion.

True scientific progress now can only be accomplished (if at all) with the mandatory requirement of double-blind studies, even for experiments with no human subjects. Furthermore, all details are kept hidden until after results have been determined to prevent people from speculating and thus ruining the outcome.

Gambling still exists, but in a different form since upsets are much rarer and difficult to pull off. The field of probability will likely develop in a different form due to this (the earliest form of probability calculation developed from gambling).

The insane are extremely dangerous due to their vastly divergent views on their surroundings.

Humans likely have very different emotions due to vastly different understanding of what it means to be 'surprised' or 'confused'.

There's endless amount of ways this kind of world could different from ours with beliefs having a visible impact on reality.
