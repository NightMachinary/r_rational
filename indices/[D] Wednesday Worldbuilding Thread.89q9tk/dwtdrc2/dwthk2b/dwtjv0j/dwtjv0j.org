It could somewhat work with some reinterpretations of history. Suppose this "belief-magic" slowly evolved with human intelligence, and can only be used by actual physical beings, not belief-beings. I.e., you can't believe in something that believes in itself to strengthen your belief magic. That seems like a natural law to have in a magic setting, just like how in standard magic settings you can't create more magic out of magic, so you can't cast magic spells to refill your MP bar.

And then you would need historical events to happen that weaken the power of magic to get to our modern world. First, you could have the church declare that magic is evil witchcraft (good motive: less magic = more stable societies/ evil motive: only my organization will have magic, called god's blessings). The people with stronger belief-magics that let them cause supernatural events would be branded as witches and swarmed by church believers who think god will protect them from evil witchcraft, thus nullifying the witch powers and making them helpless as they burn at stake.

The scientific revolution would then start out as some kind of conspiracy of magic-haters, who decide to raise societies that are indoctrinated from young with the belief that supernatural events are all frauds. It would then snowball quickly, because these societies would be full of powerful nullifiers, wiping out the belief-magics of other societies as they spread, adding more to their ranks as self-proclaimed mages try to use magic in front of the nullifiers and fail because they have been nullified, further "proving" that magic isn't real to everyone watching.
