Thanks for engaging in this.

Ideally I would like as few patches as possible.

I'll remind you that people can't choose what they believe. They might think that they believe something when they really don't. That of course doesn't stop the charismatic leaders from persuading people but it does stop the low hanging munchkin. For instance you can't just start believing that food instantly pops into existance because you are hungry and need it.

On that note it seems likely to me that charismatic leaders with sufficiently many followers did become gods. I'm not seeing any good arguments as to why people wouldn't be affected by other people's beliefs, so you'd expect that gods would end up acting in certain set patterns, as many people not only had beliefs about their power but also their behaviour. There's nothing wrong in any of that.

I'd say that intelligence probably should be separate from(or perhaps even have a diminishing effect on) belief effects, as both take energy. A certain intellince would be required to have a model of the world but I haven't decided on why people specifically have this power. I am thinking either

- It's related to some set of natural laws that the human brain chemistry happened to mutate to mildly affect. Evolution made it more powerful but evolution is a slow and messy process, and belief control is a complex process. The complexness of it also slows the process.
- Another specie(or species) actually were first and their beliefs granted humans the same power(or actually created humans). The animalism religions are remnants of that period and humans won the great war.

Your point about power convergence is valid although I think you are overstating the nessecity. Different groups fight over power and empires crumble, especially if they are controlled by people who act in patterns. I wonder how settings in which gods are powered by worshippers tend to handle that.

The point about the power of population is valid. It isn't as much a problem historically speaking but it's a problem for the story I had in mind. Essentially MC and others have their limiters removed and have their beliefs altered to fight off a major existential threat. It would just be more efficient to breed a trillion kids and convince them that a) someone has absolute power b) pregnancy happens in seconds and c) food spontaneously appear if you are hungry. Suggestions for reasons to why that might not happen aside from moral conserns?
