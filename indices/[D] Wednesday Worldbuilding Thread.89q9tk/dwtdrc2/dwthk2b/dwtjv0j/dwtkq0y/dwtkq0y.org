  It could somewhat work with some reinterpretations of history. Suppose this "belief-magic" slowly evolved with human intelligence, and can only be used by actual physical beings, not belief-beings. I.e., you can't believe in something that believes in itself to strengthen your belief magic. That seems like a natural law to have in a magic setting, just like how in standard magic settings you can't create more magic out of magic, so you can't cast magic spells to refill your MP bar.

See this doesn't really work as a solution because beliefs are stated to be able to have nearly unlimited power to affect the physical world (they can even affect the laws of physics after all!). Which means if "spirits" can't have their belief count then instead people could simply believe in other entities who are close enough to physical humans.\\
Also if belief magic evolved with human intelligence then you have the same evolutionary issues I mentioned before. Except in this case maybe it's some birds, monkeys or whales who first reach the starting point, then they rapidly begin an evolutionary arms race to increase their belief power (through stronger beliefs, more intelligence) which again results in things being rules by eldritch gods.

Similarly you're thinking of things as being way too close to our own world starting out. For instance since nearly all cultures start out with animism and belief in magic then those cultures will actually have that magic. They will believe in it much more strongly because they see it which results in a rapid feedback loop. Point is magic would start out way too much a part of everyone's life for any ideology to take hold which actually forbid it, for the same reasons it would be wildly implausible to imagine some sort of super-luddites ever converting most of the world to their religion in the modern world.
