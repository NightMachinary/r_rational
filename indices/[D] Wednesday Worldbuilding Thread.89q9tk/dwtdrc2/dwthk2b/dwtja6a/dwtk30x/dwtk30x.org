Even without beliefs being able to directly affect how other beliefs are scored (as in belief that some beliefs have more or less psychological "power" doesn't affect them) pretty much all of the same issues still remain.

For instance if you can't tamper with how beliefs are scored then you can simply increase the strength of your own belief to incredible levels and also increase the strength of others shared belief, so effectively you're altering your mind so that you can generate the amount of belief that would ordinarily be created by a vastly larger number of people.\\
Similarly you could believe rather strongly in fertility related magic and have your tribe take over because you all have a crazy amount of kids which mature extremely fast and are all extremely conformist and share their parents beliefs. Even better however you don't need to rely on normal breeding either, since you can just believe in the existence of spirits which share your beliefs. This belief thus creates those spirits ex-nihilo and then those spirits can produce more belief power, thus enabling them to spawn even more spirits.. leading to an exponential explosion...

Another thing to mention would be that even putting the above issues aside there's still going to be a tendency for things to converge until you get a single god. After all you start out with lots of shamans, but some of those shamans go to war and defeat others with their magic. This results in them having new people who believe in and fear their power thus increasing it further. And so sooner or later you end up with a single god who is never usurped because nearly everyone believes in their power and so any usurpers can't hope to compete with that since they have less belief power.
