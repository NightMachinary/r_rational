Hmmm, but what if beliefs aren't recursive? Beliefs still have their power to affect the world, but now meta-beliefs don't have any effects. You can believe that shamans have magical powers which leads to godlike shamans, but if you believe that the shaman's belief has more 'weight' than other people's beliefs, the shaman's beliefs stay equal to others.
