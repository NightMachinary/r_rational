Apples fall down because people believe they fall down. People grow old because they are expected to.

Imagine a world that look like ours on the surface but that are run by the belief of people down to the core. We'll call the unit of belief mana. Each person only have a certain amount of mana and mana is spent unconciously to effect the world in the way that the person believes. People who have certain strong beliefs have more of their mana allocated to those beliefs and people with no strong beliefs don't use their mana as much. Effects are localized by default but can be extended with a diminished return of effect, ie. the belief that everything is made of atoms is universal and therefore each person who believes it only reinforces it with a tiny ammount. Two contradicting beliefs can damage each other, with the stronger ending out on top or can create multiple coexisting subbeliefs.

Imagine the total power of all humans to be growing linearly by the number of people with a sharp artificial drop around the scientific revolution, such that a hypothetical belief created just before that period that were shared by all people would be roughly 4 times the strength of a similar belief created today.

Clearly there would be weak versions of the older gods and some version of an abrahamic god exist. Hinduism have a lot of followers by they also have a large number of gods so each individual god would have relative less power. Vampires exist in many different variations, not by geographic location but by trope.

In which other ways do you think that the world would be different?
