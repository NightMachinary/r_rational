- Hide, like 90% of the matter in the universe. The poor rubes will never figure it out!
- Bury dragon skeletons beneath every life-bearing planet. That'll put the fear of space-god into the primitives!
- What if-- get this-- we set /mass/ to curve /spacetime/. HAHAHAHAHA. Just think of how hard it'll be to make time machines!
- We can [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] where [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. A little mean, but as long as nobody finds out, what they don't know can't hurt them.
- So you know how we discovered that beautifully elegant theory of all physics centered around a single fundamental force and a deterministic universe that allows both free will and objective truth? Let's obfuscate it by having [REDACTED] vibrate at high speed whenever some species tries to observe planck-scale events. They'll be able to make some good guesses, but they'll ever know for sure how the universe ticks. Suckers.
- And finally, let's set a universal speed limit, so intelligent species can't meet up and compare notes about our shenanigans. That'll keep the ruse going indefinitely. (Or at least until the developers get back and patch the exploit that let us do that.)

And the best part is, [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. Oh man, this is going to be the best prank /ever/. We could literally go down to the primitives and tell them everything, and they still wouldn't believe us.
