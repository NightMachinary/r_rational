  I'll remind you that people can't choose what they believe. They might think that they believe something when they really don't. That of course doesn't stop the charismatic leaders from persuading people but it does stop the low hanging munchkin. For instance you can't just start believing that food instantly pops into existance because you are hungry and need it.

Given humans seem to be really good at tricking themselves into believing things that are convenient (for instance it's bizzare how many cult leaders start out knowing they're full of shit but eventually end up drinking their own kool aid, potentially even literally), so given the limited power of a single belief anyway I'm not sure world breaking power being limited to cults really solves the major issues here.

  On that note it seems likely to me that charismatic leaders with sufficiently many followers did become gods. I'm not seeing any good arguments as to why people wouldn't be affected by other people's beliefs, so you'd expect that gods would end up acting in certain set patterns, as many people not only had beliefs about their power but also their behaviour. There's nothing wrong in any of that.

Yes in theory you could do just fine with a setting with gods, however the primary issue with this settings premise is that it tends to rapidly spiral into the kind of setting too alien to really write stories in. And even if you limited writing to the transitionary period when things would still be recognizable to humans, well it's pretty much impossible to try to take into account all of the the complex interactions involved here.

For instance here's some things off the top of my head that would be an issue with a world that rapidly ended up devolving into having gods: For one you probably wouldn't have multiple gods for long, since whichever god was slightly strongest would likely win out in terms of belief and in a direct conflict any small gains could be amplified. If course their would be some randomness here, however long term having a single god would seem like the only stable scenario.\\
Secondly since people will probably believe their god to be the most wise and the most just it seems like things sort of end up with you having effectively a godlike FAI which while desirable does get you a very alien world without large scale conflict.\\
And lastly is that due to the feedback loop that grants charismatic people mind control, it's likely that competing gods are going to turn their followers into not totally human thralls in order to gain the upper hand. Which of course results in a even more alien outcome than a FAI utopia.

  Your point about power convergence is valid although I think you are overstating the nessecity. Different groups fight over power and empires crumble, especially if they are controlled by people who act in patterns. I wonder how settings in which gods are powered by worshippers tend to handle that.

As someone who doesn't spend entirely too much time munchkining fictional scenarios I think you serious underestimate the scale of the issue here. It's not just that power will tend to snowball, but that once it does you're never going back to normal. Once one empire of cultists gains an edge they can beat everyone else and then there's no realistic way for less powerful factions to gain power. Worse for the reasons I stated before the end result isn't do much a fantasy world with gods who grant their clerics power, but something so alien it's hard to even speculate about.

Even putting aside power convergence I haven't even gone over all the ways the setting is going to be massively altered just by the beliefs most people hold by default. For instance nearly everyone believes they are above average in basically every regard, which means that every person has the belief of most people being worse than them causing them to /become/ worse and most people only have a small group of people whose beliefs will protect them from the rest of humanity.\\
So if everyone believes they're cleverer and healthier than most people then everyone will have their abilities reduced in an out of control feedback loop until either they die from some physical qualities being reduced too far, or the population is all rendered too dumb for their beliefs to hold any power.

Another example is that tribes (i'd say groups generally except all this starts mattering during a period when non-tribe groups wouldn't really be prominent) tend to naturally demonize their outgroup. Which means that if every tribe is demonizing every other tribe except themselves then you get another feedback loop that results in humanity rendered cartoonishly evil, though of course I can't predict exactly how the various feedback loops would interact but it doesn't likely end well.

And of course that's just a spattering of random beliefs people basically all have by default due to their psychology, which would rapidly overhaul and begin rapidly throwing the setting off the rails right out of the gate.
