  Eh, it's magic. There's always ways to sidestep problems like this just by using more magic explanations. There's no reason why the laws of physics should be the ultimate laws. You can have spiritual laws that can't be altered no matter what. You can make humans have magical souls that can't be created with belief-magic, and these souls are only given to naturally created humans by immutable spiritual laws or a saptient true god who won't fall for your belief-magic creations.

See even that doesn't work because people start using fertility magic to breed at some absurd rate or something similar. More generally the issue here is that the amount of rules you need to tack on to make a system like this work is so extensive that you either end up defining your preferred system into existence (which feels a bit dirty and renders questions of what a world with those rules would be like moot) or you almost certainly leave loopholes. And not the sort of loopholes that make it exploitable by a clever munchkin either, but the kind of loopholes that destroy plausible deniability.\\
Not to mention you have /sooo/ many other exploits besides just creating more people to share your beliefs.

  I'm thinking of making the starting point more recent so it is closer to our world. Since this magic is based on "belief", it isn't unreasonable to assume it has some minimum intelligence requirement to activate, since creatures that are too dumb can't have "beliefs". Make it so that this minimum threshold was only passed by humans in recent history (~10000 years), so the animals can't join in, and belief-magic would only become strong enough start having significant effects around maybe ~5000 years ago as humans kept getting smarter.

The issue is that that explanation doesn't even come close to working, you would be better off just saying humans got this power at a set point in time just because.\\
It doesn't work because if you say that a certain level of intelligence is required for beliefs to "count" then you're forced to exclude any belief which wasn't produced by a cognitive process of some given level of complexity which becomes super hard to apply as a rule. Not to mention it's not clear how you would even go about judging a cut off like that since animals which are clearly capable of having complex models of the world that could be called beliefs have been around long before humans.\\
Not to mention if you're going to set a cut off point wherein this only starts applying to proto humans then you're still going to have an evolutionary arms race since the selection effect for intelligence is suddenly vastly greater, which almost certainly doesn't result in something that looks like modern humans.\\
Also there's really no evidence that the genetic underpinning for human intelligence has really meaningfully changed in the last 10k years and even some weak evidence which would seem to point in the other direction. I mean you have the Flynn effect more recently, however a lot of what that covers is getting rid of malnutrition, chemical exposure and other thing which would have affected agrarian cultures more than hunter gatherers (as in how we were for nearly all of our history) also if you're talking about something like that then only sufficiently clever people should have these abilities so they wouldn't just suddenly arise.

  Assuming the spiritual laws we discussed earlier prevent beliefs from recursively strengthening themselves, the feedback loop will max out at using all of a person's mana when it becomes a fundamental belief, and stop getting stronger from that point until you get more people to believe it. Then you can set the belief-magic cap to a low amount so they can't become omnipowerful without getting more people to join.
#+end_quote

See you really can't fundamentally stop beliefs from strengthening themselves if you're going to accept that some people have stronger beliefs than others or even that intelligence is a relevant multiplier on power. If you have it be graduated like you were previous implying then that gradient is going to be something that can be exploited by using belief to "hack" the brain as it were. Also getting other people to join in is also something with plenty of other extremely exponential feedback loops as well, for instance as has been pointed out charismatic people could end up in a feedback loop that ends with them having mind control.\\
Sure you could crudely attempt to patch those issues but you either end up with vague rules that basically just eliminate anything you don't like (which isn't great world building) or you leave /many/ loopholes no matter how you try to avoid them.

  Is it so implausible though? Suppose a skeptic tribe and a mage tribe of roughly equal power went to war against each other. Then, just by random chance, the number of people from each tribe that participate in each skirmish would be different, and so there would be skirmishes where the mage beliefs are stronger and they can use their magic, and skirmishes where the skeptic beliefs are stronger and the mages magics fail.
#+end_quote

What you're failing to realize is that you don't get skeptic tribes period, I'm literally unaware of /a single culture/ that didn't start out with widespread supernatural beliefs and practice something like magic (even if it be praying to deities). So if all cultures start out with magic it's hard to imagine an exception gaining power, since they have to compete in terms of belief not just with their enemies but also with the entire rest of the human race. Also it's pretty likely people would be using magic to help them get food, cure disease and other such things so people would be extremely resistance to relinquishing magic and doing so would /severely/ lower their genetic/memetic fitness.

#+begin_quote
  What about the skirmish where the magic succeeds? Well, the mages would validate their beliefs that magic is real and strong enough to counter the skeptics' nullifying powers, that's a positive feedback loop. But the skeptics won't believe that magic is real. They are skeptics. They will think it is a fraud. That the mages are just using tricks to create special effects that they call magic. That the mages' magic is mostly fakes that they can't consistently produce at the same power. And so the skeptics' belief that magic isn't real reduces by little or not at all. So the feedback loop on this side is weaker.

See this seems like a wildly implausible scenario, "sir the shaman blew up Grogg with lightning!" "No it was just a trick" "but he did blow up sir" "well /yes/ but it wasn't /magic/" "What the hell does it matter what we call it!". The issue is that proving something (like say magic) is super easy and not a gradual process, however _dis_proving it is much harder and is a gradual process of lowering certainty (when it comes to something expected to be unpredictable to begin with). Plus if you see your enemies doing something, well you may deny it's magic but you still believe they can do that because you saw it, and what you call something probably doesn't really matter here.
