  See this doesn't really work as a solution because beliefs are stated to be able to have nearly unlimited power to affect the physical world (they can even affect the laws of physics after all!). Which means if "spirits" can't have their belief count then instead people could simply believe in other entities who are close enough to physical humans.

Eh, it's magic. There's always ways to sidestep problems like this just by using more magic explanations. There's no reason why the laws of physics should be the ultimate laws. You can have spiritual laws that can't be altered no matter what. You can make humans have magical souls that can't be created with belief-magic, and these souls are only given to naturally created humans by immutable spiritual laws or a saptient true god who won't fall for your belief-magic creations.

  Also if belief magic evolved with human intelligence then you have the same evolutionary issues I mentioned before.

  Similarly you're thinking of things as being way too close to our own world starting out.

I'm thinking of making the starting point more recent so it is closer to our world. Since this magic is based on "belief", it isn't unreasonable to assume it has some minimum intelligence requirement to activate, since creatures that are too dumb can't have "beliefs". Make it so that this minimum threshold was only passed by humans in recent history (~10000 years), so the animals can't join in, and belief-magic would only become strong enough start having significant effects around maybe ~5000 years ago as humans kept getting smarter.

  For instance since nearly all cultures start out with animism and belief in magic then those cultures will actually have that magic. They will believe in it much more strongly because they see it which results in a rapid feedback loop.
#+end_quote

Assuming the spiritual laws we discussed earlier prevent beliefs from recursively strengthening themselves, the feedback loop will max out at using all of a person's mana when it becomes a fundamental belief, and stop getting stronger from that point until you get more people to believe it. Then you can set the belief-magic cap to a low amount so they can't become omnipowerful without getting more people to join.

  for the same reasons it would be wildly implausible to imagine some sort of super-luddites ever converting most of the world to their religion in the modern world.

Is it so implausible though? Suppose a skeptic tribe and a mage tribe of roughly equal power went to war against each other. Then, just by random chance, the number of people from each tribe that participate in each skirmish would be different, and so there would be skirmishes where the mage beliefs are stronger and they can use their magic, and skirmishes where the skeptic beliefs are stronger and the mages magics fail.

Let's look at how the beliefs of each tribe change in each skirmish. In the skirmish where the magic fails, the skeptics validate their beliefs that magic isn't real, that's a positive feedback loop. The mages start doubting their magics, since they failed, or start believing the skeptic tribe has some kind of magic nullifying ability. That is also a feedback loop that makes it more likely for magic to fail in future skirmishes.

What about the skirmish where the magic succeeds? Well, the mages would validate their beliefs that magic is real and strong enough to counter the skeptics' nullifying powers, that's a positive feedback loop. But the skeptics won't believe that magic is real. They are skeptics. They will think it is a fraud. That the mages are just using tricks to create special effects that they call magic. That the mages' magic is mostly fakes that they can't consistently produce at the same power. And so the skeptics' belief that magic isn't real reduces by little or not at all. So the feedback loop on this side is weaker.

This way of thinking, that other people are frauds trying to trick you, gives the skeptics a massive advantage in terms of belief feedback loops. This in turn could make them win against mage tribes of equal strength, absorb them and turn them into more skeptics, and thus expand exponentially the same way mage tribes did. It wouldn't work if they went up against mage tribes that were significantly stronger than them, but in thousands of years it's not so hard to believe that some skeptic tribe eventually gets lucky in their battle matchups.

Alternatively, you could always just tweak the magic system to give the skeptics an advantage. You could argue that since mage beliefs force the world to deviate from the natural order, they cost more mana than skeptic beliefs that bring the world back to its natural state. Thus nullifying magic would be far stronger than other magics.
