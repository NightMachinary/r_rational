For one thing settings like this have the obvious issue that no matter what you do it's /never/ going to look remotely like our world unless you're massively tampering with things so they don't progress naturally.

Firstly you have the issue of how things arise in the first place, is the world following the same rules as our own up until some life evolves intelligent enough to start mucking everything up? If so then you expect the first fish with an internal model of the world (and thus beliefs) to rapidly evolve to have stronger and stronger beliefs (about things important to its genetic fitness) until the universe is dominated by fish-gods.

If the ability isn't gradually imbued and just instantly appears in early humans then things are still going to be pretty weird. After all for most of human history people overwhelmingly believed in animism and magic, which means you're going to suddenly have humans be outnumbered by non-human spirits whose beliefs will then trump those of humans. Alternatively another stable attractor state might be that since people believe in magic tribal shamans will have their beliefs count vastly more because of other people's belief in their power. They can then use this power to impress their followers thus reinforcing the beliefs in their power even more, this spirals upwards until the world ends up ruled by a single godlike tribal shaman or multiple ones (though having more than one is likely to be an unstable equilibrium).

There's different ways things could play out depending on initial conditions, however something that needs to be understood about powers like this is that they're extremely likely to spiral out of control due to feedback loops in people's belief or other situations where the power of belief is having a recursive effect on itself.\\
One thing however you should never see is magic getting /less/ powerful, since people will always believe in it if they've seen it and human tendencies bend towards exaggeration rather than downplaying events so magic should always get more powerful over time.
