Well, sick people would get better even if they eat sugar pills that they think will cure them instead of medicin- oh wait that's the placebo effect.

Umm... people would be able to believe random pieces of paper or virtual bits are valuable, and they will actually become valuab- oh wait that's money and bitcoins.

Err... when people expect something to happen they will see it happen more ofte- oh wait that's confirmation bias.

Hmm... there would be psychics wielding supernatural powers because they believe they are special, and then skeptics who strongly believe that there's no such thing as supernatural powers would go to the psychics and prove that they are frauds, and the stronger belief of the skeptic would nullify the psychic's powers so psychic powers are never proven... argh!

Oh I know! The scientific revolution produced a lot of skeptics so the frequency of supernatural events per person per day should be far lower after the scientific revolution than befor- oh wait it is.

Erm... are we sure we aren't already living in this world?
