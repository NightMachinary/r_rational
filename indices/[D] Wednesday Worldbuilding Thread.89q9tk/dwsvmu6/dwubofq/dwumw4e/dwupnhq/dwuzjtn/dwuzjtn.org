Seems like the solution is to limit the growth of dreamborn to a lower rate than that the server's growth, which would probably mean most people stay at near-human intelligence so their dreams are less detailed. The more superintelligences there are, the more excess space they need for the dreamborn they are more likely to make.

The big consequence of this is that most characters can be relatively human, and that a server with even a single superintelligence can have huge populations of dreamborn from worlds they had imagined. However, I'll say that a superintelligence doesn't need to sleep on a daily basis so new worlds aren't constantly appearing overnight.
