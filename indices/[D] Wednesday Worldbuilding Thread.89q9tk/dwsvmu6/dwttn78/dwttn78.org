I once read a fascinating novel about a company that recruited children to act as salesmen to trade items in some sort of similar dream world, exploring the infinite, and trading for things that could only be found there. I read this book years back however, and have no idea what it was called, or how they managed to access the dreamscape...

EDIT: there was some strong theme of technology? Something about gadgets, or gizmos... I actually don't know how good it was, but I'd be interested in reading it again...
