I saw the present situation as the solution superintelligences came up with, everyone's dreams can be saved as simulations and the hive mind can tell when sentience emerges from a sufficient accumulation of data. There may even be theories about whether biological minds have always dreamt up sentient people who died upon waking, so they feel morally obligated to preserve this newly discovered life.

Additionally, they probably view integrating dreams into their civilization as a net positive. New people, places, and ideas are being created all the time in a post-scarcity society of immortals who want for nothing. What else is there to do once you grow bored with your comfort zone but to seek out novelty? It's not like they're short on space in a matrioshka brain, and even if they were they can just put people in stasis for now.
