I'm trying to refine this setting that I thought of, I need help to identify any inconsistent elements and to further develop my ideas.

In this world, there is Mana, which is everywhere, it can be used by many plants and animals, and all humans. So it depends if an animal evolved to use magic or not and humans did evolve to use magic.

So the magic can be used by all humans but there are differences in how much mana their body can process, so this leads to weaker or stronger magic users. It's somewhat dependent on genetics but not entirely, kind of like intelligence.

So magic has always been part of life for people of this world, of course there will be other humanoid races which I haven't fleshed out yet. There's also wide variety of magical beasts and plants. Mythical beasts like dragons unicorns, etc as well.

The first humans were able to use very basic and simple magic, highly inefficient and very intuitive kind of magic, they overtime improved in using magic. But most early human communities developed Ritual magic first as it allowed them to sidestep the early inefficiency of magic. Magic was passed on within families and became like an inheritance.

Later on as the humans began to settle down, and agriculture happened, the communities began to specialise in certain types of magic. Families began to specialise in their own type of magic, and as they developed the most powerful families were leading the village, and against external threats these villages were forced to develop into cities. A city is ruled by a council made up of the most powerful families as well as independent mage who are powerful.

So each area(city and its surroundings) in this world, would have their own general specialty, like one area specialises in water magic, etc. It would depend on what type of area they live in, and what type of threats they face.

There are no limits to the type of magic one can practice, as it all depends on time and practice.

There is also the aspect of bloodline magic, certain types of magic can be passed on to your descendents, most bloodline magic is created through rituals. And in order for descendents to awaken their bloodline magic, they have to complete a step according to the ritual, otherwise the bloodline magic will lie dormant. A dormant bloodline will still give you some enhancements.

There are no religions in this world and no gods, there may be powerful god like entities but no gods, and no organised religion.

And also this world never develops kingdoms and empires, the largest polity would be cities and there will be no Kings or royalty, as the rule of cities is done jointly by the strongest families, no single family is strong enough to rule the city alone and it is near impossible to destroy a strong family as they'll have built up magical defences over the generations on their Home and the same with cities, taking a city is too costly to attempt which is why no one has been able to conquer another city. So no kingdoms.

Many magical beasts have special materials which can be harvested not always by killing them. There also natural materials like magical metals or crystals which have special uses.

Types of magic specialisations

Slayers- This is a magic that absorbs certain aspects of magical beasts that you slay, like killing a dragon may give you claws or scales etc, depends on the ritual. It also gives general enhancments to strengh, speed etc Can be passed on through bloodline magic.

Shifters- This is a magic that allows one to turn into a magical beast, the ritual requires a live specimen of the beast. Can be passed on through bloodlines.

Tamers - These guys raise magic beasts for their materials as well as for fighting and selling as familiars. They are the experts in rearing beasts, different families specialise in rearing different kinds of beasts, and the knowledge is accumulated over the generations.

Riders- These guys are experts in riding magical beasts and for combat They tie their bloodline with a bloodline of magical beasts and leave them in the wild so that their descendents can find the beasts and awaken their connection.

Hunters - These guys hunt special magical beasts for materials or juvenile beasts to sell, they also specialise in certain areas and types of beasts as the knowledge is accumulated through the generations.

Herbalists - These guys dabble in using herbs and plants to create concoctions for healing and buffs etc. The knowledge is passed on through generations.

Elementalists - These are magic users who use elemental magic and have contracted elementals which particularly strengthens their elemental magic. The elementals are found in special regions and contracting one is very difficult, the knowledge in how to find and contract one is passed on in families.

Shamans- They specialise in using rituals and are proficient in buffing and enhancement magics. They can make permanent enhancement through ritual tattoos by binding the spirits of departed beasts. The rituals are passed on in the families.

Druids- They specialise in using rituals to be able to transform into magical beasts, but this requires a special part of the beast(like unicorns horn) and a ritual and they have to always keep that part of the beast to transform, and they can only transform for a limited amount of time. The beast part can be passed on to descendents but they'll have to redo the ritual to be able to transform at will.

Enchanters - They are able to enchant items or weapons to be able to produce certain magical effects when those items are infused with mana. The knowledge of the enchantments is passed on through families.

Smiths- These are the people who work with magical metals and magical beast parts to shape them into weapons or armors etc. The knowledge of how to work with different magical animals or metals is passed on in the family.

Seekers(Ranger?) - They specialise in magic that allows them to be stealthy and fins the lairs magical beasts or find magical plants to sell. The techniques and magic of surviving is passed on in the family.

Hexblades - They are magic users who have mastered the use of magic weapons and posses a variety of different magical weapons. They magical weapons are passed on in the families.

Explorers - They specialise in searching for new things, magical beasts, magical plants or trees, special places, exploring dangerous areas, making contact with other races etc. To be an explorer you need to be really powerful and/or rich to finance expeditions. These are very rare and no families specialise in it.

Wizards - These guys are at the forefront of researching magic and studying and creating magic, they mainly use spells to induce magical effects and create scrolls, expendable spells which are powered by imbuing the scroll with mana.

Casters- They use magic through voice like poetry or singing, this helps them focus the magic and can strengthen the magic. The art of poetry or singing needs to be taught, passed on in familes, and the power of magic needs to be bound to the voice through a ritual, which turns it into a bloodline.

Arcanists(Magewright) - They use language as the basis of magic, using it to shape magic. The language needs to be bound to magic through a ritual first. The language is kept secret and only passed on in the family

Sorcerers- They are powerful magic users who have not learned or can't control their power fully. They have large capacity to process management but with that they rarely learn to finely control magic. They are usually born to small families and thus their magical guidance is limited.

Warlocks-??? Witches-??? Magi-???

Some problems that I have is that with no religion, how will the people find a purpose in life, in the beginning it'll just be survival and then as they develop what will their goals or motivations be? How will they stay on the correct moral code? Also what should I do about souls, as I believe that souls are eternal in this world so where will they go after death? Reincarnation or a spirit world? Any questions and critique is welcome
