In a virtual universe, the ultimate resource is processing power; finite, rapidly filled by sentients (who grow exponentially in number), and, ultimately, running out - unless there is some means to carefully ration it, and ensure that the growth in the number of people does not outpace the growth in space for people.

This... could actually be a solution for that problem. If all means of creating sentients /other than/ dreams was disallowed. (That is, you can't fork a copy of yourself, and you can't create a mind to order).

Lucid dreamers then become the only source of custom-designed minds, but anyone who /really/ wants a certain kind of person to exist can make the attempt to dream that person up...
