Honestly, the Dreamborn alone will eventually flood any server that grows at less-than-exponential rates. If this has already happened and the Dreamborn have priority access to new CPU space, then it's possible that the only new people ever added to the sim are Dreamborn... and the worse the problem gets, the longer even Dreamborn are held in stasis before being given runtime...
