I actually thought that there'd be enough reason to not endlessly create people already, but I actually like this idea. I wouldn't expect making minds on purpose to be illegal in every circumstance, you just need to jump through legal and financial hoops first.

Even if you did make someone without the resources to care for them, they'd be put in stasis. However, the dream-born are subsidized because they can be created by accident. I know this sounds like a pretty idealized world, but I prefer the idea of conflicts being more personal than societal.
