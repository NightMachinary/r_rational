I have a sci-fi world that combines elements of The Matrix, Westworld, and Inception in my most high concept idea yet. The Singularity may have solved many problems by uploading everyone into a virtual universe where they could do whatever they wanted, but it turned out that even digital minds need regular REM sleep in order to stay sane. This wouldn't be that big an issue, except that dreaming is now a high-fidelity simulation the subconscious mind creates to trick you into thinking it's real.

This simulation increases in detail with the brain's processing power, which can't be modified on a daily basis, so what happens when someone dreams sentient life into existence? This is a society that thinks it's immoral to delete sentient life and that free will cannot be expressed in a universe run by an omnipresent god, so the only ethical thing to do is save the data from the dreams and integrate it into the virtual reality. People who's whole lives were imagined overnight become refugees in the waking world, while first contact is made with sprawling worlds created by the musings of massive minds.

What kind of civilization would this be where the dreamscape is a new frontier for exploration? I can see immigrants saving money to recreate loved ones who didn't make the cut, political debates about whether to change imaginary worlds to be more hospitable or set up an afterlife, and lucid dreamers being charged with imagining what it was like when people mourned the dead since it subjected people to suffering that turned out to be real.

I honestly don't have an idea for a story in this world, I just think it's an interesting twist on the idea of life in a simulation that allows for boundless possibilities. It could be be like if Night Vale was an urban ghetto in Altered Carbon, Star Trek meets Psychonauts where they visit worlds of fiction filtered through someone's subconscious, a coming of age story about a romantic fantasy searching for the person who made them, or a criminal who hides from the law inside other people's dreams.
