Why not require those who are advanced enough to dream up sentience to be trained enough in lucid dreaming to not do so automatically? If sentience can be detected and saved from a dream at its conclusion, why can't its imminent formation be detected and aborted? Perhaps it is discovered that not dreaming of people at all gives you mental problems such as losing your theory of mind. Perhaps the current Manhattan project is to have the enhanced humans research how to solve this whole problem while at night they spawn a managable number of immigrants. It seems to me this scenario will be hard to tweak such that it would be hard for a /civilization/ of /superintelligences/ to solve; and if you succeed that fine-tuning might be enough to have the characters discover the fourth wall.
