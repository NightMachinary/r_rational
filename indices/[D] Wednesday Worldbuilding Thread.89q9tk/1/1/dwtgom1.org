In order to really make this sensible you need to put a limitation about not being able to use roundabout ways to transmit information farther back than 6 hours, because as is there' nothing stopping multiple people chaining information together as far back as desired, this restriction is basically mandatory because if you don't implement it then you should expect the post-singularity world to /immediately/ spill backwards in time resulting in a world full of bizarre bootstrap paradoxes and stable time loops that nonetheless is extremely alien.\\
Also you will probably need to alter things such that time itself actively conspires to prevent you from abusing bootstrap paradoxes or using the stable time loop limitation to generate arbitrary information and other such tricks.

Basically if you don't want this to immediately end up turning into some incomprehensible post singularity setting you'll need to put the same limits on the time turners as were implemented in HPMoR.
