  How do the mechanics of time travel respond to precommitment to violate causality unless <improbable event> occurs?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure because I don't have too good of a grasp on the consequences on whether or not causality is violated or what it means if improbable events can be easily 'fabricated'. The closest understanding I have is the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes][Outcome Pump]] which basically means easy access to godlike power.

  Can we use exploits like in chapter 17 of HPMOR (instant factoring of large numbers), or is there some 'do not mess with time' filter that intervenes?
#+end_quote

If I say that the exploits are possible without 'do not mess with time' issues, how do you think it would play out?

Thanks for the ideas!
