  If I say that the exploits are possible without 'do not mess with time' issues, how do you think it would play out?

Then password hacking and various cryptography hacks become laughably small-scale. Think *BIGGER!* If you are the first person to get a time turner, do the following:

1. Write a computer program that quickly outputs random strings of characters in black every time you run it. Make it output the characters in red if the new string is exactly the same as the previous string. Make it so that every random string is equally likely: i.e., "a" is as likely as "asdaiosidfhpjdq jwi dq23rvW#$WV!.a, isd".

2. With the program open and ready to run, close your eyes for a while.

3. When you open them:

3a. if the program hasn't been run, wait 6 hours, then time turn back and run the program.

3b. otherwise, obey the outputted string to the best of your ability. Within the next 6 hours, if you become god, time turn back and use your god powers to make the program output the same string you obeyed. If you haven't become god, time turn back, and run the program. If the program gives the same random string that you just obeyed, run it again and again until either you get a different random string or you got the same string 1000 times in a row (you can immediately tell if it is the same string after the second time because it will be output in red).

There are only three stable time loops:

A) You find that the program hasn't been run. You died in the next 6 hours, before you would time turn back. So future you never comes back to run the program. Try to prevent this loop by staying in a very secure location and doing nothing dangerous for those 6 hours.

B) You find that the program has been run. You obeyed the random string and became god. You time turned back and used your god powers to make the program output the same random string. You are now god.

C) You find that the program has been run. You obeyed the random string but did not become god. You time turned back and ran the program, but it gave the same string. You ran it again and again a thousand times but it kept giving the same string out of sheer random chance. You conclude that either there is no way to become god in 6 hours that can be written in a million characters, or you are extremely unlucky. Like somewhere around 1/10^{1000?} unlucky depending on how many ways there are to become god in 6 hours that can be written in 1 million characters.

If you get outcome (A), you are now dead. Should have planned your secure location better.

If you get outcome (B), you are now god. Pat yourself on the back, remake the world to your will or whatever.

If you get outcome (C), repeat the experiment with a different overpowered goal. Like finding instructions for how to freely time travel or gaining super speed (which would make the next set of experiments far more powerful since now you can do a lot more in 6 hours). If you're in a rush, you can actually combine a lot of these experiments together to get more out of your time.
