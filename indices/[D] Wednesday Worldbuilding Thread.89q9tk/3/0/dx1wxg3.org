  Some problems that I have is that with no religion, how will the people find a purpose in life, in the beginning it'll just be survival and then as they develop what will their goals or motivations be? People are not born with religion. People will find a purpose in life the same way people will find a purpose in life now. For most people religion isn't their purpose in life or a primary concern even if they pay lip service to it. Moral codes are generally acquired through culture rather than scripture. People aren't magically born with an inherent desire to serve a god or gods. They get trained into it via systems of reward and punishment and stuff like the threat of hell that doesn't always take.

The reason people don't murder others isn't because they are born with an ingrained desire to serve religion and religion says murdering is bad. It isn't because they fear the threat of eternal hell. It is because they are generally born with the capacity for basic human empathy.

  How will they stay on the correct moral code? Also what should I do about souls, as I believe that souls are eternal in this world so where will they go after death? Reincarnation or a spirit world? Any questions and critique is welcome

In any case people not having religion in your world makes no sense. There is very literal magic with rituals and stuff that actually works. People are going to worship that harder than primitive tribes worshipped the sun and weather. The magic would also probably prove Intelligent Design so at the very least your world is going to be deist.

  And also this world never develops kingdoms and empires, the largest polity would be cities and there will be no Kings or royalty, as the rule of cities is done jointly by the strongest families, no single family is strong enough to rule the city alone and it is near impossible to destroy a strong family as they'll have built up magical defences over the generations on their Home and the same with cities, taking a city is too costly to attempt which is why no one has been able to conquer another city. So no kingdoms.

This also makes no sense. Large cities should be able to take out smaller cities unless your magic has a major defensive advantage or is geographically specific. Even then a city could be attacked through economic warfare or outright bought. Kingdoms aren't just formed through conquest. They are also formed through strong alliances for trade or economic profit. If City A and City B have a strong trade between each other and there is a river in between then they might co-operate to build a bridge and perhaps create a unified council to work on shared projects like it. Members from the ruling council of City A might marry members of the ruling council of City B and so on. There are a lot of things in economics and administration which benefit from centralisation and standardisation. Those benefits would push cities to unify much like they push cities to unify in our own ancient past.

I find it unlikely that every single city would have a council of ruling families rather than at least some having a hierarchy with a head family. Some having kings and so on. You would also expect that rich families with lots of powerful blood magics would end up having more kids which would end up spreading the blood magic.
