Ah it just seems they never mentioned that part when they were handing out the morphing power like candy. I think this implies you can touch the cube and it displays a number. And then later they made up some kind of formula. (which was just a line, iirc)

I figured that you would want to tell the new morphers to wait till the warning appears when they first morph in safety.
