  When Garrett as a fly is pulled into Rachel's morph, his senses disappear and reappear at exactly the halfway point, in both the initial morph and the later demorph. It's emphasized that there's no transition, no sense of becoming or unbecoming - he's just suddenly completely gone, and then later, completely back, all at once. The mental hiccup and appearance/disappearance of thought-speech seem to happen at 45-second mark too, as do Rachel's seizures. Clearly, there's something going on when a morph is halfway through. I'm tempted to say this is the point where the physical brain hands the reins over to the emulator or vice versa, but I'm suspicious of how little sense this makes: there is very obviously no realistic way a human brain could still function (or start to function) halfway through ANY morph. It smells like there's something artificial going on here, but what?

Your mind always runs on the hypercomputer when you're morphed. When someone starts morphing your construct body (to hide it in their morph), your mind keeps running on the hypercomputer without any change the entire time.

What happens (I think) is that the nanotech in your construct body suddenly stops working halfway through the morph, which means your mind (running on the hypercomputer) suddenly stops getting all sensory input.

I /thought/ this was because the nanotech is designed to fail safely (so it being slowly "frozen" and moved to Z-space doesn't gradually degrade the signal, but rather just cuts the signal off at some point)... but when Jake morphs Quatazhinnikon, his signal starts decaying when the morphing tech starts failing. (Edit: Actually, he experiences flickering while probing Quat's memories - it's possible the sensory part fails safely. After all, Garrett never tried to read the fly's mind.)

Maybe your construct body becomes completely static /before/ the nanotech has a chance to start malfunctioning.
