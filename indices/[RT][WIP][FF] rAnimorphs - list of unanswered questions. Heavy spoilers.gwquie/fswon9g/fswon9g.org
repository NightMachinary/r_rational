I actually have a theory about the Rachel seizure phenomenon, but didn't feel right including it in the main post, so I'm doing it as a comment instead. I'll spoiler tag the important parts, just in case it ends up being right or close to right.

First of all, we know your physical brain goes into stasis when you enter morph, and your consciousness switches to an emulated version being run on the god computer instead. Since Rachel is seeing memories from the dead Rachel's life, it seems reasonable to assume the computer is saving a copy of that emulated brain every time a character morphs.

So, okay, why is Rachel having these seizures, and no one else ever has?

My theory is that it's because Rachel is the only one who's ever died in her actual body. I /think/ every other death before a resurrection has been from characters getting trapped in morph, aside from the Marclones, but I'll come back to them. At first it looked like Marco, Jake, and Tobias died in their bodies in Wyoming, but it turned out later that Visser Three kept them around at least long enough to parade them around in front of the council, so it's very possible they're not actually dead.\\
Rachel's body actually physically /died/ in real space. That would mean the morph tech nanobots keyed to her brain signature (or whatever) are still out there, and they could be interfering with the signal that fires up to send her mind back to her physical body when she demorphs. As for the Marclones, they all existed in parallel /before/ they died, so it seems reasonable that the tech would have had a chance to set up discrete profiles for each one when they received the morphing power, or something along those lines.\\
As for the impact this could have on the wider story, I think this could be a curveball that the Ellimist and Crayak didn't see coming. Rachel, after all, wasn't supposed to happen. So maybe their lines of prediction didn't make it this far, and they didn't expect this weird glitch which lets her accidentally psuedo-hack into their hardware. Food for thought.

Opinions? Are there holes? Am I crazy?
