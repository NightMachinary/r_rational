I suspect that Rachel's two mysteries (Chee interaction, siezures) are closely linked. Note how the Chee refer to her as "the human female" and such rather than by name as they do all others. Something about her doesn't register properly as a sentient being worth naming to them, which is likely why they are able to hand her the stuff. Whatever is causing this is, I suspect, related to whatever's going wrong with her morphing too.
