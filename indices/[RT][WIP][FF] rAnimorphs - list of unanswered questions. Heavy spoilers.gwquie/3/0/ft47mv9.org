Yeah, that all seems reasonable. I guess I'm still just stuck on why the fly senses happened to cut off /exactly/ halfway through Rachel's morph. Like, if Garret's nanotech suddenly realized something was going on with the fly body and halted sensory transmission, you'd expect that to happen right at the moment when the fly body starts being broken down and sent into the pocket dimension. But what are the odds that Rachel's palm starts to morph at the EXACT instant that Marco is saying <forty-fi->? Even if it took the full second to say each number, that would be a 1/90 chance of happening, right?
