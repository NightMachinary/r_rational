  I guess I'm still just stuck on why the fly senses happened to cut off /exactly/ halfway through Rachel's morph. Like, if Garret's nanotech suddenly realized something was going on with the fly body and halted sensory transmission, you'd expect that to happen right at the moment when the fly body starts being broken down and sent into the pocket dimension.

That's a good point.

Now I think that what happens /might/ be this: During the morphing, the functionality of the body being stashed away into Z-space is preserved by the nanotech - there is no pouring blood, etc. Maybe the same functionality preservation makes it so that you can still think during the first part of the morph with your brain. When the morph is sufficiently far in progress, the computational processes of the brain no longer need to run (because your mind is entirely in the hypercomputer (maybe)), so they're put on hold and the yeerk tissue in the construct (that had sufficiently materialized in the meantime) is allowed to start accepting commands from your uploaded mind.

So the exact point at which you switch from being in your body to being in the computer would be an arbitrary engineering decision.

When someone else is including your construct body in their morph, this could be similar, except that now the arbitrary cutoff point manifests as your construct's nanotech stopping the transmission (because the construct (or its subset) becomes frozen).

There could maybe also be a simpler explanation - something like a condition "if the morph is halfway through, stop all Z-space transmissions from the matter being stashed away" made for some arbitrary engineering reason.

I have no idea.
