  “For an adult Andalite body, the charge typically lasts around one human hour. Your bodies are smaller, and in some ways less complex; I predict you may be able to stretch the time to two, or perhaps even longer. The cube will tell each of you as it transfers the morphing power; you must check the number again regularly, particularly after any significant growth spurt.”

Elfangor says this in the first chapter. I've never been sure if that means they need physical access to the cube, or if they can just perform the check mentally somehow.

Either way, there's probably always the warning, but the warning ain't gonna do you much good if it kicks in 90 seconds before your dimension decoheres and you're three miles underwater in colossal squid morph.
