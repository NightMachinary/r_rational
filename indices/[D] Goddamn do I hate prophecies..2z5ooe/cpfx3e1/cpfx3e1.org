Well, I disagree. Strongly.

Information from the future is an interesting Speculative Fiction problem to deal with. It just is. I like reading time travel stories, and prophecies allow for a particularly limited version you can interject into any fantasy universe that doesn't have to consume the entire damn plot of the story.

Precognition often serves to make the Chosen/Unkillable Hero a lot more logical in-universe (this /is/ [[/r/rational]], right?) This might be bad if it did so by killing the narrative flow or whatever, but prophecies are actually one of humanities oldest tropes, and were well-codified before we had writing IIRC. They are clearly effective storytelling, from a practical point of view.

And, of course, from a [RST] rather than purely [RT] perspective, dealing with prophecies and time travel when You Can't Change The Future allows for all sorts of educational Newcomb's Problem variants and expounding on varieties of Timeless Decision Theory. A perfect predictor streamlines away the "what if I can trick them/what if they're too smart to trick" issue with normal TDT situations, and makes everything much clearer and a better message.

You could easily tell a thousand distinct, brilliant, /Rational/ stories centred around prophecies and precognition.
