I agree - prophecy tends to suck. If a character is doing everything because of prophecy, they basically don't have any agency, and worse, the author is often not compelled to make any of their actions make sense. This is my biggest problem with Worm and the Path to Victory shard. You can't criticize the actions of [[#s][]] because everything that they did was because it was the winning move, even when their actions looked incredibly stupid, nonsensical, etc. There's no agency to it. This has been on my mind in the past few days because of [[#s][HPMOR]], who has the exact same problem. Why X? Because prophecy said so. It virtually assassinates the character, because all of their actions - everything that they did - was done because of reasons that even they didn't understand. All interpretation shuts down immediately in the face of something like that.

So with that said, I occasionally like prophecy if it can act in a time travel sort of way (because */I love time travel/*). Something like "The Skynet missile defense system goes online April 19, 2011, declares war on mankind and triggers a nuclear apocalypse two days later" is a compelling prophecy to me when it's treated like any other bit of information. It's not much different from saying "an asteroid will strike the Earth on April 19, 2011" in terms of what it does to the characters - it's preventable, avertable, and treated just like that, with the implicit "unless we do something" tacked onto the end.

There are still a whole host of ways to misuse that though, as you've expressed.
