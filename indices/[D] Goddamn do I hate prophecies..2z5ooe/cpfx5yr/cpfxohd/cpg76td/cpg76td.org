I've always been fond of Chrono Trigger/Dragonball-style time-travel metaphysics: effectively, time travel exists between the present and all possible divergent future timelines (for any given values of "present" and "future"), though only one future timeline is actively 'attached' to the present at any given time---the "default" one that happens if nobody else ever again, from this point forward, acts on information derived through time-travel. All future information comes from that particular future, time-travel /to/ the future only goes there, etc.

So you /can/ have prophecies (information, or even people(!), delivered from "the future"), but just in the act of delivering them, the the quantum probability-mass is shifted away from the future timeline that information came from. It could shift toward another one that ends up looking /very similar/, if anyone in the present happens to think in terms of redundant back-up plans, but there's nothing forcing the present to "stick to" a given future timeline.

On the other hand, this gets into the (in my opinion much more entertaining) questions of the anthropic value of people in alternate futures that could be "evacuated to" the present.
