(Spoilers for worm ahead.)

I actually have my own theory about the PtV:

Namely, that as an Abbadon shard, it was carrying some prior programming. Instead of just giving /the/ PtV, it merely shows Contessa /a/ PtV, that just happens to coincide with furthering the goals Abbadon set for it, including, but not limited to: the deaths of the native entity pair, the concentration of power under an organization run by parahumans, and the fostering of conflict.

That being said, Contessa does retain some level of agency: the PtV shard only shows a single path towards victor,y, not necessarily the best path. Contessa and cauldron took on the role of optimizers, trying to corral the shard into giving them PtV's that maximally benefited humanity, while also setting up failsafes so that even unexpectedly powerful trigger events (as trigger events force the PtV to recalculate) don't force cauldron into choosing an overall less beneficial path.
