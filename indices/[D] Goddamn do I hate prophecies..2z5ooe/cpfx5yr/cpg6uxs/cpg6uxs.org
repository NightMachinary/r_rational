I was just explaining in a separate subreddit why chess grandmasters prefer to play other chess grandmasters, even if chess AIs can offer them, in strictly technical terms, more of a challenge.

Chess AIs don't make the optimum move by finding an optimum coherent "strategy" and following it. Instead, they just search the solution-space as far out as they can, keeping track of the optimum move they figured out so far... and then do that "best-so-far" move they figured out. Effectively, they divine the future in their heads (which is possible if you live in a restricted deterministic game-world), prophesize their own success, and then act to carry out that prophecy.

If you're a skilled-enough strategist that the AI isn't poking holes in your own strategy, and its ability to effectively prophesize is /the only reason it ends up winning/, then you end up both bored, and frustrated. At this level, whether you win or lose, you /don't learn anything/, because there's no pattern to its reasoning to figure out that'll help /you/ advance!
