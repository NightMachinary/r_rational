You might be able to get away with a prophecy that gives important information without guaranteeing outcomes. For instance, if it suffices to identify your heroine, but doesn't describe what she must do. The first half of the Trewlaney prophecy is an example of this, while the second half is overly cryptic and entirely unnecessary, and additionally contradicted by events.

I guess that leads to yet another type of prophecy: the false prophecy. Or two, actually: the intentional false prophecy and the prophecy that is false merely because the author wrote it poorly.
