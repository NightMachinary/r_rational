Are they? I hadn't noticed recently. I do tend to make some enemies in other threads though (I'm a moderator of a subreddit that explicitly counters the narratives of The Red Pill, just as a possible example as to why), so it's possible someone took umbrage at a recent point of mine and is going through my comment history.

C'est la vie. As long as the comments aren't being buried, I don't particularly care about downvotes. Thanks for the concern though :)
