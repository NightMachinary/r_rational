My favorite use of this device is the future telling abilities of Agnes Nutter, Witch, writer of Nice and Accurate Prophecies. From Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Also the horoscope given for the world because the Earth was a Libra, in that same book. These were used as plot devices a couple of times, and were used to occasionally foreshadow lightly, but were more for comedy than to seriously drive the plot.
