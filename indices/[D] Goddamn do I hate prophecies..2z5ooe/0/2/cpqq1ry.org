Well have you seen or read minority report? It has a kind of similar idea behind it I suppose. Or at least it's that the main character knows his own "prophecy" and is trying to figure out why would or will do it (a murder). Everyone else (the pre-cog police) are trying to stop him from ever murdering to begin with.
