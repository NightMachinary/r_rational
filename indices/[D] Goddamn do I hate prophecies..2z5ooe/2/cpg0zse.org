In a sort-of-fantasy setting I've been mulling on and might eventually do something about, "Prophecy" is a system which is a legacy (one of many) of an ancient and now absent civilization that's basically a warning system about dire future events. The system isn't perfect at all, of course - this depends on how exactly you define 'dire event'. That would come into play.

There's the twist that few if any prophecies ever come true - they would only come true if they hadn't been made. Prophecies, so to speak, tend to avert themselves simply by existing, and change the course of history with few people being any the wiser - they're not given much credit for being true, anyway, since they are by their very nature extremely avertible.

It's not a crucial feature of the lore, in any wise, but it /is/ a background fact which shapes many parts of the story I might eventually set in this setting (who knows - I've a dozen other ideas competing for attention). Once the characters catch on to this fact, they will make quite a few useful deductions and then proceed to do their own thing entirely with this information. (Edit 2: In fact, they will abuse the hell out of it.)

Would you object to prophecy used in that sense?

Edit: And to more directly respond to the topic question, I don't /think/ this fits under any of your categories.
