Now /that's/ interesting: the utility function of any sufficiently-powerful optimization process would just "ripple backward through time" and make its desire for paperclips et al known before it exists to demand them.

This would sure be a convenient world for the optimizer---it would effectively be given the opportunity to execute Roko's Basilisk-like bargains, even with creatures that would never otherwise think to model its utility-function; they would just be "inspired" with it.

This seems like the kind of world the term "Lovecraftian horror" actually should apply to.
