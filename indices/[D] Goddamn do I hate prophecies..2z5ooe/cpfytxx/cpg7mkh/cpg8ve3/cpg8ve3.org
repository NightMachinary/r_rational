There are very few tentacles in my world, but possibly there might be an itsy bitsy bit of existential horror here and there.

Destiny doesn't reach back from the future, but it is capable of predicting some things, especially when they are important enough to warrant its full attention. It, uh, it might also be the case that souls in my world are not so much pure mind as they are destiny latching onto human brains and trying to nudge them. ...That won't be known to the reader, but it makes talking about the world easier. Destiny is capable of predicting the future fairly well because it can see the long term plans of every faction and player. It still makes mistakes, but mostly because a few NPCs and a villain has figured out how to send Destiny false signals.
