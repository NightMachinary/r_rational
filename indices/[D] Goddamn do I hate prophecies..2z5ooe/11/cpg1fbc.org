I'm contemplating prophecy as relates to time shenanigans lately (periodically in the last few years).

My approach at present is that the prophecies are artificial tools, constructed to create the actual outcome desired.

They are literally only as trustworthy as the party who created it and bothered to send the message back.

Nothing in prophecy is clearly certain to those that receive or send them back.

And those that blindly obey prophecy' dictations are about as interesting/important in the world of a time traveler as a loyal slave is to a prophecy author.

Which is to say there are actually a lot of prophecies and their used horribly to exploit enormous quantities of populations across time and space just because it's convenient to those who want work performed in the past for their own benefit.
