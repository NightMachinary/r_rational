I'd agree prophecies are overused and sometimes not done well at all. But like every other trope, they are only bad if used poorly or if used in bad writing. Let me give you a fifth category, though it may not be very common: Prophecy as a vision of what some powerful NPC being /wants/, or what is "supposed" to be. In my own writing, prophecies (Which come in visions, not words) are the product of an unconscious force of destiny trying to bend human behaviour by showing 'futures' to leaders and those around them.

  So. All that said, does anyone have examples of stories where prophecies did none of the above?

Not yet. I'll certainly ask the subreddit for input when I have a first draft.
