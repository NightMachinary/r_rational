I disliked it for the second reason stated: it just artificially propelled characters to do things that they normally wouldn't have done, namely try to stop him at all costs and at a much higher priority than they normally would have. Not to mention what HE began to do once he heard of it himself.

It would have been far better if he'd independently thought to do something that would have that effect anyway, and they found out about it and tried to stop him. Same actions, same results, but no prophecy necessary.
