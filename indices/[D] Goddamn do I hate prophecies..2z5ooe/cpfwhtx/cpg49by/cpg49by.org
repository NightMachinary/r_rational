I agree for the main reason that Dinah's prophecy was worded as a "If P, then Q" type of statement. The prophecy was a clear statement on what will happen if a certain event occurs. This kept the absoluteness inevitability prophecies have while still allowing characters to have the chance to stop event P to prevent the disastrous consequence Q from happening.
