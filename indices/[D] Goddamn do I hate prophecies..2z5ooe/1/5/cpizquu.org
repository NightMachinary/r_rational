One thing I hate about prophecy is the why aspect. It is easy to say that blank can see the future, but there is no reason for them to. This is one of the things I like about HPMoR prophecies- specifically that a lot of things that sending information through time implies are, in fact, real. I simply never got why someone would bother sending a message through time and still make it to cryptic to understand.There isn't any reason (that I can see) to do this.
