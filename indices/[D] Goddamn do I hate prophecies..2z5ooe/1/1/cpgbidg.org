Dumbledore may have had that problem in-universe, but literarily, the puzzle was that we were supposed to deduce /the very fact/ that he knew a zillion prophecies, which wasn't revealed until the very end. It's not like we were supposed to figure out what the purpose of Harry's father's rock was in Chapter 17, and it ended up being unsatisfyingly random; the randomness itself /was/ the clue.
