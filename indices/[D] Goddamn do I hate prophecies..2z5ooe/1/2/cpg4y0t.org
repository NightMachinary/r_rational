To be fair, Cauldron was following a specific Path to Victory, not the "winning" Path because of certain things that were blocked to the shard, such as modeling Scion.

If I recall correctly, the path they were going on was "Path to highest number of active parahumans" or some such. So there's still quite a bit of arguing you can have on if they chose the most effective path. It guaranteed they would perfectly do whatever they set out to do, but is what they set out to do the most optimal path they could have taken?
