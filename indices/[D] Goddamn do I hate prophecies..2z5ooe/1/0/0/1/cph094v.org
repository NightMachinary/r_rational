I wouldn't say so. A large part of the reason people "play at war" (sports, games, etc.) is to learn from the tactics of their opponents. Why play a game where your opponent has no skill per se†, but keeps winning because they have a large negative handicap?

† And they never /will/ have the skill, either. There's obviously reason to play people who don't have skill /yet/---you're trying to get /them/ to absorb the skills they observe /you/ using to beat them. (Current) game AIs do not do this.
