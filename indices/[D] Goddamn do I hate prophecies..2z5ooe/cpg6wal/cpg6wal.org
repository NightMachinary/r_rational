Personally I enjoyed the prophecies in Wheel of time. This was mainly because the main prophecy was incomplete and a bit vague but everyone tried to spin this fact to their own advantage. There's also the fact that The prophecy could just straight up fail completely because the "wheel" (basically the thing that keeps fate and the universe going) would be broken.
