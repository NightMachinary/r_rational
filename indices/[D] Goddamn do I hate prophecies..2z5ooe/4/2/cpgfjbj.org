Yes, but it should be acknowledged that we're talking about /finite/ information from the future. If a prophecy is so absolute that it has probability 1.0 (infinite information), then you start getting [[https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/laplaces-demon/][Laplace's Demon]] [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0159][Paradoxes]] (and I can also think of a trivial way to construct a form of Loeb's Paradox here).
