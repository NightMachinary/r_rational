  Information from the future is an interesting Speculative Fiction problem to deal with. It just is.

You can have a technology/force/law of physics that is interesting to reason about, but which nevertheless inherently decreases the fun-theoretic value of universes containing it. Unless the story specifically is /about/ that thing, contrasts life before and after it, and so forth, all you'll end up with is just "stories set in a universe constrained to be less entertaining than would otherwise be possible."

For another example: Culture Minds are neat. But a story /setting/ where they exist, is one where the heroes have less agency than they would in a setting without them. The story could be interesting if the Minds were /themselves/ the main characters... but they're very likely not, just as unravelling the metaphysics of prophecy itself is very likely not the plot of a story with a prophecy in it.
