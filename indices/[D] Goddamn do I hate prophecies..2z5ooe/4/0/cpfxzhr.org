  Precognition often serves to make the Chosen/Unkillable Hero a lot more logical in-universe

True, it's possible to make otherwise illogical tropes /more/ logical through prophecy, but that doesn't make it compelling, to me, because ideally if your story really is about an average joe who ends up helping save the world, giving them personal stakes in doing so is much more interesting and engaging.

I don't really care that it's a time honored and widely enjoyed trope, to be honest. There are a lot of things people like that I don't, and lots of things I like that people don't, and that's all fine. I prefer characters with as much agency as possible, as relateable as possible, and the point is, none of us are ever going to be approached by a wizard one day, handed a magic sword, and informed of our destiny. Nor have any of the great men and women in history been destined from birth to be great.

We choose our destiny: life happens to us, and we decide how we respond to it. When I say that the best stories follow reality in this respect, it's because the best stories can inspire us to be better, and personally I can relate to their struggles far more than those of people who are compelled to save the world because God said they would.
