I think prophecies are equivalent to time travel, and prophecies that always come true are equivalent to Stable Time Loops. They send information far into the past (or pull information from far into the future, depending on your point of view).

In a universe that allows time travel, causality goes out the window, so everything that happens is author fiat.

Time travel can be a lot of fun (at least in short one-shots), but you shouldn't try to write adult stories that feature it. That, I think, was the biggest mistake of HPMoR.
