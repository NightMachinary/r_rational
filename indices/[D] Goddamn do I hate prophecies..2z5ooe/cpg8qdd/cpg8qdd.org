The spoiler prophecy sounds like a form of foreshadowing to me and I think that's fine. The point of a story is to entertain it's readers and if the readers are given information ahead of time there is a thrill from knowing what to expect and also not knowing how the characters will react; It's the journey not the destination. There are valid points in giving the readers information that the characters don't have. For one, it builds anticipation, two, It gives the readers a chance to figure out what might happen, and three, It gives direction the the story. In practically all hero stories, we already know that the "good guys" will win. But, when we get a little bit of information about how it's going to happen, it excites us. Sure it may or may not give the characters anything, but for a novel as a whole it has good merits, at least I think so. Or, maybe I'm getting the wrong impression from your description and completely missed the point.
