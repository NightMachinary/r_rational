Subtle hints or foreshadowing is one thing: to me, prophecy is far too blatant and in-your-face to increase my enjoyment. I know some people like to know as much as possible about what's to come, but I like figuring it out and watching it unfold myself, so it's always irritating to me to see the writer basically relying on it to keep their reader's attention/interest up. A good story should be able to do that on its own, I think.
