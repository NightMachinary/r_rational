Yeah I'm still not seeing the the huge flaw. I mean you said it yourself. The readers gets a snippet of the big picture. A table of dead people. It means nothing to the characters but to the readers it's a hint at what's to come. It's not like they are explicitly told, "A groups of bandits will charge the hall during a feast and kill everybody".
