I think EY did the best he could with what he had: namely a source material so contradictory and irrational that the prophecies were just one broken aspect among many. As much as I enjoyed Dumbledore's "redemption," it did feel a bit like it took away from his agency to know that he was basically doing everything because of special knowledge only he had access to... but then, if there's a place where hundreds of prophecies are stored, reading them all really is the best play to optimize how they come true. I just wish there was a way to have had him make such decisions without "Time" or "Fate" basically pulling the strings, which is again just an inherent problem with prophecies in the first place.
