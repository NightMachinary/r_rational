Now I want to see a story with an epic prophecy as the driving MacGuffin that drives every single person that knows that there /is/ a prophecy, only for it to turn out to be complete bunk. Sort of like the twist in the Lego Movie, only with it being bunk-er (that prophecy was fulfilled in the end, after all).
