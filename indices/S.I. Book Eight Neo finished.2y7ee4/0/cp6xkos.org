The moderators at SpaceBattles decided that some of the content in S.I. has passed into NSFW territory. I'm trying to negotiate with them to see if it will be possible to make edits to bring the story into what's allowed to be posted there. (I've made a similar appeal to a similar ruling at a SpaceBattles spin-off board I was also posting the story at, SufficientVelocity.) While that's being hashed out, I've started to post the new chapters to another SpaceBattles spin-off board, at [[http://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/s-i-original-si.1134/]] . (I've just posted chapter 7.9 there, and expect to post new ones twice a week or so until the buffer's at a more reasonable size.)
