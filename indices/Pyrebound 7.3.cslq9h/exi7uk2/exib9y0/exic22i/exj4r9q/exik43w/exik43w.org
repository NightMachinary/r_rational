I'm not sure about tags as I rarely use them, although I know some people have appreciated character tags in Wildbow's works. The use of the links I requested is as you stated: They are useful for navigating through the site. If you're binging, it's nice having them on the bottom as you can read and just have it handy to click through to the next chapter. However, if you're archive-diving or searching for where you left off after a break, it's nice to have them at the top.
