Well it can't anticipate that /all/ hosts are going to be extremely virulent, however as long as it infects /somebody/ it is still successful.\\
It's entirely possible that your post could have infected up to a dozen people, which for a pathogen is pretty good. By comparison measles hosts on average infect 15-18 people so TV Tropes isn't the /most infectious/, but it's up there.
