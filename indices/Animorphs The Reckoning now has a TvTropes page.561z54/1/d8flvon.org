Through the most powerful force ever to be witnessed on the internet (boredom), I created a TvTropes page for The Reckoning. The tropes example list is bare-bone for now, since I don't have the time to fill it yet.

Feel free to expand it. I recommend these two articles:

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/HowToWriteAnExample]]

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/HowToCollectTropes]]

TODO:

- Add more tropes.

- For each of these tropes, find the trope page, and add The Reckoning to its example list.

- Replace every reference to The Reckoning in TvTropes with a link to this page.

- Find indexes to add it to.

- Profit!
