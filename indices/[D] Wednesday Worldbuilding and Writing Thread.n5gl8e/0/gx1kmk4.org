So I've wanted to start writing recently and have some notes on an outline of a setting. I think for now, I would need an idea for a <short story> in this setting.

There are restarts at set intervals (month/season/year?). At each restart everyone gets dropped at a random location with nothing except one chosen item from a previous revision. There is no known goal, just survive. Most people choose to create enough tools and shelter to live a comfortable life but progress no further knowing they will lose it all at the end anyway.

The main character has a plan to eventually break out of the resets by developing more and more complex technology, but something is different this reset: (one of the following)

- Main character has an item he shouldn't have access to.
- Everyone looses everything and no one gets to start with any items leaving many people scrambling to survive.
- Limited number of restarts before x event.
- Restarts beginning to shorten.
- Monsters start to spawn.
- Main character starts with something extra that he didn't choose.
- A person that is unaffected by restarts is discovered.

Keeps one item from each reset

- There are limitations on complexity of the item, i.e. can't bring a smartphone.
- Some people choose to group up and save items that can combine into something greater that gets around the complexity limits.
- Need ideas on /how/ people choose their item. I feel like the "game interface" is a bit overdone.
