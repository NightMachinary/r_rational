I think it's important to break the loops in a way that fits within some set of established rules, whether that's known to the characters or not. The inciting incident can be the discovery of some new aspect of the rules that no one had known about before, either through direct observation of some natural part of it, or through someone going about something approaching science (or at least iterative testing).

If you want to write a short story though, I think it might be best to focus on what life is like for these people, absent any kind of break from the normal behavior of the resets. Here are some ideas:

- When the loop resets, it brings everyone together ... including outlaws or other people who have been cast out. How the community might handle this is up for debate, but there should be a strong demand for labor right at the start of the loop, as people need to get settled. That gives an opportunity for redemption, so you could tell a small story about that.
- Resets are bound to be a time of hardship, because even nomadic societies have considerably more than a single item. Getting settled would mean finding sources of food, finding water, and finding shelter, all in short order. If weather conditions are good, and the season is right, maybe that's not so much of a problem, but being dropped into the middle of winter with only a single article of clothing, no food stores, etc. might be a death sentence for a small community, and provide a nice backdrop for a survival story.
- Tell a story set in the waning days of a reset, when everyone knows (or 'knows') that it's only a matter of weeks, maybe days, before the next reset, when everything goes away. There are, perhaps, festivals or parties, efforts made to eat through existing stockpiles of food, to slaughter animals, and so on, all in preparation for an upcoming time of hardship. I think that's a somewhat good setting for a coming of age story.
