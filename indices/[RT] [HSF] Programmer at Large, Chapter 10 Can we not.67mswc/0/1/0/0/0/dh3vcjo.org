It's not just the main character being non-binary, but also the fact that it keeps being brought up in the plot. You don't see the plot constantly remind the audience that the main character of /insert random book/ is a straight male/female constantly do you? Nor do you see the author running around reminding everyone not to interpret their character differently than they pictured.

On the other hand you are as of this chapter making it an interesting plot point instead of a meaningless one and it seems ripe for some sci-fi shenanigans. So I guess I'll just have to keep reading and see where you go with it and maybe you had more in mind than just trying to convince the readers that normal genders are wrong.
