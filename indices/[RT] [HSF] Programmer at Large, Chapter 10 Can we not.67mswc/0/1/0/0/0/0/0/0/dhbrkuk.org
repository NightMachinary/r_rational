I don't really understand this complaint is coming from. The resulting social landscape /does/ look like that. Every single instance of gender coming up in the story has been through the interactions of the crew with a gendered culture - either in universe, or implicitly through the readers.

Here are the places gender has come up in the story:

- the translation convention is that pronouns for the crew are they (a thing which is only obvious to readers and is completely unremarked upon by the crew)
- there is a popular TV show (of sorts) that the crew watch that comes from a gendered culture
- the protagonist has talked about it with someone who picked up the idea of gender specifically from their interactions with a gendered culture. They picked up on this because the person in question was very strongly non-conforming to the typical crew appearance. Missing that isn't like not noticing that tall people have an advantage, it's like not being able to notice that someone is tall.
