The gender of characters gets brought up a lot in genres where there's a lot of inter-gender interactions, like in romances.

Gender is almost never brought up in genres where there isn't, like in historical military fiction.

That's not to say gender is /irrelevant/ to such genres; the social mores of characters in such genre works are heavily informed by their gender roles. But, since there's nothing to compare to, the characters themselves don't /notice/ this.

Becoming consciously aware of gender role-scripts in an all-male army on the march, would look about the same as [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/tax-the-tall.html][Robin Hanson becoming consciously aware of the fact that tall people have social advantages and that nobody cares.]] It's something that leaves everyone a bit baffled and/or miffed, because even when staring straight at the thing you're staring at, they /still/ can't differentiate it from the background---still can't see what's worth calling attention to in the direction you're pointing.

And I have a feeling that what people are feeling and calling you out on, here, is that---in a culture where everyone is the same /non-/gender---the resulting social landscape would be a lot more similar to the second example (stories where everyone is the same gender) than the first (stories where everyone is split along gender lines.) Just like in an all-male world, it'd be very hard in an all-non-binary world to /notice/ gender role-scripts.
