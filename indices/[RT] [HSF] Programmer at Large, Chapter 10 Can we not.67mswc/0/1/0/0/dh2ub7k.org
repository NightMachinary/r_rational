  I both dislike the non-binary agenda you are pushing

If you think that having a story where the main characters are non-binary is pushing a non-binary agenda, I invite you to consider what a story where the main characters are male does.

(Note that I am a cisgendered man and perfectly happy that way. I am not a gender abolitionist, I just think writing a story that follows the defaults is boring)
