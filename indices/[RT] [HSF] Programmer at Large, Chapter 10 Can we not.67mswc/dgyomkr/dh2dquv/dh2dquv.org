It's the author's bias coming through. Arthur is female but doesn't identify as female because they live in the dystopian SJW society you just coined and Arthur was never taught that concepts like female or male exist.

What I'm really excited about here is that apparently our author is about to give Arthur a rude awakening into gender politics from the anti-SJW rebellion. Although that will probably get quashed because the author is on the side of the SJW society so I'm not sure how things will play out.
