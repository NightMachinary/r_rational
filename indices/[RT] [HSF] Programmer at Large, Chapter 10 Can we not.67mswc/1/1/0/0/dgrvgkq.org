  It's not that I'm ignoring this, it's that whoever designed their system was ignoring this.

This is basically true. The system is designed more by way of a form of self-awareness for the ship society - it's there to go "Hey, this is a thing you should be aware of that you might not have noticed". It's not designed to be adversary resistant, because the crew are largely presupposed to be on the same side and social problems are presupposed to not be deliberately created.

There are also special circumstances here that will be made clear later.

  Or, presumably, the entire thing is just a tool of social oppression

I'm not sure it's possible to distinguish a sufficiently heavily designed society from a tool of social oppression.

  The system you want is not an alert system, but a priority queue of concerns.

OK, so, spoiler time because I don't really have a good way of answering this without giving bits of the next chapters away.
