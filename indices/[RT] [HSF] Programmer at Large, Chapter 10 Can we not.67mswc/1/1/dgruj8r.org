I think you're currently:

- Underestimating the difficulty of the alerting problem for complex systems (you can be as fuzzy as you want, but when noise dwarfs signal you have to be /very/ selective in what you flag up to a human).
- Overestimating the difficulty of fooling neural networks
- Ignoring that the members of the group have full access to the alerting metrics too
- Assuming that Arthur is the first person to notice this

(Some of these things will become clearer in the next chapter or two)
