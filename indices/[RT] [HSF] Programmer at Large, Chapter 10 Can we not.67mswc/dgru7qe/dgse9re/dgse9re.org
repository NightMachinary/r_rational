I think this is one of those /unspoken/ rules. It's a system that's pushing the design tolerances, but there's also an implicit understanding among everyone, including those designing the systems, that /this/ particular group is okay. Presumably, the group itself has a hand in it too. So you've got the set of sexually active people, who don't want to get flagged, overlapping somewhat with the social engineers, who don't want to have to deal with flagging them. It's also possible that having a sexually active counterculture is a long-term profitable thing compared to the social losses, especially if that also goes with a more nuanced approach to gender than "what's that?" Ambassadors to grounder cultures with heavy gender biases, for example, or a back-up of sexually active adults to keep a trade ship from dying out in a generation due to the artificial wombs failing, a crash landing, or something similar.
