As someone who thinks the most common Social Justice rhetoric is frequently wrong, naive, and immoral on multiple levels, many of the social dynamics of this story bother me, and at some points it feels almost like an "The SJWs won" distopia. That said, I can more or less accept genderless pronoun BS and whatever else as part of the world-building cultural norms of having /actually/ genderless vat grown people for multiple generations. It's mostly fine so far, but I'm really hoping that this doesn't get preachy later in the story.

I love the coding though, and I reeeeeeaaally want a HUD to help me keep my life in order now. That's totally the Google Glass killer app. Thanks for writing. Can't wait to see where this goes!
