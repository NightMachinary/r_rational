Wait, Arthur is /plural?/ Some sort of localised hivemind, perhaps? Hmmm... previous chapters seem to indicate that Arthur has only one body, but ah, perhaps there's more than one brain in there... the standard organic one, and a technological implant or implants that act as a sort of a co-processor... and it's that that keeps feeding him all these social metrics he keeps looking up, kind of like an internal computer interface, not sentient in and of itself but a /part/ of Arthur that at the same time /isn't/ and this justifies the plural pronoun.

Am I close?
