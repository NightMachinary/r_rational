It's not a recent redefining--there exist usages of singular /they/ going back to both Shakespeare and Chaucer. I'm not sure that we should tittle over "redefining the rules" when those so-called rules haven't been considered absolute /since the 1400's/, and /not/ by obscure authors, either.

So if there's going to be "worse problems in the future", it must be a damn slow-burning process. On this sort of time scale we'll have moved from Modern English to Future English and all this hand wringing will have been for naught.
