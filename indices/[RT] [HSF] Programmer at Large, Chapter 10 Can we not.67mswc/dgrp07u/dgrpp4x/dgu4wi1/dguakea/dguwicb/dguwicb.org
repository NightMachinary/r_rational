[[/pinkiepout][]] Oh, but that's boring. An internal hivemind is so much more /fun/. Besides, 'their' is very much third-person /plural/, if we're going to be pedantic. (Yes, English does not have a good option for third-person gender-neutral person - other options include 'he', which comes of automatically assigning male gender when gender is not obvious; 'it', which carries connotations of being a non-sentient object, or making up an entirely new word altogether (I once came across someone who insisted on using 'ke' for gender-neutral third-person, thus neatly avoiding the problems of all the other options). It is a problem, and I am not convinced that redefining a plural pronoun to include a singular definition won't introduce worse problems in the future).
