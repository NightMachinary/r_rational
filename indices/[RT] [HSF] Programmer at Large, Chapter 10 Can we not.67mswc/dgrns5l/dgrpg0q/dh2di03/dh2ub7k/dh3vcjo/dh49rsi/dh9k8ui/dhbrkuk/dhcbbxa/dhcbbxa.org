These things are true, yes---I'm not denying that you're Doing It Right for the most part. My argument wasn't /exactly/ an apologia for the stance other people are taking that there's too much notice of gender /generally/; you addressed that to my own satisfaction in your FAQ post.

Rather, I think my complaint boils down to this: the /protagonist/ shouldn't be able to "obsess over" systems problems related to gender and sexuality as "naturally" as they're doing in the latest chapter. Noticing that something is strange about the world is rational; but noticing that something is strange about the world when /nobody else notices/, and when there aren't even words available in this society to use to refer to the /axis/ along which the thing is strange---it's a really hard thing to do. So I'm feeling like it's a bit implausible that this protagonist should be the one to be suddenly capable of noticing. Why should /this/ character, at this moment in the society's timeline, be the one to notice the sleeping social knot?

I mean, sure, your protagonist might be (presumably) on the autistic spectrum with a consciously-acquired social awareness. And sure, they look for bugs in systems nobody asked them to debug for a living. But that doesn't mean that they'll /notice/ a bug in a system they not only don't interact with, but don't understand the functioning of well-enough to distinguish intended behavior from malfunction.

To put it another way: I'd expect the protagonist of /this/ story---this conflict---to have pre-existing /beliefs/ about gender and sexuality. I would expect that the plot will then result in a /change/ to these beliefs, with the particular change---and what it was in response to---conveying a theme. But right now, your protagonist has a starting condition where they have /no/ beliefs about the system; whatever beliefs they /acquire/ will "go down easy", rather than being resisted, so the dramatic arc will fall flat.

If I were going to make up a character to exist in this setting and have this conflict happen to them, I would likely choose one who had, in the past, experienced either gender dysphoria or sexual urges, and then had their society respond to that experience in a way that left them with "incorrect" starting beliefs, so that the conflict could inspire a change in these beliefs. I could fully believe that such a character would /notice/ the flaw in the "human system", because they would've been touched by that human system.
