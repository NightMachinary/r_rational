Being male keeps getting brought up in the plot of a lot of books too, it's just that you don't notice because that's just what you expect the background to look like.

Anyway, I ended up [[https://gist.github.com/DRMacIver/946af0d56878e4de965e07e608bc39c8][writing up a short post about this]] because people seem to keep being confused about the politics of programmer at large and I figure if people are going to be annoyed by the politics they might as well be annoyed for the right reasons. ;-)
