For a single person of unknown gender, you have a point which I am forced to accept. However, if Shakespeare ever wrote about a person of nonbinary gender, I would be greatly surprised.

I don't really care all that much about it. I just thought plural Arthur was funnier.

And the 'worse problems' would be limited to uncertainty about whether one is referring to a single person of nonbinary gender or multiple people of any gender. Not /major/ problems, just worse than without the ambiguity.
