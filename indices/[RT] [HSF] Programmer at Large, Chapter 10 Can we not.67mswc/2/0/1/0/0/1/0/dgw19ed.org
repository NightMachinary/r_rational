Surprisingly chill. As a second-person pronoun, it's usually easy to tell from context whether the singular or plural is intended; third person is trickier.

The issue of nonbinary gender is one that English as a language handles poorly, and while I don't really care all /that/ strongly about it (I only started this conversational thread because the idea of plural Arthur struck me as funny), I do have a vague feeling that it's better to introduce a new singular pronoun for clarity than start mixing singular/plural worse.
