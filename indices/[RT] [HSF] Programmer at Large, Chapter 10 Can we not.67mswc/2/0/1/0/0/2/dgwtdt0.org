A hivemind would be much more fun, wouldn't it? On the subject of they/them/their as gender-neutral singular pronouns, though...

It's true that using "they" in a gender-neutral singular sense is common, and goes back hundreds of years. But I find that these usages are pretty much invariably in contexts where the referent is unspecified, or somehow non-instantiated (e.g., in "each congressperson gathered their staff," "their" is clearly singular, but it does not refer to any specific congressperson) or else where the speaker is mimicking this usage to avoid giving information away (e.g., a teenager telling their parents "My friend is coming over; I'm going to study with them in my bedroom" attracts less suspicion than if they used a pronoun that revealed their friend was of the opposite sex).

As far as I can tell, historical precedent doesn't really justify using they/them/their for referring to specific, named, individuals who are known to both parties. In fact, the established usage pattern has always lent they-as-gender-neutral-singular a certain concealing quality to me. That is, even when I'm not confused by the plurality, it never feels like it's referring to a person who possesses themselves some real manner of gender-neutrality. Rather it seems to be a polite way of having a non-gender-specifying conversation about a person who, by implication, has a definite masculine or feminine gender. I doubt this is the intent or desired subtext of people who use gender-neutral pronouns (or of those who which to be referred to by them), which is why I prefer ke/xe/ze/sie/whatever else people use these days. Neologisms imply many things about the speaker, but smuggle in a lot less about the referent than "they" does.

That said, inventing new words for such a central part of English does feel a bit like steamrolling over the language. I expect most people who choose "they" do so because it seems to be the least-radical alteration of language use, which is... probably true, and a commendable rationale. So on that basis, I can accept and respect the choice of "they", even though I think it's not the best option.
