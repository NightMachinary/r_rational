  He promises not to hurt Mark, and to get Mark safely to Europe.

If you examine the oath, he only forswears injury, emotional devastation, and frying Mark's eyes in vegetable oil. He doesn't forswear, for example, telling someone else to injure or emotionally devastate Mark, or to fry Mark's eyes in vegetable oil.

More importantly, however, Dylan manages to swear /not/ to get Mark safely to Europe if/when Mark wants to stop working with him (which Mark plans to do /eventually/, even if he does stay until Malia Ngo is dead). Mark doesn't need to know whether Dylan is lying: Taking him at his word is sufficient reason not to trust Dylan.
