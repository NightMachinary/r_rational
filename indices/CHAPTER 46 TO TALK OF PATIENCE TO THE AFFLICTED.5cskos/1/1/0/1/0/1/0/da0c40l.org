  Dylan is clearly the embodiment of the rational learned helplessness -- that's why he's a rogue placebomancer.

I don't think he is. Remember, that whole speech was a /lie/.

We have no idea what Dylan's motives are. All we know is that he's witty and persuasive, and a pathological liar and serial killer.

Actually, that's not entirely true. According to /Laughing To Scorn Thy Laws And Terrors/, Dylan was originally a rank-and-file ritual magician who vowed revenge after he was expelled, and he became a terrorist because he realized "hero fighting the system" is a better story than "failed magician begging to be reinstated".
