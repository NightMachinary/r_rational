I didn't articulate very well. I'm not saying his story is true, a reflection of something that happened but occurred in a different way, a metaphor for his existence, nor a useful lens to try and guess how he sees himself. It's probably just bullshit.

But he does seem to categorically reject the narratives of his opponents instead of trying to negotiate or reason with them. That is an actual tactic he uses, we can observe, even if we don't know what his goals are. And that (aside from being more powerful placebomancy, as you point out) is also a fair way to deal with the concerns Scott brings up in the article. That similarity was what I was trying to point at.
