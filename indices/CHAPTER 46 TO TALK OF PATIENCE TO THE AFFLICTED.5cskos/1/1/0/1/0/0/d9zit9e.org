It's his core values. Viewing Dylan charitably - as at least half of me really wants to - he sees a world that's gone /wrong/, that's obviously offending against his sacred values, and refuses to accept any argument otherwise because the world is self-evidently /wrong/! To quote a Chesterton quote from [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/25/book-review-whats-wrong-with-the-world/][another of Scott's great essays]]:

  I begin with a little girl's hair. That I know is a good thing at any rate. Whatever else is evil, the pride of a good mother in the beauty of her daughter is good. It is one of those adamantine tendernesses which are the touchstones of every age and race. If other things are against it, other things must go down. If landlords and laws and sciences are against it, landlords and laws and sciences must go down. With the red hair of one she-urchin in the gutter I will set fire to all modern civilization...

  She is the human and sacred image; all around her the social fabric shall sway and split and fall; the pillars of society shall be shaken, and the roofs of ages come rushing down, and not one hair of her head shall be harmed.
