...I notice that Dylan's reworded oath is missing one thing that Mark asked him to swear to.

Mark's oath asked Dylan to swear that he was /telling the truth/ and that things would go bad /if Dylan was lying/. Dylan's reworded oath says nothing one way or another about truthfulness.

He promises not to hurt Mark, and to get Mark safely to Europe. But he's lying to Mark. And I'm pretty sure Mark didn't notice.
