Dammit, Mark. You were a good wizard with a bright future ahead of you, imprisoned for murders that you didn't commit, framed by a charismatic former friend with a mysterious past running a secretive terrorist organization. You could have won in only a few story arcs, if you yelled "I've never join you" and then swore revenge.

  “I, Dylan Alvarez -- oh, how should I remember how your stupid phrase went -- I swear I won't kill you, make someone else kill you, cause you to die in ways that may not technically count as ‘killing you', betray you, injure you, emotionally devastate you, turn you in, use you as bait, fry your eyes in vegetable oil, feed you to an alligator, trick other people into feeding you to alligators, cause you to be consumed by an alligator in ways that may not technically count as ‘feeding you' to it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, if by some bizarre fluke you make the terrible choice not to continue working with me, get you safely to Europe, or may my luck dry up and my head turn green and my liver explode and everybody die, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So help me God.”

  Then Dylan stared at Erica, and Erica started laughing again.

Instead, zero chance Mark has a happy ending.

So Unsong ends with all that happening to Dylan and then the US becoming a DrugLordy hivemind before dying?
