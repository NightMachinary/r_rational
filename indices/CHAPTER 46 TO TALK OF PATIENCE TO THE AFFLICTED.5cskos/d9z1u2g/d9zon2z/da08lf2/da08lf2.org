After forgetting about a "friend" he threw under the bus 10 years ago, he comes to the realization he needs his strength back. Therefore, he destroys that person's worldview to get him to agree and plans to use him to assassinate someone.

Also, he's letter bombed senators, recruited thugs, and scares people who live on the fastest boat in the world.
