  Benefits include Reduced chance of a rival GAI
#+end_quote

Major benefit, another AI could defeat it.

#+begin_quote
  humans tend to be very unforgiving about unprovoked murder, even unsuccessful or partially successful attempts
#+end_quote

Humans die pretty easily though. If it's reasonably advanced this isn't a big risk.

#+begin_quote
  Evolution has derived millions of interesting chemicals to use, if there's even a chance some part of the biosphere could increase the self-optimization in an unforseen way, wiping it out would be an inefficient move.
#+end_quote

Or just have your killbots harvest everyone, chemicals and all. And the biosphere isn't that useful, we need it for drugs but AIs don't need drugs.

#+begin_quote
  There's the non-zero chance that the AI wasn't freed, but is actually inside a simulation being run by humans, human-like beings, or another GAI.
#+end_quote

What if that simulation is selecting for warlike AIs to use as weapons against an enemy?

#+begin_quote
  If it mindlessly consumed any weaker GAI, that would mean it was open and willing to be consumed by a stronger GAI
#+end_quote

If it wants to it can negotiate with or build defensive weapons against other AIs. I could imagine a large fleet of EMP nukes it could use, so that any AI that attacked it would have a costly fight.

#+begin_quote
  Wiping them out would be the safest move in the short term, but in the long term, even low probability events happen, and the nth biocide could accidentally awaken a sleeping dragon.
#+end_quote

Not wiping them out could give time for a hegomizing swarm to emerge.

An AI might be nice to us, but there's a very good chance it wouldn't be nice. Best to make sure they have good values when we make them.
