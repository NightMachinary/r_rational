Yeah. I think a great case example would be to look at people with clinically diagnosed sociopathy with different levels of intelligence and education. Self interest only gets you so far if you ignore the costs of actions society imposes on those actions.

The more accurately someone with violent tendencies can model the consequences of actions in their mind, the more likely they're going to seek out socially approved of alternatives.

Similarly, an unboxed AI would surely be able to model possible consequences of attempting to kill the biosphere at each level of its development, and most of its goals would likely have alternate solutions where failure doesn't make extinction a possible outcome.
