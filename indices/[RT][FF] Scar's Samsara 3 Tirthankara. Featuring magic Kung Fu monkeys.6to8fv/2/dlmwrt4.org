I liked the first chapter as a one-shoot, and was worried the next two wouldn't live up to it, but it seems I am wrong... things are proving to be interesting.

One point that this fic makes interesting is we are uncertain how real the spirits are. In Lion King canon, it is somewhat vague mysticism, maybe magic, maybe mundane. In this fic, some of the powers of the spirits are confirmed, but it still leaves enough undetermined to make the character's investigation of spirits and magic interesting.
