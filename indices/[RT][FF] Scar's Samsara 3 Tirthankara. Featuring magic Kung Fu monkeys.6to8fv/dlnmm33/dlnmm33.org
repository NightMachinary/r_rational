As soon as I read the end of that chapter, I was immediately struck by the possibility that that's the same stick Scar stole. He had no reason to hold onto it when it wouldn't work for him, and would totally rather just leave it outside wherever Rafiki lived instead of face the awkward conversation. Rafiki just figured it was an extraordinary turn of good luck that he got an identical stick the next day and failed to realise Scar gave it back.

I mean, the spirits just giving him a new stick also works, but I hold out hopes for my prediction.
