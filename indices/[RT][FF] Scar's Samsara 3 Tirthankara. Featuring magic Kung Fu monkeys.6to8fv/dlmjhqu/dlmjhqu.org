This is great, as always. I can't get enough of the Scar/Simba relationship. It's just so much fun. I'm going to be legitimately sad if their relationship crumbles irreparably. Of course, The real question is what will Simba think of Mufasa when he finds out that he is the cause of the drought (If that's actually the case). I'm also loving the fact that I'm wonderfully uncertain as to who will triumph? The forces of Scar or those of Mufasa? So far Scar seems to be winning. From my perspective his life seems to have improved massively since he killed his brother(Except for the drought which he might be able to fix and his own private uncertainties/ emotional issues which he seems to be coping decently well with)
