This is great to hear! That's exactly what I was going for. It's really hard for me to get the audience to really think and feel along with the characters - mostly I think people see my stories as 'cool', but they're never interesting to the point where I actually see them being discussed outside of the chapter threads themselves. Something to shoot for, I guess :)
