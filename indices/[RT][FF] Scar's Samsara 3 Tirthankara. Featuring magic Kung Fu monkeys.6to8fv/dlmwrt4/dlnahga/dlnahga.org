Cheers! I really love the idea of magic as being a mysterious unknown force. Magic with rules ala Bandon Sanderson is great, but there's always a risk that if you explain too much, it loses the appeal of what makes magic so fascinating in the first place.

I'm actually planning to write a full novel at some point, with as fundamental thesis: What if superpowers/magic is real but people have no control or understanding of any of it and are terrified of their own abilities? I think something like that could be really cool.
