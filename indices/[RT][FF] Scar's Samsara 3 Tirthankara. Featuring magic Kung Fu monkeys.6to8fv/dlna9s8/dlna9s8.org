One of the things I'm really enjoying writing this story is that unlike NTBS, I don't have everything planned ahead - I mostly just start writing and see what happens. So with this chapter, I ran into a bit of an obstacle: In the previous chapter, Scar told Zira to trick Rafiki with a story about Simba having visions.

Then in this chapter, I thought "Wait that makes no sense, the real concern is the drought, so why not just say that?" But then I had Zira bring that up, and I realized that Scar was actually much smarter than I had given him credit for, because bringing up the drought gives Rafiki enough evidence to realize that Scar murdered Mufasa. It's always funny when your characters do things without you even realizing exactly why. :p

Anyway, I'm curious how obvious these things are to the audience. Was it clear that Rafiki deduced the whole thing at the end of the chapter? Or was that a bit too vague?
