I actually think the "spiritual advisor" excuse was just that, an excuse. Rafiki was rather close to Mufasa and already didn't like Scar, so when his friend died and his enemy took the throne in an outwardly legitimate way, rather than face it Rafiki went away to grieve and get high with the stoners of the animal kingdom. Realizing that Scar may be responsible for Mufasa's death gave Rafiki the drive to get back to work.
