Val is definitely in the Lair, right? He was unconscious at the start of the fight, and his body was probably dragged into a corner. Rain hasn't found his body. He probably woke up after the fight and went into the Lair, if only to get away from the corpses. He and Rain can then escape via the route Val took to get into the Lair without the guards spotting him (waterworks?).

I hope Rain figures out how to make and/or level up Essence monsters. Even if he can't make his own from scratch, if he can take an existing one, capture it, and boost its level with Essence Well and some of the Tel he conveniently got just before the dungeon run began, that would be plenty. I imagine each level requires mana/essence as well as Tel. Probably following the base system of fibonacci per level of Tel and mana. 100 and 1 Tel for level 1, 300 and 3 tel for level 2, etc. Maybe it resets at 25 and costs GranTel? That would prevent Rain from immediately being able to become a Platinum.
