An interesting bit of lore. Apparently there are three (presumably) Platinums still in the world.

- Warden Vatreece - Mentalist
- Potentate Fecht of the Adamant Empire
- High King Kev, the ruler of Ter'karmark

It also makes it seem like Gold+ are somewhat rarer than I had thought. So far all the non-DKE/Empire Gold rankers we've seen belonged to a single party, and that it's not like World of Warcraft or something where you can just find a pickup group for a gold ranked essence monster if you're strong enough (although, the DKE /sorta/ do that).

This also explains why Lavarro isn't gold rank. She's already in hot water with the watch, and now she's being abandoned by the guild. If getting gold rank is as much political as it is power, then of course she'd have trouble. I know that was a theory before but it seems virtually certain now.
