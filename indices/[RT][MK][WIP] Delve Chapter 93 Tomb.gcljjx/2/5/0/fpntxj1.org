Eehhhh... in litRPGs I'd prefer it if levels were kind of were absolute - I say kind of because a good counter build and a small enough gap should definitely left a lower level 1v1 a higher level - and the underdog won by grinding up faster or building alliances or something.

Nobody ever says it's a problem when the One Ring can only be thrown into the fires of Mount Doom.
