  We can guess (for Doylist reasons if nothing else) that he'll raise his cap in a novel way soonish.

I kinda hate that this has paid extra chapters. I can't not feel that people are throwing this kind of stuff based on the future knowledge instead of actually just guessing.

I feel I can't participate in the discussions without being spoiled, because I'm at a disadvantage.

I understand that the writer wants to be paid, and I have thrown some coins with Patreon to some things myself.

My Patreon doesn't even work right now. :( Failed to pay last month for no apparent reason and they haven't answered my questions...
