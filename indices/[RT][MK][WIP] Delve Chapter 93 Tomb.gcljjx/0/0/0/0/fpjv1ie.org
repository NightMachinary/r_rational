I'm not a Patreon reader and am guessing purely based on what's publicly available, for what it's worth.

Rain has been stuck at the level cap for many chapters, which is unusual for a litRPG, with only minor stat improvements to tide progression-fantasy fans over. This can't last. But Rain is not at all on track to visit a higher-level dungeon in the near future. And part of the appeal of the fic is seeing Rain defy the setting's conventions and baffle everyone. Thus, Doylist guess.
