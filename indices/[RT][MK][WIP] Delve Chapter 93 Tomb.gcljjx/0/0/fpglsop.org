  Did anyone read this part and immediately think that Rain might have found a way to raise his level cap?

We can guess (for Doylist reasons if nothing else) that he'll raise his cap in a novel way soonish.

But he's done a bunch of novel things lately that /could/ be the key. Feeding mana to slimes, making his interface do tricks, pushing past various flavours of soulstrain.

This is one more for the pile. We don't know enough about the true underlying system to predict which one will pay off. "Gaining so much XP that the level cap breaks" makes a certain kind of sense, but only if the system is sort of a physical object rather than an algorithm.
