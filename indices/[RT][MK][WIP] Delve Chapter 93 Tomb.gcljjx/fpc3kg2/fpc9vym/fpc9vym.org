Lavarro is very close to Gold. She is either around level 48/49 and missing the exp needed, or is having difficulty fulfilling the class requirements. So the level gap is probably not all that wide.

Also, I fully predict that people will start making predictions that Westbridge faked his death in a variety of ways. With Lavarro's help to fool the DKE, with the DKE's help to fool Lavarro and the Watch, all by himself to fool everyone, with the Empire's help to fool the DKE, and so on....
