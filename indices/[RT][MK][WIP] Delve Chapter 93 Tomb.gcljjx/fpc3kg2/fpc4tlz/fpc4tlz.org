Lavarro mentioned that whenever she fought her husband Halgrave, she always won over him, despite being just a silver compared to his gold. She also stated that Halgrave is a bit too soft, which is why he lost to Westbridge as he tried to avoid damaging Fel Sadanis, which really handicapped him.

Lavarro brought the fight right to Westbridge's own city, and I think it was stated Westbridge cared for his city and citizens so he was avoiding collateral damage which likely handicapped him. From the conversation about the fight, Lavarro likely didn't care at all about that and just went wild, which provides a huge benefit to her. She's also a kinetic mage or something similar and I would imagine snapping someone's neck at a distance would be a bit difficult to defend against, along with the surprise element. I mean, I don't think any sane person would just roll up into a Citizen's city and kill them and a bunch of other people.

Honestly though, I didn't expect Westbridge to die like that either, he was shown to have both experience and power, but I guess Lavarro is stronger than what her silver plate might suggest.
