  Both seem similar to me. If one can work, both can.

I really don't see the similarity.

  The only way to defeat a high level opponent is to grind up until you reach it's level.

But this is not true at all. If it was, none of these guys would have levels, because they only get them by killing a monster that is higher level than they are.

But I'm not sure we are talking about the same thing here.

This system, and pretty much most systems, are those where the protagonist should not be able to catch up.

Rain is not where he is because he has been grinding. He is where he is because he got lucky as hell in many ways. He has been grinding quite little actually. Because he can afford it, because he somehow stumbled upon the optimal class for him.

To get to platinum, Rain would have to get lucky. It has nothing to do with grinding more than the other guys. It has everything to do with having the advantage to /not/ needing to grind as much as everyone else.

The chinese cultivation stories are a prime culprits with this and shows exactly what is wrong.

In their world, pretty much everyone is grinding all the time. Yet the MC somehow outgrinds them and finds all kinds of way to cultivate faster. Even though he started with knowing basically nothing, he keeps figuring out things these other cultivators never did with their history of thousands of years. Then he is killing gods in a year or two.
