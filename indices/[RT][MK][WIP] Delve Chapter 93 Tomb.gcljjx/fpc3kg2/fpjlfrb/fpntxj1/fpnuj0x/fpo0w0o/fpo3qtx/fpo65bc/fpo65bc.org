  But this is not true at all. If it was, none of these guys would have levels, because they only get them by killing a monster that is higher level than they are.

There's plenty of ways a lower level charachter should be able to beat a higher level opponent. Teamwork, builds designed to counter the opponent (something like water mages vs fire), etc.

But beating a level 20 at level 15 with an appropriate build, or just knowing how to use your build better than they do, makes sense. Beating a level 40 at level 15 does not. That should be absolute. If you're a team of highly optimised party of level 15 adventurers, and you find a level 40 warrior. Go out and grind. That kind of level gap should be an absolute limit. (If you want to say that in this system 35 levels is small, and you need 100 levels for a big gap that's fine too of course).

  This system, and pretty much most systems, are those where the protagonist should not be able to catch up.

Why not? There's plenty of ways to grind up and catch someone ahead of you in a hypothetical litRPG system. The most obvious one is that the experience required to level grows faster than the rate of exp gain.

In Delve we can see that most of the gold-plates have, for one reason or another, stopped advancing. Halgrave retired to run a guild branch. The Citizens are all busy running their cities and don't go looking for ways to increase their cap. There is no way Rain's party that went into the dark-dungeon could defeat Halgrave in a fight, ever. Heck, he could probably stand there while they hit him with everything they've got and he wont even notice, his defences are that high.

But that party going off and searching for blues, raising their level until they are a threat to Halgrave. That is plausible. Especially since Rain the mana fount really gives an advantage. And they already have a silverplate to help the others raise their cap.
