This is the problem, though. The big dudes are already those who ginded their whole lives basically and also got lucky in terms of abilities and all. They also know their shit, having done that their whole lives.

The newbie MC needs something extra to beat that. Here he was lucky to get the build that lets him get most xp AND learn the language and stuff, AND he was very lucky getting that blue monster. Luck, luck, luck. There is no way someone from another world could just outgrind those big dudes.

No idea what you mean about the ring thingy.
