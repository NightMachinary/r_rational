He has had a really easy way to gain XP almost the entire story so far: it is how he has unlocked viewing rights on all the possible tier 1, 2, and 3 skills.

Every time so far he has always made sure to spend the experience without "wasting" too much by staying capped. Him getting "multiple levels worth" of xp /while at the cap/ is a totally new thing

Yes, what we know /so far/ indicates that the only way to raise your cap is to kill an essence monster. But that still begs the question: how do essence monsters raise their level/level cap?

This is the first time ever he got a shitload of experience while also at cap.

of course /all of this is pure speculation/ right now, but think about how Delve has been written so far, it generally follows a loop where:

Rain experiences the physical reality of Magic effecting the world, and then later figures out what happened.
