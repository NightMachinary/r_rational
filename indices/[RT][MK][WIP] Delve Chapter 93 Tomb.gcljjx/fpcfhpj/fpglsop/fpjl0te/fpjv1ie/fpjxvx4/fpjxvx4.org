I've seen people talking about it before a lot, so I'd guess your guess has more to do with the discussion where people seem to be too sure of that stuff, than the source material.

Now, of course I could be wrong and it does not happen. But if he will end up leveling soon in a weird way, I will stop reading any discussions of stories that has patreon chapters if I don't pay myself.

Rain could advance in many ways. He can make powerful friends. He can learn to use the artifact that makes the dome, which I'd bet is exactly what is going to happen. He can learn other stuff and he can get political power by helping Velika. Not all power is straight up leveling. He can get items, and he can learn to use these things he just found.

There are not many times he could get a huge powerup from leveling. There is the silver, gold, platinum. IF the story is not short, and it seems to have a lot of stuff, other stuff has to happen too. He doesn't even need to get to the top tiers necessarily for a good story imo.
