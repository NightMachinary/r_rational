  This is the problem, though. The big dudes are already those who ginded their whole lives basically and also got lucky in terms of abilities and all. They also know their shit, having done that their whole lives.

  The newbie MC needs something extra to beat that. Here he was lucky to get the build that lets him get most xp AND learn the language and stuff, AND he was very lucky getting that blue monster. Luck, luck, luck. There is no way someone from another world could just outgrind those big dudes.

Of course there is. Most RPGs have it easier to level up at the start and harder later on. Delve has that as a major setting element.

And if there isn't, then the writer has done badly. Creating a system where there is no way for the protagonist to catch up, then bypassing the entire system, is far worse than creating a system where the protagonist can catch up.

  No idea what you mean about the ring thingy.

The only way to defeat Sauron is to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom. The only way to defeat a high level opponent is to grind up until you reach it's level.

Both seem similar to me. If one can work, both can.
