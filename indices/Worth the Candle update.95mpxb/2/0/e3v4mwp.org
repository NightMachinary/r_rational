I'm a big fan of Worth the Candle, but the fact that it's so infrequently updated (and I recognize that it's updated in batches and it usually averages out to be at least one chapter a week) stops me from really wanting to support his Patreon. I wish that Alexander Wales wouldn't stress so much about having all his updates ready in a row and would instead stick to a more strict schedule. As it stands, it just feels like you might be paying money for a web serial that gets updated once a month and that kinda sucks.
