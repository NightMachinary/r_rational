my guesses for why people might prefer batches:

the author might have voiced preference for batch. if you look up above, the comment saying "whatever works for the author" has significantly more upvotes than anything else in this thread. (search is not working for me atm, so i can't find that survey.)

batch updates mean fewer errors and more cohesive/satisfying story arcs where the cliffhangers are more like hooks into the next arc, rather than unresolved immediate plots.

people might be like me: my enjoyment ramps up and up the longer i read and get immersed in a story. so i prefer to read for hours at a time, rather than <10 minutes (a few thousand words at 500w/m). but i don't often have enough self-control to put off reading updates to get a big chunk. (plus missing out on the response threads, which is the best part of serials.)
