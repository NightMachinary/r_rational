I think my preference would definitely be in favor of "shorter and more frequent" than "longer than less frequent". Do you know why people opted for the former? Having longer releases means less opportunity (for me) to participate in discussion, which is one of the pleasures of reading a web-serial, since by the time I've finished the 40k words or whatever and venture into the spoilerific discussion thread, several days have passed and active discussion has died down

(when reading for pleasure I slow my reading to maybe ~500w/m -- I could do it faster and just focus on retaining information, but I don't for the same reason I don't fast forward through shows I'm enjoying. So it takes me ~1.5h to read, which I can usually slot in over several nights before bed, but only in so much a quantity. Plus, a more smoothly distributed dose of web serial means I've less opportunity to tire of the work during a long read -- I think enjoyment for me peaks a couple thousand words in and decays from there -- not by much, but not negligibly).
