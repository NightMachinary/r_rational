his words not mine. I was reading his patreon page about why he was writing it under CRJ instead of AW. basically he thought the self insert fic would be disliked and he was writing it for himself not for others and he wanted to keep that stress relief outlet separate from the main body of work. But we all love WTC so much he ended up giving in and and admitting he owned it.

I just like that what he considered to be b-list when he started is my most anticipated release.
