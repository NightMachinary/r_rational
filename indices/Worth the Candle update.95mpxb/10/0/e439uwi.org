why do you think it's a supposed b-list work? isn't it the main thing he's working on at the moment?

if i ever manage to become a prolific author, i would consider using another pseudonym simply to get a more genuine, naive response from readers judging it on its own merit, and not influenced by my reputation or their own expectations of my work. (so not just because i consider it a potentially sub-par work.)
