Fair point, I hadn't considered it when asking.

The reason I made the post is that it hadn't updated in a while (more so than usual), and I was, well, worried that it died. May have been an overreaction, but please believe me that I found myself checking for an updated multiple times a day.

So I looked around for any kind of note on why it's stalled, couldn't find anything, and then asked here, where clearly I got my answer.

If I was aware that the author was on vacation (which was a strong possibility given the summer), well, I'd have just waited patiently.

After thinking about it, I still think it's a legitimate reason for a post, but I could have phrased the question differently, and probably would have avoided implying that I'm asking for an update date, as opposed to making sure the story is not dead.
