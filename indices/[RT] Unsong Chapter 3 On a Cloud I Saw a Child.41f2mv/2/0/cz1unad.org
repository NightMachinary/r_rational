I am constantly boggled by people who have read my previous stories still being surprised that I like humor in fiction.

But I am trying to make the book able to stand on its own aside from the humor (sort of like HPMoR or Discworld, which both included humor but weren't /about/ humor), so I hope you'll stick around anyway.
