I like funny non-fiction more than funny fiction. Bill Bryson's books are very funny.

I think its quite difficult to do generally accessible but intelligent humor. I like Discworld, but the humor often falls flat and IMO really damages the emotional drama of the work. I never feel emotionally invested in Discworld; I find it funny but not serious, though I enjoy the creative worldbuilding.
