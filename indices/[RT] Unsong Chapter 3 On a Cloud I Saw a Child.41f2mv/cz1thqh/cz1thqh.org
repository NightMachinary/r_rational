So, um. This is still pretty great.

It's confirming implicitly that this is a simulated / code-based universe, which given everything else that's going on I find unsurprising.

A callback to a previous chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Gebron and Eleazar's classic textbook says that only four kabbalists have ever gazed upon Adam Kadmon bare. Rabbi Isaac Luria. /The archangel Uriel./ The Comet King. /And an eight year old girl./
#+end_quote

(italics mine)

The events of this chapter happen in 1990, about 27 years before the events of the previous chapters. 27 is 3^{3,} and there are three characters of consequence in the chapter (the girl, her father, and the archangel). Also, the archangel repeats the figure "4.9 seconds" three times.

Edit: The number of days separating the date of this chapter from the date in chapter 1/2 is 9,720 - which is the mystically significant 40 multiplied by 3 repeatedly (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 40). 40 is often a biblical amount of time, as in the 40 days and nights of rain or 40 years wandering in the desert. So we've seen 3 * 3 * 3 and 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, so after those sequences of obvious 3's the missing sequence 3 * 3 * 3 * 3=81 must be somewhere hidden in the chapter. And, of course, it's hidden in several places - in the Archangel's thoughts of killing Sohu, he thinks about how 29.4 kJ of energy would smash her skull, which is about 8.1 watt-hours, for example. The rest are left as an exercise to the reader.
