Some time back I'd asked for advice on rank order decisions for prospective cities to move to for my wife's residency. The results came back a few days ago -- it looks like we're going to Palo Alto, CA! With that uncertainty out of the way, a greater uncertainty rises up to take its place: finding me a job D: if I can't manage to secure an appropriate postdoc somewhere, plan B has always been to explore industry data science positions (put my first resume together last night!). I hear this "Bay Area" is quite flush with tech opportunities, so is anyone here experienced in navigating its job market and willing to share advice? Things you wish you'd known before applying to places? Common mistakes applicants in my position make (in short, coming from a PhD in Anthropology with a heavy focus on computational statistical methods development)?
