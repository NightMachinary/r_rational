There's this superstition that if you say that things can't get worse they will or if you joke about something bad happening it will. I don't know if the idea is that there is omnipresent supernatural judge that punishes people for overconfidence or if the idea is that the internal belief changes the universe, but it seems really silly. And it seems silly in an easily exploitable way as different people consider different things bad. Would anyone be interested in writing a short story on that?
