  here's this superstition that if you say that things can't get worse they will or if you joke about something bad happening it will. I don't know if the idea is that there is omnipresent supernatural judge that punishes people for overconfidence or if the idea is that the internal belief changes the universe, but it seems really silly. And it seems silly in an easily exploitable way as different people consider different things bad. Would anyone be interested in writing a short story on that?

I'm sure it comes from literature. If I had to guess, saying it can't get any worse comes from literature et al originally as a way to introduce extra tension when it does in fact get worse. Or a way of showing that the characters are emotionally unprepared from the tension. Then the device gets overused and everyone now has expectations of things getting worse when someone says it.

Also the idea of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris][universe punishing people for overconfidence]] / ambition is much older than that. As for that, the superstition that you shouldn't upset society or you will get punished for it is a socially useful way of reinforcing norms.
