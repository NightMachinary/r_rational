We have something like that near my place in Australia, only it used to be a prison for indigenous people who were imprisoned, essentially, for not having a concept of property (and imprisoned on an island that they thought was a bad spiritual place). For each pair of cells, they took out a wall in between and made that into a single room. Now backpackers stay there.

(I think finally the outrage in the indigenous and non-indigenous community is making them close the hotel and convert it into a museum, but /gods/. Why do people think derelict prisons are "fun" and "quirky"? Yes, Sharon, I understand that little Kayden doesn't eat his vegetables and you think it would be funny to put him in prison for it, but... SERIOUSLY?)
