So, I've been in the Bay Area for the past week... and been horrifically sick the past week. In fact, the only day I wasn't sick was the first day I arrived here where I had a very pleasant meal and walk/chat with [[/u/callmesalticidae]] , who is just as kind and interesting as you'd expect. (God I hope you didn't get sick from being around me)

It's been pretty disappointing, to be honest, as I was looking forward to seeing Oakland and Berkeley and instead I saw... Tenderloin, which is where I booked a hotel in my infinite wisdom.

I'm beginning to recover now and I'm on to my way to Vegas this evening, so hopefully I'll be feeling okay soonish.

That said, while sick I was able to do the following:

- See the sea lions, TWICE
- Go to alcatraz, which was very well organised, though parents taking photos of their children in the cells was cringy
- See the SF production of Hamilton, which was awesome especially because it didn't require me to do anything other than sit down like the lump I was
- Eat some good but not great food
- Saw the Survivor Season 40 Premiere on TV, THOUGH BECAUSE I WAS SICK I MISSED OUT ON GOING TO SOME INTERNET RANDOM'S HOUSE TO WATCH IT THERE (I promised callmesalticidae a write-up of Survivor, someday, to get you all just as addicted as me)
- Go to a Best Buy

So that's... not too bad. Even though this trip to the Bay has just been a very, very expensive way to recover from my illness (though no doubt less expensive than a single night in an American emergency room?).
