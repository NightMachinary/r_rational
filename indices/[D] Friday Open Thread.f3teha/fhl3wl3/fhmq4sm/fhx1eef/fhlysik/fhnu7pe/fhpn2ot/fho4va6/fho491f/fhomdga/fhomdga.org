I liked this show mostly because its meta-story (The Quest) gave me a lot of ideas for RPGs I run. I also like that the characters have complicated but campy personalities, and the moral disagreements that leads to.

My favourite parts were the Library heist, the king-golem sex scene, and the enslaved fey mansion.
