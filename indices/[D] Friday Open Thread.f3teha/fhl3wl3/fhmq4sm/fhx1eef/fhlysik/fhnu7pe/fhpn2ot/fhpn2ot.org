You should put in some spoiler tags.

I've been pretty sick the last week, and watching The Magicians, currently somewhere in season 3. It's much different from the books, which it would pretty much have to be, but has come into its own, and features some cool/clever/funny/whimsical stuff often enough that I'll keep watching.

The books, on the other hand, are probably my favorite works of fantasy, though I almost never recommend them to anyone, since a large part of why I liked them is that they resonate with my personally, something I don't think is likely true of other people. Also, I read them all as they came out, and while the second book elevates the first, the third /really/ elevates the first and second, so it's kind of a "it gets better!" thing, except that I loved the first book for what it was when it was written. (The author grew with the books, and there were long gaps between them for that reason.)
