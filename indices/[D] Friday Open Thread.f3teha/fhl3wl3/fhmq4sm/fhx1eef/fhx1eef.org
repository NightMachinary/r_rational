There's a lot of discussing and squabbling around on scientific/academic Twitter right now that's giving me a headache for how stupid the whole thing is. Basically I think it's rooted mostly in a massive misunderstanding - purely semantics - but because emotions are running too high no one is willing to simply calm down a bit and look at the thing for what it is.

Basically Richard Dawkins tweeted something along the lines of "of course eugenics programs are bad, but they should be argued against on the basis of ethical, not feasibility, arguments, because if you can select and breed animals of course you could do the same for humans - it just requires things that we should NOT DO to humans". Here's the full tweet sequence:

This has turned immediately into a massive "Richard Dawkins supports eugenics" based on the fact that him using the words 'it would work' is taken as a moral endorsement, not just an assessment that it would succeed /at the goals that it sets itself/, not that the goals are morally good. Pretty much everyone is screaming bloody murder and frankly it's stupid as fuck. I actually think we could really use in a lot of fields a lot more distinction between the scientific and the ethical. In lots of situations when people drag science to support their position they actually miss the point (e.g.: bringing up neurology/embryology to defend abortion with someone who literally thinks the worth of human life is defined by God and thus does not care for it being rooted in materialism at all, which means no science in the world will budge them), and all this leads is to further politicisation of science with little or no progress on the actual issue. It might be part of why we're so screwed and polarised over climate change, in fact.
