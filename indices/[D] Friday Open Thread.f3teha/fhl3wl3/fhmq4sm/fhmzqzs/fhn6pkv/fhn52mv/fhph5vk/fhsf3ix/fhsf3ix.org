I mentioned in another comment Undertale as a great example of inconsistency used for narrative purposes. You have stuff like Toriel dying immediately after your first attack that is designed to catch you unaware and trick you. The game plays around with you quite a bit.

Not sure about a seemingly inconsistent game actually making more and more sense as time goes. I don't see why it should be impossible, but it's hard to think how exactly it might look like. It'd be interesting though. Especially if you get to experience the feeling of slowly figuring out this seemingly crazy world and finding a logic in it.
