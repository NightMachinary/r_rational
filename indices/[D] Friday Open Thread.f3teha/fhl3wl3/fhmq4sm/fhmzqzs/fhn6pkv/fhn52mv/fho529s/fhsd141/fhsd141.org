It happening now and then however can be a great source of humour or surprise. Undertale uses this to great effect - both breaking the assumed rules of the genre, the things you'd expect from a videogame in general (by going meta in many senses), and sometimes breaking its own rules (for example in boss fights, which often suddenly introduce strange, unique mechanics). It can actually afford to do it also because one of the things that makes it unique is that it actively incorporates the saving and reloading mechanic into its gameplay and role, and so "losing and having to retry" is literally part of the plan (and in fact what the in-world player character experiences).
