Ha. We got a former jail here in Oxford that has been turned into a luxury hotel. It is quite the strange sight. It's still got the structure, with one big central space and the doors from all rooms at all floors facing this main hall, and was used as a jail I believe as late as the 1990s. But now you have to actually /pay/ to go sleep in it, and a pretty penny too, I think.
