The last episode of the Magicians had a time loop with the cause being a primordial being released. I just thought it funny with Mother of Learning recently ending and all.

I can't really recommend the Magicians (tv show, haven't read the books) much, but it has its moments! Stuff often happens semi-randomly without proper foreshadowing. It has problems with tone, i.e., funny one moment, serious the next without proper (for me) transition. What annoys many, I think, is that the protagonists are causing more problems than they solve (opposite of the sidebar ;) ), are depressed, annoying, useless or broken in other ways etc. but that is what makes it unique.
