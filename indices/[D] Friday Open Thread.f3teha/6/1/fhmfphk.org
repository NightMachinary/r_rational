- Primer: the best time travel movie ever made.

- 10 Cloverfield Lane: an extremely smart & rational protagonist makes this a joy to watch.

- Death Note: not exactly rational in execution, but it has a rational feel to it.

- Chronicle: the protags are pretty smart, if not actively rational. Their actions pretty closely replicate what mine would look like after getting superpowers (i.e. test, test, test).

- Black Mirror: more-or-less rational explorations of the ramifications of various technologies, real and imagined.
