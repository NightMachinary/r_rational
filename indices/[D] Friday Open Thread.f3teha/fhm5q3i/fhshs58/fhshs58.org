Anime: last year's "Kanata no Astra" is pretty lighthearted and not very hard as sci-fi goes (there's FTL travel and alien biology that's a bit too close to terrestrial one), but it still has a lot of interesting concepts, and an overall mystery plot that's very well planned and wrapped up satisfyingly. One of those cases where you genuinely have the hints to figure out a lot of stuff from the beginning, but you don't notice until it's slammed right into your face.
