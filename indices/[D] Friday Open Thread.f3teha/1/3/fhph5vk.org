What do you mean by inconsistency?

â€‹

It seems like you've re-invented/discovered two notions of paradox:

a) an actual contradiction

b) an apparent contradiction

(In a more complicated way, there can exist ways of handling things which seem to make sense, but then break under complicated circumstances, and a different way has to be found/made (re-examining old premises at times) that still has the desired properties (like consistency).)
