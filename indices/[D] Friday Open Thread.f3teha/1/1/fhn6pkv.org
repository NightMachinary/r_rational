Unfolding games (Candy Box 2, A Dark Room, Frog Fractions, etc.) could fall into the category of "seriously utilising inconsistency", maybe. They centre around having the game mechanics shift as you progress through the game.

For "inconsistency that resolves into consistency", I can't think of any games, but the best piece of fiction that I've seen do that would be Problem Sleuth, followed by Homestuck. Various strange mechanics of the world are exploited in various situations.

Also, digging around the search bar found me [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5imb61/rational_video_games/][this thread]] from three years ago, which could still be relavent.
