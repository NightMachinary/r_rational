I'd argue that player uncertainty about the consequences of their actions is sometimes a good thing in horror games. In my experience, I'm most afraid during the times when I don't know enough about adversaries/mechanics to be able to game the system. That feeling quickly wears off once I've figured out the parameters of any given situation, and at that point the game becomes less enjoyable for me.
