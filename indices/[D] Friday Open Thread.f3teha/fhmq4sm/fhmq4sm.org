Been wondering about the intersection of video games and rational fiction. For story games, it's a boring question. But for system-based games, is it possible for one game to be more rational than another? For example, Baba Is You is a self-consistent exploration of some ideas that seem impossible on the surface, is that analogous to trying to make a coherent world out of something a bit loopy like Harry Potter or Pokemon? Consistency is cheap in a system running on a computer, but there are games that are deliberately inconsistent, mostly troll games like I Wanna Be The Guy. Are there more serious uses for inconsistency (that are still fun)? Could you make a game that initially appears to have inconsistent mechanics, then slowly resolves them into a consistent state?
