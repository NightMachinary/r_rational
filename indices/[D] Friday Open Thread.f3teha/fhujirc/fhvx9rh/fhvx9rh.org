It was recommended a few times in weekly threads, I think. But newer got major attention, dunno exactly why. I've read first 1,5 books myself, but found quality of second one extremely lacking compared to the first one (which I personally think is quite good). Characters were extremely lacking in depth, they quite literally lost their internal voices, story turned into a slog. Author in his notes mentioned that the first book was in the "other genre" (although I didn't noticed that shift) and if he says that second book is more representative of whole story, then... Well. Mb other "books" turned out better, but it wasn't worth founding out for me anymore. Especially with "weak" evidence of it being invisible in this sub despite being proclaimed as ("Big Serious") "Rational fiction".
