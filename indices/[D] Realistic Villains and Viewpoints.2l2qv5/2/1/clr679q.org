I think it rings false to me because "Blue-Skyer" denotes some sort of tribalism which is based on the truth statement. I mean, believing that abortion should be legal (for example) doesn't /necessarily/ feel like being Pro-Choice, but it's often the case that people who believe that abortion should be legal /do/ feel like they are Pro-Choice with all the social signalling and tribalism that implies.

I may be reading too much into this though.
