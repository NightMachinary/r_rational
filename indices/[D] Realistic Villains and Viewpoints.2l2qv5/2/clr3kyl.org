#+begin_quote
  Really believing that the sky is blue doesn't feel like being a Blue-Skyer, it feels like the sky being blue.
#+end_quote

My pattern-matcher says that this sentence is accidentally pretending to be wise.

Edit:

It feels pretending to be wise because repeatedly using phrases as obviously true as "The sky is blue" feels like it makes the reader biased to believe in the other things written nearby. (That explanation leaves a quiet strain in the back of my mind, so it may not be the true cause of that feeling.)

It feels accidentally so because it is plausible that EY included that sentence as a reminder to everyone who read [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/][this]] that what is learned there can be applied here. If that was his intent, putting a link into that phrase, as he does in the Sequences, might help.
