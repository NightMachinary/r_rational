I suppose the issue here is that Yudkowsky spends so much time writing from the perspective of one not-so-villain, Draco, and has his main character in thrall to the definitely villain, Quirrell. If we're going to spend that much time in their heads looking up to them, then yes, a climactic battle where the hero slays the villain in single combat seems a bit wrong. Ender struggles with this. He understands his enemies too well not to feel grief when he defeats them.

But if you keep the readers out of the heads of the villains, you can have them be realistic and sympathetic while still rooting for their defeat. See Azula, season 1 Zuko, even Ozai doesn't feel cartoonish. And with a bit of balance you can have your cake and eat it too, like in "The Beach" episode where we kind of hope Azula gets the guy or at least burns his house down.
