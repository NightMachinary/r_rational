I quite agree - there is a lot of fiction where villainy being obvious on the level of a saturday morning cartoon is a good stylistic choice. Others where the villain is extremely obviously evil and does a lot of evil things "on screen" can also be very good stylistically. These are perhaps not 'realistic', but there are other virtues that can be important for a story than realism.

Quite frankly, in many fantasy stories the hero triumphs over the villain by stabbing them or otherwise inflicting violence. Quite possibly viscerally. If the villain is not doing something obviously, blatantly wrong at the time and has all sorts of actual moral justifications that are at all believable, then it can be super tough to rejoice in their defeat, especially if their defeat comes via methods like being stabbed repeatedly.

I mean, imagine if Harry kills Quirrell the same way he did in canon - by giving him a hug that slowly and painfully burned him to death. Imagine if that was graphically portrayed, and we even got a Quirrell POV as he slowly burns to death (possibly with a bit of dramatic irony as it is revealed in the POV that Quirrell actually burned Narcissa to death to bind Malfoy Sr. to his cause more thoroughly or something). If Quirrell is at the time not actually doing anything horrible but is instead just sort of sitting around when Harry ambushes him with a hug-o-fiery-death, I can imagine a lot of reader anger and rejection at the scene, no matter how well deserved QQ's death would be. In canon HP, of course, QQ is a nonentity until the scenes directly before his demise (where he reveals himself to be a hammy, scenery-chewing villain with no justification), and the burn-to-death ending works fine for the story and causes just about zero reader anger.
