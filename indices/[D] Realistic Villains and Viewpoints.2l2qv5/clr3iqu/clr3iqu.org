There's a real risk of making villains too sympathetic, especially if their villainy is kept secret from the reader (or sometimes even if it's not). That creates some serious dissonance when the villain loses, or when the villain is revealed as having done some terrible things that the reader thinks he's not guilty of.

Assuming that Quirrell turns out as evil as I think he is, I'm curious what the reader reaction will be, and whether Yudkowsky can maneuver around the trap he's created by writing a sympathetic villain.
