I think this is a question better suited for discussion on [[/r/unsong]] or [[/r/slatestarcodex]].

But I do believe it should be posted to topwebfiction.com if only because that's the purpose of the site, to link to fiction and to enable some sort of comparison between the web serials.

However, unless Scott is aware and regularly links to the site at the end of his chapters for regular voting, it will be very hard for his story to move up through the ranks. So I think the only person who should do the submitting is Scott.

TL;DR - Yes, but Scott should be the one to do it.
