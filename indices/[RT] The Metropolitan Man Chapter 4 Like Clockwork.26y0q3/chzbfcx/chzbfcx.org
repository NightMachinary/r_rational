Now that I think about it, don't Superman's language skills suggest some tantalizing hints to what's really going on, that Lex could pick up on?

Consider two facts: 1) Superman claims he only arrived two weeks before his initial appearance and 2) He spoke perfect English at his initial appearance, but no other language.

If Superman was able to obtain idiomatically perfect of a language in just a couple weeks, why hasn't he learned any other languages? And if it takes him a more human amount of time to learn, that suggests he's been here for longer than he claims...
