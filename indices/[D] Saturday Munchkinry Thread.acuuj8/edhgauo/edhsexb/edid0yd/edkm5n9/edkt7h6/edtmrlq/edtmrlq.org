The thing about the ax is that while axes are a good pick if you have to take a weapon skill, I'm just not seeing weapon skills in general being a good pick when you don't know anything about the state of weapons, armor, magic, and tactics on the otehr world.

And while accounting for the Skyclad Sorceress opening (nakend in the wilderness) in your plans isn't a bad idea, I think there are probably better skills to accomplish that goal. An ax is useful but not necessary for survival, and using axes isn't that complicated, so if you put one on your belt and get to keep it it's not like you'll cut your own hands off when you try to take some branches off a log to to make your shelter better.

On reverse engineering the system: Well, I'll admit, that most Isekiea stories operate on author fiat so it's possible the scientific methods doesn't work here. However, this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and and since such a world is intrinsically not rational, I'm ignoring that possibility for the purposes of this conversation.

If the world and the system follow rules, it should be possible to determine those rules by experimentation, and that means for the longer times at least you really should be experimenting and trying to determine those rules. If you have a year, spending 6 moths just tinkering with the system then formulating a plan based on the results of that tinkering is almost guaranteed to be better than formulating a plan at the start when you have no information and sticking to it for a full year. With 10 years you get even more time to experiment.

And on separation of chemistry and alchemy, Honestly it's not all that weird. A lot of the equipment and lab practices in modern chemistry were developed by alchemists, and if it wasn't for the fact that the underlying theory of matter turned out to be wrong, alchemy would have probably become a real science with the invention of the scientific method. If alchemy worked we wouldn't have chemistry, but a chemist walking into an alchemy lab will recognize most of the equipment and doing chemistry on a world where alchemy works will probably result in falsifying the laws of chemistry and verifying the laws of alchemy.
