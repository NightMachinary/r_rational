Thank you, I've always loved the superhero genre type of stuff but thought that in general the whole thing was a little too constrained to certain ideas and tropes. Like what you mentioned earlier in that the vast majority of people with abilities like this would probably use them in completely mundane ways instead of fighting each other.

At the same time however, I also love outrageous super-powered punch ups.

There are a lot of other details such as super technology courtesy of abnormally intelligent individuals becoming integrated into global society during the 1950's and the fact that the main plot takes place in a retro future 1970's.
