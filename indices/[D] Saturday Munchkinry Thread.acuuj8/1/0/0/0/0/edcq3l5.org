When you said microscope I assumed you meant an electronic one, my mistake. If it is just glass then he would absolutely be able to manipulate water on the other side.

As for your other question, any amount of moisture in the air is theoretically enough to conduct his power though the strength of his attacks obviously varies.

And about that power plant idea, funnily enough that is actually apart of his backstory. He was so good at his job that he put a lot of people out of business who against better judgement wanted to get revenge which led to some people being exploded and him having to turn to less than official pursuits. In the Shapers case his father(who has the same power) saved his home country of Japan from many potentially devastating tsunami's and other natural disasters as well as working in Hydro-power. His son however was obsessed with mythological stories about ancient elemental water gods from cultures around the world and believed that his father was wasting his potential as a public servant. He wanted to be feared, and respected, treated as being more than human which he truly believed.

Sorry if that was too much backstory, thank you so much for your advice and ideas. I've always loved the idea of using such powers in unconventional or novel ways and you have given me lots to think about!
