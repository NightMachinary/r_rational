So there is this group who call themselves the Trident because there are three of them and they all have water or liquid based abilities. The first and arguably most powerful can control all water with a 30 meter radius of himself, forming it into water shape he pleases. However, he can only control water he can visibly see and can not change the state of said water into ice or steam and can only control it in it's liquid state.

The second turns all water he comes into contact with into acid which lingers for about an hour after he leaves. This acid is incredibly potent and can quickly erode steel and melt flesh. The bodily fluids he produces and are composed of are immune to these effects

The third member can super heat any water he comes into contact with, this includes the water that resides within living things. Despite this he only has a high resistance to things such as steam burns and usually wears a specialized suit to mitigate any damage to himself. The most he is normally able to super heat in any moment is in an area of exactly 3 meters in any direction. He must however have a direct physical connection to water he wants to super-heat, for instance if 2 two people are holding hands and he touches one of them both will explode.

I've been thinking of ways that they could synchronize their abilities to cause maximum damage or be the most combat effective. I've thought of a few but wanted to get some thoughts from the professional munchkinners.
