  I feel like you'd be able to abuse it pretty easily. Competitive people are willing to risk A LOT for immediate benefits disregarding problems for later.

Huh, you know the thought of pitching the powers as super-doping never even crossed my mind? And I even mentioned profesional sports in the tennis example, I feel a bit silly now.

It's a very good pitch too: impossible to test for, magical abilities that are slowly becoming more prevalent in the news, but nobody knows the true limitations yet. All of your competitors are probably allready using it and you'll lose your competitive edge if you don't join them soon.

  Google "Goldman's dilemma" => More than half the athletes would accept something that guarantee success even if they died 5 years later.
#+end_quote

*Googles*. Jeesh, for real? Half of proffesional athletes? That.. is a much higher number than I would have guessed. Though a more recent study from 2009 apparently found a much lower percentage of people accepting it (6% if the treatment was legal, but deadly) so maybe things have gotten better since the nineties?

Thanks for the suggestion, that was an interesting read.

As for your questions:

  If you manage to convince an archivist to become an archive then what happens? Would he have increased storage and do you have access to all the skills of his archives?
#+end_quote

I cut the bit that explained this from the description, but in short: the ritual fails in a very unpleasant (though non-lethal) way for all involved.

#+begin_quote
  Are there other powers in this world and do you have access to them if you turn a power-holder into an archive?
#+end_quote

Nope, no other powers. Which, incidently also means you have to convince people that something supernatural is going on in order to get them to take you seriously. Probably not particularly hard, but not really trivial either, given that you need to convince at least one person before you have any powers to demonstrate.
