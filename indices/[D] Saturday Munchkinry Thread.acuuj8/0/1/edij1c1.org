Unethical mode:

You can set up a tier system of how much memory maintenance your archives are going to get. For some very important ones, you actually clean things up in a reasonable and useful way. For many others, you just let them burn out, and either replace them or put them in a nursing home. It'd be worth experimenting with a medium maintenance tier, where you carefully store a year's worth of useful memories, and from then on do sloppy periodic maintenance. That is, the archive gets to remember their last 30-60 days, and you trim that back down to 30 once a month, which is crippling but livable.

If any of your archives betray you or become a liability, you can dump sensory backup on them. if there's too much risk of someone interviewing them to use your knowledge against you, you can prepare an archive with only completely useless memories (all your archives' memories of eating sandwiches) and dump that on people you want eliminated.

It's worth finding potential archives who are actually talented, driven, and unethical. You can always replace one if you find a better candidate. Your core personnel are someone who can research better mnemonics and mental archiving abilities, someone with strong salesmanship skills who can anonymously introduce you to potential archives (who probably has a lot of other criminal skills), a doctor for maintaining the houses full of people with no long term memory that you'll be leaving behind, and an investigator for finding other archives you can frame. You might want to reduce some of these people to medium maintenance if they're a threat.

You'll want to quickly assemble a team of money launderers, card counters, and hedge fund managers to gather your initial stockpile of cash before people catch on that archives exist. Speed is more important than subtlety here, since you should assume the secret will be out shortly regardless, and you'll be wiping these people's memories as soon as they become liabilities. Another potential route is stealing the identity of a reclusive billionaire, which you can do just by finding one with few enough friends/family and offering to make them an archive. I'd probably go with both.

Once the cat's out of the bag, I'd go much more reclusive until society readjusts to the fact that this exists (I expect witch hunts whenever someone is talented, which isn't sustainable), and carefully get more competent archives (who can clean up the messes you made during the initial blitz). From there you're a reclusive billionaire with a secondary pile of dark money, and a superpower, so accumulating influence should be easy.
