Still taking a break from the Mistborn mini-series due to not having the books here, so how about munchkinning a power from the long list of stories-that-I-will-probably-never-write?

(Apologies, again, for the length. I appear to be unable to write these things in a concise way)

You are an Archivist, this means that you can perform a ritual that establishes a mental connection between yourself and another person, this other person thereby becomes an Archive.

*The ritual*

The ritual requires a deliberate act of will for both parties, but does not otherwise require a willing participant (the target can be tricked or forced to participate). From the words spoken during the ritual it is clear that the Archivist will be able to access the memories of the Archive, but the details are vague so misrepresenting what someone is signing up for is definitely an option.

You can perform this ritual once a month, but there is otherwise no limit to the number of Archives you can create.

The target of the ritual must posses a sentient, biological mind that has reached a certain level of development and is very similar in design to that of the Archivist. In practice, this means only other humans older than, say, 14 years old are able to become Archives (assume this clause has enough asterixes that hacking the definition of human is not a viable approach).

Once the ritual is complete, the Archive gains a number of useful abilities:

*Perfect memory*:

From the moment the ritual is completed the Archive never forgets anything, their memories do not fade or change with time like they do for normal humans. This power only applies to long term memory and it does not repair existing memories from before the ritual, though it does prevent those memories from fading further.

*Enhanced knowledge aquisition*:

Archives can acquire new information and skills at a rate vastly quicker than regular people. This includes mental skills like playing chess or solving a rubix cube, but also skills that rely on muscle memory like juggling or sports. They do not, however, develop the corresponding physical strength and endurance any faster than a regular person would, nor do they become any more intelligent or creative than they were before.

An Archive could become an excellent tennis player (on a technical level) in a few weeks, but might still lose to a merely competent, but physically stronger, player. They will also never be able to compete with the best tennis players in the world if they didn't already have that weird combination of good genetics, competive nature and willpower that makes a top athlete.

Similarly, Archives are no more capable of applying their knowledge than they would be if they had acquired it the normal way. An Archive can develop PHD level knowledge of a field in months, but that does not automatically allow them to produce new insights in that field if they didn't already have that weird combination of intelligence, creativity and passion that makes a good academic researcher.

*Archives trance*

In addition to the above two abilities, the Archives mind also keeps a backup of the sensory input that they experience. This backup includes mental state, emotions and even simulated sensory experiences like dreams or the voices you hear when subvocalizing.

An Archive can enter into a trance where they can relive any part of the backed up experience at higher or lower than real time speeds, even pausing the stream when desired. This allows an Archive to recall experiences that didn't get converted into long term memories (they could, for instance, read through a book that they quickly paged through before). Using this ability requires the undivided attention of the Archive and while they are in the trance they become unable to observe the world around them.

*Mental limitations*

All of these powers come with one very serious downside. The human mind is limited in the amount of information it can store and remembering everything, learning a crazy number of new skills and storing a backup of everything you experience eats up a lot of mental disk space.

Once the amount of information in an Archive's brain reaches a certain threshold they lose the ability to make new long term memories. When this happens, the Archive cannot recall anything that happened between the moment the threshold was reached up until about 30 seconds before the current moment in time. Absent outside intervention, most Archives reach this threshold about two years after they first get their powers.

*The Archivist*

It is with this limitation that the Archivists own supernatural abilities come into play. An Archivist has access to the complete set of memories and skills of every Archive they are linked to as if they where their own.

An Archivist can also enter a trance similar to the Archives Trance where they can review the stored sensory inputs of any Archive they are linked to. In addition, while in this Archivists trance, they can also erase particular memories, skills or bits of stored sensory data to prevent the archive from running out of mental storage space.

Finally, an Archivist can store their own memories and skills or those of an Archive they are linked to in the mind of any other Archive they are linked to. The Archive is able to access any memories stored in their mind as if they were their own, but cannot use any skills that they did not originally learn themselves (only an Archivist brain is adaptable enough to use skills not originally theirs).

The bond between Archivist and Archive cannot be broken once established and an Archive cannot be linked to multiple Archivists. This means that if an Archivist dies all Archives linked to them are doomed to run out of mental storage space eventually.

*Further notes/limitations*

- Due to subtle differences in how people perceive the world it is always clear if a memory you have access to is originally yours or not. So no implanting fake memories.
- An Archivist can store about 8 years worth of sensory backup inside the mind of an Archive, but this would require wiping literally everything else, leaving the Archive with the mind of a newborn infant and unable to learn new things.
- With an Archivist that regularly cleans up memories and trims the sensory backup to maybe a few days of relevant footage there is very little chance that an Archive ever runs out of storage space for important things, but sorting through every new memory to determine if it should be kept or not is a lot of effort on the part of the Archivist (especially if they have to do it for multiple Archives).
- It is possible to remove an Archive's memory of participating in the ritual, but the perfect memory and increased learning are going to make it pretty obvious that something strange is going on.\\
- All interactions between Archive and Archivist are subject to speed of light delays.

*Scenario*

You learn all of this information when you and 700 other randomly chosen people are selected to become Archivists. You do not know who the other people are and you are all given your powers at the same time without the rest of the world knowing about it.

*Easy mode:* Turn off your ethical inhibitions. You are an amoral villain that wants to use this power to acquire as much wealth and influence as possible without ending up in jail or lynched by an angry mod. Keep in mind that there are 700 other people with the same powers as you, so sooner or later people are going to catch on to how things work. What do you do?

*Hard mode:* Turn your ethical inhibitions back on. You are a decent person who is kind of freaked out by the potential for abuse that these powers represent and only wants to use their powers if they can do so in an ethical manner. You want to limit the damage that other Archivists can cause while also maintaining a somewhat pleasant life for yourself and preferably improve the future of mankind. What do you do?
