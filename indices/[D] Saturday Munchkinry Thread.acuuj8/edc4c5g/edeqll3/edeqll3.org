Question : If you manage to convince an archivist to become an archive then what happens? Would he have increased storage and do you have access to all the skills of his archives?

Other question : Are there other powers in this world and do you have access to them if you turn a power-holder into an archive?

I feel like you'd be able to abuse it pretty easily. Competitive people are willing to risk A LOT for immediate benefits disregarding problems for later. Google "Goldman's dilemma" => More than half the athletes would accept something that guarantee success even if they died 5 years later. If you were to offer a deal like that to an Olympic athlete he would probably take it in a heartbeat. If you were to offer a country like Russia or China the opportunity to contract their athletes, you'd get one delivered to your doorstep every month. The ability for an already talented person to reproduce his best jump, his best time on the race, his best shot on the day of the competition would immediately earn him a gold medal compared with other non-archives athletes. As for intellectual fields, the memory to not overlook anything in their field of study is invaluable for a researcher. They would probably be more careful than athletes to contract but you'd find some pretty easily.

And that's with being very open about the drawbacks. You wouldn't even have to trick people into accepting.
