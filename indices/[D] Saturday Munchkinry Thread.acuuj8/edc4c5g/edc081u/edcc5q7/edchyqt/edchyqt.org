1.Visibly seeing as in with his own eye's, so yes that does mean he can manipulate water visible through translucent materials but not through camera's or microscopes.

1. Decently precise, as in he could probably use his power to grasp a pencil and write legibly with it. This however requires very intense concentration so he usually resorts to using broader moves.

2. He could conceivably move his water into situations where it's physical state could change but he can only control it within it's liquid state. It could be cold or hot but as long as it's liquid he can control it.

3. Yes it does conduct to a degree, as in all the water he controls becomes more like an extension of himself. However if he is blinded he is out for the count.

4. His acceleration depends on the amount he is controlling, in small amounts he could conceivably use it like a whip while at his maximum it is more like a wrecking ball. His absolute maximum velocity while controlling all the water he can would be around 100 mph which takes him about 3 minutes to reach in the open ocean.

5. The only materials completely resistant to his acid are glass and ceramics, but he does not know the full range of what it effects and to what degrees but he tests frequently.

6. Around 10x it's original mass

7. Varies depending upon the material in question, but usually it acts within seconds.(If you want a reference point, think of the xenomorphs blood).

8. The goo left behind will stay separated, for instance if you dropped a rubber ball in a small tube of this acid it will melt but when the acid returns to a water state the melted rubber will float to the top.

10- Leaving as in when he physically exits the body of water he is inhabiting. For instance if he jumped into a pool, turned all of it to acid, and then left it would take an hour to return to it's original state.

11- Yes.

12- Any water within a spherical 3m radius of himself.

13- His power is either on or off, he can only super heat water to explosive degrees. Despite his attempts at controlling his output.

14- Technically not all at once, it just propagates from his body incredibly fast.

15- Bodily fluid as in saliva, blood, mucus, etc...Just about any liquid the human body can create.

16- He does have precise control to a degree, in the water tank example he could theoretically heat any amount within his radius though he has to focus hard otherwise he'll just heat all of it.

1. Direct physical connection means skin on skin contact or water on skin contact. Steam will conduct his power as will ice, the explosive power drastically increases with ice but the inverse is true for steam. Nope, he must be in direct physical connection with the water for his power to work, which is why the only part of his body he usually leaves exposed is his hands.

-As for general costs, well all powers such as these are still physical abilities and can be strained to damaging degrees if someone doesn't have full control or knowledge of it, and even then someone with experience can slip up and injure themselves. This obviously varies based on the power in question but each have certain trade-offs and deeper implications. For instance someone with a quick regeneration power can only regenerate based on how much energy is stored in their body, once they run out their ability to regenerate ceases.
