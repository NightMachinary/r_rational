It's interesting that the shaper can see through glass or translucent plastic but not through a microscope, which is just a bunch of glass lenses. That's an inconsistency you should probably resolve. If he ends up being able to do it through a microscope then there's a ton of potential for abuse since he can build nanites.

​

​

1.  The shaper can form "wires" of water linking a target to himself or a teammate. This technique mostly negates the touch limitation. It's less effective if he can't make the wires super thin, but since it doesn't require the precision of handwriting it sounds like he can do it fairly easily.

2.  The heater can explode people. The transmuter can dissolve them. The shaper can rip them apart.

3.  The shaper can fly by enclosing himself in a hollow sphere of water linked to him with a wire. A sphere means he'll always see the water, so he won't accidentally fuck it up and fall to his death. He could also use the water as a defense against bullets etc, though ymmv since you said powers have limited resources available.

4.  The heater can vaporize nearby water to fill the area with steam and then conduct through that to reach stuff further away. It doesn't matter if the steam doesn't explode, it's just a conduit for his power. That brings up another question, how much steam does it take to conduct his power? What about water in the air? I'm guessing normally it wouldn't be enough, but during a storm where there's already lots of rain?

5.  The heater/shaper violates conservation of energy, which means he can produce infinite electricity. It's probably not very useful in a fight, but he needs a good reason to not be working in a power plant. A coal plant uses millions of tons per year, so even if he was being paid millions of dollars it would still be far cheaper to hire the heater than to buy coal. The transmuter can /probably/ find a way to abuse his power as well, but I don't know enough chemistry to give you specifics.

6.  The heater can start fires. Probably not very useful but might not be obvious since usually water = no fire.

7.  The biggest limitation to the trident is the water. The heater and transmuter are effectively destroying water, so in a prolonged fight they'll eventually run out of fuel. The shaper can bring large quantities of water with him to delay this (have it levitate above them so it stays out of the way). A well suited tactic would be hit and run style attacks. Bring in water, use it, then get out as supplies fall off to grab more. Alternatively, you can fight by underground water pipes/lakes/rivers/etc. Or during a storm.

8.  The shaper can destroy buildings by targeting the water pipes.

9.  The shaper can suffocate people.

10. The shaper should prepare for fights by making everything wet. This gives the team an ideal environment.

11. The shaper can pick locks, or the transmuter can just dissolve them. If the door uses a digital lock, then you can dissolve the physical bars that hold the door shut. Same idea for chains, shackles, etc.

12. The heater and transmuter can set up booby traps with a puddle of water wired back to them.

13. The transmuter can dispose of evidence by melting it.

14. The transmuter can fill glass/ceramic containers with acid and use them as grenades.

15. The shaper can bombard an enemy position with the transmuter's acid bombs, or anything else that's handy.

16. The heater can create fog to obscure a getaway. It wouldn't last for long though.

17. Steam trains. Not a literal train, but the method for turning water into force... though it probably wouldn't be very good here since the heater has to touch the initial water.

18. Use transmuted acid to melt a hole in the floor for a quick escape -- or set up a ring of water for a trap.

19. The shaper can clobber people with wire-linked water balls. He can also smash stuff, like cars, buildings, etc.

20. The shaper can accelerate himself and water to high speed. Tweak the angle of the water so it'll strike something while the shaper himself flies past safely and you've got a nasty weapon. Might not seem dangerous, but consider that if you're moving fast enough and hit the ocean, it'll feel like concrete. Terminal velocity for a skydiver is about 120mph, only slightly more than the shaper's max velocity. You can also combo this with the transmuter. Alternatively, you can do the same thing with rocks and dirt. Or, you can go for a good old rods from god and just levitate a big chunk of iron and drop it. This is different from #15 because the velocity involved is /much/ higher, but the precision is also worse. You'll have a lot of collateral damage with a kinetic strike.

21. Everyone should carry around water, in case they get separated from the shaper. Normal water bottles are pretty awkward, but there's flat flasks and such meant to be strapped to your body for easier use. They have less volume, but that's fine, if you're desperate a little water can go a long way.

22. Not a tactic, but acid usually reacts badly with water. It's a basic safety rule for chemists and if the transmuter is slinging around acid in a wet environment it's probably going to end badly.
