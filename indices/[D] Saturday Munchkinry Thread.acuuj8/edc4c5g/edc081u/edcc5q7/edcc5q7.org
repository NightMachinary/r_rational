So this seems pretty interesting but I need to know more specifics.

​

Shaper questions:

-What counts as "visibly seeing"? Can he work through glass? Translucent plastic? Through a microscope? What about a camera?

- How precise is his control? Could he move 1 gram of water 1 millimeter? How about 1 microgram 1 micron? Does this precision have any cost?

- You said he can't change the state of the water, but can he cool/heat it within that restriction? Or can he only move it?

- Does his power conduct, or does have to see all of the water he's controlling, at all times?

- How fast can he accelerate the water? If he uses velocity instead, what's the maximum velocity and how long does it take to get there?

​

Transmuter questions:

- You said the transmuter's acid will melt steel and flesh. What won't it melt? Real acids usually don't react with everything/./ For example, fluoroantimonic acid melts through glass but not teflon.

- How much matter can a given amount of transmuted acid dissolve?

- How fast does the transmuted acid work, exactly? Are we talking minutes or seconds?

- Does the transmuter's power conduct through contacting water, like the heater? If so, does it propagate, or will all of the water transmute at once?

- When you say "lingers", do you mean that the acid reverts to water? Suppose the acid melts something, producing a large amount of inert goo. What happens to the atoms that started out in the acid?

- What counts as leaving?

- Is the transmuter immune to his own acid?

​

Heater questions:

- You specified that the heater has an "area" of 3m. Do you mean he can heat any water within a 3m radius, or that he can heat a cone? If it's a cone, what angle? Does volume factor in at all?

- Does the heater heat all of the water at once, or does it propagate like a normal heat source?

- Can the heater control the amount of heating, or is his power either on or off? Can he make his shower water nice and warm or will it come out superheated no matter how hard he tries?

- What counts as a "bodily fluid"? If he puts water in his mouth and spits it out, will it be immune? How about if he swallows it? How long does it take to qualify?

- How much control does the heater have? If he has a tank of water, can he heat half of it but not the other half? What's the precision on his control, and does it have any additional costs?

- What counts as a "direct physical connection" for the heater? Will steam conduct his power? Ice? Can his power conduct through non-water substances, like through a layer of steel to heat water on the other side?

​

General questions:

- What costs are there to the powers? Can they use them forever without getting tired, having headaches, bloody noses, etc? Do they have to concentrate? Is there mana or other finite fuel?
