First things first: converting "prep time" into skill points. 3 days is 72 hours with no sleep or 24 with 8hrs per night. 1 moth is 256 hours 'night and weekends' or 360 'full time', and one year is 3328 hours night and weekends or 4380 full time. Since you can probably pull at least one all nighter but two is unwise I'm calling /3 days: 62 skill/ points. being generous I'm assuming two weeks vacation and the remainder night and weekends for /one month which is 296 skill points/. And for a /year I'm calling it an arbitrary 3000 skill points/ on the basis that a whole year is a long time to remain dedicated to one specific thing with no lapses in motivation or unavoidable complications. 10 years I think would be impractical to min/max as at that point you're going to have to spend most of your time living your regular life.

​

First observation:

​

3 days in insufficient to determine the skill cap, so you probably only get one main skill if you're trying to min/max. A month gets you up to 3 skills at expert level and pretty good confirmation about the cap. A year is enough to verify the cap, then devise a specific plan, max several skills and dabble in various other skills.

​

​

Second observation:

​

Without knowing what the world you're going to is like it's hard to value skills. If you level axes the find out this world is Star Wars like you'll feel stupid for not leveling guns or swords instead. If you level Chemistry but the world has alien space bats that don't like gunpowder who veto your skill well that will suck majorly. Especially if you got 3 days and that as the skill you focused on.

​

​

Third observation:

​

It may be possible to determine some things about the world based on what skills you get. For example whether the skill you get when working with basic lab procedures and equipment is called "Chemistry" or "Alchemy" will imply some things about what you might want to focus on.

​

​

Personal Strategy:

​

I'd pick two skills that I want to focus on initially. One will be "safe" (unlikely to be lost, likely to be valuable in any world) and the otehr "high risk" (chosen assuming best case scenario on its potential utility). I'll then try to level them as equally as I can until I reach the skill cap. Then I'll take stock of what if any skills i've picked up be accident along the way (I expect Cooking will slip in from preparing food for example) and either increase the ones I like the sound of, or formulate a new plan based on anything I notice about the names.

​

I think my initial skill pics would be something related to languages for the 'safe' skill. As I expect the world I currently inhabit to be pretty high up on quality of resources for learning about language and related topics like cryptography in general, and it's hard to make talking to people not a valuable skill. The main thing to worry about is getting stuck with specific languages that may not exist on the otehr world, but I expect I can abort if my first several attempts end up with "+1 level Chinese, +1 level ancient Myan, +1 level 1337" instead of something more like "+1 level Speak languages, +1 level decipher script, etc.". And for my High risk skill "SCIENCE!" (ideally including the caps and the exclamation point), But the specifics will depend on what feedback I get as I begin getting level ups.

​

​

I wouldn't bother with anything combat, wilderness survival, etc. focused unless I have a year or more as they're too dependent on what the world I end up on is like, and anything I can do in a month is going to be chump stuff compared to what somone who's been leveling their whole life can manage and "the graveyards are full of middleng swordsmen, better to be no swordsman at all than a middling one".
