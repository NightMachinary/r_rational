A bit late to post but I would get lots of mind related skills like memory palace, lucid dreaming, poly-plastic sleep, speed reading, memorization, comprehension etc After that if there is still time some martial arts at average level would do wonders for survivalist in a world where people rely on si-fi/magic. Probably some levels in wilderness survival too.
