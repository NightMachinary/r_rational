I disagree about Alchemy vs Chemistry. That magic exists to be included in ingredients is significant knowledge that I was not otherwise given by the system. However more importantly that was an example. The core principle is that if I can catch the system interpreting a general action as training for a specific thing I can extrapolate that the specific thing is the main use of the general activity in this world. That can give me information about the new world the system is otehrwise not providing.

​

Some otehr examples:

If meditating gets me: "Force use" I may promote "swords" on my priority list as my estimate of the likelihood that this world has Jedi increases as I didn't instead get "Manna manipulation", "Occultism", "Mysticism", "Meditation", "Focus ki", etc.

​

If studding Physics gets me: "SCIENCE!" rather than "Physics", or "Mechanics", or "Motion" I would conclude the world I'm going to doesn't have a well developed scientific tradition. I'd also be included to suspect from the capitalization that it's going to become increasingly "mad science" as I level it.

​

If studying dragons gets me: "Beast Tamer" Well that's a jackpot of knowledge. I've established that monsters likely exist, that they can be tamed, and that I can level it by studying fictional creatures in this world.

​

In my specific strategy in particular the plan for the languages skill relys on this as I'm aiming for a skillset that lets me Daniel Jackson my way around problems and I'll need to adapt my study methods in response to what i actually get, possibly abandoning the skill in favor of something safer.

Making a passable Ax out of stone isn't particularly easy. You'd at least need some practice at stone knapping, which would then be something of a dead end skill unless you're going to a stone age world.
