Ok, Iskeia (from another world) novels. Their is a system but it gives you a clearly defined amount of time to prepare yourself for transport to this world. I have been thinking about 3 days, but I would also like to see how much things change when you have 1 month, 1 year or 10 years to prepare.

You have no idea what type of world this will be, what setting or even what you would be able to keep if anything. Magic may or may not be real.

What you do know is that the system works for you right now. It allows you to Skill Up in multiple disciplinarians.

Skill Ups do the full,"flood your mind with extra information after you level" the relevant Skill. At least to start you do not know how the system works. It could end with all skills at 10 or go to 100, or even infinite. It is 100 though, just that your person does not know that so you will have to test that in a somewhat efficient way.

Skills can basically be anything. You do not retroactively get skills from your previous learning.

Compound Bows 100 just means you are really good at knowing where it will land. It is not a magical sense of knowing where it will land just a good idea. Bow 100 does not know how to shoot multiple arrows at once.That would be a separate skill Multiple Shot #.

You can not learn magic on this Earth. You still do not know if magic exists on the other world either. So no learning Elemental Arrow # or Heraculun Strength #. This is another thing you do not know because the System does not tell you.

The best archer throughout history would probably have bows 90-95 on a good day. Most likely said archer's ability would fluctuate to lower 70's to mid 80's.

With the system (again something that is not explicitly told to you) you do not have this problem. You will always shoot at Bow 100 when you have the skill at 100.

A subsequent skill could be heavy/variant winds arrow skill #. Also Bow Mastery # would not be a damage boost with bows but instead the speed that it takes you to learn a new bow.

Skills level up consistently. 1 hour = Skill Up. This is no matter the level. 99 -> 100 and 0 -> 1 are both 1 hour. This gets a little tricky in leveling up in things like dodge where you would not be dodging for a full hour instead you would be thinking about dodging for a full hour.

If you were practicing swords (or my choice Axe) then while practicing you would just dodge while swinging your weapon. It does not make you take 2 hours to learn both Dodge # and Swing #. It still takes 1 hour.

So how would you munchkin your time for 3 days 1 month 1 year or 10 years?
