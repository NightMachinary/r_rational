My thoughts about the ax (and yes you would need stone knapping) is that If you do not appear naked and thus keep your metal ax then you can keep using that skill. If you do appear naked then you have an immediate goal to make a stone ax and have a weapon.

If you appear in your doppelganger body with a flood of new information from your past/side self then you could drop ax and just never use it.

on your other points it is a good idea to test the new world IF that is how the system works. It could work by giving you skills based on how you understand them and thus you would only have Earth/English based skills like meditation and chemistry. where you would only otherwise unlock alchemy and manna manipulation once you arrive at the world with magic.

I say this because the only real inference you can make when you get the system is that it is an uber-powerful pseudo (maybe) all knowing system that may be either a magic god or a super tech AI.

If the system is smart enough to know how to systematize all forms of knowledge (like most of these systems in these books) It is probably smart enough to separate meditation from manna rotation.

I am not trying to say that this is not a good test to do, what I am trying to say is that I do not know why the system would be intelligent/powerful enough to reach earth and speak in English but not separate muggle science (chemistry) from wizard magic (alchemy).

I always think of these Isekiea systems novels with no separation between chemistry and alchemy have a major plot hole when it comes from a system that is at least partially aware of the MCs home-world.
