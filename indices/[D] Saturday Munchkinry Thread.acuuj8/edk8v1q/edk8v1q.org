Not sure if this is late enough to get buried, but wanted to write it up before I forget. This "power" is from [[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/zhang_12_18/][/Master Zhao: The Tale of an Ordinary Time Traveler/]], a great story I found on the Clarkesworld podcast. You can read or listen to it at that link. It's pretty long, but well worth the read. This post obviously has some spoilers for the story, but I'll do my best to keep it to mechanics to preserve the plot.

You have the ability to live through projected versions of the future. At various points in your life, you diverge from "primary" reality and begin living in an alternate timeline. The alter ends when you die or when certain irreversible choices are made, at which point you are returned to a point soon after--not simultaneous with--the moment you split off.

Three caveats make this less of a blessing than a curse. (The third is a heavy spoiler, so read the story first!)

One: you have no way of telling that you have split off into an alter until you return to the main timeline. Generally big choices spur a change, but there is no indication of divergence until you are deposited back in the primary, all memories of your alternate life intact.

Two: the longer you spend in an alter, the bigger the gap between divergence and return. If you spend 3 days on a split timeline, you might return a minute after you left; 20 years on an alter deposits you 3 weeks after the divergence. Nobody notices any difference in your behavior during that "empty" time, and you have no idea who--if anyone--is piloting you through the gap.

Three: As time goes on, the magnitude of choice that forces a split gets smaller and smaller: at first it's "do I save my son or my daughter," then "do I move to Virginia or New Hampshire," then "do I take the promotion or the bigger raise," then "do I buy the grey shirt or the blue shirt," then "do I get up at 8am or sleep for 5 more minutes." After a few decades of living with this ability, each day in the primary timeline takes subjective years or decades to get through, spinning off dozens or hundreds of alters. Caveat Two is mitigated by experience: the amount of "empty" time per second of alter decreases with use, until you can live years in an alter and come back seconds after you left. Master Zhao refers to himself as "Zeno's time traveler."

How would you go about making this power as useful as possible? Obviously memorizing a daily or weekly list of stock trends and lottery numbers would lend itself to getting rich quick, but beyond that, what do you do to maximize your own CEV (and if you're a big-time altruist, the world's CEV)? More immediately, what do you do to make sure that Caveat Three doesn't drive you insane?
