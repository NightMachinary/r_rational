Suppose a homeless poor person got the power of cleaning and repairing things. It works within 2 metres of the person, it cannot repair things that have more than 1/4 of the parts missing (unless they have extras or materials out of which extras could be made). Cleaning and repairing is intuitive - you do not need to know how to repair a thing to repair it, and also you need to consider yourself to be repairing or cleaning something while you do it, because if you think you're breaking the object or dirtying it or making it worse in general, the power won't do anything. Cleaning can vanish bits of anything that is "dirt" or "dust" or "trash" in the same intuitive way and as mentioned repairing can fill in up to a quarter of missing parts of an object, by volume or mass whichever is biggest.

How might they exploit that to 1) get themselves a better life 2) improve the world?

Edit: if a part of an object is a different material than the rest of an object (ex: screws in a device, gemstone eyes, etc) the power can only try to 'summon back' the eyes or screw, not generate a new one. Also, yes, this is defining "objects" to be things that are commonly considered single objects instead of random stuff taped together.
