Goal 1 is actually really easy. People throw away broken things all the time, including expensive things like TVs and computers. If you can fix them back into perfect condition, you can sell them for money.

In some cities, its even easier since all the trash is collected and dumped in one area. For normal people, it's nothing but a dump, but with this repair ability, every trash dump is now an ore mine.
