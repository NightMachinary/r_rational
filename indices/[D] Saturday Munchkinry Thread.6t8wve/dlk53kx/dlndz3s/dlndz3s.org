(1): Put up a sign that says "sTuf FixeD cHeep". Wait for someone to produce some stuff to get fixed. Repair it, get paid. Rinse and repeat (and /especially/ repeat once word-of-mouth really gets going)

(2): Once you have enough, get a better sign and a more visible location.

(3): Before long, it should be possible to rent a small shop and get an actually professional sign. (At this point, drop the word "cheap" and just say "Repairs"). Maintain relations with previous clients, of course.

(Note that this all assumes that 'things' only refers to non-living things. If 'things' includes people, then get a job in a hospital and work up from there.)
