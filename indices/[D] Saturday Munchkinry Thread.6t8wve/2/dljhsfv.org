My uncle is starting a new D&D campaign and in his world there are no explosions. Like literally if anything would explode instead it either fails to ignite or burns slowly instead. The only exception is certain magical spells which can channel explosions.

Anyone know how badly that would break physics or if anything is exploitable as a result of that?

Edit: I talked to him some more and he explained the mechanic by which this takes place. Any time something would explode, the energy generated by that explosion is siphoned off by an unknown powerful god-like being. That same being supplies all of the energy to power all magic and mana in the world.
