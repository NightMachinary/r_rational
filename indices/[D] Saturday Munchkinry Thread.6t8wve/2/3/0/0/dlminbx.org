Well, congratulations. If you can find a way to stuff energy into a space faster than the maximum rate cap, you can store infinite energy in very little space and create a battery that lasts an arbitrary amount of time. If the thing about "no explosions" is true, you can do that with something as simple as a pump and a glass bottle, or a windup spring and ratchet. Or a steam boiler... This a world where steampunk is viable, is what I'm saying. You can store as much high pressure steam as you want, and ruptures, boiling dry, whatever, will never cause them to explode. Gently crack, maybe. But that's much easier to fix.

On the other hand, maybe doing that just results in the relevant mass/energy just... Vanishing.

In which case, less useful, but you can still use it. You can easily dispose of anything you can put under pressure, just by jamming enough of it into a small enough space that it starts to disappear.

That breaks geology, though, because you lose a lot of planet very quickly if mass above a certain pressure limit starts disappearing until it's no longer pressurized.

Wait, do bows and crossbows not work here? Because they involve very quickly releasing a lot of pent-up energy.
