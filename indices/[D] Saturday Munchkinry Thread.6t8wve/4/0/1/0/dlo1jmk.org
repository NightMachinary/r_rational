It's not that simple, unfortunately. Checking horse races and lotteries alone would only be weak evidence for or against Determinism, since those events would almost certainly be within your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone][light cone]].

To ensure that your actions truly have no effect on the random event, the random event must occur outside your light cone. What this means is that the event must occur either really early in the time loop (within less than a second of the loop start), or really far away (not on Earth).

The easiest way I can think of to perform this experiment is to look at the sun (with tools of course). Light takes 8 minutes to reach the Earth from the Sun, and vice versa. That means that for the first 8 minutes of the time loop, any light from the Sun was already emitted before the time loop began, and should be exactly the same. But for the next 8 minutes, any light from the Sun has absolutely not been affected by your actions here on Earth, and is emitted after the start of the time loop. So look for any kind of random event on the Sun, like a solar flare or a sunspot. If determinism is true, then those random events must always occur in the exact same pattern in those 8 minutes. So if you see any difference, you disprove determinism.

(Proving determinism is harder, since you must also prove that the random events you observe are truly random, and not determined by events before the time loop.)
