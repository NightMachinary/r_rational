Hmmmm.

I'll only need to know when the time loop actually begins if I find that the data differs between loops in some way.

There's another factor to consider. There are two sorts of randomness; there is true randomness, which may or may not exist, and there is what I will refer to as computational randomness.

To illustrate the difference, let us assume that Bob is busy tossing a coin as the time loop begins. In fact, the time loop starts with Bob's coin in mid-air, spinning. The coin bounces off Bob's beermug, spins across the bar counter on its side, ricochets off a bowl of peanuts, rolls off the bar, bounces on the floor a few times, and eventually lands up Heads. Now, an observer at the instant of the start of the time loop (without any information from previous loops) cannot predict which side up the coin will land. But this is not because it's in principle unknowable. In principle, with perfect knowledge of the momentum and kinetic energy of the coin (including the rotation thereof), the exact shape and size of every obstacle, Newtonian mechanics, and a lot of paper to do the calculations on, the result of Bob's coinflip /should/ be predictable, in theory. Practically, it's not, because a lot of those factors are - practically - impossible to measure. So, Bob's coinflip is computationally random - that is to say, I can't predict it because I cannot find the data required to state with any certainty which way up it will land without abusing the time loop - but it's not /truly/ random.

Radioactive decay, on the other hand, and to the best of my knowledge, really /is/ random. Sunspots... I don't know, but I suspect that the internal mechanisms that cause sunspots are set in motion well before the actual sunspot itself appears (much as Bob's coin, flying through the air at the start of the loop already has, encoded in its position-momentum-energy data and the positions of all the obstacles it hits, the result of 'heads').
