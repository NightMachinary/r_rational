  Hmmm. That means you have to be awake at the start of the time loop.

You could ask someone instead of doing it yourself. Even if there are no other loopers, there are already plenty of non-looping people who watch the sun for sunspots, for some reason. Track them down, and ask for their data.

You will need to figure out when the time loop actually begins though.
