Well, if you are in a time loop, one of the things you could possibly check is whether determinism is true. I.e., whether fate is real, or whether free will is an illusion.

To do so, you need to check the outcome of a "random" event, exactly replicated each day, down to the exact moment in time. This will not be as easy as it sounds. You cannot, for instance, simply flip a coin or roll a dice, since it's pretty much impossible for you to give the coin or dice exactly the same amount and direction of force as you do each day.

You cannot, for instance, ask a non-looping accomplice to flip the coin or roll the dice, since the way you ask them could have microscopic differences that ultimately affect the amount and direction of force applied to the coin/dice.

The biggest problem here with exactly replicating the experimental setup is the fact that you are not replicated exactly at the start of each loop. You keep your memories, so your behavior will have microscopic differences. Differences that may perpetuate and snowball away from you at the speed of light, in a butterfly effect that influences all random events in a light cone around you starting from the beginning of each loop.

So what you need to do is to actually go around, searching for random events that occur outside your light cone, but within the loop itself. If determinism is true, such random events would always have the same outcome, since their setups would be replicated exactly to perfection. For example, if at the start of each loop, someone extremely far away from you rolls a dice, that dice should always land on the same face, if determinism is true. So if you see any random event outside your light cone that has a different outcome, you would know that determinism is false. (Or that there's another looper.)

Ultimately, whether determinism is true is not very important, but it still seems worth checking, especially since a time loop is quite literally the only chance you will get to check.
