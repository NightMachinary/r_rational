If someone is trapped in a time loop, are there any scientific experiments they can do that would benefit from an /exactly/ replicated setup each day, down to the millisecond? I feel like there ought to be useful experiments that might not normally be possible due to chaotic initial conditions, but I can't think of any plausible candidates. (Other than social interaction and other standard trial and error munchkinries, but that's not what I'm talking about.)
