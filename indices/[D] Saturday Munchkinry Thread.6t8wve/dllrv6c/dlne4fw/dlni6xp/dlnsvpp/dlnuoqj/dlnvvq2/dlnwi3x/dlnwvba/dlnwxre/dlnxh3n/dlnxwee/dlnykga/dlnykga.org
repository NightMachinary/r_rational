Hmmmm... I'm more comfortable in special than general relativity. I do know that, given the case of a photon clock in special relativity, there's a longer time in the bounces but the clock is not stretched.

Consider a vertical clock, with the photon bouncing straight up and down. Now, consider the same clock, but moving to the right (i.e. at right angles to the direction of photon movement, so that the length of the clock is not compressed)

Then the observer moving with the clock sees the light moving straight up and down. But you see the light moving in a zigzag, like so:

#+begin_example
     /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
#+end_example

So that, while the height of the clock is unchanged, the light nonetheless takes a longer path between ticks.

Now, if I /accelerate/ the clock, that should be similar, except the zigzag gets wider as I go.

...apparently gravity is equivalent to acceleration. I'm not quite sure how that translates in this case, though.
