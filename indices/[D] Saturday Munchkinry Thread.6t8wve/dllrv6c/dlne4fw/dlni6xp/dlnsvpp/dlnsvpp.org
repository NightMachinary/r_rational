That's reasonable; however, as I do not know enough of cutting-edge theoretical physics to produce an even plausibly wrong answer to that question, I don't really think I can produce any sort of escape plan.

Unless you're immortal and can wait for the shell to burn itself out with Hawking radiation, I guess.

  you'd have a chunk of space time that is effectively separated from everything around it by an infinite distance (from the pov of light trying to pass between)

Point of order; light can go /into/ a black hole just fine. It just can't get /out/ again.

  but any space time is flat locally except for a singularity

Point of order, again - in a gravitational reference frame, spacetime /curves/. Such spacetime can only be considered 'completely flat' in the limiting case of a single point (though it can of course be considered approximately flat for most purposes over a very small area).
