Depending on your definition of explosion, you could get around a few engineering hurdles. Most bombs would turn into directed energy weapons instead.

Imagine a nuke in this world. Obviously, if we detonated it, there would be no explosion. But what if we opened a small hole on it? All that energy is being forced out that hole at a rate proportional to its size. Now you've got a safe-ish radiation/heat gun powered by a nuke.

I'm not all that well versed in D&D spells, but my first idea is to polymorph a fire elemental into an ant and put said ant into a metal box with a hole on one end. When the polymorph ends, the elemental is now inside the tiny box (which cannot be exploded out of) with the fire being forced out the hole.
