Velocity is distance over time. A photon clock makes a photon cover a certain distance (for example bouncing between two plates 1 m apart). To count the passage of time, the photon clock counts the amount of bounces.

If the clock closes in on a black hole, time slows down according to a distant observer; he sees the clock as ticking slower. Therefore it takes the photon a longer time between bounces (again, for the distant observer. An observer at the same position as the clock doesn't notice anything different).

Since the speed of light must be constant in all frames, the distant observer must conclude that since the time between bounces has increased, the photon must have been covering a greater distance to require that much time. Therefore coming to the conclusion that the clock was "stretched" and the photon has covered a greater distance.

If this wasn't the case, and we still measured a slowed down bounce rate, we would measure a different speed of light.
