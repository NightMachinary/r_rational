The /photon/ covers a greater distance, but the length of the /photon clock/ is unchanged. Now, gravity is supposed to be equivalent to acceleration, which implies that the length of the photon clock should remain unchanged to the distant observer (as long as it's at right angles to the direction of gravity).

I /think/ this might mean that, to a distant observer, gravity messes with the observed speed of light.
