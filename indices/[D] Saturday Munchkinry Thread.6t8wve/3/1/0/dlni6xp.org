This is mostly a thought experiment, so I'd accept answers involving purely theoretical concepts like exotic matter. It's entirely possible that the structure I proposed cannot exist in a stable form at all for longer than it takes the shell to collapse inwards, but if it could (maybe through having it consist of charged particles) you'd have a chunk of space time that is effectively separated from everything around it by an infinite distance (from the pov of light trying to pass between) and yet I think there's a chance to access it if we permit wormhole formation to change the geometry of the underlying space time. So you'd have a structure with exactly one exit controlled by ONLY you.

The one thing I am completely uncertain about is how time would pass there. The space time is completely flat, but any space time is flat locally except for a singularity, so it's possible that you'd still have extreme time dilation, making it a time prison as well.
