Turn sneezes into dog whistles.

Attend press conferences and speeches for a few months and make politicians sneeze at random intervals.

Then, go and write a code book explaining that, when a politician sneezes after word 'X' they're saying 'Y'

Since you're writing the book retroactively, you can make it sound like politicians were talking about future events.

Next, go to a journalist, give them the code book (+throw an encrypted copy on a torrent somewhere). As proof, make a prediction that politician will sneeze 3 times after the first question in their next press conference.

You'll look like a loon, right up until your prediction comes true.

And politicians sneezes really do spell out a coherent discussion about a plan to complete (whatever conspiracy you invented) in the next several months.

News story breaks. Your torrent confirms that you predicted everything in advance. Politicians of choice are discredited, and you've "proven" that a conspiracy exists.
