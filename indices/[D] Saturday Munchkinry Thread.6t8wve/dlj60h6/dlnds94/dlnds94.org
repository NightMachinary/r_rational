  Your goal is to kill a high-ranking government official (pick and choose) without getting caught. The less attention you draw to yourself, the better. Mucho brownie points go to the person who can do this without relying on other people.

...pick one of Robert Mugabe's subordinates as the target. (Or anyone who's not /quite/ the big shot under a ruthless leader who wants to stay in power). Send Mugabe (or the ruthless leader, if a different ruthless leader is chosen) a series of anonymous emails describing a conspiracy to unseat him. Phrase it in such a way that sneezes in public speeches at certain points are being used by the conspirators to hide their communication. Also phrase it in such a way that the desired target for death is an important figure in said conspiracy.

Use the sneeze power to provide apparent corroboration of the insane conspiracy theory.

Wait for Mugabe's paranoia to make him snap (snap further?).
