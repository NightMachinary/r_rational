Well, one issue with just betting is getting the timing right. In a sport like boxing, who's to say the other boxer will recognize when to fully capitalize on the sneeze attack? With football or golf, by the time you know the game depends on one pass or one final hole, it's far too late to place a big bet. An Olympic race might work, but people would be very suspicious if all but one racer suffered from sneezing (probably not suspicious of magic powers, but suspicious that the winning racer somehow cheated, or that the track conditions were bad enough to consider nullifying the results).

Claiming the Randi prize would work, although that's also true of almost literally any supernatural power, and not really unique to this one. I also like the FTL point - even if the sneezes lose effectiveness and are just instances of mild nasal irritation, you could still use that as a type of morse code to communicate over vast interplanetary distances.

EDIT: Erp, just saw that OP specified the power works at the speed of light. Guess that last one's out.
