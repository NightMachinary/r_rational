I assume the power won't work in this case; it's actually an apparent oversight on [[/u/aerocarbon][u/aerocarbon]]'s side, not clarifying how it would work in relation to dead and effectively dead people. Unless... Uh-oh. "Cannot be prevented or mitigated by any kind of procedure"? So it can't even be prevented by /killing/ the target?

... Holy hell, that's brilliant. You could teach an accomplice Morse code, then kill yourself. If the accomplice doesn't start sneezing, the world knows there's no afterlife; if there is, you transmit info on it to the still-living using sneezes.

That's the most useful way of utilizing this power that I could think of.
