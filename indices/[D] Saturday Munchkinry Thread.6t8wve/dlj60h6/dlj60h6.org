*You inexplicably gain the power to make anybody sneeze by thinking of them*.

Your goal is to kill a high-ranking government official (pick and choose) without getting caught. The less attention you draw to yourself, the better. Mucho brownie points go to the person who can do this without relying on other people.

I've been racking my pea-sized brain for a while now and I can't think of any way that I'd be able to kill anyone, much less a government official, with such a shit power. I'm hoping [[/r/rational]] will have better luck.

- "Them" in this case means knowledge of their given name (first + last) and their current face, to eliminate ambiguity. Think Death Note rules.
- If you are unable to fulfil the criteria (e.g. the name you have isn't actually their given name, the picture you have is out of date) then the sneeze is not affected.
- You do not need line of sight to make somebody sneeze. So as long as you have their name + face, you can make them sneeze.
- This power works at the speed of thought.
- You can make groups of people sneeze so as long as you can keep all of their faces and names in your head as you do so.
- There is no limit to the number of times that you can make any one person sneeze, nor is there a limit on how many people you can make sneeze a day.
- I'm not sure if you can meaningfully quantify the intensity of a sneeze, but the first one you affect is of, uh, /average/ intensity, whatever that might be.
- The more sneezes you affect on the same person, the lesser the effect becomes - eventually diminishing to the point where a "sneeze" you affect would be little more than a few seconds worth of an itchy nose. Let's call it a threshold of ten sneezes until an affected sneeze cannot be considered a sneeze any more.
- You cannot affect more than one sneeze on one person at a time. You can, however, affect a sneeze on somebody immediately after they finish sneezing. (So, no, you cannot affect a Graham's number of sneezes every second for the rest of their lives until they get so irritated that they kill themselves -- this would be too easy, haha.)
- The sneezes you affect are magical.

  - Magical in the sense that these sneezes just 'happen.' Your brain magically sends a magical signal to your target's brain, and tells the brain to sneeze.
  - These sneezes cannot be prevented or mitigated by any kind of medication or procedure. e.g. the full-on physical removal of someone's nose and affecting a sneeze on them will result in them suffering from a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_pain][phantom sneeze]]."

Alternatively, I'd happily take run-of-the-mill munchkinry (improve quality of life, get the girl, rob a bank, become an iron-fisted tyrant, enact planetary genocide, etc.) if you can't kill anybody with this power.

Also: semantic satiation is a great thing. Sneeze doesn't even sound like a word anymore.

* CLARIFICATIONS:

  :END:

- As long as your target is not dead (i.e. complete cessation of all bodily function) they will sneeze.

- If your target is "effectively dead" (e.g. in a coma, brain dead, cryogenically frozen, etc.) then they will still sneeze. What a sneeze would be like to someone suffering from brain death is beyond me, but they'll still sneeze.

- The "sneeze signal" travels at the speed of light. (i.e. you would not be able to affect FTL communication with this power, although I will admit that sneeze-based superluminal communication sounds absolutely /hilarious/)

- Past ten sneezes, the itchiness of the nose of the person affected remains noticeable (i.e. you can tell the difference between the itchiness and a natural slight nose itch) up to twenty sneezes in total.

- Any further sneezes affected on the same person will result in a "sneeze" that is virtually imperceptible or indistinguishable from a natural slight itch.
