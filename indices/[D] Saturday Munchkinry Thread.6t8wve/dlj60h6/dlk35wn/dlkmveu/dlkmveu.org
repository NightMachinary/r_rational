Hm. I am honestly not sure, and I have no idea how to answer this question. I don't believe I specified a speed for the "sneeze signal" to travel at.

'Speed of thought' referred to your ability to use the power being limited to how fast you could possibly think of name + face pairs.

I suppose the answer would be completely arbitrary, then. Let's err on the side of reality (insofar as sneeze-o-kinesis could be considered 'real' anyways) and say that the "sneeze signal" travels at /c/.

I've edited the OP to clarify, thanks for the answer!
