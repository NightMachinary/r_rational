I know this is kind of late but I can't believe no one has already brought up the way sneezing already kills people: spreading diseases. Go about strategically spreading a sneeze-transmissible deadly disease into the population by having people infected with e.g. SARS sneeze on someone who sneezes on someone etc. eventually leading to a government official who is particularly old and has a weak immune system. Maybe Queen Elizabeth would be a good target? You'd have to do a lot of facebook stalking to find the right path of connected people to reach someone though, which risks discovery. Alternatively just make a few infected people sneeze enough that the disease spreads and causes a pandemic and kills someone important in the government along with a few thousand other people.
