  How itchy is the nose?
#+end_quote

I'll admit that I spent the longest time thinking about this question because I have no clue how to answer this.

I don't really know if it's possible to quantify "itchiness" outside of completely arbitrary labels like 'really' or 'not at all.'

I'd say that the itchiness would be comparable to that feeling your nose gets when you /think/ you've got a colossal, world-shattering sneeze lined up and it just dissipates for no apparent reason. Hopefully you've experienced this feeling before, otherwise it'd be hard to imagine.

Let's slap an arbitrary label on this and say that the eleventh 'sneeze' affected would turn into a "very itchy nose." (In comparison, the tenth sneeze would be a tiny and involuntary snuffle, hardly enough to be considered a sneeze on its own.)

Further sneezes affected, however, would have this feeling diminish further and further. For example, the twelfth sneeze would be just a "regular" itchy, and the thirteenth sneeze would be a "kind of" itchy.

  Is it noticeable enough to be usable for communication?

Up to a certain point, yes. If you want a hard number, let's say that the itchiness is noticeable up to twenty total sneezes. Any sneezes affected after that still have an effect, per se, but at this point the itchiness will have diminished so much that they would either be completely indistinguishable from natural slight nose itches or virtually imperceptible.

--------------

You can simplify this to:

- Past ten sneezes, the itchiness of the nose of the person affected remains noticeable (i.e. you can tell the difference between the itchiness and a natural slight nose itch) up to twenty sneezes in total.

- Any further sneezes affected on the same person will result in a "sneeze" that is virtually imperceptible or indistinguishable from a natural slight itch.

I've edited the OP to clarify. Thanks for the question!
