Oops, I didn't consider the wider implications. That's a great idea.

It would be rather useful for bonus challenges as well: once established as a supernatural entity, you would acquire a great deal of influence, not only on your followers but on the other random people as well. You could openly speak your mind through "chosen" people, pushing for spending resources towards the fields you consider beneficial, and threaten politicians in secret --- the possibilities for psychological warfare here are /endless/, if you're willing to abuse people's religious beliefs and order assassinations. Once you have followers or blackmailees in high-ranking government or military positions, you could start playing up the "omniscient" card, and people's irrationality would do the rest of the work on its own.

Robbing banks, starting riots and then wars is trivially easy; ordering a nuclear war/enacting an omnicide would be trickier, but if you manage to convince your government that your existence is an enemy action, or a foreign government that you're going to expand to them if they don't take drastic actions, that's doable as well. It's probably entirely possible to take over the world in a century with this. (Getting the girl is left as an exercise to the reader.)

Damn, there's a potential for a great story here.
