This is terribly broken, you can summon an infinite amount of anything by:

1) Build a compound object by taping/gluing together four/five objects.

2) Break it by removing one object.

3) Repair it using the power.

4) Repeat

Even if we disallow this by defining "objects" to be things that are commonly considered single objects instead of four supercomputers taped together, you can still summon an infinite amount of raw materials by making something like a chair made of X material and then repeatedly breaking off chunks of it.

Rather than point out the ways this could be used to benefit yourself and humanity by reducing shortages of literally everything, I would suggest you alter the power such that "repairing" an object only rearranges existing material into a "fixed" shape, not creating new stuff. Either by having a supply of extra material at hand, or by reorganizing the existing material effectively making it thinner to compensate.
