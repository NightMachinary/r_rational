Just static electric fields are insufficient to contain charged particles, as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation][Poisson's equation]] doesn't allow for any local minima, which you need in order to make a static trap. You can however, use a combination of magnetic fields to confine the particle in two dimensions, with an electric field to confine the particle in the third. These exist, and are known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penning_trap][Penning traps]].

The rocket fuel idea is rather nice, since it lets you get away from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation][Rocket Equation]], allowing for much, much easier space exploration.
