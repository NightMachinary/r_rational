How quickly does he do it, and what counts as an object that can be repaired? Build an idol with gemstone eyes. Flick out the gemstone, repair, repeat.

By teaming up with scientists, you can conjure fabled experimental materials! For example, have them build a container for antimatter (a constant negative static charge around a sphere of vacuum should keep antiprotons in its middle, as a first idea), construct an object around it that's four times as heavy in total, and insert a single elementary particle of antimatter into the container, for that's the scale we can currently synthesize. Remove the container, repair, remove the container, combine the two container's contents, insert the container, repeat. Free energy, light rocket fuel, easy doomsday device.

Other things to conjure: Supercomputers, people (designate five parts of the body, chop each off with repairing after each chop, repair the 5 parts into a whole), and everything consumable from food to ammunition for self-sufficiency.
