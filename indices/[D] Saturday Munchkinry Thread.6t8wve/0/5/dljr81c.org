Huh. A sneeze note.

You might be able to kill with a single well-timed sneeze just by making someone sneeze while they are eating. Or swimming.

  These sneezes cannot be prevented or mitigated by any kind of medication or procedure. e.g. the full-on physical removal of someone's nose and affecting a sneeze on them will result in them suffering from a "phantom sneeze."

What if you make someone sneeze while they are in a coma, does that wake them up? What about full-body paralysis? Brain death? Diseases that weaken the muscles needed for sneezing? Would your sneeze note cure them in order to make them sneeze?
