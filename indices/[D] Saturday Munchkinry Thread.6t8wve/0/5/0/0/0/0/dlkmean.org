Ha, this put a smile on my face. Post-mortem communication via sneeze-o-kinesis. According to what the rules say, that /should/ work. Brownie points for taking the sneeze note in such a creative direction!

  how it would work in relation to dead and effectively dead people
#+end_quote

I googled it and apparently [[http://www.answers.com/Q/Do_people_sneeze_if_they_are_dead][dead people /can't/ sneeze]]. What a world. (forgive the poor source, but it's difficult to find academic discussion on "can dead people sneeze?") So with regards to affecting the power on someone dead, it simply wouldn't happen.

For someone effectively dead (brain dead, in a coma, cryostasis, what have you) I'd direct you to [[https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-a-person-sneeze-when-in-a-coma][this]] Quora question (again, forgive the poor source but there isn't exactly a lot of literature on this topic.)

Quora tells me that you wouldn't be able to sneeze while in a coma (I think? The other answer seems to conflict, but I'll go with the one that makes more sense to me) ... but the rules /do/ say that the sneeze can't be prevented or mitigated by any sort of medication or procedure, so I suppose that the sneeze would still happen, regardless of the target's current physiological state.

It's sneezeforce. I ain't gotta explain shit.

--------------

You then can simplify this to:

- As long as your target is not dead (i.e. complete cessation of all bodily function) they will sneeze.

- If your target is "effectively dead" (e.g. in a coma, brain dead, cryogenically frozen, etc.) then they will still sneeze. What a sneeze would be like to someone suffering from brain death is beyond me, but they'll still sneeze.

I've edited OP with the clarification. Thanks for the answer!
