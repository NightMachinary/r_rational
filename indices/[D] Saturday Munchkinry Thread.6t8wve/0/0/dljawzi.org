Well you basically have the power to partially incapacitate someone for 10 sneezes of time. Let's say 8 seconds.

Perhaps you could try affecting a surgeon while operating on some official. However, people already sneeze regularly so I doubt it'd do much other than make them lay down their tools for 8 seconds. Same goes for pilots, construction workers, etc.

However, this power might be useful in helping out a mundane assassination. Make every bodyguard for the person sneeze for 8 seconds, murder them with regular methods, hope you don't get caught afterwards.
