Yea, like you said, I would mentally abstract this power out as "completely distract known individuals for up to 10 seconds."

For assassinations, you could wait for them to be in situations requiring intense concentration (e.g. driving at night on a windy road in a rainstorm) and activate the power then. But it requires (a) for them to be in a risky situation in the first place, (b) for you to /know/ that they're currently in said situation, and (c) for you to know exactly /when/ to active the sneeze attack.

The most effective use of this power I could think of would be to use it to your advantage in 1-on-1 sports that can be won in an instant (boxing, MMA, fencing, etc). You only need to incapacitate your opponents for a couple of seconds each match, and you're pretty much guaranteed to know their names & faces. Once you've won enough money as a pro athlete, you could just hire an assassin, if that's still your goal.

However, this approach /does/ require discretion; people may start to catch on if your 10th opponent in a row suddenly suffers an explosive case of the sniffles...
