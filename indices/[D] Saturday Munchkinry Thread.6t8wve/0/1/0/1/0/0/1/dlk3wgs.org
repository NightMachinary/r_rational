I think there are ways to make your nose less itchy on average; they could be used by long-term accomplices/minions, possibly going as far as cutting the nose off. I'm not sure if there is actually such a thing as a natural "phantom sneeze", but if no, then noseless people would be able to clearly receive any number of messages.

It makes establishing contact much trickier, granted, but not impossible, especially if you start off by creating a meme about the Sneeze God using non-magical means or something.
