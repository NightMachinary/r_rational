  The more sneezes you affect on the same person, the lesser the effect becomes - eventually diminishing to the point where a "sneeze" you affect would be little more than a few seconds worth of an itchy nose. Let's call it a threshold of ten sneezes until an affected sneeze cannot be considered a sneeze any more.

I guess we need to clarify this point. How itchy is the nose? Is it noticeable enough to be usable for communication? This would need it to be really itchy, otherwise your messages would be frequently jumbled up by natural slight nose itches.

But if it is that itchy, then the sneeze note can be used to kill: just make someone's nose itchy over and over again, which would prevent them from ever getting sleep until they die.

(Granted, you may have to also stay awake to keep making your target "sneeze", but it's certainly doable if you are healthier than your target.)
