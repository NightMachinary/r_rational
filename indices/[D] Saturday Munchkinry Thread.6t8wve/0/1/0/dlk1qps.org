  I guess (7) could be used for covert communication --- transmitting your minions commands using Morse or something
#+end_quote

That's actually can accomplish a lot.

1. Send the same Morse message once a day, every day to as many people as you can. Either choose your recipients completely at random or choose some organized group that can read Morse code.
2. Train yourself in patience. Eventually story of the higher being that communicates via sneezes will spread out. Once it's done, abandon daily messages.
3. After that you can finally move on to more specific messages. Find people who are willing to follow Sneezemaker. Choose some random site(s) to get answers from them.
4. Well, now you have group of people who are crazy enough to follow you. It is very useful... I guess?

Additional thoughts:

- Find names of high ranking government official's bodyguards. Use your Morse sneezing powers to recruit them for you cause.
- Change aforementioned plan so everything (language, sleep patterns, message contents, choice of people) points to that official. Then, kill someone using your power.
