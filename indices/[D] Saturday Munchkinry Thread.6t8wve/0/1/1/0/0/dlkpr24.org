You would need additional clues to narrow it down to a smaller search space, but there are often many. If the person is male, you wouldn't guess female names. If the person is Caucasian, you wouldn't guess Chinese names. If the amnesiac is currently at some location X, it would be reasonable to guess that they came from somewhere near X, and you could then get a list of missing people from these nearby places and go through the list.

There are all kinds of other clues as well. The accent that the amnesiac speaks with can be used to guess where they were raised, which would usually correlate to a certain set of names. The clothes they were found with can be used to guess wealth level, which has its own correlation with names. The age of the amnesiac can also be used to narrow the search space, since different sets of names trend in different years. The various physical features that the amnesiac has can also be used to guess their occupation, which again narrows the list since you can now ask nearby locations for lists of missing people with certain occupations.
