Munchkinery 101: identify what individual pieces the power consists of; figure out what each particular piece, if freed of restrictions, could be used for; figure out how to use the power to realize the full potential of the most powerful pieces.

This power: (1) identifies when you want to use it, (2) identifies who you want to use it on, (3) checks if your information on the target is correct, (4) checks how many times the target was already influenced by this power, (5) lowers the power's intensity based on how many times the target was influenced, (6) identifies the position of your target, (7) communicates with the target at /c/, (8) influences the target's brain in a delicate manner to induce a "sneeze".

What could be useful? 3, 6, 7, 8 look the most promising, but I indeed can't get much use out of them.

Nothing here offers direct feedback, so (3) can't be generally used to check your information for trustworthiness or for brute-force searches; I guess you could get an accomplice to change the name/face based on some criteria, but since it still depends on the accomplice's beliefs, I don't see a way to verify arbitrary information using it either.

(6) is mostly useless too, since it doesn't tell the target where they are, in relation to you or otherwise, and doesn't tell you the location unless you can hear the sneeze, in which case you may as well go look.

I guess (7) could be used for covert communication --- transmitting your minions commands using Morse or something --- which could give you some edge in negotiations or a battle, but it's pretty slow. It would make robbing a bank or plotting a prison break easier, but not that significantly.

(8) wouldn't be able to offer much to science, if I'm not mistaken.

Oh my, does this power suck.
