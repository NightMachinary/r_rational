I think this effect was only divine revelation of the nature of the name. They can make golems with the first two names, the third was implied to make the difference between golem and human/person. Aaron is already a human.

If the revelation of a name being transcendental is so undetectable, I would wonder how employees wouldn't be able to steal all of the real names.
