  Can it be argued that "meh meh meh meh meh meh" is enough of an addition for Aaron to own it himself and that he was off the clock at that point?

The company will try to claim they own it, even if they don't know the name or if they have no valid claim (the probably have some type of waver they make their employees sign guaranteeing that they will own any names the employee comes up with, even off the clock). However, my impression is that Aaron may not actually try to copyright it, but instead use its raw power for himself directly and not tell anyone the secret name. I imagine if the name is powerful enough, he will wipe out the company's records (just to minimize their chances of guessing at what he did, or if they always record everything just in case a situation like this comes up.)
