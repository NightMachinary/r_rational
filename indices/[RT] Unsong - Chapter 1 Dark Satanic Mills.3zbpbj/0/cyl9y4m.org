Did anyone else realize the implication of the fact that it is "dangerous" to pronounce a name yourself instead of using a scroll, yet names can be pronounced by minimum wage workers in mass working in cubicles? Either the "dangerous" part is bullshit to give an extra excuse for enforcing the current copyright setup (likely), or the minimum wage workers are working in an unsafe environment (less likely, but still plausible given the right economic incentives). I find it sad that both seem plausible.
