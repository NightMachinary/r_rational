We don't know what all the other names of God do yet, but this seems like one of those things that's unsafe until proven otherwise. They're trying to find new spells /without knowing what those new spells do/. Unless all spells are universally usable without any precautions or flaws, or unless they can predict effects, it's dangerous to go hunting for new spells. What happens if the next spell you find begins producing huge amounts of carbon monoxide? Or levels the city around you?
