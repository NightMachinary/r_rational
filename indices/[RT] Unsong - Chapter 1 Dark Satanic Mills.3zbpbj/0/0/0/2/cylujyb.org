Even if saying a name initially has no effect other than to let the minimum-wage worker know what it does, that will still eventually present problems if the spell does things like instantly produce enough gold to devalue the currency of nations, drives all of the invoker's enemies insane, or turns the invoker into a winged immortal. It would be hard to disincentivize a minimum-wage worker from paying a $70 fine for potential world domination or short-sightedly plunging the world into chaos.
