  From the effect we see when he finds the new name, it appears that a name may not do anything unless you speak it with intent. Here, he accidentally says a name - same conditions as when randomly attempting names - and instead of invoking its effect, it simply tells him what it does.

I guess my reading was that the Name he discovered grants self-awareness and that this awareness is what he granted to himself. Compare:

#+begin_quote
  It stood there for a moment, a crude statue, and then a voice from Heaven spoke a Name, and the clay came to life, lumbered into a standing position. It spoke a second Name, and the clay's eyes opened, and within them were innocence and curiosity and the capacity to wonder and learn. *And it spoke a third Name, and it was as if a light went on inside of it, and the dust became aware that it was dust and in so doing was dust no longer.*
#+end_quote

And the effect he experiences:

#+begin_quote
  *I was struck by a wave of holy light. The heavens opened and poured into me. My soul rang like a bell.*
#+end_quote

This would imply that he was the beneficiary of the Name and that he did cast it by saying it.
