Huh. I parsed the "it" in "And it spoke a third Name" as the voice from Heaven speaking a third time, and that it was targeted on the golem => man. Which implied to me that there was a targeting step, which would have to be somehow intent-based, and that the word spoken without a target does something else entirely. That's potentially much less interesting than your reading, though. Interesting.
