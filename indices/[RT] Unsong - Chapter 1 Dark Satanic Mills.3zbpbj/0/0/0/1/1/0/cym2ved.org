Aaron is already human, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the Name would have absolutely zero effect. It might be something like sending a duplicate INSERT statement and getting back a violation of primary key constraint error. No, nothing gets changed in the database, but you still get an error back as a result. The light of Heaven goes into a hollow form and gives it self-awareness, or the light of Heaven attempts to go into a form and makes the soul ring like a bell as celestial energy attempts to fill a vessel that's already full.

I mean, it will almost certainly be settled in the next chapter, but I don't think this chapter makes it clear whether /speaking/ a Name is the same as /invoking/ a Name. The chapter exclusively uses the former in all contexts.
