- The objection the police officer has to speaking a name directly starts with the classic copyright argument. "It's dangerous" seems to be very nearly an afterthought. Agreed with by the idea that half the people in the office are doing it on a daily basis. My guess is that names are approximately as dangerous as power tools: if you know what you're doing you can use them for hours a day for your entire life without ever getting injured, if you don't know what you're doing they will tear your limbs off and/or set your house on fire.
- From the effect we see when he finds the new name, it appears that a name may not do anything unless you speak it with intent. Here, he accidentally says a name - same conditions as when randomly attempting names - and instead of invoking its effect, it simply tells him what it does.
- I'm not sure how copyright will actually work in this occurrence. Can it be argued that "meh meh meh meh meh meh" is enough of an addition for Aaron to own it himself and that he was off the clock at that point?
