I would guess that the author is under contract and therefore owns no copyright. This is the same general agreement that governs things like writing for television or videogames (I've done the latter and signed such a contract).

Edit: The whole idea of being able to copyright a sequence of letters is legally dubious under our current intellectual property frameworks, of course.
