You can't copyright ideas in the first place, just expressions of those ideas.

The whole problem is that we have to posit a counterfactual legal system where it's possible to copyright a word. The closest we have are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number][illegal numbers]], but no one is really claiming that those numbers are copyrightable (well, people building strawmen are). So in order for a word to have copyright applied to it, we need copyright to mean something other than what we mean right now when we say copyright.

So there's no real way of knowing unless Unsong descends into the arcana of a counterfactual legal system, which I don't really imagine that it will. /If it were our legal system/ it's very likely that he would not have legal right to the spell, not only because he'd be going up against someone with a lot more money, but because he was using the company's intellectual property and physical property.
