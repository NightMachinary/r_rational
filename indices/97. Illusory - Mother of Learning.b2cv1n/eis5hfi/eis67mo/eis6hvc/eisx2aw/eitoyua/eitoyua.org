I was thinking that QI is being a little to cavalier in general though.

He's a frickin' Lich. He's playing the long, long, long game, because he has practical near-immortality.

A primordial being unleashed and with angels coming out is an extinction-level event that could directly impact him.

QI spending another hundred years subverting the governments of the continent to set the stage for his plans seems a small price to pay to avoid primordial play-time fallout.

I dunno. Perhaps I am down several orders of magnitude in the ruthlessness department to accurately model a Lich's value system...
