  is to trick Zach into thinking everyone who knows about the loop is dead, right?

I'm not so sure about that. It's most probable, because Zach is the easiest to fool. His incapability in soul magic and relatively low competency in mind magic made elaborate illusion worthwhile to pull. But nobody said it would be used as momentary distraction. Zorian love distraction. Remember the soul severing disc, both as small projectiles and platform that activates on notice? Both are just distraction for full blast dispelling wave and do-or-die mind incursion against Quatach Ichl.
