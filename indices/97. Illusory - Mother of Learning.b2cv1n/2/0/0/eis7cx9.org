Ah... I love how you described that. Yes. Zorian would make an excellent Aizen. After all of this is over, we need to have a sequel where Zorian dramatically betrays everybody without killing anyone important for no discernible reason. Then trounces everyone in one to one combat while having highly specialised plans for everything he can't tackle personally. Still without killing anyone important. He'll bring the government to its knees, only to be stopped by an insanely overpowered Kirielle trained by Zach and the Angels.
