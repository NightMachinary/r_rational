Key question - is the contract only checked/verified at the end of the month and never more? Because then they have to trick themselves just for that one particular moment/day.

Honestly, I'm not sure. The geas on Zach's soul is to kill or otherwise deal with anyone who performs mind magic. The geas is also to kill himself/die if there is anyone who knows about the timeloop still alive. The geas on the other two is that they free the primordial, or they die at the end of the month. But who does the checking? In Zach's case, it's his perception. In RR and SL's case, we dunno. SL actually literally says that she wiped her mind of the contract however she can still feel it in her soul.

The angels did say one thing interesting though - they said that they (the angels) are not the primordials and (I guess contrary to the primordials) the angels are not powerless on the material planes. So the primordials can't affect things in the material world, ergo the contract Pan has with RR and SL needs to have a self checking geas, cuz the primordial can't make any on the fly decisions. It's a simple algorithm.

​

All this to say that I'm not sure, but if the checking mechanism is their perception, then it's theoretically possible. however, both RR and SL are incredibly suspicious and paranoid so I don't think they would ever trust anyone to take over their minds and illusion them out.
