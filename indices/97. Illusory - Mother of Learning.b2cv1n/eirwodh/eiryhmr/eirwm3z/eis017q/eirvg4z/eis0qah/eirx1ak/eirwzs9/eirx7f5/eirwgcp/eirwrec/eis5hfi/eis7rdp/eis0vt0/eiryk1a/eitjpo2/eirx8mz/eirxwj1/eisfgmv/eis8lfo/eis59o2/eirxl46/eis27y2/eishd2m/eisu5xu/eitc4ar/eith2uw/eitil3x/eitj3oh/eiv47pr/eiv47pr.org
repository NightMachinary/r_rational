So you're gonna take one part of 1 sentence, twist its meaning, reply to that and ignore the rest of my comment?

This is [[/r/rational]]. Validity of thought is supposed to matter. Correcting something is not choosing a side. I'll correct arguments that were in favor of something I agree with! Bad arguments are bad arguments, irrationality is irrationality, no matter what "side" they are on.

Don't be what's wrong in today's world, don't spread an us vs then mentality. Don't be [[/r/irrational]].

If the guy I replied to said that the number in nobody's username didn't drop and I said "Yeah, so what? That doesn't mean there wasn't a drop in quality" you'd behave as though I chose a side? WTF? If not then why do it now?
