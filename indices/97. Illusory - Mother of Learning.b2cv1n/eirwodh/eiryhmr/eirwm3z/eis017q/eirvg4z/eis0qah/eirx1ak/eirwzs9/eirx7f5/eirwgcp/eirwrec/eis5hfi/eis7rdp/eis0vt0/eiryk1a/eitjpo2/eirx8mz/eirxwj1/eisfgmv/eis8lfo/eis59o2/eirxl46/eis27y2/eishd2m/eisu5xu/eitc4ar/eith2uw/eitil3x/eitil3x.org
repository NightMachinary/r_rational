So, going by that, you've chosen a side on whether t it being impressive excludes there being a drop and you've chosen that it does exclude there being a drop? That's a ridiculous thing, why would it exclude there being a drop? A person can have lapses in their writing whether or not they are writing in their mother tongue, or in their second/third/etc language.

If I've chosen a side on whether there was a drop you've chosen that side on that.

I chose no side. I said one thing doesn't exclude another. That is not choosing a side. I can say that, and talk about that without choosing a side on either thing. Us vs them mentality is a plague in today's world. Saying I've chosen a side is detrimental bullshit.

What you said is irrelevant to what I said, that is why not reply to me.
