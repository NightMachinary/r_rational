To really cement the idea that trying to fight the dragons is a lot of work. They were already considering how to handle three dragon mages, being told there was 30 suddenly made everyone give up trying - which was the point.

An idea you want to keep in hand would be something that could be countered and acts like a counter itself. For example having a double agent would be something you wouldn't reveal, but 30 dragons is a lot harder to keep secret and worth just as much revealing as keeping secret.

They've definitely got more cards up their sleeves for sure though, but the info they revealed works just as well used like it was than kept as a card to play later.
