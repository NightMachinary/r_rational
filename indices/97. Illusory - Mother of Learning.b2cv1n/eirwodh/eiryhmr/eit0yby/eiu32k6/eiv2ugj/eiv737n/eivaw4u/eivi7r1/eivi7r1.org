I believe the reason for killing to be important. If done for a proper objective or as part of a strategic goal, or when there is legal backing, it should not be considered murderous. Otherwise, soldiers in war and executioners of death row prisoners would have to be classified as murderers.

I'd argue that the lich doesn't kill without reason, as far as I can remember. He might have killing intent against his targets, or feel murderous rage facing his attackers, but that doesn't make him murderous.

That said, the word murder and the variants derived from it have too much emotional luggage attached and the detailed meanings seem to vary in different contexts. E.g. many pacifists seem to consider all forms of killing humans to be murder, even in self-defense or when legally sanctioned, even when the killer isn't even human. In legal terms, the definitions are more precise and I think the emotions are excluded. While in literature, the meaning is whatever the author thinks he can get away with in order to dramatize his writings even more.
