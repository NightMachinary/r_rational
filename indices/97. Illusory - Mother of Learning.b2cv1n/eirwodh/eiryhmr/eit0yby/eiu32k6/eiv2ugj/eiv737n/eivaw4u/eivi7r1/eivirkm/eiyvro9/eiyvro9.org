Just my take on this, but I believe that he is murderous just by the definition of it.

*a:* having the purpose or capability of murder

*b:* characterized by or causing murder or bloodshed

[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murderous][(Merriam-Webster)]]

Therefore he's murderous in some sense of the word - but I do believe that the reason for killing is important, but not relevant for our discussion about being murderous or not.
