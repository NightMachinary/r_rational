No. It's another attempt to reveal multiple 'facts' through verbal communication alone. The first attempt was right after Silverlake betrayal, inside the time loop. I'd say it's an improvement, but still not quite passable. For the first part of the chapter, quality is low, but not lower than previous attempt.
