I feel both Zorian's small talk with Quatach Ichl and his date with Spear of Resolve are up to par. Plots (Quatach Ichl reluctance to stay back and Zorian mind wipe strategy) developed smoothly there. Inclusion of Novelty, on the other hand, felt forcefully attached. I actually surprised people hyped about it.
