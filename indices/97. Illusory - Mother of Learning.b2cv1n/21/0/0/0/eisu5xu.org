I don't think there was a drop in quality so much as this was literally the most dialogue dense chapter of the series, and the monotone voice of the characters in the other chapters is easier to forgive / ignore when it's interspersed with the MC's diary-like thoughts.

tl;dr The dialogue was always meh.
