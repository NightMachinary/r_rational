The problem is that Aranean males aren't sentient, so they don't have romance.

Then again, that's not that different from shipping characters that aren't Alternian trolls in quadrants besides matespritship, and I do that all the time. Personally I'm more into Tinami Aope x Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty, but now that I think of it that's a good ship too. Probably the best one for Zorian with the possible exception of Zach. I'm not int yaoi, so I don't care for that one, but it seems like it's probably a good ship.
