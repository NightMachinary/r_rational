So Zorian's Plan with the mental landscape is to trick Zach into thinking everyone who knows about the loop is dead, right? We know it's based on his perception due to how he determines who to kill and who to mind-wipe, I can't think of any other reason to train this ability at the last moment.

Edit: Also, We know that it is fairly lifelike Spear of Resolve knew because she was paying attention and is an expert at mental enhancement, but it shouldn't be able to fool Soul Sight, should it? So that means it will have little practical purpose in battle, considering who they're up against, but Soul Sight is an active ability, so Zach probably wouldn't have it activated all the time.
