I don't think he goes around killing people for fun. IIRC, he has reasons when he kills.

Is he sociopathic? AFAIK, many people in leadership positions are sociopathic to some extent.

In any case, sociopaths are always reasonable. Selfish reasons, it's true, but so long as you don't get in their way, they can always be reasoned with. Of course, you still need to be careful of a knife in the back.

The unreasonable ones are the emotional people, the hysterical ones and the so-called good samaritans. The emotional ones act on their whims and fancies and are often hard to predict. The hysterical ones act out of their fears, misunderstandings and delusions. Even when they seem calm and reasonable, you never know when they'll suddenly explode.

Many good Samaritans actually act for their own self-satisfaction. They'll always say it's for your own good and force their help on you. But very often, they don't really care about the results. They may often abandon the task halfway, leaving you hanging and your schedule in shambles. Or force you to accept their help/advice now, because it's always so urgent and important, forcing you to abandon your existing plans and projects which are actually better than what they want for you. Even if there is no direct cost to you, they often don't care who they trample or sacrifice in the process. If/when shit happens, they have all kinds of excuses lined up - karma for Buddhists, God's Will for Christians, you/no one told them, etc.
