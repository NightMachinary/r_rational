Well, Zorian still has divinations to worry about. Red Robe could track his family with some esoteric method, maybe he knows how the Royal Family Vault's divine tracking method works and has already tagged someone. I'd argue the safest thing to do would be to stuff them in the orb and keep the orb on hand.
