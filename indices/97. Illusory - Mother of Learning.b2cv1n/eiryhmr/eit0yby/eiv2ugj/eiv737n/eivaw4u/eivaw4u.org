I don't think you need to find killing fun to be considered murderous, also those that find it fun have their reasons too, such as “it's fun” which is arguably just as valid as “they were in my way while I was trying to gain world domination”. They're equally detestable in my mind. I also think there is some evidence he does find killing at least somewhat fun.
