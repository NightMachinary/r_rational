Yep, there was an interesting post in [[/r/writing]] about this recently, where a person wrote a rough draft for a story long ago, and upon finally reading Game of Thrones, realized his story was too similar to it. After revising it he showed it to some friends, who remarked that it was very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender. Instead of despairing over comparisons made between your story and others, the best solution is to focus on what you want to see more of that the others did and focus on that, and cut away what you disliked or cared less about, until being similar doesn't matter because the focus and exploration is on different things entirely.

And thank you, glad you enjoyed the listen :)
