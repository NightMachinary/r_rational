Originality is an interesting topic. A common motivation for writers is the desire to share thoughts and ideas with the world. So one would assume a more original work would have more appeal for writers as well. For example, I recently had a desire to write a hpmor fic focusing on harry having to deal with his vow. This idea seemed interesting enough to share with others. However, after checking the continuation stories that I had not read before, I found out 'Significant Digits' had already explored the subject in chapter 2. Now it seemed mostly to be used as a subplot there, so if my desire was strong enough I could still write a story that would explore the idea further and more in-depth. While it wouldn't be completely original it would then hopefully add enough to still be interesting and new. In contrast since my desire was not very strong I could decide my idea had been shared with the world and not write anything on the subject.

More on the feedback side of things; I felt the rational part was more implied this episode. That might have been for the best given the topic which was more directly about writing I suppose. Regardless you two have great synergy which results in a nice flow of consistent content. It makes listening very pleasant so good job on that.
