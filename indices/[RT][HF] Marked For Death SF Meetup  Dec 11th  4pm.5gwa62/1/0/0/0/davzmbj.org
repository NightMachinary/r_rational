Yeah I can definitely understand that. Obviously there's sort of a problem where you can never be /sure/ a character isn't going to die next update, but without getting into too many spoilers, the team members who are alive are in an okayish spot right now, so it might be a great time to catch up.

Even if you only pop in to look at the plans on vote day, the more the merrier :)
