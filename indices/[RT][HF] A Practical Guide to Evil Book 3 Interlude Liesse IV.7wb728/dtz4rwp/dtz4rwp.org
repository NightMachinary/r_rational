The Empire's forces are getting absolutely gutted here. Even with no super weapons, no replacement Calamities rising, and no real pretext, I'm pretty sure Procer would leap at this opportunity. Cat's probably going to spend the entire next book running the Fifteenth ragged just protecting their borders, let alone actually invading Procer in return.
