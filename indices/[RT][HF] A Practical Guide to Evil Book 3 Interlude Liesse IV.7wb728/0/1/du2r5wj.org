It seems plausible that, in a huge misdirection, black doesn't give his life to save cat and instead warlock gives his life to save the corrupted Masego.

Which would be all as planned for black, so the warlock hates cat problem is gone. It also fits the whole killing the calamities one by one thing that is going on.
