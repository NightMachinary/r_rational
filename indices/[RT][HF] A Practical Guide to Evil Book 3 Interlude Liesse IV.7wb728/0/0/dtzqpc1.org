Killing Warlock would severely piss off Masego and Black, assuming they are both around by the end of the battle. I can't imagine the Empress would be too happy about losing her most powerful mage either. - Of course obvious negative consequences have never stopped Cat before.

the moment with Warlock leaving the soldiers behind was an interesting reminder of what Villany looks like in practice. He probably did the strategically right thing, but the fact he cared so little about it was chilling. If Squire had to make a similar decision she would agonise about it hugely. I can't see them coming back given that when they were left they were surrounded by devils, they'll likely die very quickly. But their loss will have an impact
