This battle was a shitshow before and it is somehow getting worse with every chapter. From a storytelling point of view, I'm kind of glad to see that the Woe's bullshit still has consequences. But from the characters' PoV, those are going to sting. And Catherine Foundling, Supreme-Fucker-Of-Things-Multiple-And-Varied-In-Forms, /hasn't even done anything bad yet/.

Also, it's nice to see that EE got funding for three chapters a week but I hope it won't lessen their quality too much. Proofreading has never been the strong point of this work and this week's chapters are slightly but noticeably worse on that front.
