I think people are missing out on Hakram's contribution.

  Like quill being dipped in an inkwell, void filled for purpose. It was not Speaking, not quite. He was not Catherine, able to bridge the gap of a Name too young and thin by sheer stubborn will. But he was the Adjutant, and they were soldiers. That mattered, in the eyes of Creation. They turned to him, and there was a glint in their eyes that spoke of orders awaited. Just a glint, but it would be enough.

Seems to be hinting at a new aspect. On top of his other organisational and fighting related powers being able to influence the loyalties of soldiers would be a natural extension to his name and very powerful. I can imagine him using it to rally the various armies together behing Catherine or similar.
