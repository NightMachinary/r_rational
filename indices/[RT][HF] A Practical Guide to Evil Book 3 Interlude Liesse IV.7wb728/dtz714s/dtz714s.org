Cat will not be happy with Warlock at the end of this battle - assuming he survives. Considering he's totally drained by redirecting the Greater Breach it strikes me as a perfect opportunity for a slight case of assassination.

Will the thousand soldiers trapped in Hell become relevant in the future? Would be cool if Cat managed to get them back somehow.
