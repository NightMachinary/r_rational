Essentially, an affectionate parody of Zelda. Can't comment anything gameplay wise, it's still in the early access phase.

But hacking in terms of game mechanics, kinda munchkinesque. You get to reprogram object properties, hijack global variables, hack creature behavior, etc. I thought it was an interesting take. Plus the artwork's gorgeous.
