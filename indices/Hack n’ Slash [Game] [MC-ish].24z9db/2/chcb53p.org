I haven't played Hack n' Slash personally (yet) but I probably will eventually, based mostly on Double Fine's previous products - especially Psychonauts, which remains one of my favorite platforming type games of all time.

Psychonauts was just a really amazingly well done platforming game - there's great comedy, some drama, excellent pacing, and an excellent set of voicework and characters.
