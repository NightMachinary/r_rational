  I'm also wondering if there is a diplomatic solution here where Cat agrees to confront Kairos with a coalition force in exchange for free passage out of Procer with Black's soul. This would free up Proceran forces to confront their true enemy without worrying about their heartland.

Some of the top quotes above the chapters from Cat's officers suggest that this probably won't happen.
