Did anyone comment on how lately Cat seems to be following all the hero tropes?

Biggest one was: Things are looking really bad for the army of callow, they're minutes away from their doom when suddenly a vanished hero comes in out of no where and saves the day. (Cat even mentioned this trope as then reason why she didn't try to trap heroes inside her portals)
