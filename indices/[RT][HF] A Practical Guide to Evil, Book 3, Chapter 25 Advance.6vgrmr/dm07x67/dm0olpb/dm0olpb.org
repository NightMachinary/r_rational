  I wanted to crush him under my boot, and the bone-deep hatred I'd felt when first entering Summer well up in response.

  I didn't set it aside, this time. I took it, owned it, carved it into a weapon. It was mine, and it would answer to my will like any other aspect.

It's clear in the short term, it's 'just' a powerful aspect. However, It sounds like the source is still Winter Fae. If she permanently loses her Winter Fae powers, I could see it going either way in terms of her keeping it, or the slot being open for a new aspect. I don't know if we'll ever find out that subtlety, though. Cat's "always had this power" so she may not lose it when the seasons turn / she gets her heart back.

Love the aspect for this narrative moment in the story though.
