I find it interesting that her first three aspects seemed to be related to her trying to find her place in the world and how she could deal with all these assholes who kept telling her what to do- she had to learn fast, had to struggle to deal with more experienced enemies, had to seek solutions.

Now she's got experience and a MO, and her aspects describe it. Neat! Brutal, too.
