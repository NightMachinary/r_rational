Fall as an aspect seems incredibly powerful but also very strange. Every other aspect up until this point works in some form of "I Blank": I Learn, I Struggle, I Seek, I Take, I Break, I Rise, and so on. But Fall seems to be used on an opponent - "You Fall". This means that when it works for Cat it should work incredibly well, as an Aspect imbued with Winters power. But it also will likely lead to her demise. At some point "I Fall" is going to happen and it's going to be Bad.
