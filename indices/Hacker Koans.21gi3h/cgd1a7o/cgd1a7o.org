A man once walked down the road, failing to meet with his destination. As he walked, getting increasingly lost, he came upon an old monk.

"Is there a city around here?" asked the man. "I was following this map, but it seems to be increasingly inaccurate around here. In fact, I'm not even sure that the city exists! It's certainly not on this map."

The monk said nothing. He simply took a pencil from his pocket and marked a point in the desert on the map with a star. "There is your city," he said. The man frowned, remembering that the city was supposed to be on the coast of a vast ocean. Thinking for a moment, then, the man became enlightened.
