In Anger Management, there's a great scene where the therapist subjects the protagonist to the classic "who are you?" routine. Ever since, I've been fascinated with that routine, and I hope someday the following happens:

The one calling themself a teacher asks me, "who are you?" I reply, "I don't know what I am. I only know I am." The one calling themself a teacher asks me where I learned this from. I tell them. And the one calling themself teacher becomes enlightened.
