I think the first rational Dracula was Fred Saberhagen's [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraculaTape][/Dracula Tape/]] (1975) and its sequels. I would say it and Chelsea Quin Yarbro's /Hotel Transylvania/ (1978) a few years later really created the whole "good vampire"/"vampire protagonist" genre.
