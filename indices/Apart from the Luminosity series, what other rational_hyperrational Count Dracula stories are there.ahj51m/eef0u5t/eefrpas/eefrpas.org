Love Blindsight. It's hard to call it a vampire story, when just one of the main cast is a vampire. The others have similar superhuman augmentations that are also interesting.

Just read Contratto for the first time, and was a bit disappointed in the main character's irrationality at times. I appreciated that it used rational world building to answer the question "what would a secret society of vampires look like today". However, the main character doesn't use rationality to answer questions about the world around her, or to act reasonablyvon the information she's given. The story could turn out very differently if she'd tested any of their assertions and found them to be false.
