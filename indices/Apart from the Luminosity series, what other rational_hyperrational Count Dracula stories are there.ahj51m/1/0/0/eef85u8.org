I agree with you regarding the overpowered nature of Dominate but I am not sure what you are talking about regarding the points in your first paragraph. While the exact mechanics of Humanity are a bit crude, I thought that the flavor text did a decent job of showing why Vampire society has developed the way that it did and why the depicted vampires behave in such seemingly irrational ways

To briefly address each point:

1) Vampires are incentivized to form a society as a vampire that does not find some kind of meaning to their lives other than feeding will degenerate into a Draugr / Lose all Humanity and go crazy. The Covenants create a structure that allows Vampires to function as more than beasts continually looking for their next meal. Like all organizations they also act to perpetuate themselves once they have achieved sufficient size and power. A key part of this seeking out new vampires and pressuring them to join a faction.

I think that Damnation City is one book that does a particularly great job of exploring the forms of vampire society. It shows some of the practical structures that are devised to manage the distribution of feeding grounds and allow for the existence of something more than a state of constant conflict. I thought that the analogy to gang competition and control of territory was very clever.

2) The endless machinations that comprise vampire society in Vampire the Requiem is very intensive, but it really isn't that much different from the real world. My perspective is that it was well within the suspension of disbelief particularly given the corrupting nature of the Vampire powers and the manner in which Vampires were acclimated to manipulating people by the need to feed themselves.

3) I am not sure what you mean by this. I would think that the reason why beings that prey on Humanity in the night but are extremely vulnerable during the day would place a very high priority on secrecy would be self-evident. The Vampires in Vampire the Requiem are stronger than the average human but they are not so overwhelming that they cannot be destroyed with relative ease by opponents with knowledge and preparation, superior numbers, or simple luck. The desire to avoid being hunted down and killed seems like a sensible reason for a vampire to hid their true nature and do everything in their power to make sure that their peers do the same.

4) The mechanical punishment for Diablerie of Humanity loss may seem minor compared to the significant rewards but the flavor text does a great job of showing how Diablerie can easily lead to insanity.

5) Using the Vinculum doesn't create a perfectly obedient slave. It instills obsessive devotion and gives the vampire a significant advantage in social combat. There are a lot of ways that the Vinculum could backfire and create a dangerous opponent. Going "vinculum/ghoul crazy" seems like it would create an unmanageable mess that would require intense management and would be at a continual risk of blowing up.

The Chicago Fiction where Solomon Reed turns against Maxwell and the two ghoul setting books do a great job of showing that the relationship imposed by the vinculum can easily end up taking distorted forms that end up turning the victim of the vinculum against the creator of the vinculum.
