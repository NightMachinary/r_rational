It depends heavily on what clan I'm embraced into. If I'm a gangrel I have to start the speed run over, for instance.

I came up with my plan for ventrue a long time ago, and forget the details, and am kind of drunk so now's not the best time, but I can tell you that one involved using dominate to create dominate machines who dominate others, recursively. You've already acknowledged dominate is busted so maybe that's cheating.

Also I haven't read what you're talking about regarding vinculum backfiring, so some of my plans that rely on that might not work I guess.

Humanity is the main thing stopping you from creating a diablerie farm with the help/subjugation of a high bp vampire I guess.

If all else fails you can firebomb elysium during a mandatory city-wide meeting, lay low when the international community comes and checks it out, and then be the only vampire in the city living fat once things calm down.

If you can't do that, ghoul and vinculum the chief of police or the head of the local branch of a three letter agency and initiate a raid on the current leadership of the city. If the masquerade is so important and humans are such a threat, this should work.

I don't know, not all of them are the best ideas, but some of them would at least have been tried and would change the shape of vampire society in the area from what we're told it is.

And I feel like I could come up with better when I'm sober. Auspex is really strong. Nightmare can probably be broken.

Edit: My main point isn't that a young vampire should always be able to upset vampire society, it's that old, powerful vampires who aren't holding the idiot ball would have used the tools available to them to structure vampire society such that new vampires aren't a threat. There would be no upward mobility, and the game wouldn't be fun. You'd be embraced and immediately mind fucked into compliance, kind of like how all Tremere are all vinculumed to the Tremere leadership in v20, but more oppressive.

And if they didn't, vampire society would already be upset.

The fact that the only thing keeping a new vampire from blowing the whole masquerade wide open in a misguided form of self-sacrifice upon learning he is damned is a fear of reprisal, which has never stopped a single ideologue in the history of ever, combined with the number of vampires that have been embraced, makes the idea that the masquerade still exists a huge plot hole IMO.
