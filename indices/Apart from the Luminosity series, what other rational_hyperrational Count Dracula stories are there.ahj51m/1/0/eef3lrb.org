As a huge vampire the * setting fan, it's totally irrational.

Vampires have no reason to form a society, no particular reason to backstab literally everyone even when it's not in their best interest, no reason to hide from humans, no reason not to commit diablerie constantly, no reason not to go vinculum/ghoul crazy, other than “because the writers said there are more powerful vampires than you who don't accept these things.”

Further, anyone with enough Dominate to rewrite memories has no reason not to just mentally subjugate everyone, including giving incontrovertible past memories of having tried to rebel in the past and failing due to the vampire in question being infallible and omnipotent or some shit. You can rewrite people's lives so they literally have constant evidence their whole lives of you being god. Except it hasn't happened because the writers didn't think of it and it would make a less +interesting+ accessible backdrop for an rpg.

These people are supposed to be monsters.

I love vampire, but it doesn't make any sense.
