I must admit that I am a really big fan of Vampire the Requeim and that is shaping my argument. A certain degree of suspension of disbelief is needed for any piece of fiction but I am willing to go a bit further for this rpg simply because I really like the setting.

I would actually be really interested in hearing how you would "Completely restructure vampire society". I can't really think of any easily exploitable flaws that would allow an otherwise normal starting vampire to achieve such absolute dominance. It seems like your ideas could be the seed for an interesting story.
