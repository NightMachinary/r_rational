I mean at least a few of these feel like writing the Kessel Run to involve a black hole so Han Solo's stupid "parsec" boast makes sense in retrospect.

But you're definitely more familiar with the lore than I am.

I just genuinely believe that if there wasn't a storyteller contriving obstacles, I could break and completely restructure vampire society in my favor if I became a vampire and had a copy of v20 or blood and smoke (whichever was relevant) to reference.

The fact that this feels, if not trivial, at least accessible - maybe not 100% guaranteed but with a non-negligible chance of working - and yet no vampire has ever done it by the time you start play, is what I have to suspend my disbelief about.
