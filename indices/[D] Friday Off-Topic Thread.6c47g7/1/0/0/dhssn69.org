Unless you would behave incredibly and obviously irrationally while somehow convincing me you're not doing it on purpose all along the way, I don't see why you would bother? That sentence was conditional on characters /already/ behaving in SoD-breaking ways: I would of course enjoy /good/ character development or hot-blooded speech, they become irritating only when the characters involved stop being people.
