  Do you like intelligent conflicts? Complex moral conflicts? Or see it as a tool to spread rational thinking? Like peripherally-relevant topics, such as transhumanism/AI/X-risks/deconstructions? Are bad at suspending disbelief and can only find sanctuary here? Be detailed.

Speaking for myself, personally, I mostly just like clever scifi/fantasy world building with well-fleshed-out and elegant magic systems (with fewer ad hoc components, ideally, though I'm ok with a slow reveal, so long as everything fits together consistently), as well as general munchkinry, nerd power fantasy, and competence porn. I'm not as interested in the "tool to spread rational thinking" bits, and usually just skip over any attempts at pedagogy. But I also don't really consider myself a rationalist (aspiring or otherwise) as it's used around here, and so may be atypical in this regard. I also enjoy nitpicky, rant-y deconstructions of works that I otherwise love, and in depth discussions of little details in other works of fictions that, if exploited, would derail the entire original plot.
