Since you reposted my essay, I've been thinking about that topic a bit more and seem to have hit on an evolution. Yes, rational fiction should exploit its premise to the fullest extent, but that creates confusion. So I'm wondering if the difference is thinking of rational fiction as a /genre/ or as /style/. I have some notes on an essay to explore this further, but I don't have time to write it at the moment.
