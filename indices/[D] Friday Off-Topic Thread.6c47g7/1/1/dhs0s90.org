Why? I love mysteries, and all of my favorite rational fiction stories are either straightforward mysteries or mysteries turned upside-down or inside-out.

Conventional mysteries present events that have happened, usually suspicious deaths, and then follow protagonists who unravel the actions and interactions that preceded those events. Who did what when, and why? Enjoyment comes from cleverness on the part of the detectives, catching subtle mistakes on the part of the murderers, and my own enjoyable analysis of available data as the detective encounters it.

We're each speculating and it's only slightly more enjoyable when I make a connection or harbor a suspicion than when an intelligent protagonist does so.

Mysteries don't have to follow detectives, however. They can follow potential victims as they sense a web closing in on them and try to identify their murderer before it's too late. They can follow murderers as they plan and execute their crime, then defend themselves from detectives.

No matter what, the writer must create a story and a world that can be safely unraveled without collapsing. And I continue reading in order to solve a fair, well-designed puzzle and to watch it solved. Even if it's nothing more than "Oh wow, how can this possibly end well?"
