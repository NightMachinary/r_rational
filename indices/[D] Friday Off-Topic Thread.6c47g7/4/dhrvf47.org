Anyone here tried [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/32032/Seikaisuru_Kado][Seikaisuru kado]] yet?

So far I've been getting the impression that the author really gave some thoughts to uplifting, though its not as rigorous as could be, but given this is an anime, what they show is more then I expected actually..
