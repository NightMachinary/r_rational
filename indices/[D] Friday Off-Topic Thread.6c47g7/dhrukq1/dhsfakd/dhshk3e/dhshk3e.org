Greg Weisman has disavowed The Goliath Chronicles and released the canonical continuation in [[http://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Gargoyles-2006][comic form]]. I haven't read it yet and it only lasted 8 issues, but fans seem to like it. If you're looking for more, TV Tropes has a page for fanfic recommendations.
