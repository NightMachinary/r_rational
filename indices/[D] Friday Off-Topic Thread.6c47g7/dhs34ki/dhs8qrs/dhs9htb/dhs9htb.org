  However, strength training raises your resting metabolic rate, so if you lift weights (or do bodyweight exercises like pushups/pullups/squats) you'll burn more calories over the course of the day while you sit around doing nothing than you'd burn riding a stationary bike for an hour.

I'll read the rest in more detail when I'm not at work.
