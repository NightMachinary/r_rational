I do a push/pull/legs split on a five day rotation, but I've been exercising for a few years at this point. Beginners should start with a full body workout three days a week. You can get a full body workout by doing pushups, pullups (a doorframe pullup bar is only $25 at Walmart), and bodyweight squats.

If you feel paralyzed by indecision, just /MOVE/. You can start by deciding to do pushups every other day, and that'll get you in the habit of moving. Use youtube and google extensively to make sure you're using proper form (do /NOT/ trust yourself to "just know" how to do anything, even something as basic as a pushup; I've personally impinged my shoulder and given myself a mildly winged scapula by being an idiot for the first year I exercised; don't be an idiot, because it can take /months and months/ to reverse a mistake).

Still on the subject of proper form, most people have the idea in their heads that they can do more pushups than they can actually do (EDIT: because most people have seen pushups done incorrectly in movies and TV shows, and have never realized when they've attempted them in the past that they were doing them improperly; if you don't have your body and arms aligned properly and you don't go through the full range of motion and you don't do them slowly (if you don't do them slowly then gravity is doing half the work on the way down and momentum is doing half the work on the way up) then you can do a lot more reps than you ought to be able to do; [[https://www.outsideonline.com/2001321/youre-doing-your-push-ups-wrong][here's a decent link]]).

When I started exercising and did pushups with proper form for the first time, I maxed out at, like, 6 reps. I got better by doing one set of 3 reps then two sets of two reps (obviously you rest for anywhere from 45 seconds to 3 minutes between sets), resting the next day, repeating those reps/sets, resting the next day, and repeating that procedure until that last rep of the last set wasn't a struggle anymore, then changed it to two sets of 3 reps and one set of two reps, three sets of 3 reps, 4 reps 3 reps 3 reps, 4 reps 4 reps 3 reps, 4 4 4, 5 4 4, 5 5 4, 5 5 5, 6 5 5, 6 6 5, 6 6 6, etcetera. I'm at the point where I do 15 15 15 pushups while wearing a bookbag with two 15lbs dumbbells in it, then do 8 8 8 on a dumbbell bench press with two 30lbs dumbbells, then do 8 8 8 on dumbbell flies with two 15lbs dumbbells, then do another 10 10 10 on unweighted pushups.

Even taking a 15 minute walk once per day is better than doing nothing at all. Cardio is good, and most research into the mental effects of exercise (postponing/preventing Alzheimer's, reducing depression, increasing memory, stimulating neurogenesis) is centered around cardio. However, strength training raises your resting metabolic rate, so if you lift weights (or do bodyweight exercises like pushups/pullups/squats) you'll burn more calories over the course of the day while you sit around doing nothing than you'd burn riding a stationary bike for an hour.

Ideally, you ought to do both aerobic and anaerobic exercise, but like I said, doing something is always better than doing nothing. Even if you live in a one bedroom apartment and have agoraphobia, you can manage to pace briskly back and forth in your bedroom for 15 minutes a day.
