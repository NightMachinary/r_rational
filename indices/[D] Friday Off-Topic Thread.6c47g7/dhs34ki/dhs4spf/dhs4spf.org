Exercise is a bit of a problem because it doesn't show results very quickly so it's not easy to determine whether you're doing it right. If you just generally want to work on your health the best approach is to do exercise long enough that you actually burn your body fat so try to exercise for long stretches of time instead of short periods of time often. Go for cardio stuff because it makes you feel healthier rather quickly, do it consistently for results.

If you intend to loose weight start in the kitchen and not in the gym.

If you want to build muscles or specific muscles I can't help you, you should probably just ask muscled people and do what they say or do research on the internet but beware there are mountains of bullshit out there.
