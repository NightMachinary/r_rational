In my continuing series of first world problems that I use as an excuse to overanalyze my psychology, I started watching the show Gargoyles I wish I liked it more. It's a good, perhaps even great, cartoon created by the same guy who later made Young Justice that delivered a story on par with adult entertainment nearly a decade before Avatar started the trend of mature children's shows.

The problem I have with it is that it's so much better than its contemporaries that the nitpicks I have about character development and plot inconsistencies stand out way more than they should. It's season 2 of Young Justice all over again, my expectations are set so high by past experience that I can't help but be disappointed by it doing anything different from what I want it to even though it's not bad at all.

This is becoming a trend for me and Greg Weisman productions. He is one of my favorite animation creators of all time, but I'm hesitant to watch any more of his stuff because I keep feeling that sense of disappointment. I'm ruining great stories for myself because I'm making unreasonable demands of them. I selfishly desire the same thing I got from a story I loved before and can't accept anything else.

It's not just Greg Weisman, I'm convinced the same thing happened with me and Unsong. I liked it so much at the beginning that the inconsistencies and unsatisfying plot points stood out even more than they should've and I never finished it. This is beginning to frustrate me since I now recognize it as a trend of behavior that is not beneficial to me but don't know how to stop it.
