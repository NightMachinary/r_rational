A few weeks ago we talked about what rational fiction /is/. Let's talk about the /why/. Why are we here, why do we (want to) read/write rational fiction?

Do you like intelligent conflicts? Complex moral conflicts? Or see it as a tool to spread rational thinking? Like peripherally-relevant topics, such as transhumanism/AI/X-risks/deconstructions? Are bad at suspending disbelief and can only find sanctuary here? /Be detailed./

You would probably want to include a short description on what you think rational fiction /is/, since opinions on that vary from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69f7nw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dh6lra8/]["fiction that shows the virtue of intelligence"]] to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69f7nw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dh78lsd/]["fiction that employs L1 intelligent characters"]] to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/]["fiction that fully exploits its core idea"]] to "fiction that loosely fits [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_characteristics_of_rationalist_fiction][these]] criteria" to "whatever [[/r/rational]] likes". (The "L1 intelligent characters" is mine).

--------------

/My/ main reason is that I usually lose the ability to care about their story the moment I recognize that the main character(s) of the media I'm consuming are trying to achieve their goals in a blatantly non-optimal fashion. After that happens, I'm completely incapable of actually /cheering for them/. I may still care about the plot/mysteries/battles/etc, but I no longer see the characters as /people/ I'm supposed to sympathize with; they become plot devices/automatons that should better sort out their irritating problems already and hurry up with the plot. Any character development, epic moments or hot-blooded speeches would be seen by me as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm][narm]]: "was that meant to be taken seriously?", "oh, how adorable, this construct acts as if it's a real boy!". (It could be seen as me having an incredibly poor ability to suspend disbelief when it comes to people: I have no such problem with blatant physics violations, as example.) If the main characters are important to the plot, it would almost certainly make any ending unsatisfactory.

Which implies that almost every time I put myself into the character's place and expect to /do better/, I stop caring about the plot.^{1} Considering what most of "normal" media consist of... It's no surprise that I seemed used to not even bothering with /modeling/ characters of works I read/watch, opting to simply witness sequences of events: it's not like I was missing anything. I didn't usually pick sides, either, I was as happy with villains winning as I was with heroes. (Which was the case since childhood. It had interesting consequences for my attitude towards fiction and the world in general, but that's beyond the scope of this post.)

Rational fiction was a... rather refreshing experience. Discovering it was purely a good thing: while some other people were "ruined" by it, so to speak, being unable to enjoy "normal" fiction afterwards, I didn't lose anything, since I already /was/ ruined.

Another reason is that I like interesting, unique plots, characters and settings. While deconstruction and avoidance of clich√© are not /fundamental/ properties of rational fiction as I see it, a strong correlation exists all the same, which is a nice bonus.
