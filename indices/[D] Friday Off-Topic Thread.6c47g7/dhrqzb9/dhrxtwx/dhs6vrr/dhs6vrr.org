Fun fact about Worm: during at least some of the major fights, including Leviathan, Wildbow rolled dice to see who would die. Taylor nearly did, and if she had then the story would probably have continued with Aegis, if I remember correctly. Either way, it certainly wasn't 100% that Taylor was going to beat Sophia.
