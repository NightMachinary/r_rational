Has anyone here read the rationalish Narnia fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/1/Chanson-de-Geste][Chanson de Geste]]? I can't remember how I found it, maybe related to a [[/u/tk17studios]] post listing heroes that included Edmund, but it's really good and I was surprised to not see it mentioned around here before. Maybe it was and I just missed it.

Anyway if you're looking for great Narnia fiction, particularly about Edmund and the Witch, check it out. It's fairly short (for an online story, so 70k words), I read it as a quick break between Naruto fanfics (finished Time Braid, halfway through Team Anko now) and really enjoyed it.
