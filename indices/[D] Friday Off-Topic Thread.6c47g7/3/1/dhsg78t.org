I read and very much enjoyed it. A little more background for anyone interested: it's set post 'The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe' with the four Pevensie children still in Narnia and acting as Kings & Queens. However, it's a darker and more mature take on things, with war, politics and subterfuge all playing major roles.
