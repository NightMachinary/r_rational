I challenge you to a pokemon battle!

I have both an on-cartridge team (although admittedly it's not very well fleshed out) and a [[https://play.pokemonshowdown.com][pokemon showdown]] team.

I'll be open after ~10:30 GMT tonight (for americans, that's ~5:30 CST)

So for anyone else that plays pokemon, hit me up!

...and if you don't, I'd recommend checking out pokemonshowdown anyways. Pokemon is a surprisingly strategic game.
