Most effective at achieving what goals under what limitations? A good program for someone looking to become a competitive ultramarathoner with 20 hours each week to devote to training will look different to one aimed at building a general strength base for powerlifting with 3 hours available each week, which will be different from someone hoping to perform better at adventure sports w/ 60 hrs per week free, etc. And the [[http://www.drmichaeljoyner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/twins-533x1024.png][outcomes under each]] can be quite different, too.

Regardless, if you recognize that you're susceptible to analysis paralysis, I'd say just pick a popular program (e.g. a beginner's lifting program, a C25K type thing, etc.) and try it out. "The best exercise regime is the one you actually do" and all, assuming you don't start out trying to free solo big walls and die a few hours in. Take it slow and and you'll learn more as you go along.

As for exercise(/nutrition) science, it's hard to get 5 sigma confidence or whatever 'cos humans are complex and coordinating sophisticated, high sample longitudinal experiments is costly. I'd say start by looking at the top posts in fitness specific subreddits (e.g. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/top/?sort=top&t=all]], but see also [[/r/running]], [[/r/weightroom]], [[/r/bodyweightfitness]], etc.). I've read some good summaries (and decent original work) by people like Greg Nuckols ([[http://gregnuckols.com/]], see also [[https://www.strongerbyscience.com/]]), Layne Norton ([[https://www.biolayne.com/]]), Bret Contreras ([[https://bretcontreras.com/]]) and others (e.g. I'm not as big of a fan, but given where we are something like [[http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/]] could be appropriate to mention too). Diving into the primary lit would be a bit too much where you are right now, imo.

For general fitness, though, I'd say just get out there and do (not dangerous) stuff. Try to find activities that use your whole body, and keep track of some quantifiable (or at least qualifiable) metric (speed, weight lifted, difficulty surmounted, etc.) to make sure you're going somewhere. If something's difficult or tricky try to look up how to do it correctly, and if something hurts back up and assess what you're doing wrong, preferably by asking people who know more than you about that thing and with video documentation of yourself engaged in the activity. Ideally find something active you enjoy doing so it feels less like a chore -- hiking/trailrunning are a popular suggestions there, as are different team sports.
