Find a mode of cardio your body can tolerate and do it for 30-60 minutes at a time, regularly throughout the week. Repeat until your body can tolerate more and harder cardio. Work your way up to running.

Just keep sticking with it. Exercise is simple but difficult when you're starting, and then gets simple but easily doable as you improve.

I've also heard high-intensity interval training can give improvement in a shorter exercise session, but I've got no evidence for that.
