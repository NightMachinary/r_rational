Honestly, one of the best ways to exercise is to just pick a sport and start playing. I'd suggest a martial art or another competitive 1v1 sport just because those end up having mind games at a mid to high level and I know people on this subreddit love those. I chose fencing myself, mainly because swords. Fencing also has the benefit of being able to read an actual real life munchkin story in Épée 2.0, where Johann Harmenberg broke the sport for a few years.
