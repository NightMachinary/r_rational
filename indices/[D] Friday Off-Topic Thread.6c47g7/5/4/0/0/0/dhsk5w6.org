  ... while the metabolic rate of /resting/ muscle isn't as high as previously thought, the metabolic rate of /recovering/ muscle means that people with more muscle mass are going to burn more calories in the post-exercise period.

I think that's where the confusion lies. If you lift weights 4 or 5 days a week every week for several years, then for all intents and purposes your "resting" metabolic rate /is/ your "recovering" metabolic rate; as long as you're working out with proper intensity and frequency, you're never going to not be in a recovery period.

In the end, regardless of semantics, your body will be burning more calories while you sit on the couch than it would be burning if you didn't lift weights.
