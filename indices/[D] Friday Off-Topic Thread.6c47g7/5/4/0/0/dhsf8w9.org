It's well known that it takes a higher BMR to support muscle than fat; here's an article that seems well-cited: [[https://muscleevo.net/muscle-metabolism/]]

(note that the article is saying that the benefits are overstated, but a pound of muscles burns 3x more calories than a pound of fat regardless; but 10lbs of muscle will only earn you another 60 calories which isn't even an apple's worth. But that doesn't count the calories you burn doing the actual exercise. Still, over the course of a week that will earn you 420 calories which isn't bad. My half-hour-each-way cycle commute earns me about 250cal per day.)
