This thing obviously isn't possible in our universe, at least it's very, very unlikely, so maybe the difference in the laws of physics causes this stable feedback loop in this universe? If something like this turned out to be true, it would have *huge* implications on the information theory and it's hard to know without further study what the ramifications would be.
