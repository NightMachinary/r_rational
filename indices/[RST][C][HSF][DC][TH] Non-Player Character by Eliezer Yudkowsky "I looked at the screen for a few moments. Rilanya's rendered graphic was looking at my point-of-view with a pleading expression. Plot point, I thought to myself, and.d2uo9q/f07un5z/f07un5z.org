  The sequence of reactions is a cliche: Am I dreaming? Am I hallucinating? This can't possibly be happening! No, wait, here's an implausibly twisted scientific explanation for it... And meanwhile, the main character sensibly accepts the existence of magic and begins reasoning from that premise, adapting to the new world.

  But no matter how often authors write that into that stories, it still isn't how things go in real life. In real life, if you encounter an anomaly, it will in fact have a rational, scientific explanation. In real life, if you behave like the doubting rationalist of ten thousand science fiction stories, you will not have your blood drained by vampires; instead you will win the bet.

This seems weird coming from the same person who wrote the first chapters of HPMOR - where Harry's adoptive father plays /exactly/ this role, and Harry is the open minded protagonist. The whole point isn't necessarily to think that the incredible occurrence has literally /no/ internal consistency and is thus magic, as in, entirely untethered from any and all laws of logic and nature (how would that even work?). Rather, it's not to be doggedly skeptic to the point you believe anything you're witnessing must be just the improbably complex consequence of laws you already know rather than the evidence of laws you don't know yet.

If you see that Mercury's orbit has a bit of an odd precession that doesn't quite square with Kepler's laws, you can start positing the existence of a complex, hitherto unseen host of other celestial bodies that somehow make it be that way... or just decide that perhaps gravity doesn't work quite how you /thought/ it did.

Of course it's not always the right approach - sometimes things really are complex consequences of known laws. But in order to find out when they're not you need to be at least vaguely open to the possibility. The hypothetical magic would be just that - more rules, a higher order of laws to the universe. There must be a threshold that makes you decide that, yes, new laws are needed to explain this, rather than just cobbling together unlikely explanations with the ones you are familiar with.
