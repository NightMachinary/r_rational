1. I think it won't have much influence on the story... 2, 3. Anyway, is it really so hard for current neural nets to classify emotions from text? To parse few keywords like "I'm so afraid", "I feel lost", etc and add appropriate prerendered actions? I think one of main ideas here that it's much easier to simulate emotions based on input background and context than to make program really "feel". But then, what will mean "really feel"?
