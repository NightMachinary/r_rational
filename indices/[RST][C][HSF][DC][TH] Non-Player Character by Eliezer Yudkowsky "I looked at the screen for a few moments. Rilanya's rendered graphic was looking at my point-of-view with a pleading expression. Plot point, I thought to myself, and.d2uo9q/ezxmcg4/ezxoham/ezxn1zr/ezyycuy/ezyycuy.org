Few my remarks: 1. Darin could search text log of ingame dialogs for "NPC" word to start all this. Or Mark didn't really said it, she just guess, and he didn't remember. 2. Probably that program interface allow to choose emotions and motions, not only dialogs. And no need in motion capture, animation could be prerendered. 3. Chat bots are really good even now. And with help of human it's not a surprise that they can pass Turing test
