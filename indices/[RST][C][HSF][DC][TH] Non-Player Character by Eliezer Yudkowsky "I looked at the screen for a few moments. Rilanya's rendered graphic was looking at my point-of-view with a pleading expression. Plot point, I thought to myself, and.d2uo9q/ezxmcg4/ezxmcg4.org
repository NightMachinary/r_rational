From EY's Afterword:

#+begin_quote
  In the real world I will not find a magical portal in my closet and I won't be faced with that dilemma. It's like asking, "Well, but what should I think if a fair coin does come up heads a million times in a row?" The answer is that it won't! Nor shall I write about how, if I did encounter a magical portal, I could consider rational explanations such as hallucinating, being in the Matrix, and so on. There's no need to make up excuses for an event that I don't predict will happen, nor to reason from abduction on a false hypothesis.

In other words, finding oneself obviously in a genre story after living one's whole life in an apparently material/rational world is not an expectation we in this universe should anticipate as a potential future event.
