It's not as rare as you may think. "WTF is it?" events happens with noticeable probability in the real life. Right off the bat I can remember three events which happens to me

Reflection of invisible man (this was most memorable)

In the train window I see reflection of man sitting near me. I look at the train seat and see that no one sitting near me. >! I look interchangeably at the window and train seat all the 3 seconds until train start moving and I see that man is actually standing behind the window on the platform !<

Bright red short line in the morning sky

That was easy - it was edge of red sun shining through the edge of cloud. Cloud was the same color as sky and was difficult to see.

Luminescent green triangle growing in the night sky. Next night there was a luminescent green cloud in the same place in the sky.

That was really difficult to untangle - at the end it was found out it was a series of missiles (tactical or ballistic) launched from the nearby testing ground.
