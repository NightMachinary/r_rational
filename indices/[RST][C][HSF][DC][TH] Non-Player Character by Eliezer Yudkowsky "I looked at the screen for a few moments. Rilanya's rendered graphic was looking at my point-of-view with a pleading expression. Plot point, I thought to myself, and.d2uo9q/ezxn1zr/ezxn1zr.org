A couple thoughts.

First, Janey's explanation doesn't really make sense.

#+begin_quote
  Janey chuckled. "Sure. I'd say: 'You almost died to save me, Darin. You did something-or-other.' And Rilanya would say: 'You almost died to save me, Darin. You stepped in front of a flamestrike for me.' Most of the time I didn't even need to think of anything because the AI came up with a perfectly good response on its own; I just read the proposed text and hit return."
#+end_quote

That's well and good for in-game experiences, but let's go back to the beginning:

#+begin_quote
  Rilanya's figure took a deep breath and leaned close to my point-of-view. Her animated lips moved and her voice issued from my headphones: "What's an NPC?"

  "What?" I said, out loud. Then I started laughing.

  Rilanya went on talking. "In the tower of Ashel, when you rescued me from the prison chamber... the guards were dead outside my door. I'd never seen blood before. And you said... I remember your exact words... 'Don't worry, babe, they were only NPCs.' And then that time in the tavern, when that man only wanted to talk about the Plaited Road, you said... 'Guess the NPCs here aren't programmed for deep conversation, huh?' You use that word... the same times when I get that feeling, that all the people around me are only shadows."
#+end_quote

How could Janey even know that Darin had ever mentioned NPCs to Rilanya? It seems like a necessary factor for that conversation even to begin.

I mean, Janey spending the time to learn how to imitate the character, reading back the game history in detail, and coming up with all of the lines on her own, not to mention the motion capture required... that would make a kind of sense (although putting that kind of effort into a prank borders on obsession).

But there's a chicken-egg scenario going on here as to how this conversation even gets started without Janey already knowing how to start it.

--------------

Second, while I agree that Darin is far too credulous as to the existence of an emotionally-complete AI (come on, it was obviously the girlfriend as early as "Do you love her?" if not earlier), I don't like EY's afterword.

Let's ignore that bit above and assume that Janey's program works exactly the way she describes. EY is describing an AI that would /pass the Turing test./ And not just textually: it can interpret natural language text and deliver it with visual and audio patterns that are /also/ indistinguishable from those of a human.

EY says, himself:

#+begin_quote
  The balance of abilities displayed by the AI technology in this story is not very plausible. I don't think you can get that level of realism by describing sadness as one floating-point number. Similarly, AI capable of flawlessly understanding and rephrasing Janey's spoken prompts is the kind of technology you'd expect to see six months before the Singularity, if then.
#+end_quote

...after mocking Darin for believing that Rilanya might actually be a real AI with real emotions.

For context, EY puts himself in the [[http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/schools/][Intelligence Explosion]] school of Singularity thinking, which is:

#+begin_quote
  If technology can significantly improve on human intelligence -- create minds smarter than the smartest existing humans -- then this closes the loop and creates a positive feedback cycle.
#+end_quote

Janey has made some remarkable claims about the methods being used to create the illusion of sapience in the AI program. If they're true, then, by EY's own admission, technology levels are probably just about at Singularity levels, and humans probably have already developed decent brain-computer interfaces and are nearly ready to boost our own intelligence.

Yes, Darin is too credulous /during/ the conversation; a good actor could probably immerse themselves in Rilanya's character, and the game's transcripts, for a week and pull off the same prank without any reliance on AI at all. But, once the curtain is pulled back and the method behind the trick is revealed, I don't think Darin's belief that a program that so convincingly "parsed the speech, determined the intended emotional and informational content, and operated Rilanya accordingly and in character," again, to the point of passing the Turing test on a textual, aural, and visual level, and to the point where /we're almost at brain-upload level of technology/, *might* have some form of sapience.
