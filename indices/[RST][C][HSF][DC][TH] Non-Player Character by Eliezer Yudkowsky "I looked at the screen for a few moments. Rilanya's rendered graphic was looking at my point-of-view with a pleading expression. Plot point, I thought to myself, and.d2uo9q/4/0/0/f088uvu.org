My point is, there's only so much weird shit you can witness and observe having an effect on the world before it becomes a serious option to just start considering the possibility of the existence of laws you don't know about.

You're not abandoning science and reason, it's the other way around, science has always been all about finding explanations for weird inexplicable shit. We perhaps tend to forget that because we live in an era in which most of the as of yet inexplicable has been pushed millions of light-years away from us, or billions of years in the past. When Rutherford saw a thin foil of gold bouncing back alpha particles, that was absolutely incredible. When Michaelson and Morley found no one direction for the flow of the aether, that was baffling. All of these things were explained by looking beyond and finding new rules, and anyone who'd tried to explain them without that would have just come up with contrived excuses.

Of course, in practice, it should take /a lot/ to convince you that one such revision is needed. But "a lot" is exactly what these fictional characters usually experience first hand.
