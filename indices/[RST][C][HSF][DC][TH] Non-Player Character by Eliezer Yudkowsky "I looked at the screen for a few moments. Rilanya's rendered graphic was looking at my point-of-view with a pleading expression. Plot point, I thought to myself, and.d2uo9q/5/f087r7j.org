  And if a magical portal appears in my closet tomorrow? Will I still hold to my brave statements, or will I, even faced with definite disproving evidence, go on behaving like the desperate pseudo-rationalist clinging to his now-dead theories? But asking that question is, itself, generalization from fictional evidence. In the real world I will not find a magical portal in my closet and I won't be faced with that dilemna. It's like asking, "Well, but what should I think if a fair coin does come up heads a million times in a row?" The answer is that it won't! Nor shall I write about how, if I did encounter a magical portal, I could consider rational explanations such as hallucinating, being in the Matrix, and so on. There's no need to make up excuses for an event that I don't predict will happen, nor to reason from abduction on a false hypothesis.

I don't think this is how reasoning about counterfactuals is supposed to go.
