1. Sure, Janey /could/ have read/searched the logs first, but then why not say that rather than "the AI searched through your history and came up with a good example?"
2. That's not how Janey explained it. "...the AI parsed the speech, determined the intended emotional and informational content..." The engine was determining the emotions and motions, not Janey.
3. Yes, and EY has even pointed that out above with STP-2, but there's a massive gap between being able to fool a human with text, and being able to fool them with text, audio, and video, while imitating the delivery of a specific actor performing a specific character. It's the difference between being able to unlock a phone by recognizing a specific face, and painting that same face in the style of a particular artist so well that an art critic believes that artist painted it.
