Stunning Voldemort incapacitated Harry for a while, too. And even if not, 36 somniums, at a minimum, before a single one managed to swap hands and fight back? The only semi-non-lethal takedown I could think of was to transfigure a small amount of FOOF, or anti-matter directly into their wand hands, so the wands would be destroyed too.
