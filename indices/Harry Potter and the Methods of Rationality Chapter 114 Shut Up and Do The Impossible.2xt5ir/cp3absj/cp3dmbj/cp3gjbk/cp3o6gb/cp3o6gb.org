He is completely magically drained after finishing up with voldy. There is no way he would have been able to cast 36 sleeping spells and be able to get tourniquets on them (also I doubt his healing kit has 36 tourniquets in it) before they bleed out. Also, it was the plan he came up with after only 60 seconds to think about it. If he had weeks to plan it /might/ be legitimate to criticize him for not being batman, but he came up with a plan that would take out someone who had personally killed 107+ people in private and was planning on overthrowing the world's government and going to war against muggles. 36 not-so-innocent lives are worth much less than the hundreds if not more lives that would be ruined under voldy's rule.
