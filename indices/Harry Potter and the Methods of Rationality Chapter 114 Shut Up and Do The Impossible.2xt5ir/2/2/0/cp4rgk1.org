  *Purim* (/ˈpʊərɪm/; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language][Hebrew]]:  פּוּרִים (help·info) /Pûrîm/ "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition][lots]]", from the word פור /pur/, related to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language][Akkadian]]: /pūru/) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays#Purim.E2.80.94Festival_of_Lots][Jewish holiday]] that commemorates the deliverance of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews][Jewish]] people in the ancient [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire][Persian Empire]] where a plot had been formed to destroy them. The story is recorded in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketuvim][Biblical]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther][Book of Esther]] (/Megillat Ester/ מגילת אסתר in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language][Hebrew]]).

  According to the Book of Esther, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman_(Bible)][Haman]], royal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier][vizier]] to King [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahasuerus][Ahasuerus]] (presumed to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I][Xerxes I]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia][Persia]] ), planned to kill all the Jews in the empire, but his plans were foiled by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai][Mordecai]] and his cousin and adopted daughter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther][Esther]], who had risen to become Queen of Persia. The day of deliverance became a day of feasting and rejoicing.

  Based on the conclusions of the Scroll of Esther ([[http://tools.wmflabs.org/bibleversefinder/?book=Esther&verse=9:22&src=HE][Esther 9:22]]): "[...] that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor." Purim is therefore celebrated among Jews by:

  - Exchanging reciprocal gifts of food and drink known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishloach_manot][mishloach manot]]/

  - Donating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah][charity]] to the poor known as /mattanot la-evyonim/

  - Eating a celebratory meal known as a /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seudat_mitzvah#Seudat_Purim][se'udat Purim]]/

  - Public recitation ("reading of the megillah") of the Scroll of Esther, known as /kriat ha-megillah/, usually in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue][synagogue]]

  - Reciting additions, known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_HaNissim][Al HaNissim]]/, to the daily [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah][prayers]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkat_Hamazon][grace after meals]]

  Other customs include drinking wine or any other alcoholic beverage, wearing of masks and costumes, and public celebration.

  Purim is celebrated annually according to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar][Hebrew calendar]] on the 14th day of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Months][Hebrew month]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adar][Adar]] (and on Adar II in Hebrew leap years that take place every 2 to 3 years), the day following the victory of the Jews over their enemies. In cities that were protected by a surrounding wall at the time of the Biblical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua][Joshua]], Purim is instead celebrated on the 15th of the month of Adar on what is known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim#Shushan_Purim][Shushan Purim]]/, since fighting in the walled city of Shushan continued through the 14th day of Adar. Today, only [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem][Jerusalem]] and a few other cities celebrate Purim on the 15th of Adar.
