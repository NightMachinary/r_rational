I enjoy Delphic because it is an enjoyable, "what if" scenario. What would one do in a situation where you can view anything past or present. How would you prevent knowledge of your talent getting out. It recently entered back into my memory given the current situation in Good Student, which is currently dealing with a remarkably similar situation.

Also the author [[/u/9adam4]] has poignant details that stick out in their writing, food scenes in particular. If I can find some quirk of an author's writing I like, I'm hooked for more. It is that little spark of genius or well-executed creativity that keeps me going, knowing that with enough nurturing, it will become a nice fire.
