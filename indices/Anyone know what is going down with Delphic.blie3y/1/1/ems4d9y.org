One of Hector's major faults is that using his view has distanced his sense of personal danger. He often doesn't feel that his actual body is in danger from something since his "view" is never in danger. So he doesn't react appropriately to threats or consider that people might actually be targeting him. His friend being a spy was just part of that. It's just something he never considered might happen and was thrown in his face when he figured it out.

I'm personally not a big fan of the current story arc with Kim. It kinda feels like it's getting away from the "superhero" part of the story and into too much romantic character development.
