Totally agree with you. Reactions in Delphic are reasonably subdued. Compared to, I'm really sorry about this, Chinese webnovels, they are a fresh air. I'm tired of characters who immediately plot for revenge on the slightest slight. Over the top reaction should be saved for over the top urgency (LOL, is that a phrase?).
