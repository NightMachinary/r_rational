Not trying to hijack your post but would you recommend delphic? I couldn't get the part where they found out that his best friend of many years was a spy and the cheesy introduction to all his real life friends. Felt kind of barebones. I also didnt like how the a zcientist stated that its impossible for a super power that deals with the brain/intelligence but delphic is obviously one example of one.
