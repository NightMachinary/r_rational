I don't see the emotional impact here. It was too easy and just gives the feeling of them not being important in the fic anyway. If there was a chapter for team Sakura before this test, it would have been way different.

It's still cool to actually have the "good guys" take real damage. Now if author would just kill Naruto off and make this Avenger-Hinata-fic...
