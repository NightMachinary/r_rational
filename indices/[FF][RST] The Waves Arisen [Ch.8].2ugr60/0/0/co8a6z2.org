My thoughts exactly. I was enjoying this fic enough that I didn't care that it seemed to be turning into a fix-fic. This chapter was going along in the same pattern, Naruto's team casually winning with no real struggle, and then a large number of likable secondary characters are just wiped out. No plot armor for anyone! I like it like that.
