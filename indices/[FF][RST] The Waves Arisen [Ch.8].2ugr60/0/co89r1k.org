Good lord. That was.. something.

A plan working out flawlessly and quickly, which may or may not be the first time I've ever read that happen.

/Three/ teams making it out of the forest, with everyone else likely dead, just like that.

The sheer callousness of the ninja - the chuunin and the cloud ninja in particular.

The casual, instant death of the cloud girl.

It's.. it's like this isn't even shonen! Amazing!
