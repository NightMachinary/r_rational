Pfth. Sure you can. Doing better than this crapsack social settlement is not even remotely difficult. They are currently running casualty rates comparable to... communist cadre during stalin's purges? Except, it's the norm, not the reign of terror of any individual.

And that doesn't follow inevitably from chakra use - we hand out multi-tonne high speed vehicles to essentially everyone, and they are hardly ever used as weapons. Some places literally give everyone actual weapons, and those also don't turn into bloodbaths.

This world is the result of malign social engineering. The tailed beasts are not really the problem, the social structure is, to an extent that is just ridiculous.

The trick is to avoid the fate which befell Naruto's isolationist kinsmen - Presumably they were destoyed because it was feared that by the simple expedient of just, you know, /not/ murdering their children in droves, they would eventually be back with numbers that could not be fought. So, in order to do this right, you need to arrange to not be findable at all. Or to be thought dead. Or alternatively, be in a place where you cannot be realistically followed/attacked, even if found.
