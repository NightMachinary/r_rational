Everyone is failing very hard at rationality - given this social structure, the only reasonable course of action is to flee. The planet, if possible.

I'm not even joking. Remember that anti-social branch of Naruto's family that went to live on an island to be left the fuck alone? Right idea, insufficiently extreme execution. They are living in a world in which it seems like someone systematically rigged... well, life.. to suck.

The rational move in this game is not to play - Focus on utility-techniques for chakra and found a village which is well and truly /hidden/. I'd suggest burrowing into the bedrock a couple of miles under the artic, or researching travel techniques to bail on the planet.
