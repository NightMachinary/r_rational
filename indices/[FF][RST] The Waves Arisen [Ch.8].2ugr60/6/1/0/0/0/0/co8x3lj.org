There are two differences between invented pronouns and singular they; the most important is that everyone uses singular they without thinking about it, and invented pronouns only people who are specifically thinking about it use them. The second is that they is an indeterminate form rather than a determinate nonbinary form, which invented pronouns might not have been in theory but definitely are in practice.

When Time Braid's author used singular they, I guarantee you they weren't thinking about it. They just wrote in natural language, and in places where they would use 'they' in speech, they used it in writing. Just like I did here; I don't know the author's gender, and it might be nonbinary, so 'he or she' is inappropriate, so I used they, like everyone else. Which includes y'ou, I guarantee it. It's been demonstrated before that even the most fervent haters of singular they still use it regularly in conversation.
