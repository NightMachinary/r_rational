Okay, but if it's your personal quirk and you acknowledge that it isn't wrong, you shouldn't use words like despicable to describe it. It bothers you, ok, but it's an established part of the language, theres no reason it should bother you more than any other word, if you can't get over it then sure, avoid it, but don't post judgemental opinions where you imply the author is somewhat making a mistake.
