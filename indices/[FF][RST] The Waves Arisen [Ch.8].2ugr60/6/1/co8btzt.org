[[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/dice][It's actually both!]]

#+begin_quote
  Historically, dice is the plural of die, but in modern standard English, dice is both the singular and the plural: throw the dice could mean a reference to two or more dice, or to just one. In fact, the singular die (rather than dice) is increasingly uncommon.
