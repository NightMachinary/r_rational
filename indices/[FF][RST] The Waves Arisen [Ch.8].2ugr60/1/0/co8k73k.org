  The rational move in this game is not to play - Focus on utility-techniques for chakra and found a village which is well and truly hidden. I'd suggest burrowing into the bedrock a couple of miles under the artic, or researching travel techniques to bail on the planet.

Who says the Uzumaki didn't do just that? Spreading rumors of their village's destruction after the fact, or maybe sinking it a la Atlantis?
