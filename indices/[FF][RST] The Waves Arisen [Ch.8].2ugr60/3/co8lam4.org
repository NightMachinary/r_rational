Prediction: everything just before the Rain team ambush is a genjutsu.

Circumstantial proof: Canon has a rain team with wide area genjutsu that was leading the original team + Kabuto in circles. Cloud were demonstrated too powerful in a previous fight, them losing a member in one is a bit far fetched, combined with the fact that Naruto's team won easily over both Rain and a cloud chunin, I call shenanigans. The chunin in charge of preliminaries, doesn't know Sasuke's name, which is weird because the story of Uchiha is well known in the Leaf village. Naruto's description of how wrong everything is going wrong, from dice rolling to chunin not giving a time to rest for Neji's team, or even letting Tenten leave on her own. And I think the dice rolled on Sasuke because the Rain wanted to see his techniques in action.

And seriously, everyone is to callous about death and suffering, this behavior makes sense in a warlike desperate situation, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, I can guess the author is making a point about power distribution between people, when some of those people can move mountains and therefore easily rule the normies.

EDIT: according to the following chapter I am in the wrong. Unidammnit Nappa.
