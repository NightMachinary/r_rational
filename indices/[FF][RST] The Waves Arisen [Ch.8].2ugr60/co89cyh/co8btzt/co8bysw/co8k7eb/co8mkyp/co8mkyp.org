Didn't someone invent "ze" and "zir" for just this purpose? I find the use of those invented words less confusing and cringeworthy than the use of singular "they". When I'm reading, though, I'm reading for entertainment, not moral satisfaction--and I /personally/ (though your own /personal/ opinion may differ) am disgusted (maybe "aesthetically" is a good word to use here, rather than "morally"?) whenever I see "they" used as a singular pronoun and am forced to mentally translate it into "he" or "she" (or "it" or "ze", if I'm in a moral mood) so that the sentence can make sense to /me./

(I've read [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314][a children's book from the early 1900s]] that uses "it" to refer to people of indeterminate gender, and find that to the most readable option, myself--but I guess you'd say that's dehumanizing for people of nonbinary gender, and I'll admit that it's confusing in some cases, so I usually stick to "he" and "she".)
