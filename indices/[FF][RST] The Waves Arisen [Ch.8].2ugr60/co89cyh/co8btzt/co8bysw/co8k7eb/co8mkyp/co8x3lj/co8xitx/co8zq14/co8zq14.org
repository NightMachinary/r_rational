  when I do, I consciously make a point of using "he" or "she" (though not "ze", and "it" only when I slip up) in preference to singular "they", and have done so for as long as I can remember.

I am not denying that you intend to avoid singular they. I am denying that you succeed. No one does, because it's too much an integrated part of English.
