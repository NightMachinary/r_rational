I'll admit to not having seen "ze" in use more than a handful of times, so I could be misunderstanding it.

I don't engage in very many oral conversations--but, when I do, I consciously make a point of using "he" or "she" (though not "ze", and "it" only when I slip up) in preference to singular "they", and have done so for as long as I can remember. In written conversations, I very often use "it" to refer to people of indeterminate gender.
