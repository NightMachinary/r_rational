I think the cloud ninja was overconfident because she was expecting Sasuke to be as weak as TenTen.\\
In canon at this point Sasuke was near exhausted, only had a two tomoe sharingan and was actively having to suppress using chakra to avoid having the cursed seal kill him, and he still won the preliminary match against the chakra draining ninja with some trouble.\\
In this story, Sasuke is fresh, has a 3 tomoe sharingan, and is boosting his power with the cursed seal. I'd expect him to easily beat anybody in the exam except for Naruto, Neji, and Lee.\\
Also the Byakugan should be able to see through a genjutsu like that.
