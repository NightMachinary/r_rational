I remember liking the earlier, longer and completed work by the same author - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] - very well.

It's been quite a few years, but if I recall correctly, it involves a nice culture clash between the two main characters (who find themselves fighting side-by-side) in regards to such points as to what constitutes acceptable levels of ruthlessness and overkill.

It was then quite disappointing to see the following fic - /Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure/ - abandoned so early.
