I think the common thread in a lot of commenters' reactions here is: /why?/ Why do you want to know how this subreddit thinks characters A and B would interact? Supposing you received an answer that you deemed satisfactory, for what purpose would you use that information? More to the point, /what makes you believe any of the people on this subreddit are more capable of answering this question than you are/? You presumably know more about these characters than we do, meaning you have more information than we do, meaning you should be in a better position to answer your own question than anyone here is. Honestly, right now it seems like you're just trying to get us to do your homework or something. (Emphasis on /seems/.) Maybe I'm completely misreading you, but if that's the case, so are a lot of other commenters--and you know the best way to avoid such misunderstandings? /Provide more information./
