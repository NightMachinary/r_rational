I agree, the context of their interaction is necessary to determine how they would interact. The question is essentially pointless to ask without that information. Especially because this is not the information that these characters have, they both absolutely /know/ their induvidual goals and motivations. While they also both have their own personal perspective of whatever situation they are in.

OP seems to be asking the question under the assumption that there exists a "perfect" or singular rational way in which these characters are able to act regardless of outside factors. Either that or he's asking how the audience would expect the characters to act in any situation which is a similalry useless question because in that case any answer is both right and wrong because not everyone will agree.
