Do they have to tolerate each other's presence for some time? Work together? Against each other?

I'm assuming either 1 or 2; in which case A occasionally would be grunting non-commitally to B's witticisms, B would be trying to ask some deliberately inane questions trying to make the routine more bearable. If faced with a problem, A would first wait to see how'd B go about solving it, and then silently solve it himself if B fails for some reason. If faced with unknown people, A would try to prevent B from accidentally stepping on someone's ego to prevent potential conflicts. If given enough time together, A would get somewhat used to B's not-as-clever-as-he-thinks remarks and rarely even add his own tries at jokes.

I think adding situational context info would help you get more\better answers.
