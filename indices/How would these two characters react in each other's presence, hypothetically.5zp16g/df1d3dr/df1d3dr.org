Sounds like a setup for a socratic dialogue (with person B being the author avatar, subverting person A which represents the audience's expectations)... with occasional reversal when the obvious and intuitive and conservative answer is actually the true one and the contrarian is wrong.

This could potentially be a pretty good [[/r/writingprompts]] post, I suggest reposting it there?
