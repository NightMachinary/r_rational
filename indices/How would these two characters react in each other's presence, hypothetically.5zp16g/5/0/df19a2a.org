  When you say, "weather[sic] or not person A is a fighter, is unknown," do you mean it's unknown to you, the author? This seems like an inexplicable oversight.
#+end_quote

I mean that it probably depends on the circumstances; even /he/ doesn't know weather he's a fighter. Regardless, I also wanted to highlight your second paragraph. I have /never/ heard of anyone who matches person B. Can you name anyone who matches him verbatim?
