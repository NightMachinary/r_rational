Flair checks out. Nice job Descartes. Regardless, homework? I'll tell you the same thing I told the other guy. Do not assume things. What I wanted to do was /see your opinions/. No homework, no judging, no /Oh your statement sucks/, no. None of that.

All I wanted to do was get your interpretation of my characters! This isn't some trick-question /gotcha!/ bullshit. There isn't a wrong answer.

Place them in any scenario you want. Imagine, if I thought of the character's personalities, why would be lazy and /not/ want to put them into a plot?

(As a side note, I place a high emphasis on vicarious knowledge!)
