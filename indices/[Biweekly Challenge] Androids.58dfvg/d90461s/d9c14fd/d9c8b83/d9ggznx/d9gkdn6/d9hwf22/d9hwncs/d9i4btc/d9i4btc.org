That's the only part of your story that /was/ clear to me, and it was clear that their specific origin doesn't matter. What isn't clear is what the androids are /actually doing/.

My best guess is that it's some kind of brainwashing? I can't think of any other way to explain how Herman both does and doesn't know about natural language processing. The android first gentleman speaking for the president makes more sense that way too. In this interpretation, the whole "we owe them our lives" thing is more manipulation, and this is a horror story.

It could have been a good horror story, leaving it unclear whether paradise is worth the manipulation... except it's not clear enough for me to be confident that that's what the story is about. Maybe you just meant for Herman to be unconfident without his moral support? Then the first gentleman thing was just to show how prevalent they are. In this interpretation, the androids really have helped people with their issues and made the world a better place, warranting the gratitude. Now it's a simple uplifting story.

You've written a story about the interactions of humans and androids, then made those interactions ambiguous, and left the outcomes ambiguous too. I have no idea what is actually happening, to the extent that I can't even tell the tone of the story. You've given me nothing solid at all to start imagining with. I'm just confused and unfulfilled.
