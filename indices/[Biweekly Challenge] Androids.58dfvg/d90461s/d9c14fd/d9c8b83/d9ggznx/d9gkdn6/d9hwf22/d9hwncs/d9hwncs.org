Thank you for the feedback. I'll have to think about this for a while.

Thought about it.

Would capitalizing "it", and starting the story with the line, "His order had arrived," have made it clearer?

I meant for it to be clear he has deep-seated issues of inadequacy, which his Ana resolves, and for which he ordered her. This means she knows how to make him feel wanted, and he knew she would be able to make him feel wanted when he ordered her.

If that much wasn't clear, then I failed. If rather the only vagueness is the origin of the Androids, then I succeeded -- and I need to think more about your experience.
