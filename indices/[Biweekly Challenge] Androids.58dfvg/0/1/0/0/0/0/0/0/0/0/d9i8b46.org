I once read that the writers of some TV series I've never seen (/Lost/, maybe?) thought hard about how to strike the right balance of questions and answers, since going too far in either direction makes the audience less engaged. The optimal point they found, as I recall, is one-to-one. For every mystery they solved, they would raise one new one, and for every mystery raised, they would solve one old one. I don't know how accurate that may be, even if my memory is correct, but I think it's a useful way to think about things regardless.

As it is, I have about as many questions as you have /paragraphs/, let alone plotpoints. The only good solution, I think, is for you to write a longer story that has, y'know... at least one non-mystery in it. I need a rock to start from.
