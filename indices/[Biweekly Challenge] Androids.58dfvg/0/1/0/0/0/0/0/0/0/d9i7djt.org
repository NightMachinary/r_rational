Yes! That uncertainty is exactly what I was going for.

As a layperson in that world, you'd see the same things and be just as uncertain whether the androids were a good or a bad influence. You'd see friends and acquaintances become even more competent or turn their lives around for the better, all because of the now ubiquitous influence of the androids. I wanted to convey that uncertainty with my story without giving any indication of what you, the reader, /should/ believe. Thus leaving it up to your own imagination. Your confusion is what you're supposed to start imagining with.

That you're unfulfilled is a serious problem, though, and I don't know what to do about that. Maybe change the radio broadcast to a morning talk show, with the hosts conveying the same news but also sharing that they're not sure what to make of the effect the android population has had on society in recent years? I think that would hint to the reader what they're supposed to think about after the story ends, though it sounds heavy-handed. While I suppose it's better to err on the side of making the directions clear, I wonder if there isn't a better way to create a sense of fulfillment.

P.S: Regarding natural language processing, Herman realizes he doesn't understand how it works on a technical level, which triggers his issue with inadequacy - that's all. Perhaps I could have made that clearer.
