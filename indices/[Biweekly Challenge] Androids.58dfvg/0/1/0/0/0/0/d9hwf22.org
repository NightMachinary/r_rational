I felt like the story was too vague. I wasn't able to have my imagination challenged by your story because it felt very obvious to me that you were intentionally being vague.

Imagine if someone told you "pick a number between one and ten", and no matter which number you replied with, they said "WRONG!". Trying to guess the truth of an overtly vague story like the one you wrote feels similarly pointless and frustrating, at least to me. I can't be meaningfully curious about something that is rigged to be unclear.
