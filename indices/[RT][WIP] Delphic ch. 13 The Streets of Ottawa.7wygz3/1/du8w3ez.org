Great read as always! You have Fray as Flay once.

This chapter got me thinking about the scale of powers we see in this universe. I'm used to things like Worm and X-Men, where most powers are fairly weak unless used correctly, with a few extremely powerful individuals mixed in. So far, the only powers we've seen in Delphic have been A-list--car-throwing superstrength and telekinesis, extremely fast flight/superspeed, flawless invisibility/invincibility, and of course Hector's unlimited retrovoyance. I wonder if there are shitty supers or ones even more epic than we've seen, or if for whatever reason everyone's powers are at about the same level.
