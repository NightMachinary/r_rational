The story has included weaker supers - all three of the Ottawa team members are very much on the weak side of what professional supers can do. I think there's a bias in my storytelling in that any Super Team is going to deploy their "heavies" in a wise way, and not tend to pit weak powers against something they can't take down.

Crappier powers also exist, but those people don't join super teams. We will see if I get a chance to introduce more of that in the story, or maybe as a subject for side chapters.
