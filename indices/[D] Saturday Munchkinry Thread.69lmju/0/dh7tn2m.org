[[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4xzmpe/wp_everyone_is_born_with_the_ability_to_skip/d6jsqc2/][(._.)]]

You have the ability to “skip time”. During a “skipping period” you're still experiencing everything yourself and with a fully conscious mind, but once you reach the pre-defined end point all that remains from the “autopilot” period is the dry knowledge. What doesn't remain is all the other changes that would've also otherwise happened to your brain and mind.

So, for instance, if you were to overwork yourself using this skipping technique you would not gradually become tired and depressed because of the lack of rest. And if you were to be tortured during a skipping, you would later have a normal recollection of everything that has happened to you during that period but you wouldn't develop PTSD because of the torture experience. The integration of the knowledge from a skipped period could be dangerous, but only as much as would've been watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j98QsMJXJEc][a perfectly realistic first-person VR film,]] or just watching someone else's memories.

1) How could this ability be used for maximal fun and profit if you were the only person who had it?

2) [..] if everybody had it?

3) In what ways would the society be different if everybody had it?
