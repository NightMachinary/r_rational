It would only be that temperature for a single Planck-moment, as energy migration from everything else began vibrating the atoms in the object.

That said, this is a source of infinite negentropy, given that you can use the power on an object of arbitrary size. Use it on, say, an asteroid in Earth orbit, and you could set up some kind of sterling engine to produce free energy. Even if this just moves energy elsewhere instead of removing it from the universe, you have essentially become a Maxwell's Demon and can, therefore, still produce negentropy.

Busted AF.
