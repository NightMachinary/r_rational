This is why all powers need to contain a caveat that they consume energy to use in an amount greater than or equal to the minimum amount of work they represent. This power should consume energy proportional to the size and amount of heat exchanged, telekinesis should consume energy proportional to the force output, telepathy and future predictions should require energy for the information, teleportation should require energy for kinetic and potential energy differences, etc...

Any power used by a person could draw energy from their metabolism, which provides both economic and practical limitations to how much they can use the power. Any power with a technological explanation could just use electricity.

Not only do these modifications make powers strain the laws of physics less and thus require less suspension of disbelief, but they make munchkinry threads more interesting than "Here's a power which accomplishes some task with no cost" -> "Here's free energy"
