I was thinking of Worm CYOAs and the way they had to balance the sudden, extreme leap in power levels late in the series.

[[http://imgur.com/a/ZmWe6][This]] is the latest Worm CYOA. It's pretty polished well balanced ..for the street level.

My question is twofold: how efficiently (i.e. lowest points count, ignoring obvious things like PtV) can this be munchkined to take out Scion and how useful would your build be if you got to bring it to our vanilla Earth?
