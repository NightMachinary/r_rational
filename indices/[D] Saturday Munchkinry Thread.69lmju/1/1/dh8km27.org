My initial build isn't very efficient and is probably overkill, but it was fun to come up with.

Path:

Conspirator: I'd prefer Rogue, to avoid any obligations, but the synergy with Iscariot is too good to pass up on.

Power:

Kingmaker: 10 points, but this allows me to earn a very lucrative income in two different ways. Firstly, I can detect potential parahumans. I'd probably offer this diagnosis at a reasonable price so that I can have a constant stream of people walking past me to detect if any have potential. It also seems like a good way to earn a positive reputation, and in the long run, having more capes seems like it should increase the odds of coming across a combination that can harm Scion. Interlude 13 gives a 1 in 8000 ratio for urban areas, so assuming I work 12-hour days, 6 days a week, and take 30 seconds to diagnose, I should find 1 potential parahuman every week, on average.

This would probably have to be affiliated with the PRT, so they can immediately offer their pitch to the prospective parahumans. Depending on the range and visibility of the power, it would be nice to be able to hide myself, so my clients can't see if anyone is doing the diagnostic.

Secondly, I can also offer a significantly more expensive power rental service, on the condition that the PRT is informed of the person and their chosen power (to avoid clients with villainous intent). I imagine rich people would be willing to pay a significant amount for up to 3x7 points worth of powers.

Replication: 10 points, but this allows my effectiveness to grow with time. Assuming each clone has its own set of limits for Kingmaker, I can eventually impart vast numbers of powers.

Followers:

Iscariot: To start with, having an insider in the PRT will be a great boon in getting my diagnostics and rental business approved, as well as giving me advance warning of any inbound threats. However, it also allows me to massively accelerate my diagnosis services. Each day, I'll ask my clients to assemble in separate batches, each of which will be at the upper limit of how many people I can diagnose in a day. I visit a different one in each of Iscariot's timelines, and pass on the list of potentials to her, so that even the ones I don't visit still get a diagnosis. This is the key feature of the build - depending on the logistics, there should be a very high upper limit on the number of people I can diagnose in a day, and my parahuman diagnostic rate should increase by at least an order of magnitude once this system gets established.

Taylor Herbert: I wanted to avoid taking her, but it just works far too well. Besides, I'm quite happy being a sidekick. I'm no tactician, and I'd be awful in a fight. However, Taylor plus Iscariot's simulations seems like a pretty powerful combination, and it opens up the best gift option.

Shard:

The outsider: 2 points, but that seems like a small price to avoid subconscious influence, start with a higher level and higher ceiling, and lack the limitations of the thinker.

Perks: Buying time gives me another 3 months of cape identification, and lets me give Taylor a head start on her development too. Carefree lets me ignore most of the setting and focus on replicating, earning a fortune discovering new parahumans and renting powers, and training. These cost 3 points in total.

Flaws: Identity Revealed, Kidnapping, and We Know all seem certain to come up for this concept, so they make sense to take. Wanted (ABB, E88, and the Merchants) can largely be mitigated by simply relocating elsewhere, I'll be travelling a lot anyway. Lastly, psychic nosebleed shouldn't cause me too much of a problem, as my abilities are largely passive, and I won't be the one doing the fighting when I push my powers to their limits. This gives me the additional 15 points to spend that I need.

Gifts: The Key. I'm assuming this doesn't include followers. Taylor's life is going to be even more miserable, with flaws of Identity revealed, Kidnapping, Bad reputation, Wanted (ABB, E88, and the Merchants), and Trouble magnet, for 16 points. Eh, she can probably handle it. In exchange, she gets Kingmaker, Replication, the outsider shard, and Manson Effect Bypass. One Taylor is powerful enough, but a growing number, able to impart 3x7 points of powers to themselves thanks to the bypass, each of which would also have no Manson effect either? That seems a little more powerful than the original.

To wrap up, I start on the day of Taylor's locker incident. Each week, I and Taylor will both replicate ourselves. The clones are sent out across the planet to identify latent parahumans at a rate of approximately 1 per week per clone, multiplied by 10 to account for Iscariot's simulations. Taylor prime will focus on training, with plenty of opportunities for life-or-death struggles thanks to her flaws. By the end of the 130-week period between Taylor's trigger event and the canon apocalypse, we should have identified about ((130 x 131)/2) x 2 x 10 = 170000 latent parahumans. Additionally, I'll have up to 130 x 3 x 7 x 5 = 13650 points of powers imparted to the 130 x 5 = 650 most skilled unpowered people I can find. There will be 130 copies of Taylor, each of which will have a flexible array of 3 powers of up to 7 points each, all of which can bypass the Manson effect.
