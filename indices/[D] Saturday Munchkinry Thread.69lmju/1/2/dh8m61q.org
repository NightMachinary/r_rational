Here's my second take, Inherit the Stars:

Path: Hero

Powers:

Quality assurance: 3 points, render an item unbreakable for a few hours

Power fluctuation: 5 points, modify nearby powers by 50-250%

Power hub: 3 points, benefit from nearby powers

Followers:

Satellite: A space tinker is awesome

Watchmaker: Reversing time for objects in an area sounds pretty useful for rocketry. Depending on how it works, this could either allow rockets that leave the area to be duplicated, or it could make repairing items much faster to allow rapid prototyping

Marduk: No gravity means rocketry becomes a lot more efficient

Outsider shard: 2 points, same reasoning as before

Perks:

Allies (Vista): 2 points, use spatial manipulation to get rockets to orbit even more efficiently

Flaws:

Identity revealed, Bad reputation, We know: 5 additional points

Gift:

The coin: Quality assurance 3, Warrior shard, Godslayer 5, Manton effect bypass 4, Blind spot 3, Identity revealed -1, Bad reputation -2, We know -2

How it works:

Use quality assurance to make Satellite's rockets unbreakable and so capable of being constructed far more efficiently. Use power fluctuation to boost the powers of Satellite, Marduk, Watchmaker, and Vista by 250%, and use power hub to assist with each of their powers. Use Marduk and Vista to get the biggest kinetic kill satellites into space as possible.

Once Earth's orbit is littered with these weapon platforms, toss the coin. Go to space with Satellite, use quality assurance on myself to become invulnerable. Use quality assurance on the kinetic kill projectiles to make them unbreakable and able to bypass immunity. Take advantage of the blind spot to surprise Scion with these projectiles.

Only Quality assurance and Godslayer are obligatory, the rest make sense to get everything set up. The vanilla Earth utility of vastly cheapened space travel should be obvious.
