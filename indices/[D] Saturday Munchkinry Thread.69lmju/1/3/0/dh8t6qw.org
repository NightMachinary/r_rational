Ooh, a real fan of this one. It's probably the cheapest heavy-hitter here too. Not sure what it means by "you will be completely unaffected by it" though? That might be a bit of a nerf, if it means that you go back to what you were doing at the time you jumped back to.

Maybe it just means that you remain safe (if you rewind past a fire you don't burn), I dunno.
