Other fun tricks:

Unlimited shard works + adaptation + paramount + Manson bypass: cycle through every power of 7 points or less, use them on yourself once each, then use them constantly, in order to become immune to all of them and have every one available at once

Experience exchange can be used to transfer Alecto's abilities to a more competent parahuman

Abilities like remote teleportation and ace that depend on your size might become a lot more powerful with final form

Do you even lift is based on the mass you are carrying, not its weight. Have Marduk touch the biggest container ship you can find in the bay, "carry" it, and benefit from being 2^{ship's mass in tons} times tougher.

Counter + glimpse + farseer gives you a good chance at detecting and reflecting almost any power, only subtle ones or mundane attacks should get through.

Instant acceleration + mountain allows you to always resume mountain's benefits as soon as the force on you is removed

Hindsight is a budget Path to Victory, as long as you can precommit to actions, see the consequences, then change your mind. It might need Protocols to work properly, though

Temporal leap + temporal bubble lets you leap back 5 minutes, activate the bubble, wait 10 subjective minutes inside the bubble that last only 1 minute outside, and repeat, in order to travel back in time an unlimited distance at a rate of -4 objective minutes per +15 subjective minutes. Might want immunity to aging, depending on how far you want to go. If you can take carried objects, you can duplicate single-use tinker items - pick up the item, leap back 5 minutes, pick up the item from 5 minutes ago, wait in the bubble for 10 subjective minutes, leap back again, and double the item once for every ~6 minutes you have access to it

Temperature immunity + temperature immunity + power fluctuation + Manson bypass allows you to modify temperatures by 125 degrees with no direct damage to yourself.
