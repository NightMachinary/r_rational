Rule-lawyer answer:

- 7 pts: Ace (with the power of Ace(with the power of Ace(with the power of Ace(with the power...))))

Other rule-lawyer answer:

- 10pts: Replication
- 10pts: Paramount

Create a clone, and have it use Paramount to choose Ace, (with Power Fluctuation to boost you by 250%, and Copycat, to copy your clone). This is the infinite Ace Recursion again, but with more powers.

Without that specific hack: Create two clones (in two weeks), have them use Paramount->Power Fluctuation to boost by 250% each. Use Paramount (which can now choose a power up to 7 * 5 = 35 points worth) to choose Path To Victory for a bit, then follow its instructions.

Real answer, assuming that they all synergize:

- 1pt: Phantom Punches
- 10pts: Combo
- 2pts: Vampiric Regeneration

Start punching Scion (at range), and keep punching him. Get help from a mover when he runs away. Moderately useful on Earth, but not much better than a gun, or possibly some artillery.
