Yup. I assumed that any real craziness would involve replication, though I honestly hadn't seen Paramount->Power Fluctuation until after I posted this. At this point it does seem to be the way to create an augmentation loop, since you can buff you(r clone's) buffing power even if you make generous assumptions like no infinite Aces or the buff in the case of Paramount is tied to the *time *to switch, not power cost. It hardly matters, at a certain point.

Funny,the CYOA right before this one,which was far more broken and didn't really care about balancing as much as this guy's, had the exact same problem.

Scion would splat the Phantom Punches combo in quick time though.
