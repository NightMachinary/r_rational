Worm: Pacifist Run

Path doesn't matter, followers don't matter. The Outsider shard fits thematically. Identity, kidnapping, wanted by everyone, and we know give the points needed and are soon rendered irrelevant by the powers. Take the book.

Take temporal leap and temporal bubble to go back in time 5 minutes, wait 1 minute in the bubble to recharge, and repeat. Go back in time to before Kevin Norton can have his chat with Scion. Wait for Scion to appear, and persuade him that the best way to get over Eden would be to go explore the universe outside the light cone of Earth. After the heat death of the universe, he can try something else.
