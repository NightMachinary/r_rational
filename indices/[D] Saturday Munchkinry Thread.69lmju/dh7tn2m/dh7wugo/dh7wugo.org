First off, I'd try switching models (without changing effects), to see if anything becomes clearer:

- You can make a certain stretch of emotions "temporary". They are experienced fully as they are happening, but at the designated end-point, all temporary emotions are deleted, leaving only their external effects (for a certain definition of "external").
- You can erase emotional experiences, but only by setting up the start/end points in advance.
- You can pass control of yourself to a perfect copy for a stretch of time, and get a report back of what happened at the end, though it is lacking in emotional detail.

Number 3 doesn't seem very useful to me, due to my philosophy on identity. #2 is better, but the perspective it takes on time is a bit wonky and unintuitive. #1 seems as useful as the "time skip" one IMO.

So, with that in mind:

- skip over work days (coming back for lunch, coffee, etc.) to avoid burnout, at the cost of having less connection to your coworkers and losing out on useful emotional warnings like frustration and jealousy.
- Be an impartial judge by skipping once per minute, and making yourself immune to appeals to emotion. This comes at the cost of being jaded, and also missing legitimate emotional arguments.
