  Monster respawns? Definitely, with human (or other races) settling in those areas where there are no monsters, or where sufficiently rare/powerful magic can be employed to remove the respawn effect

What? No!

Humans settle in areas /around/ the monster respawns. Gotta exploit that free XP source.

If there's an area where skeletons have a tendency to spawn, humans will want to wall off that area (or parts of it) and shoot the skeletons from a safe distance, or better, herd them into minecraft-style traps. If there's a spot where a single Silver Dragon repeatedly respawns, people might build a bunker with a bunch of ballistae / cannons near the spawn point.

(something similar was suggested a few times in Glimwarden discussions, I think)
