  Ones you think would be particularly challenging to bring in without warping the world beyond all reason?

I struggled to think of a way to make the "assignable devotion points for bonuses and abilities" aspect of Grim Dawn fit into a story. It's not overpowered, it's just hard to predict.

The [[https://grimdawn.gamepedia.com/Devotion][mechanism]] (in case you aren't familiar with it) is that you 'restore' or 'cleanse' shrines to get devotion points. You can use those points to fill out 'constellations', and a complete constellation gives you 'affinity' that unlocks further constellations.

That system seems like a pretty standard optimization problem for a game. It also makes intuitive sense that being devout might grant you boons from the gods. However, those two aspects of the devotion system are totally at odds with each other.

The problem is that the way players actually use this aspect of the game--shrines have nothing to do with specific gods or affinities, points are moved by consuming a resource dropped by enemies, and the best builds must respec devotion once initial affinity bonuses are no longer needed--this way of playing isn't really in step with being 'devoted' in a common-sense way. I struggled to depict it in my story (in which I tried to make all the game elements natural consequences of the world and less like arbitrarily-imposed rules).

The religious aspect is just flavor. It is difficult to predict the consequences of the mechanic on a world if it were implemented for all people just as it is implemented for the player.

I can imagine that 'builds' optimized for different bonuses or effects would proliferate, just like they do in discussions of the game online. Constellation decisions tend to change a lot when building a character, until something approaching optimal is validated; then they are never touched again. The demand for the respec resources could be immense or minimal, depending on how confident people are in their decisions, i.e., how much optimization they personally have to do before knowing a good constellation combination.

Information about which constellations are 'worth it' would be of great value. The citizens might not even know what the stars in their constellations are doing. "20% bonus to Aether damage" is kind of hard to distinguish if your Aether bonus is already in the 1000% range from your gear and abilities. One would hope that the critically endangered humans in the very dark Grim Dawn world would freely share information like that, once discovered, but having the factions and guilds jealously guard their knowledge of how best to use the constellation system is probably more realistic. Tribal concerns pop up everywhere. You can bet the fanatically anti-necromancer Cult of Kymon isn't going to approve of anyone whose devotion allows them to summon skeletons, and the Witch's Coven might not appreciate the constellations themed after their Wendigo enemies.

Also, choosing constellations is a matter of life or death. The constellations that grant immediate bonuses to defense, obvious shields, and healing are going to be more popular than the damage or summoning ones. (I think. It depends on how respawn mechanics work.) Collecting knowledge on constellations that require you to respec everything is a costly and risky endeavor that I don't think the average person can afford.

Predicting how these forces play out seems difficult to me, and possibly interesting.
