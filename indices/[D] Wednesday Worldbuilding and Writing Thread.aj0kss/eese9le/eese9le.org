Before writing /Worth the Candle/ I was working on a completely diegetic MMO world, one where all the common MMO game design tropes (parties, guilds, levels, crafting, skill trees, etc.) explicitly existed in-universe as part of the texture of the world, known to the inhabitants. Most of those would be recontextualized as magic of one kind or another; there's a specific spell that everyone knows which will put them into or remove them from a party, another spell that will structure a guild, and so on. This has some (IMO) neat knock-on effects. For example:

A party consists of a minimum of three people and a maximum of seven people. Parties are formed by mutual consent, such that you have to consent to being in a party, can leave at any time, and can be kicked by a majority of the party. It's common for magical effects to extend only to party members. Party members always know where you are at any given time. Party members can also telepathically communicate with you. You can only party with people in close physical proximity, but the party connection will persist even if you move far away.

This works fine for adventuring parties, which is the intended purpose ... but /families/ end up using it too, so that a parent can keep track of their children. It's also a tool of managers to keep track of their employees and communicate with them at a distance, either on a permanent basis, or with the party created at the start of the day and dissolved at the day's end. There can be networks of parties to take advantage of the telepathy, meaning that a party of messengers can potentially get a message to six other extremely distant locations, and other parties of messengers at that location might mean that with 7 parties of 7 you can get the message to ~40 places at once (albeit with a lot of setup). Prisoners can also party with guards (presuming that the spell defines consent in such a way as to allow coercion) as a way of depriving them of the advantages of a party, as well as to monitor them (they can drop from the party whenever they please, but that's still a useful canary).

Other MMO game design tropes that you think would be interesting to make an explicit part of the world? Ones you think would be particularly challenging to bring in without warping the world beyond all reason?
