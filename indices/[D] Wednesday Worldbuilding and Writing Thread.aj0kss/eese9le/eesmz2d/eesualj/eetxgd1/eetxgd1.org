  We can maybe curb the effects slightly if we posit that there's some non-trivial cost to the resurrection-at-a-safe-place spell (aside from just the time taken to run back), but it's still a lot to take in.

There will be a cost, because whichever nation built it will want their money back. You'll respawn inside some sort of prison complex, from which you can only be released once a friend or relative (you /do/ get a phone call) pays the Respawn Cost, which is exorbitant. (Alternatively, you /could/ use your one phone call to get a lawyer to make alternate arrangements - or you /could/ try to break out, but then you get a warrant issued for your arrest).

If you didn't want to pay the Respawn Cost, the administrators say, you shouldn't have gone and got yourself killed.

Spies, on the other hand, can presumably tie themselves to their own nation's Respawn Point and kill themselves to snap back there if they've got an urgent message to bring home. (That is, if they can't just communicate it to a party member back in HQ).

If stuff that was with you when you died is lost forever if you die again before retrieving it, then that makes an interesting way of permanently destroying something (like secret documents) - if, on the other hand, it is simply returned to the real world at the place you were killed when you're killed again, then that adds another interesting wrinkle to spy dramas - a spy, almost caught, might suicide to get home and then have to return to the site of his suicide in order to obtain something secret /before/ he gets killed again (while the enemy country wants to kill him again in order to obtain whatever secrets he had at the time).
