NPCs don't exist, at least within the fiction of the world; part of the "point" is to make everything a player would experience be equivalent to everything that a real person that exists in that world experiences. Obviously if you were making it into a real game you would likely need NPCs, but they're not a part of the fiction, in part because I don't find them to be terribly interesting.

(If they were part of the world, they would be as immobile, ineffable spirits with particular wants and needs that could be satisfied by giving them goods or providing them with services. For example, a spirit that would give you a copper piece for an apple, with a limitless supply of copper pieces and inability to be satisfied with any number of apples. This creates some economic distortions and allows things like, for example, the creation of apple orchards right next to the right NPC, which is only mildly interesting to me.)

Monster respawns? Definitely, with human (or other races) settling in those areas where there are no monsters, or where sufficiently rare/powerful magic can be employed to remove the respawn effect (it should probably be taken as a given that the static nature of MMO worlds is an artifact created by the costs of limited developer/artist time/budget, though maybe you'd be tempted to leave it in if you were going to properly explain every element of the game design).

Player respawns? Probably, though I'd want to have it tweaked as much as possible so that it's interesting, and so that there's a great element of risk/tension than there is in a typical MMO. If we /also/ take as a given that MMO worlds are supposed to represent larger worlds than they actually are (e.g. Stormwind is supposed to be a city of thousands rather than dozens), then maybe "death runs" where you have to get back to your corpse (with all your stuff) actually do represent a significant malus, days of travel rather than minutes. "Your stuff stays on you when you die and can't be recovered by anyone else" is an interesting trope as well, but hard to reconcile.

How about this: there exists a spell which will bind all of your personal possessions to you, so long as they stay within a meter of you. It takes twenty minutes to perform. When you die, all your bound possessions will be shunted into an extradimensional space, awaiting your return (or failing your return, they'll be lost forever). There exists a /second/ spell which will bring you back from the dead at a safe location, though these safe locations are incredibly difficult and time-consuming to build, meaning that they're only constructed by large cities and/or nations. When you die, you have to personally make it back to the location of your death in order to get the stuff there. If you die a second time on the way, the stuff from your first death will be lost forever.

There are /tons/ of knock-on effects from that, because we have to imagine this being the case for /everyone/, from the leaders to the armies to the middle classes and those living in abject poverty. We can maybe curb the effects slightly if we posit that there's some non-trivial cost to the resurrection-at-a-safe-place spell (aside from just the time taken to run back), but it's still a lot to take in. What systems develop if everyone knows those are the rules? Is it even relevant outside of normally high-risk occupations? Or do people simply compensate for the reduction in risk by the creation of some new occupations which take up the same position? How do the courts handle "death" versus "real death"?

I would probably include monster drops in the form of either "essence" of some kind, which can be used for crafting/trade, and/or a spell which can swiftly extract some amount of materials from slain monsters at the cost of some other materials. Imagine a spell that would completely butcher a deer corpse for you and remove the skin into rectangular pieces, but remove the offal, bones, blood, etc.
