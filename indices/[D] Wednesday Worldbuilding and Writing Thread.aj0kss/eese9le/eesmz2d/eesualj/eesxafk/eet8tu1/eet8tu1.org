Ah, the base assumption I'm working from is that the world is essentially covered with monsters, and there are only a few places where the monsters don't spawn/go, a sea of black with a few points of light. If you're not in a safe zone, monsters will spawn in your closet or under your bed.

If you instead take the base to be a sea of white with a few black points, you get a very different world, one where it makes sense to go just outside where the monsters are.

And yes, if you were going through all this work, you'd probably want an explanation for why, if there's something to be gained from killing monsters, the process isn't just industrialized and made into something that small parties would never actually do, but that's a tough one. (With several solutions, but still.)
