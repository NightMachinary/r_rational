One trope more present in JRPG:s than MMO:s is the shared party inventory. I have given some thought to a world with such. The catch is, parties would not be easy to come by. They would require a great deal of intertwinglement, uninamity of purpose or the like. Sure, experiencing life-or-death with a group of people as a part of a grand quest would create one pretty quickly, but in a normal person's life you would usually see one only in a happy marriage.

This being a pre-industrial world, the capability to instantly transport items across a distance would be lucrative, creating a profession of inventoryneers. They would have to maintain their unity with their spouses, while living far apart, creating conflict.

There would also be conservation of potential energy, but across the whole inventory, making it useful to climb mountains and store big rocks. Possibly with sufficient skill you could translate the potential to kinetic energy when accessing the inventory, and so launch projectiles.

When you die, the inventory disperses and leaks back through random chests around the world.
