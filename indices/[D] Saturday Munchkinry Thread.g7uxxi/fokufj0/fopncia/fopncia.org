I recently watched Avatar the last airbender, where some "benders" can control different elements. It made me think about telekinesis, especially in the part where an old woman can control people by telekinetically moving the water in their bodies. Of course, there is endless works of fiction that involve telekinetic powers, but I think that it is a power way more versatile than you might think. Before I start listing ways it can be used, I'd like to precise that telekinetic powers are rarely universal (ie they often have restriction like specific materials, no human telekinesis or extremely crude control), but for example's sake, lets give our character telekinesis that has extremely good control, can affect all materials but can't affect inside a human body (crushing specific neuronal cells would be too easy) and has very low strength (can barely lift a small rock).

With this out of the way, how could it be abused? Here are my ideas:

1- Slowing each individual molecules of a liquid substance to decrease it's temperature, or the opposite. For example, if someone has a bottle of water you can quickly make it explode if you increase the temperature enough and transform the water in gas form. The same technique applies if you simply want to highly increase the temperature in a room. It could even light fires if the temperature gets high enough.

2- If you posses long range telekinesis, creating long range machines is a piece of cake. You install very precise quartz pressure sensors and it lets you activate anything at a long range with the lone power of your mind. For example, creating an ambush situation without being in the line of fire by putting pressure sensitive devices that the telekinetic can activate from afar.

3- Telekinesis, at that scale of precision, can become a super easy way of making lots of money. It could have countless experimental benefits, and many companies would pay a fortune to use it. For example, it's easy to purify any substance, and there must be ways to create energy, by activating certain chemical reactions and reversing it by reforming molecules (I'm not sure how that would work).

I feel like there must be way more other uses. If you have more ideas please tell me :)
