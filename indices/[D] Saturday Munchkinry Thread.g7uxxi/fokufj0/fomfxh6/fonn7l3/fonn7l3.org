The energy to repair/regrow an object comes from the user and the process is very slow and requires a lot of concentration/mental focus that few people can easily do. It's more that any object infused can't be destroyed permanently rather than a magical copier. If you infused say a metal ingot and cut it in half you have to focus on one part to grow it back. The part you didn't focus on would start to crumble/decay as the other half regrew.

That said, it is magic so I think for a master who had gathered or generated a lot of mana and had amazing mental discipline, they COULD copy an object this way. Not indefinitely as the energy requirements would be large and the object is tied to your soul, so constantly cutting/regrowing objects is probably not very pleasant. But it should be possible. I don't think it would be widespread just because magic itself is not widespread or easily learned in this universe.

It would work on food. A necromancer using this ritual could repair a broken zombie and the same principle would work on a say a cooked turkey. I think there would probably be side effects if anyone except the user actually ate this food, I mean eating a magical voodoo doll tied to someone else's soul can't be that healthy.

Liquids? I think it would work as long the amount was not much and it was enclosed into an object. A bottle of soda that replenished itself if you concentrate on it.
