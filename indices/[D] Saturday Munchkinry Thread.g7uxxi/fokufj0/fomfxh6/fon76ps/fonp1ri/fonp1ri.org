Can't be something living, there is a mass limit that is smaller than your body, and you have to be able to carry or move it with just your body. But you can cheat on the mass and carry limit if you have a lot of knowledge of the object and it is spiritually significant to you. A car could work but would probably count as five or six objects and you wouldn't be able to infuse anything else. But you do some crazy stuff in that car. Someone else might just pick the steering wheel and wheels which would accomplish something similar might cost only two or three objects since they are connected. But if you built/restored that car piece by piece with a parent, you know it inside and out, and it has a bunch of significant memories/feelings to you, you could infuse the whole car while having it only count as one object.

A living animal or child would not work. It would if they were dead and not that big.
