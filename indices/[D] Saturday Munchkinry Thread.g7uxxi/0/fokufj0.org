Soul Infusion

You ritually cut out a portion of your soul and infuse it into an object. This allows you to telekinetically control, strengthen, and repair the object. You are limited in how many objects you can infuse, with the norm being between four to six. The object must be able to be carried or transportable by your person. As it is literally tied to your well being. If the object is stolen and leaves your presence, you can sense the direction and area around it so you can track it but you will begin to slowly mentally and emotionally degrade if you are away from it for too long. Destroying an infused object permanently while it is near a user is very difficult as a user can repair or even regrow it from almost nothing over time. If a user chooses to, they can simply absorb back the soul essence of a destroyed object so they can create a new one.

Potential Uses:

The power in question is a magic ritual for an AU Batman story I am working on where Batman and later his rogue's gallery studies magic along with technology which they use in limited but very effective ways. Batman created the ritual and later taught it to the Bat-family. He uses it to strengthen and empower his equipment as well as provide a reason for why his equipment is so much better than everyone else's. His cape can support his weight allowing him to glide, his armor is tougher/makes him faster, his grapple gun's small motor is strong enough to shoot him through the air, and his bat computer is literally magical and helps explain his detective vision.

Oracle: Uses it to become a magical hacker and creates a drone/golem that is designed to look like batgirl and lets her control it in the field.

Red Hood: Jason Todd uses it to act as a necromancer, killing mob bosses and supervillains which he then infuses to control their dead bodies like puppets as long as they are near him. He uses it to systematically replace crime lords to take over their organizations while pretending to be their bodyguard to explain his close presence.

Lucius Fox- he figured out how to infuse an entire building by personally building and repairing the entire thing by hand and then living in it for several years before trying the ritual. It makes him very powerful inside of it but he hates to leave it.
