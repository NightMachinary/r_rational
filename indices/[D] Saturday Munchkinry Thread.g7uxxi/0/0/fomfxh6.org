If you can regrow objects that have been damaged, that seems like a way to create matter from nothing. Can I infuse an ingot of metal, cut it in half, then regrow the bar and repeat indefinitely? If the ritual became public knowledge, I would expect factories to pop up exploiting this.

Would regrowing and repairing work with food? Having some food that's always fresh and replenishes itself would be interesting. Does regrowing work on fluids?
