I found the actual "game" part was less interesting that ingress's equivalent, but the fact that it has random spawns makes it considerably more interesting than just planning a portal route and only taking out your phone once you get there.

Plus, /everyone/ is playing it, so I've talked to a bunch of people I haven't seen in a year or more.

And I fully expect the gameplay part to improve-- they wouldn't have included strong attacks if they didn't plan for them to matter, so they'll probably balance out combat whenever they get around to doing the next patch.
