I see, bash is usually recommended for small automation tasks and processes that require interaction with elements of the OS like file systems and the like but complex tasks can be done with effort, its still better to use a dedicated language for those though.

I've read some really good things about Ruby but haven't used it. Lua is very clean and Python like, used it once for a robotics project. Is there any reason you don't use Python?

I've found it very easy to learn and great for prototyping or automation tasks.
