Wait But Why is [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/07/wait-but-hi.html][planning IRL meetups]] worldwide on August 13. You have to answer a survey and they'll try to match you with people/activities/courses/foodstuffs/dates? that you'll enjoy. It has the potential to be awesome. If nothing else, people who read Wait But Why are my kind of people.

Here in London I'm part of a semi-private [[http://www.meetup.com/The-Golden-Axe/][boardgaming club]] looking for more members. We currently have a strong female majority (how the fuck did /that/ happen?) and would quite like to even it out, but everyone's welcome. It's not rationalist, there's just me and then one guy who enjoyed Luminosity, but it's good people and good games.
