It's a fairly anecdotal argument, but my impression is that mature stories /also/ pull readers out of the story and compromise sales, at least to some degree. Simpler, unambiguous story = bigger audience = bigger sales.

If an author is calibrating for that, then they're probably also calibrating for vocabulary. While you can't judge whether a story is a mature one without having actually read the thing, you can judge its vocabulary within the first few pages (barring some notable exceptions like /Flowers for Algernon/).
