There's a point where you're just having a thesaurus thrown at you, which is bad, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad metric. The optimum pH balance of a pool is 7.4; it's bad if it's higher or lower, but that doesn't make the scale any less useful.

I generally consider vocabulary as a fairly good second-order approximation for adultness of a work. Vocabulary acts as a gate through which inexperienced or uneducated readers cannot (or will not) pass, so if you see a certain vocabulary you can assume a few things about both the author and the author's intentions.

I do have a B.A. in English though, so treat what I say with a grain of salt.
