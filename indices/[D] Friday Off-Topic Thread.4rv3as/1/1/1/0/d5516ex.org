Vocabulary is a bad marker for good fiction, as it can go too far and give off the "English Major" feeling and turning off readers from enjoying the book.

I guess I would like the "intelligent reader" treatment with more complex plot lines, deeper meaning in the story, etc. For example. Lord of the Flies would be in the category because of the way it treats the reader. Stephen King could be Adult as well, not because of any gore or sex in his books, but because he treats is readers like they're intelligent and doesn't beat the motifs or tropes over your head, etc etc.

Adult should be adult literally because it exhibits a higher quality in story and language depth than most YA novels. What that quality is, is extremely difficult to quantify.
