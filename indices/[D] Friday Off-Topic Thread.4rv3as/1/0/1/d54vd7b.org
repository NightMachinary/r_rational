Agreed. I recently finished the first season of Penny Dreadful on Netflix and found the sex and nudity annoying. Presumably it was added to compete with Game of Thrones, but many have nothing to do with the plot and don't add to the gothic horror. That said, I do recommend the show if you like old English literature, since it very much embraces that writing style.
