Lol.

The Tudors predates Game of Thrones and had this in buckets.

Cable shows, especially history shows, play into this, both in terms of nudity and gore, it has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.

Frankly, a lot of the things people attribute to Game of Thrones gets a bit tedious, kinda like back when everything was "The Sopranos with/of X".
