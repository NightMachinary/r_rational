When I talked about authentic I was referring to the html format seeking to copy the original PDF. If you so hate the original PDF then the best way would be to start with a PDF that you like and see what it loses when trying to pass it through.

In regards to the "why"s:

Because they create page breaks, flow and points towards where the reader's attention is drawn instinctively. When I'm going through the core rulebook to check on a rule in the middle of a Pathfinder session I don't remember on which specific page the rule is, I know the approximate region and I quickly move through the pages; because every page is unique and visually distinctive from all the others in its layout and visual identity I don't need to read or scan words in every one of them, I only need to keep on going until my brain goes "stop, I remember that it was somewhere around this specific visual memory".

Why two columns other than one? Same as with scientific articles, it helps with optimizing space while compacting all necessary info in a small area where your eyes are looking at.

Also bold, italics, colors and those details are important for the same reasons as explained above, there's a reason why so many people invest in design for their product, and it's mainly related as to how good designs can help the user understand the content.
