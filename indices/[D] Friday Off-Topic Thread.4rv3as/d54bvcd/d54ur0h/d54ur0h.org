Regarding the ubiquitous use of the PDF format, I would define the problem as such:

"New formats will only turn popular once you can emulate the design of a current complex PDF with just LaTeX"

As a totally anecdotal evidence I can say that I've worked on trying to emulate a Pathfinder sourcebook with a LaTeX template, and the work hits a snag around 70% authenticity. Don't get me wrong, LaTeX is still the number one option to obtain the best alignment and visual aspect with the least effort, but once one goes pass the bare medium effort, the small design details that one might want to work with turn it into a nightmare. Putting a picture halfway in each column, creating a wrapped effect in a column, making changes halfway through the page, etc... All of those things are complicated to do in a project where the design process has to be left partially to the computer, but easy to do when the human controls where pretty much everything will end up in as in InDesign.

All of this to say that in this comparison the free formats for online resources are much more similar to the LaTeX pipeline than the InDesign one, you have your inputs of images+text+design rules->you get the device constraints(screen, proportions, etc...)-> you display the final result 'image'. And if you wanna present a very stylized and presentable result then a static creation like a PDF is still the best option, both in terms of the result and of the tools used to create it.
