I use it all the time when I'm talking to people online, just because gender is almost always ambiguous with user handles. I prefer singular "they" to alternatives like "he/she", "s/he", "xir", etc. because it's the only one that doesn't draw attention to the issue of gender. Using "he/she" has always felt like it was saying to the reader "okay, I don't know gender here, so I'm going to be respectful and point out that it's ambiguous", which can detract from the message you're actually trying to communicate ("xir" and variants being the most aggressive about it). I've never felt like there was a similar component of signaling with singular "they", which is practically invisible for most readers.

(There was a period of about a week when I tried to avoid using pronouns and/or tried to figure out gender from posting history or context clues, but it was too much work.)
