I guess it depends on the specifics (themes/stories/word count/etc), but in no particular order:

- Making omakes or short stories out of them; you're still letting a lot of words go to waste though.

- Cannibalizing their characters and plot points into your other stories/books, the way Wildbow did with his superhero stories pre-Worm. It means you probably can't use most of the text you've written, but transferring a character to a different story might be faster than writing a new character from scratch, so you /might/ get some increased productivity from your previous work that way.

- Making A GIANT CROSSOVER OF THEM ALL WHERE THE DIFFERENT WORLDS ARE LINKED BY PORTALS AND then I guess interesting things happen or something?

- Trying to complete shorter, denser versions of you stories. Only keep the essential, try to go to the conclusion as fast as you can, maybe use a different format. You still need a lot of work for each book but at least you're actually using your previous writings.
