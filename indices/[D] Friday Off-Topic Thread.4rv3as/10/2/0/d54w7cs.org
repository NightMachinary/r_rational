  the work hits a snag around 70% authenticity
#+end_quote

But why do you need perfect "authenticity"? When I look at [[http://i.imgur.com/gJKUacH.png][that /GURPS Low-Tech/ screenshot]], I'm /annoyed/ at this "authentic" editing. Why are the margins humongous, when they could be narrow? Why are the borders huge and orange (with a Kira-damned /orange gradient/ in the outbox!), when they could be narrow and black or gray? Why is the page in two columns, rather than in one--and, even worse, why does the outbox protrude from one column into the other? I don't want "authenticity"--I want a design that looks good and is easy to read.

I didn't try to make [[http://i.imgur.com/FGeKwUx.png][my HTML rendition]] /match/ [[http://i.imgur.com/gJKUacH.png][the original page]]. Rather, I made it as starkly simple and beautiful as possible, with no random colors, no unnecessary columns, no randomly-protruding outboxes, and no unnecessary jumps from bold to italic to all-caps in the headings.

  Putting a picture halfway in each column, creating a wrapped effect in a column, making changes halfway through the page, etc...

But why would you /want/ to do [[http://i.imgur.com/Bq3F9Xl.png][these hideous things]]??
