  Don't get me wrong, LaTeX is still the number one option to obtain the best alignment and visual aspect with the least effort, but once one goes pass the bare medium effort, the small design details that one might want to work with turn it into a nightmare.

  All of those things are complicated to do in a project where the design process has to be left partially to the computer, but easy to do when the human controls where pretty much everything will end up in as in InDesign.

Thank you for putting this into words. The other people in my lab all use latex and my PI insists on latex, and I can appreciate how it automatically formats everything... but it still annoys me for some reason and I think you have verbalized why.
