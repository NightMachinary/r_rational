Is there anything useful that I can do with books I started writing but didn't finish, besides actually taking the time to finish them? I have ~9 books that are sitting at various stages of completion (that's only counting anything that's crept over 10K words) and actually completing them will be [[http://i.imgur.com/MD0p6LA.gif][/haaaaard/]], not just because of the writing-prose aspect, but because of the editing, beta-reading, second round of editing that are a minimum to get quality content out the door. I don't want to just throw away hundreds of thousands of words, but I can't foresee myself ever having the time to finish all but one or two of them.

Is there anything that can be done with unfinished stuff? Or is it completely worthless except for the practice it gave me at writing?
