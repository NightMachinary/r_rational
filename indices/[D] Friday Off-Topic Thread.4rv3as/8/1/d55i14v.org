In the same boat here, though I am nowhere near as prolific a writer as you. I can't just discard, due to the emotional and intellectual investment. What about extracting the core of those works into an "Omake" anthology? For example, the LOTR omake fan fiction segment within HPMOR is some of the most inspirational writing I've seen.
