I do but only on small projects that catch my attention. I worked a bit with crawlers and neural networks and actually found use for one for a paper I'm making on ontology generation for chatbots.

I think its a fun way to work and automate tasks. I'm biased towards Python given how easy it is to craft something and modify on the go but have tried (unsuccessfully I must say) to create Android applications for automation.

If you go mobile and want something for personal use I suggest Apache Cordova because the deployment process is faster than Java Android. I absolutely hate how you must edit stuff in lots of windows and how cluttered and verbose the code is when using Android Studio.

What language are you using? Or its bash?
