Anybody using git and programming in their writing process?

I wrote a shell script to document how many words changes I made to a given project everyday, in which I learned a lot about...shell scripting. It was satisfying to document my progress this way.

I am thinking of building a random name generator, a dice roller, maybe an RPG system for use in quests.

There will probably be a lot of processing and indexers in the future soon as well, so I can better cross check and jump around, helping me keep things straight.
