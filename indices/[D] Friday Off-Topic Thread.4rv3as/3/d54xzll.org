Anyone have recommendations of well written fics that deal with protagonists that are actually inhuman?

Of particular import is the MINDSETS being at least not like a baseline human.

My frustration being, if my own brain is more foreign then your so called "unfathomably alien" mind in its diversions from the baseline of 'majority' European human on motivations, approach to sexuality, ethics and problem solving, aesthetics of beauty, culture etc I will have to resist the urge to scream and smash something.

I'd prefer if their vaguely insectile or something like the xenomorphs or zerg in physical aesthetics but considering how small the pool of this kind of works is I'll take most anything.

To date everything in the tvtropes page on xenofiction has either been researched/read by me already or I've not found an accessible source for it.
