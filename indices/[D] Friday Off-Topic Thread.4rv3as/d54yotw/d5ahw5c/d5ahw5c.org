  What I don't understand is this reaction specifically in response to someone shooting police officers. "We need our guns in order to go after the government" seems completely tone deaf to me when someone has just used their guns to go after the government. I can't actually tell whether this is just repetition of a talking point without regard to context, or a hard line ideological stance. I recall similar rhetoric following the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, so I don't think this is isolated to just Ben Carson or just this incident.

Maybe Ben Carson supports shooting cops.
