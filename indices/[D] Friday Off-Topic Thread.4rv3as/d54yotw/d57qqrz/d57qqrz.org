Yes, there is a real ideology that suggests that the answer to both "oppressive government" and "dangerous rioters" is "give everybody guns". We outnumber the government, and we outnumber the rioters.

EDIT:

I'm blue tribe, so take this with a grain of salt:

The structure of modern militaries is fundamentally different to those envisioned by the drafters of the constitution. You have to remember, when the United States were founded, artillery and warships were routinely privately owned.

You could argue pretty strongly that this means the constitution is outdated.

But you could also argue that it means our society has been drifting closer and closer to a state where a few powerful people control most of the power, and this is incredibly risky. Or you could start thinking about asymmetric warfare and argue that we can plot a fairly short route back from where we are now to something like balance, argue modern militaries aren't really all that in the case of civil war - when was the last time the US military really /captured and held/ a hostile territory?
