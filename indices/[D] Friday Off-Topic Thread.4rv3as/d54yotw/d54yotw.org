So [[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/ben-carson-dallas-shooting-obama-225278#ixzz4DqSuBDxP][here's Ben Carson]] on Obama's response to the Dallas shooting:

  Why do we have a Second Amendment? They're always saying you don't need a high-powered weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting. It's about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion.

I've always considered the "we need guns to protect ourselves from the government" as something of a power fantasy, similar to how a lot of people view the zombie apocalypse. People like to make escape routes out of the city, build prep kits, go camping in the wilderness to test their survival, etc. I generally consider this (and prepping in general) to be pretty harmless, or possibly beneficial in the sense that people are going out to acquire useful skills like first aid and disaster preparedness. This particular defense of the 2nd Amendment seems to come from a similar psychological place.

What I don't understand is this reaction /specifically in response to someone shooting police officers/. "We need our guns in order to go after the government" seems completely tone deaf to me when someone has just used their guns to go after the government. I can't actually tell whether this is just repetition of a talking point without regard to context, or a hard line ideological stance. I recall similar rhetoric following the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, so I don't think this is isolated to just Ben Carson or just this incident.

(There are other, much better arguments against gun control, but they provoke less head scratching from me.)
