In a earlier thread I recommended the book How To Succeed in Evil as a rational dark comedy. Now that I've finished the book, I hereby rescind that recommendation because the ending was awful. Not only does it fail to properly conclude the story in any way, instead just setting up for a sequel, but the last scene features the protagonist convincing a man to commit suicide by allowing himself to be buried alive without a shred of irony.

I felt unclean after reading that, and even if I didn't the final act is still a drastic shift in tone from the rest of the book. I was fine with its mean-spirited satire of human stupidity, but when it suddenly decided to take itself seriously it was repulsive to read and strained credibility. It has some hilarious and tragic moments, and even a few interesting insights, but when none of it is tied together properly it all becomes meaningless drivel.
