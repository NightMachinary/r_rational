I did enjoy reading most of it, the story just never amounted to anything in the end. I guess it focuses on rationality, but by having EVERYONE make horrifically stupid decisions and refuse to listen whenever Edwin tells them they're wrong. It's understandable when it's comic book supervillains, they're supposed to be insane, but for Excelsior and his government handler it is ridiculous.
