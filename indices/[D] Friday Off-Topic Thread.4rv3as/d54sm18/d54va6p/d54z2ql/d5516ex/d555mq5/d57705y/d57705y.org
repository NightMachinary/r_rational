From a storytelling and marketing standpoint simpler vocabulary is safer for the writer to use.

The depth of language the writer can use is at the mercy of the reader's own vocabulary. An unfamiliar word throws the reader out of the story. The writer obviously /doesn't want that to happen/ (unless, I wonder, if a writer has ever done that to deliberately make a reader stop and think about what was said?) so they limit their word usage. Being playful with language is too risky.

From a selling point complex language reduces the size of the potiential audience. Plainer language = bigger audience = bigger sales. Personally, I think this makes vocabulary a poor basis to judge the maturity of a story on.
