To some extent, this is one of the expectations of "literary fiction" as a genre (and one of the things that people mean when they use "literary fiction" as a euphemism). Literary fiction doesn't tend to sell very well, because it's mostly optimized for critical acclaim and social status rather than actual sales, but I don't think that says too much about what impact vocabulary has on sales.
