I've certainly seen a fair bit of critique in [[/r/rational]] for stories with simple vocabularies, and quite a few of the stories written in here tend to have rather complicated vocabularies.

I'm reminded of vaguely remembered studies that found that Donald Trump and Daily Mail or something had a reading level and style well below other political leaders, and suggestions that this made them more popular and charismatic.

Plus this.

From a quick google this and many other things slowly edited in.

  The initial surprise from my little data experiment is that writers whose work we regard highly tend to be produce work at a lower reading level than we'd intuit.[7] Cormac McCarthy, Jane Austen, and Hunter S. Thompson join J.K. Rowling in the readability realm of pre-teens. The content of McCarthy's and Thompson's novels isn't meant for children, but these writers' comprehensibility is rather universal.

  I wasn't shocked that academic documents rank difficult. However, I was surprised that the ones I studied were only 12th and 13th grade reading level.

  Most of us don't read at that level, it turns out. (Or if we can, we hate to.) Here's what research says about how many Americans even can read well:

  In other words:

  I did an informal poll of some friends while writing this post. Every one of them told me that they assumed that higher reading level meant better writing. We're trained to think that in school. But data shows the opposite: lower reading level often correlates with commercial popularity and in many cases, how good we think a writer is.[8]

This on magazines and tabloids and such is interesting.

From before.

  Furthermore, the dialogue is stilted, the characters are dumb and erratically motivated, and the writing itself is childish, which opinion I arrive at having spent three years teaching and grading the writing of eleven year olds. If Brandon Sanderson reads my first, incorrect rant, I am entirely sorry for any degree of pissed-off he becomes, and abjectly apologize, and direct him to this more accurate rant instead, acknowledging any further inaccuracies as my own fault.

This sort of comment by another user is representative of the sort of attitude I've seen here. Brandon Sanderson does probably write at a fairly low grade level. This may explain part of his popularity. I read that above quoted user/author's writings, and there were a lot of odd complicated terms I wasn't actually sure of the meaning of in his writing.

From a quick google, harry potter book 1 is a grade level for 11-12 year olds, and is of interest to 8-9 year olds as well.

I'll end with a quote.

  "I notice that you use plain, simple language, short words, and brief sentences. That is the way to write English---it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; and don't let the fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in.

  "When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them---then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when close together. They give strength when they are wide apart." - Mark Twain.
