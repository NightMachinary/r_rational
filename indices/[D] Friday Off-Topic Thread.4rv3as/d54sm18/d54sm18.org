A bit of a rant here, but i'm sick and tired of 'adult' and 'adult-themed' books merely being another term for the inclusion of sex or blood and gore (if not all of that). It's a completely non-descriptive set of terms... The writing can be just as bad, or even worse than YA fiction.

I would like 'for adults' be a moniker or a sign that the book uses more terms, treats the reader like an intelligent person, etc, but I'm not sure how I could influence that. I'm sure if I wrote a novel and marked it as adult, I'd get a bunch of teens in on it, looking for porn, and then get complaints that what I was writing barely even mentioned sex, and when it did, it wasn't detailed graphically.
