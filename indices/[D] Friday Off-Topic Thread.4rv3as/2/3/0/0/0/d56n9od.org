And despite being a patriot (in the revolutionary sense) and a 2nd Amendment advocate, as a Christian, I always remember the words of Jesus: "He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword." Guns don't make things better when dealing with people, they just give a chance at survival in some dangerous circumstances.
