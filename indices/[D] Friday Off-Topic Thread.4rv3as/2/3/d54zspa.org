Fighting against our own government is asking for a civil war.

The last time this happened was because a bunch of slavers wanted to secede and form their own union.

Then the last time the last time it happened was the American revolutionaries against the British. Arguably, Canada manages to gain its independence without even firing a single shot.

So, what good is it when Americans rise up against other Americans? You could say that it is already a disaster at that point.
