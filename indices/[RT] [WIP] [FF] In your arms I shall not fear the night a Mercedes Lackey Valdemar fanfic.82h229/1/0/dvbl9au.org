I personally liked Lackey a lot when I was a teenager. I've since grown out of her writing, and more recent attempts to reread works of hers that I've previously enjoyed were not nearly so enjoyable nowadays. If you happen to be at the right age / stage for them, you can probably enjoy some of her works (though her early writings' politics / messages are mostly super dated nowadays). If you try reading them and find them to be fundamentally juvenile and uninteresting, you've probably outgrown her already. A lot of her works are more clearly targetted at female sf/f readers; I'm male, but still enjoyed many of them when I was younger anyways. Many of her works are basically romances.

Valdemar books - A really huge number of trilogies, and fewer books not in trilogies. Centers around a magical world and mostly the kingdom of Valdemar where magic telepathic horses permanently bond with worthy people and this magic telepathic horse bonding is the main basis of their system of government. A lot of people are first tormented by hidebound reactionaries / other abusers and then get rescued by the telepathic horses who love them unconditionally. If this sounds to you like McCaffrey's Pern but with magic horses instead of magic dragons - well, you get a cookie, some borrowing of core concept is clearly happening here. These books were progressive at the time they were originally written, including canonically gay main characters who were portrayed as not evil / wrong etc and full of homosexual romance and heteresexual romance side by side, which was actually pretty progressive for the late 80's / early 90s. However, Lackey draws on a lot of really annoying stereotypes of gays and gay romances as always tragic etc. in a way that would be called out as problematic if written nowadays. More on [[http://limyaael.livejournal.com/214314.html?page=2][that here]] - her portrayal of gay characters almost always draws heavily upon a lot of stereotypes that nowadays feel cringe-inducing. Actual execution of the various books is mostly not terribly interesting - these books are just fundamentally not doing much that is interesting or unique in the fantasy genre.

Bedlam's Bard - with Guon and Edghill. These books are mostly traditional-ish urban fantasy centered around Irish/Celtic elves and human musicians/bards. This is not terribly exceptional - probably the best strength is an interesting portrayal of a character growing up and maturing as an adult, but overall it's very schlocky urban fantasy. Progressive points for a polyamory relationship portrayal at one point. Silly, but inoffensive mostly.

Serrated Edge series - tied to the above books, these are mostly about Elves in a Masqurade from the world who are inexplicably into racing cars and also rescuing abused children. Has really fucked up depictions of child abuse pretty much every book, and various children are constantly rescued by good elves / imperiled by bad elves or fantasy monsters in addition to more normal child abusers. The premise and story background is, I cannot emphasize enough, totally batshit insane, but the actual execution isn't nearly as interesting as the batshit premise would make you hope.

Elemental Masters - A series of historic-set stories with elements of structure and plot borrowed from classic fairy tales but mostly set in the early 20th / 19th / 18th centuries, and a 'summon elemental servitors' magic system. E.g. The Fire Rose is Beauty and The Beast. Honestly, some of these were interesting. A lot of them feature a woman protagonist defying gender roles as sort of a parable of feminism ideals. Very strong romance elements in many of these.

The Halfblood Chronicles - Total fantasy. Dragon shapeshifters adopt a half-elf, half-elf makes war upon elven oppressors. Honestly, not terribly great.

Some of Lackey's work ended up in the Baen CD-ROM of free to redestribute books initiative - particularly in "This Sceptered Isle" IIRC? anyways you can grab the free-to-redistribute CD-ROM images [[http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/][here]] with some of Lackeys works scattered about.
