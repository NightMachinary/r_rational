I would agree with this characterization of Lackey's work. It really is well suited to hit you at a certain age. I also grew out of it in nearly the same way.

But when you are young, the concept of Companions (telepathic horse friends finding someone paired with them by fate) really hits teenagers in just the right way to create a sympathetic audience. Lackey always had a way with emotional characterization that rings particularly true with people just beginning to explore those feelings in life.

Also, if you sometimes use FF's as introductions to certain books and authors, I would say this one in particular imitates the tragic hero and emotional characterizations well (if you like feeling-oriented writing, you will enjoy this fic, it is done well in that extent.). However, this fic author focuses much on deconstructing those feelings and making them understood to the reader, but as a result of that you might miss the other elements of Valdemar that make Lackey's work enjoyable; sense of wonder and discovery, the enjoyable magic system, and how Lackey generally puts together an interesting setting. If you have a Valdemar background, you will dive into this fic easier. If you don't, you will be missing out on how the protagonists are discovering the elements of the Valdemar setting with you. That particular element is taken as assumed for this fic.
