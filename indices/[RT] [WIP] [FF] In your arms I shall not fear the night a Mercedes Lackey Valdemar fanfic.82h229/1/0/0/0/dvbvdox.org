Do you have any thoughts on how I could work in more worldbuilding and intro to the magical system earlier on? This does get explored more in depth later in the fic (I also think the Valdemar setting and magic system are really neat!) but it's likely the case that at the beginning, I've put in the exact amount of explanation of the setting that someone who hasn't read Lackey needs to not be confused, and no more than that.

(I guess "sense of wonder and discovery" is not the thing I'm going for; my model is that to most of the characters, this is just the way things are, and it seems pretty mundane to them -- and they too have death and taxes and roads to be repaired and national budgets that need to be submitted on time.)
