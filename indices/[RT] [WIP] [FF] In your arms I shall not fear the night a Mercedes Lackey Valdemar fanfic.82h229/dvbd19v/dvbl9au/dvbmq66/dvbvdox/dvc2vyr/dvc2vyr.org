Typical Lackey style was to establish a tragic protagonist -> Introduce friction -> introduction Companion -> discover world through the eyes of that changed relationship -> reintroduce friction ->Acts 2 and 3.

Usually in the non-companion stories, the sense of discovery happens because the introduction of the pair element leads to the first easing of friction and allows the characters to stop looking at the world from the microcosm of their own suffering and start contemplating existence and the world beyond their own.

It is with new eyes that they look and experience the world around them, and this is usually where the setting gets discovered and the sense of wonder happens. It is the natural break from the protagonists struggle, where they get a moment to take a breath, rest, de-escalate tension, before we dive back into the struggle. We also see a bit of character development as the hero grows a bit into their future self.

So far, Van has been in agony for about 8 chapters, and just felt a minor release from his icy mountain. Usually the first release happens earlier so the author can allow the reader's mind to rest from emotional conflict. The pairing of the first release and looking at the world with a new outlook allows world-building to happen.

Look the colors are brighter now, what I looked upon from afar is so different up close. I have a place/gift/friend and while my core conflict isn't resolved, I finally have hope and can feel again! The world is so different from this perspective! And this is when Lackey hits you with world-building. Sure it was described so many chapters ago as common knowledge, but now I can finally see it for what it is. Companions are not just magical telepathic horses, they are your fated friend, they are a piece of you that was missing and this is what it feels like to finally be whole. This is where life becomes beautiful. This is what the protagonist fights for.

Usually world-building happens during the first introduction of the schools, the first easing of friction happens before this so you can explore the world through hero's new perspective. You did a bit of that with the cousin's last words at the holding. Van started growing a little, but we never saw him achieve much release from that. It was our first chance to take a break from "woe is me" and start to like Van beyond contemplative wet blanket. Van thus far has been Sad (holding)->neutral (journey)->sad(meet Sav)->neutral/curious (meets moody eyes)->sad/neutral(school)->Very sad (drunk/nightmares)->bunch more of that then he gets down and is happy for two paragraphs then we go back to sad again. Van is still "woe is me" (which I have absolutely enjoyed your writing of. Your emotional characterization is on point as I said earlier), despite having his first release. All we know of his hidden depths are that he is very contemplative and good at music. He hasn't actually enjoyed playing music that much because he keeps bemoaning his arm. He has no outlets to experience happiness up to the first kiss. He has had no positive emotional highs up until chapter 8. We have no reason to really like him unless we love depression. Van is more than a two-note character played on the organ. Show us his range of feeling. and use that to build the world around him.
