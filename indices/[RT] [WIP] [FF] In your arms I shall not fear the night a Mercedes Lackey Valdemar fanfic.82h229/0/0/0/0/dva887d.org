Think you got them on the head. (3) was Owlflight. Thanks a bundle. Look like (2) was Take a Thief, and paired with it Exile's Honor. Lord, was Alberich a sour noodle.

Now that I've had a gander over the list, damn did I read a bunch of Lackey. Good times with the public library catalog.

This FF should be a nice stroll down nostalgia lane. Time to dig in.

Though seriously, where in the Valdemar timeline did those book take place? At least in relation to the Last Herald Mage series, I don't want to be misplacing, perceived events.
