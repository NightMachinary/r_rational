I am updating the wiki, specifically the chapter pages. My current plan is to include the following sections:

- Title (eg. Dark Satanic Mills is from William Blake's /And did those feet in ancient time/, and is a reference to the industiral revolution destroying relationships.)
- Characters (both main viewpoint, and others mentioned)
- Time/chronology.
- Plot summary.

Anything I should add or remove?

I made a post in [[/r/UNSONG]] over [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unsong/comments/4suxo7/updating_the_wiki/][here]] to keep the comments consolidated.
