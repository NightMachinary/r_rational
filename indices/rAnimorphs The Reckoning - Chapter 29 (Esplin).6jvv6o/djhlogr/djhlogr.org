Keep at it, I can't wait for more!

Well this confirms some of the suspicions I had. Silat is in Pyongyang and has probably infested Kim Jong Un and a significant proportion of North Korean high command, and Esplin is planning something big with an Operation Clarke, which I suspect involves North Korea as well.

He really isn't thinking about Telor right now, which may come back to bite him in his tail.

I really hope that after you finish the primary storyline, you flesh out your universe a bit more. I'd love to read about all the sieges and battles between the Yeerks and Andalites, and perspectives from both Andalite and Yeerk leaders as they prosecute the war. There are so many noodle incidents mentioned in an offhand way.
