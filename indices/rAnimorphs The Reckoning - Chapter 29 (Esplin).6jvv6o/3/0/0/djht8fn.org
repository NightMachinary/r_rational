  Also, it's sweet that you've recently read through canon---I haven't had the time, my last read-through was maybe five years ago
#+end_quote

I've only read about 4 or 5 of the Chronicles, and they are a 1-2 hour read each, so it's not much of an investment. The worldbuilding mostly happened in the Chronicles so I actually felt like I got a HUGE amount of background/worldbuilding on the back of that.

  Insects in amber: I chose that as a planet-neutral "flies in honey." =)
#+end_quote

Don't think it's quite there: amber is the sap of earth trees that hardens, and insects specifically are an earth thing. I mean, do the Hork-Bajir or Andalite trees have sap? Is their sap sticky?

  The Gedds are still used as hosts in the Yeerk empire, they're just none-too-bright and not very coordinated. A very low-status host.
#+end_quote

Just like canon; but it sounds like the rendezvous with the Gedds is the same sort of thing as with the Taxxons or Arn; I got the impression that V3 was negotiating with the Gedds, which didn't seem right.

  I sort of liked how in canon everybody just left the Skrit Na alone.
#+end_quote

I like how the Skrit Na are /older than the Ellimist/ in canon.

I wonder what V3's dog paradise looks like? I mean, with a whole planet of resources, you could have a pretty big dog population, depending on how nice they play together. I suppose they'd form loose packs or something?
