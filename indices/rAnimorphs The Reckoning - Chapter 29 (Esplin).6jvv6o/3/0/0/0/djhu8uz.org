I imagine that there's a lot of convergent evolution, so most tree-like organisms would require some kind of liquid inside, and most planets would develop small critters that crawl and fly. They wouldn't /technically/ qualify as trees/sap and insects in Earth biological terms, but they'd be clear analogues.

And by "rendezvous with the Gedds," I was more intending "a group of Gedd controllers."

I forgot they were older than the Ellimist! That's pretty metal.
