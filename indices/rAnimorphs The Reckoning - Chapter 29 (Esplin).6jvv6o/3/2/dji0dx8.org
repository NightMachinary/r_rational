The oatmeal was actually in the original series too.

which, while written for children, were surprisingly dark and good, if memory serves me. Although I feel like the ellimist is way beyond deus ex, if there /wasn't/ a god literally looking out for them their survival would be completely unbelievable.

It's a testament to this fanfic and my iffy memory that I keep thinking things from it happened in the originals and vice versa.
