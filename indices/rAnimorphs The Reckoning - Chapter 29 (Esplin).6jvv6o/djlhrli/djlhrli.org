Regarding Cassie's family:

Hot DAMN, Visser Three is straight evil for torturing them just to provoke some kind of reaction. And indeed, his releasing them in Washington was confirmed a trap rather than a gesture of goodwill... though what kind of trap, I'm not sure of. Is it a trap Cassie would have fallen for, if someone hadn't taken steps to remove her from the game?

Anyway, point is, they're still alive. Announced dead back in book II, but still alive, taken off-planet.

The Chapmans were also announced dead. Could they still be alive and off-planet as well? Will Rachel get her happy ending with Melissa [[#s][]]?
