  re: 600 kids ... yeah, it's always wise to remember that V3 has access to the Arn, and regardless of the fact that it's poor literary convention to use the Eagles over and over again, it's pretty good strategy ...
#+end_quote

I don't think it's poor literary convention, as long as you move to challenges that can't be easily solved with eagles, or where using eagles isn't practical, etc.

  I think it's still narratively good---teenagers fail to overcome their ethnocentric bias makes sense to me.

Sure. I mean, I'm French and I keep seeing movies about New York being invaded by aliens, so of course I notice these things pretty quickly. (although Edge of Tomorrow was an awesome exception)

  ... I'm actually seriously considering having the Yeerks make crazy headway on a bunch of issues after having caught and infested Andrew Critch.
#+end_quote

It would make sense. I mean, you don't /have/ to namedrop your boss, but if the yeerks keep nabbing humans (especially the highly educated people they'd need for their engineering/logistic projects), they're bound to get a few that are pretty good philosophers, if only as a side thing.

Thinking about, at this point in the story Telor already knows quite a bit about human (well, American) culture. They demonstrated knowledge of cognitive biases when talking to Esplin; they probably know about the Prisoner's dilemma, the Holocaust, Stargate, and those Star Trek episodes with the mind slugs. Wonder what it'd make of all that?

  re: redundancy, don't speak too soon. Note the line "sent a drone with seeds and copies," for instance. He's read Vision of the Past and Specter of the Future by now, probably.
#+end_quote

You mixed those titles. It's actually Specter of the... wait wait seriously? V3 read some Timothy Zahn? Because - 1 - this definitely deserves an interlude/omake - 2 - this opens up a can of worm. Does that mean he named Honoghr and the Iblis maneuver after the books? Retroactively, in the second case, after realizing that an Earth sci-fi writer had the same ideas as him? Or /does Timothy Zahn really exist at all/? Maybe he was Esplin all along. What does Visser 3 thinks of Star Wars? Of the prequels? Did he watch Star Wars Rebels? (okay, probably not)

Also I'm going to drop what I was doing and resume reading /Hand of Thrawn/ now.

  You're right about his poor scientific methodology, and that might be worth a significant rewrite as well.
#+end_quote

Well, it might be believable. I can't imagine yeerks would know much about the scientific method at the time Esplin was formed. Alloran probably would, if Andalites generals have to study as much as occidental military officers do; but even then, "Do randomized blind trials" might be something he knows in abstract, but wouldn't think to apply to his situation. (I like the idea that he's not as self-aware as he thinks he is)
