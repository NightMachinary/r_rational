Long form review, because apparently those are important to some people or something and also this is literally the single most productive thing I have energy for right now:

--------------

/January/

- So is the Council of 13 made of controllers, or hives? The interlude mentions "simulated faces", which could mean holograms of hosts, or computed-generated images. I'd guess they're controllers, since Telor needed one to speak with Esplin. Even then, I'd guess these particular council-controllers are kept on a very short leash by their respective hives.

- On the other hand, we have definitive confirmation that Vissers are all controllers. Which brings the question: what species do they control? We're told that each yeerk has a host IQ+20 intelligence, which means there's probably not going to be many Taxxons/Gedd/Hork-Bajir Vissers. Maybe the Vissers are disproportionately Naharans? Being the only human-controller, Visser One would be the smartest of them all after Esplin. (unless there's other smart species we haven't come across yet, or Visser 3 asked the Arn to produce smarter Hork Bajirs for his political rivals and... yeah, probably not)

- I like Visser 3's hypocrisy when complaining about Visser 1: "How dare you keep secrets to pursue your own private agenda! Do you not see how destructive it is? Why, don't you realize how easier it would be for me to pursue my secret destructive agenda if we would all trust each other and cooperate (except me)?"

- How often do Vissers and other yeerk leaders lie to each other? Esplin seemed to think "Visser 1 lied to the council" was more likely to be true than "This happened by coincidence". But given that, as she said, V1's memories can be checked by other coalescions, I doubt she would casually lie to them. On the other hand, V1 is not a static entity, and the hive that produces her might create a shard with fake memories who sincerely believes whatever lies her hive wants to feed the council. On the first hand, maybe V3 is projecting. He spent his entire life crafting elaborate lies, and manipulating everyone into furthering his selfish agenda. His perspective is probably biased.

- Also, yeah, Visser One! And for added mystery she is Schrodinger's Tobias/Marco's mom! (I vote Marco, because some of my favorite Animorphs fics are about Eva and her life as Visser 1; also I think her book rocks even more than /Andalite Chronicles/).

- I see Esplin went to the Tom Riddle school of pretending to lose. You can feel the frustrated rage between each of his "Yes, Visser"s.

- So Visser 3 gave Visser 1 the Andalite world, knowing that his better understanding of Andalites meant he could set it up as a trap that Visser 1 wouldn't detect until it was too late, and wouldn't be able to prove to the council. Once he got past the "Holy shit I'm stuck in space" stage, it didn't seem to occur to him that Visser 1 might have done the exact same thing. More on that later.

/February/

- "At first I thought I could breach the secrets of the mysterious Z-space rift, and acquire impossibly advanced FTL technology if only I managed to infiltrate the fringe group known as 'Trekies'. Didn't work out. But then I learned about this incredible secret place called Hogwards, and then..."

- I like how many Alloran quotes Esplin manages to dig up. He's like those people who keep quoting The Art of War all the time, excepts he's telling them to Sun Tzu, who just can't stand them anymore.

- This chapter shines an interesting light on the previous Esplin chapters. He's been waiting for the other shoe to drop ever since he arrived; he thought Cassie "morphing without going back to Andalite" was it at first; and then when the tunnel arrived, he went "Alright, fine, it's an actual god. Happy now, Alloran? Alloran?"

- So Esplin's method for investigating secret conspiracies is to expose one of their members to Leeran hypersight and hope they don't talk about it because people would think they're crazy. He does that because abducting them and reading their memories directly would leave a trail of corpses behind. That's questionable logic; a conspiracy with the means to detect a worldwide series of murders would definitely react to one of their members being exposed to hypersight. Though I guess even if the patsies talked about their hypersight vision, they would mostly talk to their own conspiracy, so to an outside observer a trail of bodies /would/ be more noticeable.

- I liked the Bayesian Conspiracy shout-out, by the way.

- Something that Esplin doesn't seem to have considered: if his search for worldwide conspiracies did not dig up the Chee, how does he know he didn't miss /others/ highly improbable weirdly-aligned societies? There is no "There is no perfect crime", after all.

--------------

/March/

- More /Chronicles/ references!

- It sounds like Elfangor's various titles come from a specific campaign of ambushes, where he disappeared yeerk fleets in "The Deep", which I'm guessing means either interstellar space, or a specific location? Probably the second, since zero-space travel means fleets wouldn't spend much time in interstellar space.

- Which brings the question, how did the yeerks even identify Elfangor? Apparently no one came back from those ambushes, which means the yeerks somehow learned Elfangor's role from either Andalite civilian media or military intelligence. Didn't Esplin discourage that kind of information gathering? Or was it just on the Andalite side?

- By literary convention, it ain't dead until the body is onscreen. So do we really know that Elfangor killed those yeerks? He could have captured them or trapped them in time-stasis fields or made friends with them! So many exciting possibilities.

- Elfangor knows about Esplin being an abomination; which may or may not mean he knows about the coalescions. But if he does... why didn't he tell his people?

- While we're playing the 'who knows what' game, how much of this did Marco know after going through Elfangor's mind? Did he learn about the z-space rift? Elfangor's campaign of ambushes in The Deep? The coalescions? Esplin's nature?

- I like Esplin's philosophy. On the one hand, 'Villain rants to defeated hero/mentor about how he's not evil, it's just other people who are weak and/or stupid' is a bit of a overused cliché; on the other hand, this scene still felt like a smart spin on these ideas.

- I also like Esplin's speech: "I will not monologue about my motivations like an idiot. Why would I? As much as you desire it, you have no way to enforce your will; in fact, the whole world is like you, in that they [...] and this is why I want to take over the world. Uh. I did monologue. Feels kind of good. I should do this more often."

/April/

And nothing else important happened in April.

--------------

/May/

- Screw you, Esplin. "Incomprehensible" is a perfectly valid label.

- Not exactly relevant to this chapter, but I wondered if it occurred to the Animorphs that their recruitment drive might not be as useful as they thought. Visser 3 was likely to move his operations away from America anyway, since it probably has one of the worst population-density-to-security ratios from his point of view. Hundreds of morph-capables resistance fighters in one country won't do much good if most of the invasion takes place in... well, any other continent.

- Still not clear why the ship's sensors did /not/ detect the kids after Elfangor's ship was destroyed.

- Quirrel Rule n°10: I shall not rant about the unworthiness of the meddling kids who disrupted my operations so hard I had to throw an asteroid at them to cover the damage.

- It's been remarked upon already, but wow, the "producing offscreen" comment has some disturbing implications. It's also kind of a strange decision; we're told that the entire Yeerk War has lasted less than 4 years, and a lot of things already happened; it takes at least 10 years and a lot of effort to raise children to the point they might become valuable soldiers. Those 600 kids they're "producing" seem like a waste of efforts when they should be focusing on the billions of humans they need to subdue (no small task on its own, more on that later). Maybe these humans they're raising will have special, valuable properties?

- I like how the number 13 keeps popping up arbitrarily all the time. We're building a factory that makes more factory parts? It will make 13 other factories, exactly. Of course we don't realize how arbitrary it is when we're using base-10.

- So Esplin decided to commit random acts of destruction and cruelty to see if the gods would react. First off, that's awful; second, it seems like a desperate approach; after all, the gods' goals might be seriously hampered by, say, the pandemic he set off, but still not make any intervention he might detect, to keep him from having an edge on them.
