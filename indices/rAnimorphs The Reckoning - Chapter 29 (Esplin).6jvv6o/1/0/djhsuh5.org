Trillian. :D

Silat has been kept somewhat mysterious, but the gist so far is "a new coalescion that spawned off of Aftran somewhat early on, leaving Aftran all lovey-dovey and peaceful (and so probably Silat is somewhat aggressive)."

It's true that Esplin didn't specifically mark it as weird that oatmeal could provide a /kandrona/ replacement. It might not actually even /be/ weird, though, when you think about it, given the insane biodiversity of Earth (which is unusual in this universe).

The brain in a box is just straight-up another copy of him. Same awareness, same values.

The idea with Kandrona is that half of it /always/ stays behind in the pool, and the other half of it is in instant Z-space radio contact on a neuron-by-neuron basis. So it's always in "the sharing," even as it's controlling dozens or hundreds of bodies. One hive mind, but with enough neural mass to punch right through the multitasking problem and /actually/ do a million things at once.

Our Esplin would have zero control over it, which is why he's so keen to be /absolutely sure/ that it's value-aligned. But! Once it's really up and running, he could merge with it, and become a part of it, in theory. Then he would /be/ it (since it was already him) and that's mission accomplished.
