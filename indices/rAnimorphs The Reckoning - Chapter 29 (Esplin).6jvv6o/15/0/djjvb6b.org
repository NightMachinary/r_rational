In canon, I thought the demorph ray was kind of a gimmick; basically the equivalent of Team Rocket showing up with electricity-proof gear so everyone would go 'Oh no, the single most effective tactic of the heroes no longer works'!

I mean, yeerks have nukes, orbital strikes, bio-filters, gravity waves detector and antimatter paintballs. The demorph ray doesn't bring that much to the table in comparison. Any mook that has the occasion to point the thing at an Animorph could also pump them full of holes anyway.

The two major impacts I see this having is: Garett is now vulnerable to infestation if he's captured, and it will be even harder to infiltrate yeerk facilities now (not that it was really a possibility at all at this point)
