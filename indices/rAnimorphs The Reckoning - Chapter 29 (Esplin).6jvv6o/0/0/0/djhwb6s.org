  Morphing tech isn't destroying bodies when it tucks them away in Z-space. I can see that it could, but I'm sticking with the actual pocket dimension thing.

Interesting... this doesn't exactly /disconfirm/ my theory about the interaction of physical memories and the emulation; the memories still have to be transferred from the emulation to the original body somehow. Unless there is no separate emulation, and it's all done on the person's physical brain, but that implies that they would need to sleep as normal after lots of morphing, which isn't the case.

  I'm hoping it doesn't quite count as idiot-ball so much as realistic bias.

Honestly, it seems pretty idiot-ball to me, /unless/ Esplin didn't know about morph-mind-replication at the time.
