  Maybe he does acquire Elfangor, but the combined resistance of Alloran and Elfangor overwhelms Esplin's ability to rip the relevant information from Elfangor's head, and he can only really awaken Elfangor while restrained to avoid getting a tail blade to the throat, and even that is too risky because the whole thing might compromise his ability to demorph?
