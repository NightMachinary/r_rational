Well, if /I/ had this power and someone was dying, the first thing I'd think to do is grab a copy of their mind state, to save them from permanent death. I imagine if I were /evil/ I'd have all the more reason to grab mind-states as standard procedure.

Maybe he /does/ acquire Elfangor, but the combined resistance of Alloran and Elfangor overwhelms Esplin's ability to rip the relevant information from Elfangor's head, and he can only really awaken Elfangor while restrained to avoid getting a tail blade to the throat, and even that is too risky because the whole thing might compromise his ability to demorph? It would be super poignant, Alloran and Elfangor could interact mind to mind for a short time. Or maybe Esplin predicts this outcome and doesn't even try. It would also be kind of hilarious if he does try and that is how Alloran finally kills Esplin and saves his brother to boot.

Alternatively, I think idiot balls are less blatant if the character later facepalms about them / somehow the story acknowledges that it was a mistake.

Edit: Or! What if one of the incentives for Esplin's experiments to increase his yeerk-tissue without compromising his identity is to successfully unlock Elfangor's memories and solve a piece of the animorphs puzzle, and when he succeeds it leads him to learn about the Ellimist, except naturally the Ellimist knew that it would happen and so it put /precisely/ right memories in Elfangor's head to influence Esplin in a way that twists the plot in /exactly/ the right way...
