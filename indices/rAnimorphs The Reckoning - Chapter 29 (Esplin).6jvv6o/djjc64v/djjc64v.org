Loved the window into V3's mind and terminal values and goals. My first thought was that he's like a sapient cancer, but really he's more like the ultra-yeerk, wanting not just one host, but a universe of hosts all controlled by the same essential being.

Great villains can make good stories great: an already-great story gets made that much better :)
