(oh god I'm doing the rational debate police thing again, what the hell am I trying to prove)

I get your point, but it's irrelevant here. Poor form (whatever it is) isn't about what you intend to say or the wording you use, it's about dynamics.

Like, imagine you have a kid whose family is about to move house; the parents are trying to decide whether she should change schools; if the parents tell their daughter "You should stay in your room until we've come to a decision, so you don't make things too complicated", after she asks to be included in the discussion, they're being condescending. It doesn't matter that their wording was neutral (they could have said 'Get to your room, kid!' or that they didn't intend for the child to feel patronized at all. Context is everything, and in context they're not respecting her.

(I suspect this is a big problem in feminism and similar movements; and the big concept behind mansplaining; the point is, you don't get to say 'the rules don't apply to me, it's not condescending because I have good reasons to say that')
