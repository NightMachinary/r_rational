I didn't take it as him claiming some sort of high status, so much as basically pointing out that a person who is presenting a speech on some new metallurgy technique probably knows the basic nature of the role carbon plays in steel, because pretty much everyone who would be at a metallurgy conference knows that. I had just popped in for coffee and didn't think about where I was.

It's kind of funny that you'd bring up "mansplaining."

You know the story behind the coining of that word, the one regarding a woman who had a guy at a party find out what field she worked in and keep talking to her as if she didn't understand it, to the point of recommending that she get a grip on it by reading a book that she was actually the author of?

Actually, that's basically what I did to TK there. Circumstances did convene to find me explaining to him a thing that from context it would be freakishly unlikely for him to not already know. His criticizing me for it is a fair cop.
