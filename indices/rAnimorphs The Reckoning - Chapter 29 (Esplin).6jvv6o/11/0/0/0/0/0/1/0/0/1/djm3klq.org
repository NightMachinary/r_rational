I notice that you didn't address what I identified as our disagreement: that however right you are about the dynamic you identify as bad, I don't think that applies, because I /disagree I said the bad thing you're claiming I said./

That's a crux, for me--I'm highly skeptical that there's any value in further engagement for either of us until that point is addressed. You can make strong arguments for "be reasonable about how you might be MISinterpreted, and make reasonable accommodations to prevent that," but in the end I like to fall back, as a defense, upon what I /actually said/ in a given situation, and whether THAT is objectionable.
