"I think the lecture on Bayes was a bit much," TK17 says dryly. "I mean, did you really think the source of our disagreement was that the author of the 250,000 word ratfic lacks a 101 understanding of probabilistic reasoning? Much more likely that we just had different priors, for some reason."

The actual crux here, I posit, is the phrase "doesn't accept the god's intervention as real." By the moment in the story in question, he is in fact LEANING toward 'the gods did it' as an explanation. He's LOOKING for things that might be indications of divine interference. Which indicates some bias, and I maybe could've thrown in a token sentence about him being sure to consider alternatives, but he was doing that left and right and it should've been taken as implied.

Additionally, 'overwhelmingly likely that they recovered the test subjects' ... those subjects were all locked up in the pool and vaporized prior to the meteor impact; V3 can verify that they were still there via security footage. (Things like that are not spelled out in the text every time, but the hope is that after showing V3's MO they can be reasonably extrapolated/predicted Ã  la 'what would Esplin do?')

Given that the god or gods' actions have always been invisible in the moment, and only noticed afterward via their effects, that lends weight to the source being some shard or human that was under less direct surveillance (as opposed to ' the footage was directly doctored').

One last piece of the puzzle that your calculation didn't take into account is the likelihood of a given host knowing what its Yeerk knows. It's far from guaranteed that a human host would be aware of the details of a highly secret project, given a Yeerk's ability to shut off the human's access to sight and sound at sensitive moments.
