  "I think the lecture on Bayes was a bit much," TK17 says dryly. "I mean, did you really think the source of our disagreement was that the author of the 250,000 word ratfic lacks a 101 understanding of probabilistic reasoning? Much more likely that we just had different priors, for some reason."

Saying "Don't you know that I have credentials? Waste not your explanations of simple concepts on me, for I already know them" is kind of poor form, justified or not. It establishes an implicit norm of "Don't try to explain simple concepts to people with high status, even for the sake of clear communication, because doing so is a /faux-pas social/".
