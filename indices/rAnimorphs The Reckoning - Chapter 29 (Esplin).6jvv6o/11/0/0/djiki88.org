  but the group that was being fed oatmeal was fairly small and tightly controlled, kept isolated and so forth, and most of Aftran's hosts didn't just sort of casually know about it.

I suppose that Esplin does seem to suspect treachery easily enough that "they got lucky and found the test group" is less likely to him than "they got lucky and found someone willing to betray everything." Still a bit odd that he seems to have ruled the first possibility out.

  The coalescion knew, of course, but as individual Yeerks got sorted and dumped into individual heads, that particular knowledge wasn't usually needed.

Come on, man. The two individual yeerks that they happened to get knew about it. Even if they didn't, the number of yeerks that knew about it being smaller actually just reduces the attack surface for getting the info by corrupting yeerks, and so it makes salvaged hosts who were in the know more likely to be the points of discovery for that piece of intel, relatively speaking. This hurts your own case.
