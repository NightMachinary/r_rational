A little confusing for the first chapter, will definitely have settled down by chapter three. Deliberately intended to stand alone without references, and I've heard from multiple readers who say they love it who haven't read canon. Some of the really weird stuff will seem like it comes out of left field because it was meant to reference something in canon, but it'll all make /sense./
