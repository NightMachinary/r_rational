Always love Esplin's chapters. The guy is so insane, so smart, and so evil.

Aw, Trillian got Yeerked :(

Who is Silat, and why does Esplin have such total control over them? I thought at this point all he had left within the sphere was Telor, who is obviously not on his side. Am I mixing up pools?

Isn't it a bit odd that Esplin, who has keyed into the weirdness going on in this system, hasn't noticed that Ralph's maple-and-ginger instant oatmeal just happens to be a kandrona replacement? Did he just take that for granted?

Esplin has a brain in a box. Ok, not great. Is it sentient? Or just encoded values and memories at this point?

Why did Esplin use the hypersight on Kilgam at all? To give it some shred of his memories to take with it into Kandrona?

Glad that didn't work. But even if it had, would Esplin have been able to control all the bodies at once through Kandrona like he does with his clones? How are they all linked while apart from the coalescion?
