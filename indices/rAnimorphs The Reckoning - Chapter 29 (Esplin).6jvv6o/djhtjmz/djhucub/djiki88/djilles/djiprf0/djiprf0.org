1) Yes, but given that the POV character doesn't accept the god's intervention as real, it doesn't explain why they would write off possibilities due to the god. Unless you're saying that the gods intervened to make him write off the possibility of a host human being the source of the information, which is... oddly specific, especially since it isn't even true.

2) It's not that fewer yeerks knowing about it makes it more likely for the secret to be spilled, it's that it makes it less likely, once the secret is known to be spilled, that the source was a yeerk.

It's like the statistics of false positives - you know, how if you have a test that reports that you have a condition 99% of the time if you actually have it, and reports that you don't have it 99% of the time if you don't have it, and the condition happens in 1/1,000 of the population, and you have a person who came up positive on the test, what's the odds that they actually have the condition?

Well, there's a .99 out of 1,000 chance that they have it and the test reports that they have it correctly, and a 9.99 out of 1,000 chance that they don't have it and got a false positive, so there's only about a 9% chance at this point that the positive result was due to them actually having the condition. All they know is that more examination is probably a good idea, since their odds have gone from one in a thousand to one in eleven.

So, say you had a hundred thousand yeerks and ten humans who knew about the oatmeal.

Let's say there's a 5% chance of the enemy being able to identify a given controller, a 30% chance of them being able to capture it once identified, and a 0.1% chance that they'll talk once captured.

On the other hand, let's say there's a 1% chance of them discovering the test humans, a 10% chance of them recovering each one once they find them, and a 100% chance the subject will spill the oatmeal.

At that point, once you know the secret is out, there is only a 0.7% chance it came from a recovered host, and a 99.3% chance it came from an interrogated yeerk.

But if the yeerks controlling humans don't generally know about it? If only 20 yeerks at a time know about the alternate source, and 10 of them are in the test humans at any given time? Once you know the secret is out, it's overwhelmingly likely it's because the enemy discovered and recovered the test subjects, and between the human and the yeerk, who was the one most likely to talk?
