I wholly agree that saying "Don't you know I have credentials" would be poor form. I disagree that that's what I said, though.

What I /think/ that I said was, you're explaining Bayes to me, but do you think that's the actual root of our disagreement? Or, to put it another way, you're explaining Bayes to me, but did you use Bayes before writing your explanation?

That's definitely what I /meant,/ anyway, even if I did a bad job expressing it. That's what the "dryly" and then further concrete elaboration of what I thought was going on was all about.

Alas, I'm not yet as good as Jake.
