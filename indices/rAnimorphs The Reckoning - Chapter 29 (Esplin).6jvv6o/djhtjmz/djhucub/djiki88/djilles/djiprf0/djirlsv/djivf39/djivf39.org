  "I think the lecture on Bayes was a bit much," TK17 says dryly. "I mean, did you really think the source of our disagreement was that the author of the 250,000 word ratfic lacks a 101 understanding of probabilistic reasoning?"

Well, I had assumed that you would immediately recognize what I meant when I was talking about relative odds in the first place. When communication didn't happen I figured that the worst that could happen if I built up my point from principles was that it would become painfully obvious. Plus I had forgotten that bit of math is actually Bayes' theorem, and would be a big name around here, so go ahead and get your yuks in for that. I don't really hang out in this community that much - I only stop by occasionally to see the commentary on a couple of things, your story included.

We've probably wasted a lot more words on this that is justified, but I'm not sure I'd consider "the subjects were all locked up in the pool, as per the security footage" to be a particularly solid defense when the opposition has an unknown number of shapeshifters with an unknown level of fanaticism and who are able to pocket entire people with no outward sign, and I have had access to the same toolset and have an idea of its abilities.

Why couldn't they have say, infiltrated with multiple agents, some of them folded into a morph, rescued people who could provide intel (and possibly captured yeerks) by absorbing them into morph, and left behind agents willing to die for the cause to take on the role of the recovered individuals? The abandoned agents could have just planned to die in z-space, which would prevent them from being used as information sources against their allies, and would leave behind a copy of the person they stole, who knows nothing of the resistance. The controllers have to go to join the pool like any others, right? If someone is paranoid enough to go over the timings of their trips with a fine tooth comb, they're paranoid enough to worry quite a lot about low-probability possibilities.

Though, I guess your later point about yeerks being able to block senses may be good enough to rule that out as a source of leaks, if he trusts them to be vigilant.

Anyway. Yadda yadda yadda, it's not a big deal. It just seemed odd to handwave away what seemed like a pretty valid possibility at the time.
