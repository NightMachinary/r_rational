Woohoo! Thank you for the long and detailed comment.

Last part first ... I think Esplin is /probably/ eating oatmeal these days, rather than Yeerk shards, but he didn't necessarily tell Telor that. I mean, if they're already delivering you a shard every few days, and you've stopped eating them but you want to start using them for mad science ... easier to just not say /anything,/ right?

Morphing tech isn't destroying bodies when it tucks them away in Z-space. I can see that it /could,/ but I'm sticking with the actual pocket dimension thing. But you're right that Esplin's been stealing every individual piece of the morphing tech puzzle that he can---he's figured out how it transmits thoughts, how it scans and duplicates bodies, how it stashes stuff in Z-space. But for some gosh-darned reason, he just can't get the whole thing to add up. Weird, huh?

re: Elfangor, I went with him not grabbing Elfangor's DNA to show that he's still goad-able and, while pretty sharp and on-the-ball, still capable of just going eh, that's low-priority, I can just skip it. I'm hoping it doesn't quite count as idiot-ball so much as realistic bias.
