This was amazing, as usual! Esplin chapters are always the most "rationalist" in the classical hpmor sense. I love how Esplin is a Dark Transhumanist (Transyeerkist?) who wants to end death and make optimal use of resources, but only for himself. He aspires to eventually become an Ellimist/Crayak-level being, at least. I wouldn't be surprised if Crayak himself, who is from another galaxy in canon, had a similar origin story, leaving behind his old galaxy in ruins. Probably most or all godlike beings in this universe have an origin like this. If Esplin ascends in this way, he still has to deal with all the gods in the other galaxies too - which would be a fascinating story in its own right. Of course, I don't want him to get that far...

*Specific Comments*

One. [Hey, I would use actual numbers, but the numbering interacts weirdly with the quotes and I don't want to deal with that now]

  The same was true of the chain of coincidence that had led to the seizure of a Skrit Na freighter during the frantic escape from Ondar---a freighter that had just happened to be carrying the only human that had ever been transported outside of its home system, the woman who eventually became the host of Visser One and who brought the human species to the attention of the Council of Thirteen.

It looks like Marco's mom is still Visser One in this story. She was apparently abducted on earth by the Skrit Na, who made it look like she was in a boating accident.

Two.

  Almost without conscious thought, I found myself morphing, my perspective shifting as I rose into the air, the form of an Antarean Bogg

And /why/ does Esplin not first acquire Elfangor in order to sift through his memories later? Even if he didn't yet know about reading thoughts from morph, he might still want to impersonate Elfangor later.

Three.

  Kandrona, I had named it, for I was not without a sense of history. A new life form, distilled from Yeerk-flesh and Andalite neurons with the help of the Arn, enhanced with microscopic technology developed by the Naharans.

I bet that the morphing technology was the icing on the cake that allowed him to make /exact/ copies of himself.

Four.

  for every thread that would leave the coalescion, a mirror that would not, the two kept in perfect harmony by the self-repairing transmitters ensheathing each axon.
#+end_quote

This is probably (also) something Esplin learned from studying the morphing technology. The Yeerk neurons in-morph have Z-space links to the brain emulators. So ... the emulated brain is interacting with a simulated world that mirrors the real world, but can possibly be disconnected from it (hence the intervention in the Yeerk pool). This implies that the gods can only do those impressive interventions to someone in-morph.

Also, given how precisely the morphing tech can perfectly replicate bodies, I bet it just destroys a person's original body and reconstructs it with the right memories every time they demorph. Hence the intervention on Marco, who saw David's true mind in the mirrored simulation but whose body was reconstructed with a different set of memories.

Five.

  Today, I would test Kandrona's true steadfastness. Today, I would see if Kandrona could metabolize a natural Yeerk, in addition to copies of itself
#+end_quote

On first read, I thought that Esplin was trying to get the Kandrona to perfectly become the Yeerk that it had devoured, so that Esplin himself could later be absorbed by a Kandrona to become part of the coalescion without a change in his values. I suppose that since he can already create perfect copies of his own mind, there is no need for that, but /why/ does he still need to eat other yeerks? Dude, just copy the oatmeal; you can't eat other yeerks forever anyway.
