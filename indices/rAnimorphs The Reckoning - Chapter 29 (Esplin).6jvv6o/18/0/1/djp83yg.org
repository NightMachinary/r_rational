Wahoo! Bleu is back! At least for this chapter! Though they still sound stressed and busy! So no pressure for the future! But lots of appreciation this time! Hooray!

The Council is the thirteen largest/most influential pools on the homeworld, which got a lot more complicated after the war started and some of those pools uprooted themselves entirely and others stayed and now there's a blockade and agents of pools that stayed behind went in and out of coalescion with other pools and who knows how much they stayed exactly the same and boy howdy.

But generally speaking, they're each represented by a consistent ambassador or set of ambassadors. In my mind, Visser One is a shard derived from Edriss, which is the first among the pools and is no longer on the homeworld.

Sticking to canon, I'm going to say that the Council is made up of a semi-representative mix of hosts, but that this will likely change soon. Going with the sort of HPMOR "we're starting at a dumb status quo, but we'll let people evolve away from it quickly" thing. In particular, the impressiveness of Visser One's host has caught the Council's attention, and "export us a few dozen humans" was probably high on the list before the Z-space rift.

I guess I did say "V1 lied to the Council," but I think the real emotional core of that was "V1 and the Council all lied to me!" V3 and the entire Yeerk species have had this uneasy sort of cease-fire alliance since the beginning, so V3 is paranoid that they're all scheming against him because they probably are.

re: 600 kids ... yeah, it's always wise to remember that V3 has access to the Arn, and regardless of the fact that it's poor /literary/ convention to use the Eagles over and over again, it's pretty good /strategy/ ...

Oh, man. I'm now seriously regretting not having him investigate Trekkies and Hogwarts. Missed joke opportunity. I think I'll actually edit that in, Galaxy Quest style.

Yeerks learned about Elfangor through some eavesdropping on Andalite propaganda, and through the fact that Elfangor has a single, identifiable ship, and through the fact that he himself was carrying out a campaign of demoralization against the Yeerks and while most of his kills were silent, would occasionally be very, very blatant about it, Ã  la leaving one survivor. That just made it so that when ships disappeared by /actual/ accident, they would /still/ attribute it to the demigod Andalite warrior ...

As far as Elfangor keeping secrets from his people, it hasn't been clarified in text, but note that he claims to have spent several years in human morph, and that he was aware of Ellimist fuckery. I'm basically conceiving of him as the mirror to the canon Drode---the character who'd be closest to playing r!Dumbledore's role of "constrained by prophetic knowledge."

Marco got a lot. But probably not all, and there's a /lot/ there to get.

re: recruitment drive, I'm hoping that Tobias and Garrett leaned on some of them to travel internationally and set up shop elsewhere, but even if they didn't, I think it's still narratively good---teenagers fail to overcome their ethnocentric bias makes sense to me.

Sensors not picking up the kids was direct god intervention, bringing the total of on-screen, incontrovertible god interventions to four, I think (Z-space rift, sensor malfunction, kids' rescue from the asteroid, Marco's mindwipe).

re: redundancy, don't speak too soon. Note the line "sent a drone with seeds and copies," for instance. He's read Vision of the Past and Specter of the Future by now, probably.

... I'm actually seriously considering having the Yeerks make crazy headway on a bunch of issues after having caught and infested Andrew Critch.

I also love you forever for noticing that he's vacillating between base 7 and base 13.

Telor does know about oatmeal; they were running the factory, after all (they were running everything outside of Ventura). They think V3 isn't eating oatmeal because the tests were never fully conclusive; he is, and he's just using the ongoing stream of Yeerks for his experiments. It seemed easier not to bring it up---"I want you to stop sending me sacrifices to /eat,/ but keep sending me sacrifices to /play/ with ..."

Hmmm. You're right about his poor scientific methodology, and that might be worth a significant rewrite as well. That's the sort of thing that used to get fixed when I was better about using my volunteer beta readers and did less writing-right-up-to-the-wire.

I think the only actual non-value-drift method is for Kandrona to start basically "digesting" other Yeerks and simply using their raw, physical components to grow new Kandrona tissue according to a rigid, preset form. That lends itself to other failure modes, of course ...

If V3 starts using Kandrona as an advisor, that's good, but it also introduces the AI control problem (which, even though he's theoretically solved with Leeran hypersight, he's still wary enough to be suspicious of).

I like the idea of V1 having given this to V3 hoping he would fail. It's a nice, rationalist-compatible update to their political brinksmanship from canon. V3 /does/ have some plans, though, and I think they're plausible.

Thank you so very very much for the long review. Made my afternoon.
