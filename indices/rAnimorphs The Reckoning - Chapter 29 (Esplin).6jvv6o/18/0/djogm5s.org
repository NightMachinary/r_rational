/Kandrona/

- Oh god, here we go, Esplin becomes gray goo. That ain't good.

- Esplin is discarding redundancy pretty quickly. He makes the argument that having many independent copies is not as good as having copies with distributed version control, but it's still unambiguously better than no copies at all.

- Overall, I like the whole philosophical dissertation; the sci-fi examples sort of make it seem more grounded, somehow; it's maybe a little on-the-nose (who is Esplin even talking to?) but even that fits his personality.

- Although I think Esplin's dichotomy between "the object / the method" and "the meta / the ultimate goal" is somewhat arbitrary.

- "And I struggled to answer questions that no one had bother to ask before. Except the Bayesian conspiracy. I actually made a lot of headway capturing these people, reading their mind and then releasing them as more pawns to take over the Earth."

- "It had doubled seven times" Interesting. I wonder if Esplin makes faux-pas like that when discussing with his lieutenants. "And we will make a factory with the ability to build seven spaceships a month!" "You mean thirteen spaceships, Visser?" "Uuuum yes. That is what I meant. Because I like base thirteen. I don't think in base seven at all." "..."

- Poor Kilgam 1. We hardly knew you. Not that there was much to know.

- It's interesting that Telor would give unique names to the yeerks it feeds Visser 3. If I had to discard parts of myself on a regular basis, I would just go ahead an call them Tribute #451 or something. (I wonder how the coalescions even give names to their individual parts?)

- I wonder if it occurred to Telor yet that, with oatmeal, they don't need to feed tributes to Esplin anymore. They might not know about oatmeal (unlikely, Aftran would have told them, it's pretty important intel); if they do know, would they wonder about exactly Esplin does with the yeerks he's still receiving?

- So Visser does realized he's fused with Alloran.

- Esplin is using a poor scientific methodology here. He apparently doesn't have any objective mean to detect value drift, and relies on his own perception instead; that means he should do a blind trial; create 2 Kandronas, one 'pure' and one altered, put them each in a space shuttle, and approach one of them at random with a Leeran, and try to determine which one is altered, then see if he gets significantly better-than-random results. As it is, he's likely to get false positives, see value drift that isn't there, etc.

- While we're nitpicking his approach, it also seems a bit hasty of him to immediately discard the altered Kandrona; there might still be insights or experiences gained from it. Also Esplin could probably parallelize a bit more, and build Kandronas in assembly-line, instead of one by one.

- I wonder how Kandrona could absorb new yeerks without value drift? As I said, there's not much concrete difference between methodology and ideology; I'm pretty sure they're not stored in separate areas of the brain (I could be wrong). How would Kandrona absorb one and reject the other? Real-life version control has merge conflicts, and those can only be solved by a higher authority (someone manually editing the files). Although now that I think about it the 'higher authority' would simply have to be the original.

- Even if his experiments don't work, could Visser use Kandrona as an advisor? It's basically a smarter, bigger version of him, with less immediate perception. He could give him a set up similar to Telor's, humans or other sentients with yeerk-rope going through their brains, linking them to Kandrona. Then he'd have better analysis abilities, better memory, more throughput, and his chapters would be even harder to write! Win-win for everybody (who happens to be Esplin)!

/Logistics/

I've been wondering about how logistically feasible taking over the Earth might be for Visser 3. He says he will have to build a thousand pools to be able to infest everyone on Earth, and that having a few dozen factories means he will be able to outproduce all the major players.

But... how would he build those pools? It's kind of a catch-22: he needs pools to control the humans, but he needs humans to build the pools. Moreover, I don't see partial conquest working. Ideally, Esplin would want to take over a small country for long enough to build enough Kandronas to sustain a complete takeover, but even that would be hard. Countries are not islands, people come and go from them, and you can't infest them all. Even North Korea can't get you that far, since they don't have enough infrastructure to keep their streets lit at night. Once your yeerk country is found out, surrounding countries will try to invade it, the major powers will try to nuke it, etc.

More importantly, everyone will stop exporting anything to this country. It's like those videos about how crazy complicated supply lines are needed to build even a crayon. A space-capable fighter would require extracting, refining, and working a lot of materials. Not all countries have the huge coal and iron mining facilities needed to produce steel (and that's before we get into rare earths and petrol). Not to mention, an increasing proportion of western infrastructure is getting dependent on GPS and the internet. Yeerkistan is not going to have those (or at least, not for long).

A possible strategy is to keep the secrecy, and seed pools and factories throughout industrialized countries, but I don't see that working either. The problem is always the same: to build spaceships, you need materials and engineers, which means you need supply lines, and those can be traced. A government-employed engineer can say on his tax papers "I spent the last six months working on a secret military project"; a private engineer can't.

Another strategy is to destroy all governments with orbital bombings until they aren't able to detect your presence, but that runs into problems too. First off, the yeerks only have around 13 fighters (less now that they gave some away). By the time those fighters are done destroying all military bases and killing all Senators in, say, the USA, the other countries will have had time to prepare themselves, decentralize, hide their leaders and their aircraft, etc.

Which is all to say: secret alien invasions are complicated. Anyway, my original point was that I wondered if Visser 1 had thought about this, given this nut to Visser 3 hoping it would be too hard for him to crack.

And... that's it. Well, this was a lot more thought-intensive and time-consuming than I expected. Anyway, great story, and keep up the good work!
