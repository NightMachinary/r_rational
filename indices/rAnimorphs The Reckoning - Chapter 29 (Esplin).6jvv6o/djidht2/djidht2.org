Man, what a crazy chapter. I'm wondering if V1 is Loren or Eva now. Here's some rambling thoughts:

There's something nagging at me...this whole chapter I keep getting the feeling of 'Esplin's going to fuck up and it's going to be his downfall'. I can't put my finger on exactly where...right now I think it's Alloran that's a giant unknown factor, and Esplin hasn't really pursued it. What's going to happen when he perfects Kandrona and leaves his host for the first time in how long?

What would happen if you just chucked Esplin, host body and all, into Cirran?

There is a persistent theme of 'strength in unity' throughout this story, and Esplin stands against that. While Esplin has the Arn, other species, Silat and Telor under his command, I wouldn't say he has allies, he has...servants. No, hold on. His approach is to unify the galaxy under his Kandrona, as one. Unity through silence or unity through harmony? Now we're back to the themes of the E/C conflict. So I think what it boils down to is whether Esplin can achieve his goals in time? If he ultimately fails to capture Earth, or loses too many troops in the process, will he get the opportunity to pursue his ultimate goal like this again?
