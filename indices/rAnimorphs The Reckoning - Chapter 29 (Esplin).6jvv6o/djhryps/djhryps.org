I'm going to try and do longer form feedback, because, well, the story is very good and I want to make the author happy by providing long-form feedback. It's mostly going to be squeeing over every minor detail, so if you were hoping for long-form /critical/ feedback then I apologise.

~January~

- First thought: ESPLIN CHAPTER OH MY GOD THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN BIG TROUBLE AREN'T THEY

- Why does Esplin think the humans rearranged Z-Space?

- Is Visser One some non-human alien or is the description just based on andalite sensabilities??????????????

- Insects in amber seems like a strange simile for Esplin to use since I don't think the Yeerk world or the Andalite world would have insects and amber.

- Given the yerk hive mind... what is Visser One? Is she a cannibal like Esplin, or is she part of the Visser One pool, or what? I feel like this may have already been answered.

- Speaks of a rendezvous with the Gedds. In the series the Gedds are not portrayed as being capable of advanced society. Now I want to know what the Gedds are like here????

~February~

- I'm wondering how much time has passed in-universe since Elfangor crashed. I get the feeling this chapter is 3 months or so long. Is that just bridging the gap between Esplin's last chapter?

- Good that Esplin is taking a good look at influential human orgs. Doesn't seem to help him, but he's right, if it turns out area 51 does have secret alien technology, he /needs to know yesterday/.

~March~

- Ohhh okay so the past two subheadings were "prequels" and /now/ we're meeting Elfangor. That's interesting. But also comforting because I got the feeling that the story had only happened like for a month since Elfangor's death, so my intuition has not been squashed so much.

- Backstory is different?? Arbron is a lady?? Is the andalite society not horrifically sexist here? And she's not a taxxon??? I liked arbron-the-taxxon :( I kind of hope she appears "what? YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD?" style!

- The yeerks here are infesting Skrit Na? That's interesting. (Aside: I have re-read all the chronicles and some of the megamorphs the past week or so, so I'm feeling especially brushed up on the mythology if you can't tell, and ultimately I suspect I'll be re-reading the whole series with a few of the crappy books skipped).

- This Esplin/Elfangor scene is amazing. I didn't know I needed it.

- "the least unworthy of my opponents" /swoon/ at that line.

- "patch the hole at your side, prevent your soul from leaking out" - is Esplin being poetic or does he believe in souls?

~ May ~

- WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW I AM EXCITED TO READ THIS SUBHEADING

- The idea of humans mastering z-space manipulation as arn have mastered biology and Naharans microtechnology is a cool idea that I've only seen once before, in something I started but never finished on podiobooks back in the day called, I think, "Hospital Earth" - its premise was that each alien race is naturally good at one thing, and humanity was good at medicine, other species being good at FTL drives but not quite grasping germ theory or whathaveyou. We have pretty amazing medicine when you think about it, so I kind of liked that. Anyway, point is, it's a great idea because you'd expect that different branches of science are "further along" by some objective standpoint than others, but we have no way of seeing which those are because of our, well, context in human culture. So I'm kind of holding hope that humanity has an amazing mastery of, I don't know, offshore engineering compared with other species (perhaps due to our large amount of coastal cities). Anyway, I'm sure I"m wrong, but it's a fun thought!

- I love the oatmeal. It is so terribly ridiculous but it's wonderful.

- I'm not sure if I like Esplin jumping to Ellimist here. I mean, we know he's right, but if I were Esplin, I'd think it was more likely the animorphs immediately started recruiting and the Z-Space thing was a coincidence than that /a god has it out for me, but isn't directly killing me, just making humans not quite die/ - honestly the Chee make more sense like he said...

- Two thousand humans for Silat including 600 producing offspring: is he breeding his hosts? Is a baby a useful host? That's all kind of fucked up.

- He's giving the dogs a PLANET?

- Okay, Visser One is a human, and the other mouth holes that are flapping are nostrils I guess. But wait - does that mean Visser One is Loren, not Eva?

- I'm feeling better about him guessing the Ellimist/Crayak thing as he doesn't seem to actually believe it, just tossing it out there. And he's smarter than me, so he'd be more likely to think of something like that.

- For those playing along, Luanda and Kinshasa sound like alien places, but they are African capitals - not Ebola, though.

~ New Section With No Heading ~

- Living forever??????

- oh my god his philosophy is going to be amazing, coming from a culture where consciousness itself is highly mutable

- wait he's making some sort of artificial life???

- omg his plan is scary AF

- oh thank god it didn't owkr

- wait he just threw out a mind-clone of himself into the vacuum of space, dooming it to death??? THAT IS COLD, VISSER
