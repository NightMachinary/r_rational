Wahoo! Ten billion Planck constants of extra credit to you. Also, it's sweet that you've recently read through canon---I haven't had the time, my last read-through was maybe five years ago.

~January~

Humans responsible for rift: It was his immediate, knee-jerk thought; the obvious suspicion given that it happened JUST as they violated Earth space.

Visser One: Is human, as-yet-unidentified, the "alien" stuff is just from-Esplin's-perspective.

Insects in amber: I chose that as a planet-neutral "flies in honey." =)

Visser One is an ordinary Yeerk. She drops in and out of a larger pool, and that larger pool occasionally tweaks her, but since she's a pretty capable Yeerk as-is the tweaks are minor and she's basically consistent from infestation to infestation.

The Gedds are still used as hosts in the Yeerk empire, they're just none-too-bright and not very coordinated. A very low-status host.

~March~

Yeah, I gender-bent Arbron. I want the Andalites to be a bit less sexist, since they're still terrible in other ways. I actually /seriously/ considered having Ax be female all along (after all of the team's assumptions about "Elfangor's brother") but in the end it felt a little too token-y. No promises re: Arbron showing back up as a Taxxon, but I guess she /did/ die off-screen, which is always suspect.

I decided to leave it ambiguous whether they're infesting Skrit Na or just conscripting them. I sort of liked how in canon everybody just left the Skrit Na alone. There've been references earlier in the story to the Skrit Na planet falling to the Yeerks, though.

re: souls, Esplin was being poetic.

~May~

Yep, he's breeding hosts.

Think about negotiating with the Chee: if you're all, like, "I promise I'll be nice to dogs," that might get you somewhere. If you can prove "I've /already/ committed to making a dog paradise; it's half-built already, you can look inside my mind with a Leeran and see that I am 100% never going back on this promise," that gives you a BUNCH more power. (Kudos to one of my colleagues for pointing this out to me.)

It didn't work /this/ time...

^{Also note that even though he can't get the thing to be stable as it eats other Yeerks, he /has/ successfully created copies of himself that share his exact values, and can infest other hosts.}
