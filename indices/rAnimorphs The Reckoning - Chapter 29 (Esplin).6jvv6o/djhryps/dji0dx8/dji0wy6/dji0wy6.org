Yeah, but in the original series the oatmeal was mentioned once but never came up again. I like that the oatmeal is remaining relevant. But it makes sense: if such a thing did exist, well, then of course the Visser would be all over it.

Whereas that failed experiment to stop humans having free will, or Rachel burping up an alligator, even canon, would have little effect on /this/ universe, if you get me.

(Aside: PLEASE let Rachel acquire an alligator and burp it. PLS)
