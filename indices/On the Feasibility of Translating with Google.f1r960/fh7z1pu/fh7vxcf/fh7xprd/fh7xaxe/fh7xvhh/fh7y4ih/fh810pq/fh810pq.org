You could try asking for more information/suggestions in the Novel Updates forums? Novel Updates hosts links to translated chapters of many fictions, largely Chinese and Japanese, and among which a good number of translations are similarly touched-up machine translations. Quality varies. In any case, presumably the people in their forums might be more familiar with the ethical, legal, logistical, and/or other aspects of this proposition?
