If his personal view was that he was OK with a translation, he'd have put something about that next to the copyright notice he chose to add.

Adding a copyright notice indicates his intent to control his copyright. He would have copyright in the work even without the notice, so choosing to add one is good evidence that he doesn't want the work to be in the public domain.

So, I hope you will now understand why you should seek and receive permission before publishing any translation of this work.
