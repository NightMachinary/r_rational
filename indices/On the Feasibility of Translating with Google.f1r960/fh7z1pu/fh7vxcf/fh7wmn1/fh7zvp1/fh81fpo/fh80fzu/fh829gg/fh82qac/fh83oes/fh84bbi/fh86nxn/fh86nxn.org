  Aight mate, when the author puts a work of theirs online for free, that's usually indicative of a certain sort of spirit, you see? One that generally approves of a work being spread around and modified---though I have more experience with software, myself.

I mean even in software, it's possible to put your code online but not to allow it to be "spread around and modified" without permission. It depends on the particular license, doesn't it? In the case of this particular story, he's put "Â© Copyright Shumil Pavel", and he hasn't licensed it using Creative Commons or similar, so your assumption that he'd be fine with your botched translation is probably false.

  Anyway, copyright law is really different in Russia. Do you know anything about the law there at all?
#+end_quote

Russia is a Berne Convention signatory so the law there is not that different any more.

#+begin_quote
  Not that this point is actually applicable, since if the author grants permission, that kind of renders the entire thing moot.

Yeah, ask the author's permission. Be sure to tell him that because he put the story online, you feel entitled to run it through Google Translate and hack it around and then publish it, so you regard his permission as a mere formality and you'll do it anyway if he doesn't reply. I'm sure he'll see that you're a smart guy who knows what he's doing.
