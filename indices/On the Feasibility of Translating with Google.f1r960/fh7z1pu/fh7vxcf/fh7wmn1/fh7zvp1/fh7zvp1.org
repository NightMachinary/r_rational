  the best translation for the title is probably The Word of the Dragon, despite Google saying it's 'A word about the dragon'

If Google didn't translate the title well, how often do you think it's going to mistranslate the original in ways that you don't notice, because you can't speak Russian?

A better idea would be to find somebody who speaks Russian and is a fan of rational fiction, have them translate into English and then you polish it.

But first you need to contact the author and ask permission to produce a translation.
