As a professional translator this suggestion is making me weep blood. If you aren't familiar with fanfic etiquette, it goes like this:

1. You contact the author. 2. Tell them that you really would like to read an English translation of their work. 3. Offer to do it yourself, if you have the competence. 4. Or maybe one of the author's fans translates it.

The entitlement and sheer lack of disrespect for a profession and skill set is unreal here. Yikes.
