Well, you've only posted asking about machine translating, you haven't actually posted asking for a human translator to help you, so it's kind of weird to complain "nobody's volunteering".

And this sub is a good place to crowdsource the translation, but it's not necessarily the best place to find a translator. Why don't you try asking where the best place to find a translator is (after you've contacted the author to get permission)? It's not like there is no precedent for people [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aKCa4J4n4xWLHEoeZ/rationalist-lord-of-the-rings-fanfiction-newly-translated][translating rationalist works from Russian into English]]
