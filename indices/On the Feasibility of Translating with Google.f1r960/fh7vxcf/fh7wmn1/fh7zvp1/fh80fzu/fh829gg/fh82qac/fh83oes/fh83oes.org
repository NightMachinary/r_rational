Fan fiction is a very different thing from an unauthorised translation. Fan fiction is arguably transformative in the legal sense, translating a work into a different language definitely is not. It's not legal to publish Harry Potter in French without permission from JK Rowling. And just because you put a work online for free, doesn't mean you give up the copyright and the associated moral rights.

You should really, /really/ read a basic primer on copyright law before you try to go any further with this.
