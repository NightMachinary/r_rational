So I ran a random chapter through Google Translate to get an idea of what the story was like. I have never seen something that seems more likely to appeal to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]:

  So again: why can't I exist? First i don't I fit into the laws of physics and biology. With a mass of five tons and scope wings ten meters I should not fly. And I'm flying. Ok let me I can fly (what am I doing now?), but I have to fly at speed no less than four hundred kilometers per hour. I have landing speed should be three hundred kilometers, like a jet fighter, and I I can hang in place like a helicopter. And how do I know about jet fighter jets? There are none in this world. And for a long time will not be. Again distracted. It should be in order. Information is the third. Biology Secondly. And physics is in the first place. Over there, right on course, physical the phenomenon is outlined. Transition of electrostatics to electrodynamics. With the rain and roar. Fucks me with lightning now, and fly by all the laws physics. Vertically down. Freshly fried and appetizing, with crisp. From a height of a thousand feet. Or three hundred meters. Or three hundred thirty yards. Can elephants fly? Show me the flying elephant and I I'll eat my tail. On the other hand, when I take off, there are branches on the trees breaks off by the wind. A cubic meter of air weighs less than one and a half kilograms. The area of ​​my wing is not more than fifteen to eighteen meters. On two wings - thirty meters. And five tons. Almost two hundred kilograms per meter. On a thin membrane. And a maximum of four strokes per second. No by I cannot fly the normal laws of physics.

A dragon ruminating on why its existence violates the laws of science is extremely [[/r/rational]]. I really think you could crowdsource a translation for this.
