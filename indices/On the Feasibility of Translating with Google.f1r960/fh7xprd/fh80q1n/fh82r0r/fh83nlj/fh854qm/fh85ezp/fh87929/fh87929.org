  It's more like, I doubt anyone here is going to volunteer, seeing as the story has already been mentioned as per my original post in this subreddit, and no one exactly jumped up to do it.

So because nobody volunteered to translate it on your post asking for suggestions of stories to read, you think that's good evidence that nobody would volunteer to translate it?

  Anyway, in my experience if you really want something to happen, doing it yourself can't hurt. Sure, the quality won't be the best, but it's not like I have the sole monopoly on translations.

Well you know who does have a legal monopoly on translations - the original author.

Why don't you just use DeepL to translate and read the story, and forget the part about translating it and publishing it? That would be the best for everyone.
