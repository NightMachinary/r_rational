I'm not so sure about Pact. I expect it to be a good story, but perhaps not a story that fits this sub. Blake tends to trust on his instincts a lot ([[http://rationality.org/faq/#intuition][which isn't necessarily bad]]), but he does it in situations where he lacks the experience to have a solid intuition.

For instance, [[#s][Pact 1.7]] But maybe that's a route for character development. Wildbow is a good writer, he could pull it off.
