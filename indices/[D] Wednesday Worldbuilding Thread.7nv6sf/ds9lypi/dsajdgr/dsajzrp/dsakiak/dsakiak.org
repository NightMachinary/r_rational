You could also make it so that a message "locks" a certain timespan around the targeted moment forever. So if one alerted themselves at particular point of time, they may be unable to send warnings within a time window of few minutes or hours before and after it.

For example if someone made a choice at 12:15 and then sent a ping back to that moment, the time period between 11:15 and 13:15 of that day is inviolable for their power after that.
