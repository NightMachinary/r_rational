This is in our future. Computers were already invented. Pocket calculators existed. It's just that then much of this was /removed/ at some point.

I'm not wondering how technology could have progressed after this point (it's totally plausible that it has ground to a halt because people can't understand the cutting edge of technology anymore, meaning that they can't build upon it), but wondering what technologies have been pared back.

This is why "hunter-gatherers who periodically use spaceships" is a possible (albeit undesirable) outcome.
