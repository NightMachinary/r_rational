A deterministic algorithm can still be considered to be making decisions - even though the decision is completely deterministic (along the lines of "IF Bob.Income > 10000 THEN Offer Discount").

I'm not saying that this is a good idea, or even a feasible idea; I'm merely presenting it as a possible method by which to reach [[/u/callmesalticidae][u/callmesalticidae]]'s aim of ensuring that "history is a human story" (along with, of course, completely obliterating any intelligent aliens - a course of action I also do not condone).
