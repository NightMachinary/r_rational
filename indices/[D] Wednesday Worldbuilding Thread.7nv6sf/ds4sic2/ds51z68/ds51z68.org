I think that there's a very simple way to do this, and it is this: all /decisions/ must be made by humans, and no technology must be permitted to /make decisions/ on its own.

To take your example of the sniper; he is permitted his sniper rifle, because it makes no decisions. He is not permitted an auto-targeting sniper rifle, because that makes the decisions for him. Power generation? As long as a human decides how much power is generated, and where it goes to, you can generate all the power you want. Spaceships? They require human pilots, who make all the decisions. Weapons? Lightsabers, pistols, sniper rifles, nuclear explosives are all allowed; self-targetting drones are not, because they are making their own decisions.

Since humans make all the decisions, therefore, history is forced to be a human story.
