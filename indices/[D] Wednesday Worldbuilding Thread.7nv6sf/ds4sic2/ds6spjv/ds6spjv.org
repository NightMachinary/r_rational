I'm reminded of [[https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Earth-Homecoming-Orson-Scott/dp/0812532597/ref=sr_1_7][another]] sci-fi setting, where all transportation technology was forcibly removed from society. The people aren't allowed to even think of /the wheel/, but they're able to board starships and travel to other planets. I found this to be heavy-handed and obnoxious. I know what the writer was trying to do, I just don't think it worked out very well.

In order to make this setting work, you'd have to have a reason why a miller can't attach his grindstone to a waterwheel.
