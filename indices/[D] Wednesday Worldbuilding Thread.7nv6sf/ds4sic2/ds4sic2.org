There's this science fiction setting that I've been kicking around in my head (if that doesn't imply a much greater level of development than what it's got so far).

I'm aiming for a space opera kind of thing along the lines of /Dune/ or some aspects of /Star Wars/. A major aspect of the setting is that, somewhere along the line, people had ideas about how they wanted the universe to work and they had the power to enforce those ideas. Maybe it was a superintelligent A.I. That part isn't important right now.

The important bit is what they wanted: for history to be a /human/ story, where humans are the protagonists of their own stories. To the people that built the future, this meant removing any technology whose purpose could be accomplished by humans (and therefore can be interpreted as replacing humans). Weirdly, the story that comes to mind most readily is that of the Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä, who killed up to five hundred soldiers in the Winter War: how much of this accomplishment would have been his, had he been wielding an auto-targeting rifle that even guided his hands into the proper position?

I'm wondering how far I should go with this, though. Even given the strictest interpretation, spaceships will be a thing because there are no circumstances in which a human can travel through space unassisted.

What about power generation, though? Humans can turn cranks, even if that's terribly inefficient.

Computers definitely won't be allowed for many things, but should they be totally disallowed? Part of me says "yes," but another part of me says that if, say, the calculations being made would take more than a human lifetime to complete, then it's okay. Basically, pocket calculators are out, but Future!NASA can still run climate simulations.

People can beat each other to death with their fists, so are weapons banned? That seems going kind of overboard!

Unless this is a story of hunter-gatherers who periodically board space ships, "No technology that does things that a human could do" can't be the /whole/ story, then, even if it's a good enough summation that most people describe it that way.

Even so, I think that most things are handmade, and the only stuff that isn't is what /can't/ be: very fine circuitry, spaceship parts, etc.

I've got some other random stuff that I've been spitballing, but it's tangential from this part so I'll end my post here.
