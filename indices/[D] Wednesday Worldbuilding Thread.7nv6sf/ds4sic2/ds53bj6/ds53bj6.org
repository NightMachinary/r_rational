  People can beat each other to death with their fists, so are weapons banned? That seems going kind of overboard!

I agree - People can't cut things without a blade, and people can't put holes in people from a distance without guns.

  What about power generation, though? Humans can turn cranks, even if that's terribly inefficient.

Same deal as the climate simulations - a healthy laborer can only realistically sustain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_power][75W]] for an 8 hour shift. A thousand people working in rotating 8 hour shifts can only put out 25KW. What's the cutoff for parallel calculations done by humans, anyway? Judging by a randomly selected benchmark (bitcoin mining), my GPU on its own is approximately 1*10^{13} times faster at calculating than I am... or ~1500 times faster than every human in the world calculating things in their head simultaneously.

Another interesting idea is that reading and writing is, strictly speaking, unnecessary - people can speak, understand one another, and remember a great deal of stories after all. This also comes with a free explanation of why nobody's gone and reinvented the lost knowledge - the pseudoluddites burned all the books and technical manuals.
