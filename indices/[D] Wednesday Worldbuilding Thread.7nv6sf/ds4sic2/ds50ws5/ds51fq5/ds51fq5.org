  How much of the accomplishment is his given that he was using a sniper rifle instead of, say, a bow and arrow?

I think that a gun isn't fundamentally different from a bow for this purpose, at least before we get beyond a certain rate of fire, but that's definitely open for debate.

  Much of technological progression happens in a two-step process: automation followed by miniaturization. Your proposed rule would prohibit the automation step while allowing the miniaturization phase. But you can't get to miniaturization if the automation doesn't happen first.

Yes. This does mean that technology isn't advancing much, if at all, and most of the higher technology is maintained by non-human means.

Technology has definitely fallen back in a lot of respects, though. This would be a setting where people can travel faster than light eat cultured meat, and light their homes with electricity, but computers are rare and anything that /can/ be handmade /is/ handmade (but things that can't be, are made by self-maintaining, probably self-replicating, fabricators).
