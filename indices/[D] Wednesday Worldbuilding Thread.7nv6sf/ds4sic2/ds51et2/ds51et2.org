I wonder, how do you go about inventing a computer without first inventing a way to add two small numbers together automatically?

Technology is usually a progression from simple to advanced, and you're prohibiting the simple parts... I'm not seeing how that works.

The solution I'd use would be expensive magic - there are no climate simulation computers of any kind, because there are no computers, because there are no pocket calculators. Weather/climate predicting "oracles" would be used instead. Make such "enchantments" prohibitively expensive, and while they could in theory be used for simple things like aiming a rifle, they'd only ever actually get used by state-level actors, for things that simply can't be done in cheaper ways.
