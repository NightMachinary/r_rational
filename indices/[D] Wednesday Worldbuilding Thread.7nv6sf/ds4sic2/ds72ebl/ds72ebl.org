I've put a bit more brain-time on this. Please let me know how far astray I'm going.

If the goal is for history to be a human story, all that's needed is to tell history from a human perspective. Taking the example of the sniper, suppose we did give him a rifle with aim-assist and auto-firing capabilities. He's still choosing where to be, which battles to fight, who to shoot, and when to leave. Presumably, his opponents will have similar technology, so at some point, a certain kill count could still be considered an impressive human accomplishment.

But if it's just kill counts that are impressive, then the crew of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay][Enola Gay]] certainly racked up quite the score. I remember seeing this discussion in Heinlein's [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17214.Starship_Troopers][/Starship Troopers/]], when the protagonist considers why infantry exist when a tech type can push a button and destroy whole cities.

Going back to WWII, there are more than a few stories both human and technological that have been told. Consider the codebreakers who built the first computers. The story of a computer breaking a code might not be interesting, but the story of the codebreakers building the computers is very much a fascinating human story.

When studying modern history, it seems that all stories are economic, social, and/or political in nature. Take, for instance, 2017's sex scandals: the first one was a human story about a powerful predator, but as the stories kept coming, the story morphed into a tale of a society that incentivizes such behavior; a story of social moral decay, if you will. I can only assume that you want to avoid those sorts of stories so that history turns on the actions of individuals rather than groups. If that is the actual goal, I recommend introducing a mechanism to keep population densities low, so that the actions of very few people still mean a great deal on a historical scale. This would also mean keeping AI populations low-to-nonexistent.

One could also look at modern history as the consequence of removing power from individuals. Monarchs have been largely removed from any real power, leaving elected legislatures and complex bureaucracies to do the real decision-making. In those nations that still have supreme leaders, the stories are those of suffering and grief. Even the super-rich have been powerless to change the frameworks that are already in place, or even to nudge the decision-making processes. One could argue that history is no longer a human story because it has reached its [[https://ps321.community.uaf.edu/files/2012/10/Fukuyama-End-of-history-article.pdf][culmination]]. Barring catastrophic disasters on Earth, the next phase of history to be a human story may very well be space exploration, which could explain why "Elon Musk" and "SpaceX" are household names in the same vein as "Neil Armstrong". Then again, any real space exploration will be so difficult, expensive, and most importantly time-consuming, that it probably won't be a human story either.
