I've been mulling over an idea of a world in which people have very limited precognition, granted through either technological or arcane means. Essentially, this would manifest as a momentary burst of alertness at a moment specified after that moment has passed.

Say, for example, a woman discovers she's forgotten her cell phone when she arrives at work. She can send a small "blip" back to herself that morning when she put it down on her desk, which could serve as a reminder to pick it back up.

Is there a reasonably consistent, non-arbitrary way to limit this power so that it's useful for simple, mundane tasks such as "Don't forget your keys!" and "That's salt, not sugar!" but not for more complicated things like predicting the next week's lottery numbers or using time-loop haxx to brute-force arbitrary mathematical problems?
