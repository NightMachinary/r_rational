which, i imagine, in a brain after glioblastoma and brain surgery, could be fairly significant. /sigh

oh, and thanks for updating my terms. I do think that utilizing a solution based on tardigrades is important (not sure what Alcor's protocols look like, but I'd be much more encouraged if they are tweaking varying concentrations of hsp, glycerol, and trehalose as close to death as possible...

"...Tardigrades are known to enter cryptobiosis at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult. Cryptobiosis has to be considered a form of quiescence, being directly induced and maintained by the occurrence of adverse conditions for an active life, and promptly broken once the adverse conditions are removed...In tardigrades, there are several forms of cryptobiosis: anhydrobiosis, cryobiosis, anoxybiosis and osmobiosis. Anhydrobiosis is the most studied. Entering anhydrobiosis, tardigrades contract their body into a so-called tun, loosing most of their free and bound water (>95%), synthesizing cell protectants (e.g., /trehalose, glycerol, heat shock proteins/...and strongly reducing or suspending their metabolism..."
