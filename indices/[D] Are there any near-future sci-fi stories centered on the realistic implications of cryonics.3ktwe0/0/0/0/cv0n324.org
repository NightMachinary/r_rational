It'll work as stand-alone, the plot is self-contained. However, the story of how Miles got the position in the government he got and his relationship with all the people he interacts with, that's an interesting story worth reading the lead-up for!

All the Vorkosigan Saga books are good Rational reads, in my opinion. Give them a shot!
