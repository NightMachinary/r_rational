Cryoburn by Lois McMaster Bujold is an interesting take on sociopolitical implications of cryonics. Specifically, it explores the question- 'what do you do with the theoretical legal power of those who are in cold sleep?'

Cryoburn answers the question with a curious system where people in cold-sleep are treated as people with votes as anybody else in a democratic system, except that since they can't vote themselves they pass off that right to the megacorp responsible for keeping them intact as part of the contract for passing into cold-sleep, incentivizing megacorps to get as many sleepers as possible to get more political clout- and also incentivizing them to engage in very, very interesting conspiracies when threatened with the risk of losing significant amounts of their zombie voter-base.

Also, it's a Vorkosigan Saga book, and I'm pretty sure that series is right up [[/r/Rational][r/Rational]]'s alley, what with all the mental problem-solving the series is about.
