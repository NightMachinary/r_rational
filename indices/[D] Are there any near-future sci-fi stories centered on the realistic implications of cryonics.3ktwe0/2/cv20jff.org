The precise term isn't "freezing", but "vitrifying". In a good cryonics case, the solution replaces enough water to prevent ice crystallization. The freezing point is depressed and ice nucleation is inhibited. Instead of turning to ice, the fluids become thick and viscous, then harden into an amorphous solid like glass.

The reason nobody/no whole human brain can be revived yet is because the high concentrations of solutes needed have side effects that prevent cell viability. These mechanisms are not well understood, but may involve denaturation of certain enzymes.

(For less than ideal cases, obviously there are issues like imperfect perfusion due to perfusion impairment. So some ice formation can happen.)
