Oh man, that issue of Transmetropolitan is fantastic. I just went and reread it after reading your comment. And it's nice that the main revived woman featured gets a happy ending later in the comic. It's a good combination of showing how terrifying waking up after having been cryopreserved would be, and how much better it would be than just being dead (plus social commentary on the plight of the homeless!).
