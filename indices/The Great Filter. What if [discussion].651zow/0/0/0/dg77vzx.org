The whole point is that the great filter is time travel.

faster then light is broken in this universe and explicitly states that this creates different aliens.

if there is a .1% chance they discover time travel in a given time frame, your designed looping gets caught into slight variations until they make them self extinct or your planned looping fails.

As soon as the ball leaves your hands, it stays out of your hands until the that guy dies, or anyone in the game manages to create a new player. Having two different species trying to mess with time at the same time will take away control form who ever is using the longer loop and add whole new losing conditions.
