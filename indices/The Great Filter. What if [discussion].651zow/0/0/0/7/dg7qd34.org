I find weird that all civilizations are incapable of not using time travel. For the same reason that nuclear bombs can't be the answer i think we would find at least some civilization that decides to avoid using it and tires to prevent other civilizations on their light cone from using it, even if other especies did use time trav√©s , there is no reason for that to mean the species that avoided time travel will disapear on the final logo, heck maybe they were the results of the loop.A lot of civilizations can fall to the same thing they can deduce happened to the others , but, all of them?!.Where did all competent aliens go?.
