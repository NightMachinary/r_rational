The main problem is that we need to find a way to improve our situation between resets.

While its technically true the infinite series with a termination state eventually terminate; in practice not really.

Consider these two math problems

1: if you flip a heads increase x by 2 else decrease it by 1; if x falls below zero, everyone dies

2:roll a dice, if 1-4 increase x by 10, if 5 decrease by 1 if 6 set x to 0; if x falls below zero everyone dies

While situation 1 has a 50% dieing on the first turn, if you make it past turn 5 or so your set and the chance of dying decreases at an absurdly low rate

while situation 2 ... death is /always/ 2 turns away, it doesn't matter if surviving the first turn is a 5/6 chance, long term success is far far lower.

This means, being the ones who control the time travel and using it. Perhaps you should try to prevent brain emulation form being funded, when ever you find its funded you reset with your memories. Which is potentially a very shitty life.

edit// maybe you should release a plague, force people into a digital life, where your to only person with access to the necessary quantum tools to make a time travel thingy and reset very few centuries just to prevent other civilizations form popping up

edit2// Wait fuck, waiting centuries means an alien civ probably is cycling time travel as well; upping your failure rate to a situation 2 setup.

.... You have to cycle realities quickly as well or find a way to communicate ftl with an alien species that also have the tech or disable their time travel.
