Shadows of the Limelight is solidly good original fiction. Glimwarden, by the same author, is currently updating and is even better. Crystal Society is great. Scott Alexander has written some good short fiction, like "... And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes" which is the top post on this subreddit of all time, and he's also writing Unsong, which I haven't read. Blindsight by Peter Watts is really good, and it's in the same vein as rational fiction, and it's been posted a couple times.
