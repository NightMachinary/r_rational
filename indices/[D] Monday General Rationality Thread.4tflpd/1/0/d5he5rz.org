  You don't want to walk around in a brain you scarcely understand, do you?

Do you feel like improving your understanding of your brain (beyond a couple most pertinent biases) is really improving your life? I'm not sure how seriously to take this recommendation; I've seen little benefit to reading things like Kahneman or Burkeman, beyond an enjoyable literature that /explains/ some of my brains bugs but doesn't really help work around them.
