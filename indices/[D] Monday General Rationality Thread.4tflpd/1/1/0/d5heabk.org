  would you mind elaborating a bit more on what value you feel like you've gotten from it so far?

It gives a nice broad overview of "predictive processing = Monte Carlo hierarchical Bayes + expected-precision-directed prediction-error propagation to perform updates". So since I want to enter MIT's Brain and Cog department, getting an overview of the Friston et al paradigm in neuroscience is pretty useful. I think some of the computational work I'm citing might actually be cited in the book some places. And the book actually anticipates my own paper and gives me one or two things more to cite.
