So as a relatively new member here I don't really have a good understanding of what is what yet... (An FYI I found this site through Mother Of Learning) So from what I have noticed most of the works here are fanfictions? Is their any recommended original works? The main things I have seen applauded here are fan fictions which I have always been Leary of.

And in a which came first the chicken or the egg moment it seems there is some convincing evidence that supports the notion that direct collapse super massive black holes likely seeded galaxies and thus the conditions for the first stars rather than the other way around.

Also anyone know the best places to turn what at this point is mostly pure world building into stories?

One of the biggest issues I face is names as there are too many diverging cultures to take the more through linguistic approach(especially as English is the only language I can speak fluently)

As is I am stuck on the prologue for all my stories because names are near impossible to do (and yet extremely important) for me.
