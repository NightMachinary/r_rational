Ah I probably will at some point though it is a ton of stuff I really am stuck with names more than anything. In the real world you have tons of ethnic groups with their own disticnt set of languages. The problem is names need to account for that even though I don't have anywhere near enough experience understanding or time to compose languages for what at minimum is 50+ distinct cultures some of which are truly alien(I cheat there by having them lack any recognizable equivalent to names because they also lack the boundaries of distinct individuals)

What would count as a decent write up? Most of my stuff is contained into various word documents (prologue drafts + more or less bullet point explanations to remind myself of details) If I posted everything that would basically spoil the entire underlying plot. But I don't know how to get around the name problem without revealing some of the details...
