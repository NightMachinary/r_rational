Is anyone interested in doing a read through of any particular story?

I was going back over /GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid/ because of a deleted post earlier today and realized that while I hadn't managed to finish the last four chapters, it still was an amazing activity to do with this subreddit and I would love to do it again.

So any recommendations?
