Thanks [[/u/xamueljones]] for clarifying

I worry that no strong consensus would emerge if we allow for different mediums. It might already be difficult enough to have the community agree on a book to read. Agreeing on a... thing to consume might be even harder. Perhaps it would be best to have a "book club" and an "alternate media" club - the latter including everything but the written word.
