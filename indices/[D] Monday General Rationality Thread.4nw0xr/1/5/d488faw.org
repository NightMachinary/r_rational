In addition to how hard it is to detect bias, I think its also a matter of drive and discipline. In my case for example, I'm a huge fan of self improvement and constantly read about new strategies and techniques to improve my thinking and performance.

Problem is that I lack the discipline to maintain it for long periods of time and I tend to enter long periods where I just can't focus or get things done effectively. Currently I'm under one of those periods where even waking up becomes a chore and I'm in pain and tired most of the day, particularly when I try to focus and get something done. I still haven't figured how to overcome it but nootropics do help a bit.

* Q1 - Spaced Repetition:

  :END:
Yes. I'm currently using Anki for language learning and I'm trying to figure how to move it towards applications in my career (engineering). I use it daily, for about an hour at a time and also make use of repetition exercises but those tend to take 1 to 4 hours due to how tiring they are (particularly in this state).

About topic, currently its Japanese but planning to use it for Control and Ai concepts and formula.

* Q2 - Method of Loci:

  :CUSTOM_ID: q2---method-of-loci
  :END:
No. Read about it, tried it a bit and built a small framework for myself with personal data. So far I've found it expensive because I'm highly linguistic/auditory and have more trouble remembering visual input and thus haven't been able to justify the time invested trying to create it.

I plan to attempt again once I've managed to put my long due tasks in order.

* Q3 - Nootropics
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: q3---nootropics
  :END:
Yes. Currently I take Adrafinil to help me focus and improve my mood. It helps me work for a bit of time although I found it fairly expensive and don't want to become dependent on it to work.

In addition I take:

- Caffeine. My main drug of choice, currently taking 3 cups per day although I'm not managing to stay awake anyway. I usually go through cool down periods where I don't take any coffee to recover.
- Green tea. Due to the L-theine and its a good complement with coffee.
- Monohydrated creatine. I'm trying to gain weight although it hasn't worked that much. I still miss my meals due to being asleep and probably require more food consumption than chemicals.
- Vitamin E. I'm 24 years old and showing signs of age.

I've also thought of consuming resveratrol and check anti aging supplements but with a student budget its not easy.

* Additional techniques
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: additional-techniques

In addition I'm trying *meditation* and it works well at keeping my anxiety and headaches in check but the effects have been temporary at best.

Currently I'm reading *Brain Rules* by John Medina and checking how can I improve my thinking. Can't recommend the book as most of the advice is quite obvious.

And I checked *mnemonics* which seem to be another technique that adjusts well with my auditory/linguistic framework. They are also time consuming but not as much as the method of Loci so I'm thinking of proceeding with those once I'm more free.

What I find most important right now is to build willpower and discipline so that I can overcome whatever it is I have.

Also I'm trying to lessen my time on Reddit as I turned it into my escape from the pain without noticing. I spend too much time reading and too little doing (along with dreaming, it doesn't hurt when I'm asleep) and its hurting me a lot on the real life. I tend to become addicted to stuff like that to escape the pain and I'd welcome any advice on how to develop discipline and willpower.
