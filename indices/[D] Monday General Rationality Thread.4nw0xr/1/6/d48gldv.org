"Q1 - Spaced Repetition: Had you heard of Spaced Repetition before? Do you currently use any Spaced Repetition software (e.g. Anki, SuperMemo)? If yes: how frequently and for how long? If no: had you previously used any Spaced Repetition software? What topics do you use it for (e.g. physiology, geography, physics)? What made/would-make you use Spaced Repetition (e.g. medical school, general interest)? Q2 - Method of Loci: Had you heard of the Method of Loci before? Do you currently use the Method of Loci technique? If yes: how regularly and for how long? If no: had you previously used the Method of Loci technique? What information do you memorise with it (e.g. equations, molecule names)? What made/would-make you use the Method of Loci technique (e.g. organic chemistry course, inability to remember people's names)? Q3 - Nootropics: Had you heard of Nootropics before? Do you currently taken any Nootropics (e.g. Nicotine, Piracetam)? If yes: which Nootropics and how long have you been taking them for? If no: have you previously taken any and why aren't you taking them now? What made/would-make you use Nootropics (e.g. attempting to compete with the intelligence of an uploaded human)? So yeah, if people could comment that would be great. Oh if anyone knows any other techniques/tools, I'd love to hear about it. permalinkembed"

1. Yup, I use it ~2x a week for geography, health care polcy, and random stuff I'm interested in that ranges from philosophy to cognitive science to anecdotes of famous people. I was tired of having a memory that wasn't great. I've always been intelligent but forgetful and I wanted to fix the latter.

2. I've used the 'linking' mnemonic to memorize all 45 US presidents and a couple of random lists of objects to impress people. This mnemonic involves turning the object into a memorable image that links to the image/mnemonic before it. For example, G Washington with a great big wig becomes a man of clay (John Adams) who tills the land (Jefferson, because he loved farmers), who digs up a friend of mine named Madison, whose head turns into a globe that reminds me o the Munroe doctrine. Goofy stuff, easy to remember, but it does have to be walked through or recalled semi frequently. I had trouble remembering it right now after 3 months of not thinking about it, but I could refresh that memory pretty easily with ~15 minutes of rehearsal. I can easily memorize a 20 or 40 item list in 120 seconds, and recall it for a while (an hour, without further rehearsal, probably), which is very occasionally useful.

3. Yup, I've heard about them since senior year of college. I occasionally take caffeine + l-theanine, rarely take l-theanine for anxiety (which is rare), supplemented Bacopa for ~5 months, very occasionally use nicotine gum to stay awake or party, and I've used microdoses of LSD a couple of times. Not sure if the last one counts, but I enjoyed it quite a bit with few side effects, so I'll include it. I use nootropics mostly for my energy levels, which are low. I've never felt too stupid for something...I've often felt too lazy for something.

I suggest meditation to anyone looking for an interesting and potentially beneficial practice. I've entered interesting states of mind with it, have been able to cultivate an emotional distance from certain painful things, and have generally felt like a better person while meditation regularly.
