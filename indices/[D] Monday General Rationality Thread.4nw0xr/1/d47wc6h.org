When compared to the general populous, the rational community appears to be better informed about mental techniques and pitfalls. However this does not seem to have meaningfully impacted, the behaviour of people who identify as a part of the /rational/ community (myself included) [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/n4e/why_cfars_mission/][[1]]]. In other words, we do not seem to be applying what we know, to the real world.

To examine this hypothesis, I would like to gather some data. As it's hard to measure the impact of something abstract -- e.g. [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][The Sequences]] -- I'll attempt to ask more objective questions. It would be awesome if you could reply in the comments with your response.

Q1 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced Repetition]]:

1. Had you heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced Repetition]] before?
2. Do you currently use any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced Repetition]] software (e.g. [[http://ankisrs.net/][Anki]], [[https://www.supermemo.com/][SuperMemo]])? *If yes:* how frequently and for how long? *If no:* had you previously used any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced Repetition]] software?
3. What topics do you use it for (e.g. physiology, geography, physics)?
4. What made/would-make you use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced Repetition]] (e.g. medical school, general interest)?

Q2 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]]:

1. Had you heard of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]] before?
2. Do you currently use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]] technique? *If yes:* how regularly and for how long? *If no:* had you previously used the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]] technique?
3. What information do you memorise with it (e.g. equations, molecule names)?
4. What made/would-make you use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]] technique (e.g. organic chemistry course, inability to remember people's names)?

Q3 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][Nootropics]]:

1. Had you heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][Nootropics]] before?
2. Do you currently taken any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][Nootropics]] (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine][Nicotine]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam][Piracetam]])? *If yes:* which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][Nootropics]] and how long have you been taking them for? *If no:* have you previously taken any and why aren't you taking them now?
3. What made/would-make you use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][Nootropics]] (e.g. attempting to compete with the intelligence of an uploaded human)?

So yeah, if people could comment that would be great.

Oh if anyone knows any other techniques/tools, I'd love to hear about it.
