1. Yes, I am familiar with the principle of spaced repetition. No I don't use it, as I am not a student and my job doesn't require a lot of memorization so I don't see any domain in my life that I need it for.

2. I hadn't heard of the phrase "Method of Loci" before, but (after clicking the link) it turns out I am familiar with it, but under the name "Memory Palace." I don't use it, as I am quite far at the low end of the phantasia/aphantasia scale, so using visual imagery to help recall factual information has alway seemed a little backwards to me. (Indeed, I am much more likely to use factual information to help me generate visual imagery!)

3. I have heard of nootropics. I do not currently take any, nor have I ever except for a ~2-week sample prescription for Adderall that I tried out at the suggestion of my physician several years ago. I am relatively unconvinced that the man-made category of "nootropics" necessarily carves nature at the joints, so I have no opinion on nootropics taken /en bloc/; my interest in any particular drug would have to be determined individually. (Though my experience with the Adderall makes me generally risk-averse on the subject.) It would take a substantial amount of time and diligence to do the necessary research for myself, and I haven't had the inclination to make that investment. If you asked me today, I would be most likely to try modafinil over anything else.
