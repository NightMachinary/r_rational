(with mod hat on)

I think this can only be settled by a very obviously irrational story, or community discussion. So it's not considered anything yet, as the community hasn't considered it.

(hat off)

I enjoyed it but wouldn't call it rational; the plot and worldbuilding are very tightly intertwined. Characters generally gain more power, rather than smarter ways to use it. This is probably a natural consequence of the one-chapter-per-day serial - an incredible feat, but not one which promotes deep and detailed planning! My vote: not rational.
