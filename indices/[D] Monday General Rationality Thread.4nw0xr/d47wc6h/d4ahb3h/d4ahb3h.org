I've used spaced repetition, though without any software, for undergraduate anatomy and physiology. I found it useful, but did not adapt it as a general study technique because I've found that for my major coursework (Computer Science) I can easily do acceptably well on tests just by attending class and completing all projects.

I've never had any success with the method of loci, but I might consider making another attempt at it if had information that I felt was worth that much investment in effort to memorize.

I'm disinclined towards regularly taking any drugs, I don't even have a caffeine habit. I would strongly consider taking nootropics if they had more strongly established dosages/benefits/long term effects, or if they had significant adoption over a multi-year term with no side effects. At this point, I don't feel the effort of acquiring them is worth the benefit of their use, but that point could change at any time.
