*Q1*

1. Yes
2. Yes, I have been using Anki almost daily for about 3-4 years, before that I used SuperMemo sporadically for several years.
3. Math, languages, geography, history, random trivia, IT, lyrics/poems, pieces of code, ...
4. Interest in language learning

*Q2*

1. Yes
2. Yes, I've been using it for about 10 years. Not sure how to answer the "how regularly" part, that would need specification if you mean "going through a journey", "creating a new journey" or "having some sort of journey in your memory". Daily-ish for first option, about monthly for second, constantly for third.
3. Telephone numbers, school stuff, languages, random numbers for fun (with the usage of Dominic system)
4. I learnt this method to make up for my poor memory + had an interest in effective learning

*Q3*

1. Yes
2. No, I tried piracetam and thought it didn't help + got scared a bit
3. If I was sure there is nootropics that is fairly safe + doesn't make me develop addiction + doesn't screw with my already frail brain in some way

Why I think I'm not as rational in my life as I'd like to be: lack of knowledge (there is probably tons of hacks or more effective ways of doing things I don't do because I don't know that I should search for them), inadequacy of my body/brain, lack of willpower. IMO [[/u/blazinghand]] hit the nail on head with their comment. I like [[/r/getdisciplined]] and [[/r/meditation]], these subs help with the discipline/willpower problem a lot.

EDIT: Now I realized: do you deem not using nootropics irrational?
