In my personal experience, the limiting factor for success is not usually things like ability to recognize cognitive biases, or knowledgeability about options--at least, not for someone in my position. I have been, and always will be, limited by willpower, drive, grit, resolve, or whatever you call it. When I start to do something or try to learn something or get something done, I'm usually already capable of accomplishing the task. Gaining more knowledge or tools doesn't help, unless they are explicitly aimed at increasing willpower or solving certain problems. Rationality never helped me improve my career prospects, become productive, or sleep better, because knowledge of what to do was never a limiting factor.

Some people may have lots of willpower, or may not understand where it needs to be applied, but my low-hanging fruits are different. My problems are always solved by setting rules for myself.

One of the low-hanging fruits I've been dealing with, for example, is getting 8 hours of sleep per night. Up until the past year or so, I usually got 6 hours of sleep per night, sometimes fewer. I was tired and less productive. My lack of sleep was not due to physiological insomnia, but the fact that I would excitedly stay up late every night reading or playing games. If I actually got in bed, I fell right asleep, even at normal hours. So, I started making rules for myself about when I was allowed to stay up late, building my discipline and self-control. Now I sleep well, and am much more productive in all aspects of my life. This is a great victory for my willpower, and did not use rationality.

Another example was dieting. I always wanted to lose weight, and one good way to do this is to cultivate a healthier lifestyle. I wanted to replace calorically dense, unfulfilling snacks like potato chips and candy bars with hearty, lower-calorie sneaks like nuts, beef jerky, apples. I wanted to stop eating large snacks after dinner, because I was rarely hungry and these added a lot of calories, etc. Sounds good, right? And yet, there was a problem: I lacked the willpower to diet. Instead, I decided to keep a meticulous food diary. This would let me track what I eat and hopefully motivate me to diet more. Sounds good, right? And yet, there was a problem: I lacked the willpower to meticulously look up and weigh all my food, especially on-the-spot. Instead, I decided to photograph literally everything I ate, and write it down at the end of the day, which is much easier. This let me keep a food diary without small inconveniences throughout the day. After keeping the food diary for about a month, I became motivated to diet seriously, and managed to make a healthy and sustainable adjustment to how I eat, resulting in a health improvements. I'm pretty proud of this, and this once again was something I always wanted to do, and always knew how to do, but lacked the will to pull off.

So, questions!

- Q1 Spaced Repetition

  - 1 - Yes
  - 2 - Yes, for about 4 years.
  - 3 - Technology and computer networking
  - 4 - I wanted to increase my skills and knowledge for the job I had at the time.

- Q2 Method of Loci

  - 1 - Yes
  - 2 - No, No.
  - 3 - N/A
  - 4 - If I had to learn new things for my career, or perhaps for a particular event or responsibility, and my particular mixture of mnemonics and spaced repetition was not successful.

- Q3 Nootropics

  - 1 - Yes
  - 2 - Yes, if you count Caffeine. I usually drink two cups of coffee per day. I've been drinking coffee at this rate for 8 years.
  - 3 - Caffeine makes me feel more alert and awake. I would consider using other nootropics if I felt like I desperately needed to increase productivity and my normal methods were ineffective.
