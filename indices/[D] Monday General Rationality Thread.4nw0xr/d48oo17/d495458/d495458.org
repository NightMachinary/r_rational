I have no strong opinion on whether TGWP is considered rational or not. If we go by the sidebar, I feel like the ultimate conflict and it's resolution had a lot of "the plot requires it" and "being good and evil rather than intelligent reasons", while there were a lot of things in the story before that point which did not have these issues. As far as having an intelligent protagonist goes... Jaune didn't do anything particularly egregiously stupid, but it never felt as if he was amazingly brilliant or whatever either - having a high number down next to "intelligence" is not the same as demonstrating intelligence in the story, and Jaune didn't really feel super smart to me ever.

Regardless of whether it is or is not 'rational' fiction, I wouldn't recommend the whole thing to people anyways - mostly because while the beginning up to and including the stealing of the airship was pretty strong, after that the fic ran into huge pacing issues where for a very long time none of the 'conflicts' in the story had stakes or mattered at all if the protagonist won or lost, which drained the story of tension or interest for a very long time. And then the ending felt sort of a lot like Star Ocean 2 or Star Ocean 3, in that it was extremely strange and felt very discontinuous with the rest of the plot which had come before while also trivializing everything in that plot that had come before it.
