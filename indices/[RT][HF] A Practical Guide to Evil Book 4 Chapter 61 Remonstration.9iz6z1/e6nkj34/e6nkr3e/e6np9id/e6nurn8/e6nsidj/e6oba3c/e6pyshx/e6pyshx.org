Disclaimer: I love this story; I deeply appreciate EE's talent, work ethic, and creativity; and I'd say that I enjoyed this chapter overall. It was nice to see Archer and Cat's relationship develop a bit, and to finally get a glimpse into Archer's mind. I couldn't write even this single chapter half as well if I tried. Now that's out of the way, the negativity.

â€‹

Boy, am I tired of this chapter. It crops up every now and again, and it always goes the same. Most rational fics have their POV character(s) analyze their motives sometimes, but, as far as I can tell, PGtE is the only one that has devoted multiple, complete chapters to that almost exclusively. /That's not a great thing/. It's nice that it's delivered as conversation (almost always one-on-one) instead of an internal debate, but it's not nice enough that I want to keep reading Cat think herself in a circle. My feelings might be different if the issue being examined was /ever/ unique, but it's always the same. Here are the pieces:

1. Cat is doing something to secure a victory or advantage over her current enemy, but feels bad about it.
2. Cat wonders if her actions might be exacerbating the current conflict.
3. Cat wonders if a victory she secures might be worse for her side than simply losing.
4. Cat questions why the one (1) peer in attendance follows her.
5. Cat ignores any reassurances the peer provides.
6. (Optional) Cat decides that agonizing over such issues is the only way to prevent her from tripping on a banana peel and accidentally becoming a monster.
7. Cat resolves none of her concerns and continues to feel bad, but ultimately decides to change nothing, because she rarely has more than one option, and the alternative is to just give up.

It's annoying because because it's formulaic, but step 7 is where it gets bad, because it means /the chapter didn't do anything./ She consistently asks the same questions, which are always about her morals rather than her motives, and always fails to answer them. She never changes her goals as a result of the talk. She never discovers anything. She never even feels better. It makes sense from a Watsonian perspective for her to have doubts and talk to her friends, but from a Doylist perspective, they're just boring chapters.

There is actually one interesting reason for these talks, but I don't think Cat's manipulative enough to actually be doing it. Provided she's as uncertain about team cohesion as she sometimes seems, these one-on-one talks where she "opens up" on a pretty pointless script would be a good way to tease out how her team really feels about her and her cause. It's a natural evolution from her early career, when she was pretty blunt with everyone about asking what they wanted.
