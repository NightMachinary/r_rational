It's telling rather than showing. The same story goals could be achieved by having Cat step over lines via her actions, and then be slapped with the alternate plans and preferences of her companions. That /has happened/ even, and tends within the story to have a more lasting effect.

Number seven is a big problem with a lot of serial fiction, however, from Dickens to Prestige TV. If the character changes too much, steps off the knife edge of desperation and uncertainty, the story ends because they either win or lose consistently. There's nothing left at that point but to watch the pieces resolve.

Personally, I think the writing here is good enough and the time investment small enough that I don't mind it. So long as the story isn't rubbing its protagonist's intransigence in my face on a regular basis I can let it go and enjoy the ride.
