I love this chapter the longer I dwell on it, after a week of waiting for the next Cat chapter, I have been thinking about what this arc means, what Malicia has done and how it affects the story and the 'Story'.

Because y'see, Malicia and Black have made a mistake, they have been thinking that villians can't be heroes and still be villians, but Heroes have been getting away with it for years, the Lone Swordsman was far enough down the Anti-hero scale to torture and placing munitions as traps were a okay and the sword Saint is her own bad of cats, both still heroes.

But what cat has done is make herself a free agent, similar to archer and ranger, she doesn't have a 'Name' just her mantle (which definitely doesn't incline her towards peace and Heroism) but doesn't specifically come from down below, and Malicia has back her into a corner. This wouldn't be a problem if she was just a Villain, a villain in a corner is on the down and outs, maybe they take the hero with 'em (likely Malicia's hope) but it's over. Cat though, she is an orphan who was betrayed by her evil mentor at a crucial moment, having had to embrace terrible power in order to aid him, only to become the defacto queen of a wartorn nation, now she is struggling to make the best of the situation, after being reject by the good side she turns to the bad and is equally rebuffed, now she needs to turn to that neutral power that got her through last time. I think Malicia is going to be in for a rude awakening when Cat leaves those tunnels.
