  (Optional) Cat decides that agonizing over such issues is the only way to prevent her from tripping on a banana peel and accidentally becoming a monster.

Haha, you nailed it.

Yeah, PGtE has inherited that tendency from Star Wars (and other fantasy stories) to treat becoming evil as something that can happen on /accident/. Like, defending my country, defending my country, fighting off invaders, whoops, just burned down an orphanage full of babies and kittens! Well, may as well keep doing it!

  There is actually one interesting reason for these talks, but I don't think Cat's manipulative enough to actually be doing it. Provided she's as uncertain about team cohesion as she sometimes seems, these one-on-one talks where she "opens up" on a pretty pointless script would be a good way to tease out how her team really feels about her and her cause.

Yeah, I think that's the main reason for these talks, to have other characters tell Cat how awesome they find her. It's a little in-your-face, though. I mean, "character with self-worth issues who has her friends tell her she doesn't realize how great she is" is realistic, it's just not very fun on repeat.

I very much preferred when the Pilgrim or the footsoldiers were building her up, or when Thief was making a "she's a drunk and she keeps ogling everyone, but she's all we have" speech.
