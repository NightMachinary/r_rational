I went back through the conversation in Chapter 20 and there wasn't any candle flickering. So, everyone was either being honest up to that point in the conversation or they had taken "the regular precautions."

My Questions:

- Did Horry really cast the lie detecting spell on the alcove?
- If so, how did he cast it without a wand?
