If you got an Ice Assassin to cast Mindscrape on Icefi, even if they are overwritten, they must still obey you, right? So you would essentially have an Afi who must follow your orders? This sounds extremely useful.

What would happen if an Ice Assassin sacrificed the knowledge that it must obey its creators orders to Herrun? Or knowledge of a specific order? Would it be freed of it? And could Mindscrape create a similar effect?
