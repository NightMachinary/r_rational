How long ago was Icefi cut loose? And knowledge of Icefi's plans and motivations would still be pretty useful. Incidentally, shouldn't there be a lot of other groups similar to Icefi that Afi cut loose? We know that Afi was inclined to cut some ice assassins lose because he did, but then wiped that knowledge and reverted to a person who didn't know he'd done that, that is, the kind of Afi inclined to create another Icefi. So he presumably would have cut loose some more and wiped the memories, restarting the cycle. And so on. At the very least, he may have figured out that he did it, as he knows Mindscrape exists and is obviously smart enough to think of the plan,as he already did. How many assassins does Afi have anyway? Was a few thousand a noticeable drop?

Also, will we ever meet any of the other refugee colonies like Grofhamr, which I believe I recall being mentioned?
