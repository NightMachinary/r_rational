As the above comment suggested, will it be the grapple ball of speed?

And as Jake explicitly states a scenario when this strategy would not work, why does he propose it as a way to solve the maze? As a 28th level wizard, Hammond ought to be intelligent enough to design a difficult maze. Will anything Hammond does in his defence even be able to challenge the Landguard now, at over 3x his level? Even 1 ought to be able to trounce him.

Also, now that Jake and co have access to Mindscrape, can they use to achieve utterly broken results? Such as giving all these new mages the memories and expertise of all their most seasoned warriors and generals. Mindscraping out any too sensitive information first, of course. Or could they get Icefi to let them use it on him? After all, turnabout is fair play and 15000 years of memories could be pretty useful.

Does Deadboy sockpuppet the other liches or just Afi? If the former, I can see him getting quite annoyed by them turning Hammond. And if Afi deconverted, would Neklos lose all hold on him?

What would happen if a HoOA was used on Jake, who doesn't really fit in the alignment system?

And as Lawful Good characters, can the Landguard make Ice Assassins? Creating a creature doomed to spend its life in thrall to you and unable to fulfill its deepest desires seems a definite act of evil. It could be justified on consequentialist grounds, but that's not very lawful
