So I guess your Gods aren't the Deities and Demigods /Faiths and Pantheons style ones, because most of them are around level 60. They get a lot of bonuses, and 20 outsider HD, but that's what they have in class levels.

Of course salient divine abilities like "Wish at will" kind of break that over backwards.
