Yeah, just by itself Alter Reality (cast any spell once per round, no XP or gold components, Save DC = lots + more) does everything we've seen the gods do so far. Time Stop once every 3 rounds lets you time stop forever, Wish at will is... well, wish at will. And the autoscry when your name is mentioned thing is part of divine portfolio powers.

Your gods actually fit so far, assuming every one of them has Alter Reality (Which is like saying 'assuming every olympic sprinter has legs').
