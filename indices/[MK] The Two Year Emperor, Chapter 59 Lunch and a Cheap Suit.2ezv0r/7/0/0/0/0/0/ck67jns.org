Factotum is a great class and falls squarely in the "holy crap that's powerful" category.

That said, it has thief abilities and I'm not comfortable giving the Landguard thief abilities. It doesn't fit with the whole "paladin" motif, even though I'm running them as rather more pragmatic than the standard.

More importantly, though, it's more complicated than I want to deal with in the text. I thought long and hard about using archivists and decided it was ok because they are basically just like wizards who use divine spells.
