If Jake happens to learn about it, the [[http://dndtools.eu/classes/factotum/][Factotum]] is another amazing class you might want to check out for FLEA'ing.

Its int based and has quite a number of very useful abilities. Factotum gives you all skills, int to initiative (a dex check), a few extra standard actions an encounter, can let you bypass sr/dr, and more. At high levels, going first in combat and casting multiple spells a round are huge.

Especially for the landguard, swapping out sorcerer for it would give them some very powerful abilities. I feel the trade off of losing spells/day in favor of spells/round+tons of other abilities would be well worth it. It would also let them focus on int/wis since cha wouldnt be a casting stat any more.
