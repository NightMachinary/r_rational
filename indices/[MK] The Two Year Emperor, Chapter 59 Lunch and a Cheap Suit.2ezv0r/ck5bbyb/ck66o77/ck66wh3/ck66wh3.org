I was reading him as exaggeratedly indulgent, like 'Sure, that's okay.. after all, I can wipe you out with a finger flick if I feel like it'. That's why I picked his particular characteristic as arrogance -- obviously all gods have that level of power, but eg Neklos doesn't seem the pretentiously arrogant type, more the "DOOM FOR EVERYBODY! YOU GET A DOOM, AND YOU GET A DOOM, AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU! ^{Have} ^{fun} ^{with} ^{that,} ^{I} ^{know} ^{I} ^{will.} ". I get the impression their personalities generally match their portfolio.
