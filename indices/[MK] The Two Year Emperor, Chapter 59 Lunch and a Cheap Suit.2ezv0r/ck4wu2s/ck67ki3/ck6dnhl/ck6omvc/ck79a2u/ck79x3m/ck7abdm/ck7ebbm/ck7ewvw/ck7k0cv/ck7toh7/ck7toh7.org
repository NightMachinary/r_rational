If the original dying means that all of the Assassins die, does that mean that no Landguard will be doing important and dangerous stuff anymore? After all, anything which risks their death also risks the death of a lot of powerful others.

And now that time is less of a concern, could the Resurrectees be quarantined until they are sure that they're safe? Or could some things slip through even so?

And would things like mummy rot or a plague be catchable by an Ice Assassin?
