Would it make sense to create cleric Ice Assassins and use those for resurrecting? After all, Ice Assassins dying is no great loss.

Would Ice Assassins be able to use the Graham's Number XP Battery to create more of themselves? And if so, would they obey the orders of the original person, or of the Assassin?
