An evil creature that catchs a ride back to Earth on the soul of a creature being resurrected, sort of like a reverse Gate. It was described a few chapters ago.

Disease: it's a supercharged and highly contagious version of mummy rot. If it gets into the population when people are crammed as tight as in Grofhamr, it causes massive numbers of death before clerics can get in top of it.
