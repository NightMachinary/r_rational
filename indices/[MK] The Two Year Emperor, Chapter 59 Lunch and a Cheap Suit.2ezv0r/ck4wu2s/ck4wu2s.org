Icefi changing his alignment seems incredibly useful if it's anything like Colborn. Although, would he not be constrained still by his programming? And does he have the power to subvert all of Afi's local troops with helms? Including the other ice assassins.

Also, Arros is a dick. Who appears to also have lied to them by promising safety during the meeting, and then essentially killing Reynard during it. Odd from the god of lawyers who is presumably lawful.

This fragment definitely seems a lot more significant than just a universe breaking consultant. A spy? Does it have god like powers, or just knowledge?
