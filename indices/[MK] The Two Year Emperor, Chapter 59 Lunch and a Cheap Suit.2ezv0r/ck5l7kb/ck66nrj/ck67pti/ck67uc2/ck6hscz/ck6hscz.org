Looks like the GBOS was brought up in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2d233e/the_two_year_emperor_chapter_56_fire_and_water_is/cjlq8zf][this thread]]. That's the most recent one I could find, and your reaction to it made me stop searching cause it seems like the first time you had seen it.
