So multiclassing means you get the spell slots for all of the classes? If you multiclassed wizard and sorceror, would you get 10 9th level spell slots a day? And as sorceror appears to have way more spell slots, balanced by learning very few very slowly, and it shares the wizard spells list, could you cast the spells you learn as a wizard in your sorceror slots? If so, those classes synergise extremely well.

And could you use mindscrape to learn the spells someone has memorised?
