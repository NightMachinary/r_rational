  If you got an Ice Assassin to cast Mindscrape on Icefi, even if they are overwritten, they must still obey you, right? So you would essentially have an Afi who must follow your orders? This sounds extremely useful.

You mean make an IA of yourself, then have it Mindscrape Icefi? Yes, that would work. Note that Icefi is a savepoint on Afi; Icefi is what Afi was when Icefi was created. His information is out of date.

  What would happen if an Ice Assassin sacrificed the knowledge that it must obey its creators orders to Herrun? Or knowledge of a specific order? Would it be freed of it? And could Mindscrape create a similar effect?

Nope and nope. The requirement to obey these orders isn't a mental conditioning, its a fully baked-in part of who the IAs are.
