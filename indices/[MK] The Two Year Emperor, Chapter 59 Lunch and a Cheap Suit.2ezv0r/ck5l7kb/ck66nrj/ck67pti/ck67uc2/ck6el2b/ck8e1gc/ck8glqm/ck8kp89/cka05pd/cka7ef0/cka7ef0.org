  So multiclassing means you get the spell slots for all of the classes?
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  If you multiclassed wizard and sorceror, would you get 10 9th level spell slots a day?
#+end_quote

Indeed. Although 6 of them could only be used for casting spells that your sorceror side knew.

#+begin_quote
  And as sorceror appears to have way more spell slots, balanced by learning very few very slowly, and it shares the wizard spells list, could you cast the spells you learn as a wizard in your sorceror slots?
#+end_quote

Nope. Your spell casting is effectively compartmentalized between the classes. You cast just like a 20th level wizard. You also cast just like a 20th level sorceror. Never the twain shall meet.

  And could you use mindscrape to learn the spells someone has memorised?
#+end_quote

Nope. Mindscrape is totally broken on fluff, but quite weak on crunch. As to fluff: you learn everything the target knows, so all troop dispositions, passwords etc. As to crunch: you know all the words, spelling, and grammar that they know, and you have years of memories on how to speak French...yet you have no skill ranks in Language(French) so you can't speak French.

Learning spells is the same thing. There's rules for how to do it and how long it takes, and those rules trump the idea that just have detailed memories of actually casting the spell should be enough.

There's actually some sense to this one: a prepared spell isn't just words committed to memory, it's a ritual which you started in the morning and left only a few word left unsaid. Since the person using Mindscrape didn't do the ritual, they can't cast the spell that it presages.
