  How long ago was Icefi cut loose?
#+end_quote

The BDH (Big Damn Heroes) don't know.

#+begin_quote
  Incidentally, shouldn't there be a lot of other groups similar to Icefi that Afi cut loose? [reasoning]
#+end_quote

There might be. There's no evidence available one way or the other at the moment.

#+begin_quote
  How many assassins does Afi have anyway? Was a few thousand a noticeable drop?
#+end_quote

All that's been revealed so far is that Afi has AT LEAST four 9th level spell slots per day, and he's had 11,000 years to use them. The BDH might have destroyed or captured all of his IAs already, or he could have another ~16,000,000 of them. Or he might have far more, if he has spell slots from other classes or found some other way to cast the spell more often.

Really, they just don't have a clue.

  Also, will we ever meet any of the other refugee colonies like Grofhamr, which I believe I recall being mentioned?
#+end_quote

I would like to, but it's not looking likely to happen in the near future. The plot doesn't call for it at the moment; I could force it, but it would end up looking clumsy.
