  As the above comment suggested, will it be the grapple ball of speed?
#+end_quote

That would be telling. :)

In entirely unrelated news, could the person who first pointed out the GBoS please raise your hand? I don't remember who you were and I need to.

  And as Jake explicitly states a scenario when this strategy would not work, why does he propose it as a way to solve the maze?
#+end_quote

It will automatically solve any one-level maze. If the maze is multiple levels or extradimensional, you can probably brute force it given enough speed, but this trick won't work.

  As a 28th level wizard, Hammond ought to be intelligent enough to design a difficult maze. Will anything Hammond does in his defence even be able to challenge the Landguard now, at over 3x his level? Even 1 ought to be able to trounce him.
#+end_quote

Level isn't all that matters, brains and experience count. The Landguard are brand new to their new classes and won't know all the tricks. Hammond has been doing this for a long time; he's put a lot of thought into self defense, and the fight is happening on his chosen ground. It might be a challenge or it might be a curb stomp, but either way it requires more than one Landguard.

  Also, now that Jake and co have access to Mindscrape, can they use to achieve utterly broken results? Such as giving all these new mages the memories and expertise of all their most seasoned warriors and generals. Mindscraping out any too sensitive information first, of course. Or could they get Icefi to let them use it on him? After all, turnabout is fair play and 15000 years of memories could be pretty useful
#+end_quote

Yes, those things could be done, but you would likely mess up the person receiving the data -- if you're 30 and you get 11000 years of experience it might actually overwrite you.

  Does Deadboy sockpuppet the other liches or just Afi?
#+end_quote

They have no evidence that it's more than Afi.

  What would happen if a HoOA was used on Jake, who doesn't really fit in the alignment system?
#+end_quote

It would have no effect.

#+begin_quote
  And as Lawful Good characters, can the Landguard make Ice Assassins? Creating a creature doomed to spend its life in thrall to you and unable to fulfill its deepest desires seems a definite act of evil. It could be justified on consequentialist grounds, but that's not very lawful
#+end_quote

It helps preserve the Land from extinction and doesn't involve actual torture or murder of the innocent. The Landguard are pretty pragmatic.
