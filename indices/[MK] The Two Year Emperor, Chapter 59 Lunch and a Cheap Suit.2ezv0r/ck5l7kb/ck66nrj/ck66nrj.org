  The XP battery got an OK without Jake specifying what amount of XP. A Graham's number XP battery coming up? Although I do favor 3^{^{^}} 3 as unimaginably big numbers go, for requiring fewer characters

Well, I have mentioned Graham's number before....

3 ^ ^ ^ 3 is large-ish, but not really catastrophically so. There's just something that makes my heart go pitter-pat about a number so large that it could not even theoretically be written down in the real universe.

The Landguard already live under permanent Haste spells, so another Haste wouldn't stack. Good thought, though.

It was more in the nature of a warning: here is a condition under which this method will not work.
