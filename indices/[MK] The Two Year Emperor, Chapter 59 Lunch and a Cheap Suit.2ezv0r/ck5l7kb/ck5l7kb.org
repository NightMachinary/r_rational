The XP battery got an OK without Jake specifying what amount of XP. A Graham's number XP battery coming up? Although I do favor 3^^^3 as unimaginably big numbers go, for requiring fewer characters.

Jake's plan seems like it will be something Munchkiny, as if it was a normal magic item, Thomas or someone else present presumably would have said something. A Wished item to cast Haste with sufficient caster level to last essentially forever? But Haste can apparently only double your speed, which I doubt would be sufficient to brute force a maze of arbitrary size. Without further hints, i don't know enough about DnD to hazard a better guess

And why does Jake assume the maze is one level? Or that Hammond will be in it at all, and it isn't just a red herring? With pocket dimensions, there is a far greater potential for cool mazes than Jake is used to, especially if these can lead to different destinations at different times. I mean, look at Grofhamr, reachable through a single hole
