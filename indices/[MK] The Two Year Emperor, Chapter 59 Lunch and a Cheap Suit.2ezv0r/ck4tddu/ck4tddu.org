I cant remember if it was addressed somewhere already, but why are Jake and co not just buying non-custom magic items?

As far as giving high leveled people like Isaac and Thomas xp through the FLEA, Im guessing you had them get hit with a bunch of negative levels, intentionally let that become real level loss, then went through the FLEA and got hit with some restoration spells later? That is a nice trick.
