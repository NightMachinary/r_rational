  Yeah, that's probably it actually. Still, I'm keeping an eye on Loki's motivations. There's a lot we don't know.

I'm taking a somewhat non-standard view of Loki. In many of the myths he was a cruel, evil trickster, and he had a big hand in setting off Ragnarok. In some myths, he was an ally of humanity -- he taught them how to make fishing nets, for example.

The Loki I'm using leans more towards the later view, and is heavily mixed in with Coyote and other trickster gods. The "trickster is evil becuase plot" thing bores me; I wanted someone more mercurial and unpredictable.

There is at least one more major reveal related to the gods that will clarify your questions. Right now, I don't think I've given out enough information for people to reasonably figure out why everyone is doing the things they're doing. I promise I'll get there, though.
