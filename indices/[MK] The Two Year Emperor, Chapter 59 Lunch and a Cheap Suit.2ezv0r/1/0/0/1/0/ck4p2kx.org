Excellent point. But then what does that have to do with infinite-wish loops? Are we expecting people to pray that Jake the Lord High Munchkin will save the day? Considering that the gods react in seconds to the Ring of Three Wishes exploit, that seems like overkill.

Particularly since they don't seem to mind the FLEA, which is just as likely to produce legend-tier heroes.
