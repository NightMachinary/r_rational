Drifa was complaining about 2 of the clerics being killed, so it wasn't really a gain from resurrecting Reynard and Isaac. If Ice Assassins were used instead of clerics, they could be easily replaced, rather than if a person died. So would this be a viable strategy for mass resurrections?

And could the Ice Assassin order this new Assassin to obey all the orders, not harm and prevent harm coming to etc the original person, so it's essentially the same as if the original person had made a new assassin? Who could then do the same and so on, creating an exponentially growing supply of Ice Assassins. Have I mentioned how completely and utterly broken this spell is?

Incidentally, what happens to the Ice Assassin if it's creator/target dies? The spell description doesn't specify
