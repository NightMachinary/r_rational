I thought Ice Assassin had only half the levels of the original caster? Something like that tickles in the back of my head... (I have never read nor played D&D) [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/frostburn--68/ice-assassin--1279/][Reading the text of the spell]], there's a lot of stuff in that spell.

- Passive: dragnet in 1 mile radius around caster due to Scrying on IA.
- Passive: magic cast on original caster *can* affect IA's, meaning 1 spell buffs n+1 Landguards. (n=#IA)
- Passive: killing the IA results in 20 feet ice shrapnel at (x/2)d6 damage (x=caster level; Landguard IA thus 10-11d6 damage)
- Failure Mode: Oughtn't they be dispelled by the antimagic swordclanging? I suppose the IA would be reduced to protecting GrÇ«fhamr.
- Intelligence: Making IA of intelligence targets and mindscraping them. According to the spell description one needs some material component of the original for casting IA, though.

I assume the Landguard took the 21st level in Paladin so their class remains the same? I remember you mentioning there being no Epic tiers or something like that; my assumption is no extra skills and stuff. So aside from the class issue, the only advantage of having 20+y levels in a class is those tied to class level, like the extra damage to Smite Evil, right?

While I see the advantage multi-classing (I'm thinking of more options and synergy), wasn't one of the advantages the Paladins had their effectiveness without magic? I don't know to what degree this would be increased with more levels though.

So mostly I'm wondering, to what degree does multi-classing out-compete more levels in magic-independent classes?
