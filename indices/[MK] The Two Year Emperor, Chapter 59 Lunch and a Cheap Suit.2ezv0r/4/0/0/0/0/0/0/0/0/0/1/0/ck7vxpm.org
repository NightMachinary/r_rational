  I thought Ice Assassin had only half the levels of the original caster?
#+end_quote

Nope, that's Simulacrum, the less broken 7th level version.

  Passive: dragnet in 1 mile radius around caster due to Scrying on IA.
#+end_quote

Yes, but the Scrying is not a passive, always on thing. It's a deliberate choice by the creator.

  Passive: killing the IA results in 20 feet ice shrapnel at (x/2)d6 damage (x=caster level; Landguard IA thus 10-11d6 damage)
#+end_quote

Yep. Makes them pretty good as suicide troops.

#+begin_quote
  Failure Mode: Oughtn't they be dispelled by the antimagic swordclanging?
#+end_quote

Nope. The IA spell has a duration of "Instantaneous". That means that the spell happens, creates a creature, and is then over. The IA creature will have its special abilities (spell casting, etc) turned off by antimagic, but it itself will not be any more destroyed than a zombie would be.

  Intelligence: Making IA of intelligence targets and mindscraping them. According to the spell description one needs some material component of the original for casting IA, though.
#+end_quote

Yep.

  I assume the Landguard took the 21st level in Paladin so their class remains the same?
#+end_quote

According to RAW, if a paladin takes a level in another class they lose the ability to progress as a paladin. According to my house rules (chapter 10) they can multiclass freely as long as their paladin level is higher than any other, and they don't take rogue levels.

#+begin_quote
  I remember you mentioning there being no Epic tiers or something like that; my assumption is no extra skills and stuff. So aside from the class issue, the only advantage of having 20+y levels in a class is those tied to class level, like the extra damage to Smite Evil, right?
#+end_quote

Pretty much, yes. Might be a few others -- I'm away from books at the moment.

#+begin_quote
  While I see the advantage multi-classing (I'm thinking of more options and synergy), wasn't one of the advantages the Paladins had their effectiveness without magic? I don't know to what degree this would be increased with more levels though. So mostly I'm wondering, to what degree does multi-classing out-compete more levels in magic-independent classes?
#+end_quote

At high levels, casters are strictly better than any other class; wizards can out sneak a thief, out fight a fighter, and blow everything the hell up at will.

The fact that the Landguard seem effective is because I've put a lot of work into it, and because of the brains and force of personality of their members. Strictly speaking, a smart wizard could kill them all even without munchkining.

On the other hand, casters top out at 20th level. Without Epic, there is no reason to keep progressing as a caster past that point...hence why the Landguard went multiclass.
