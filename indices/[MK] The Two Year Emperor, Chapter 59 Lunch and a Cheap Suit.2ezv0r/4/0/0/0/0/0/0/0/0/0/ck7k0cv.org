  Drifa was complaining about 2 of the clerics being killed, so it wasn't really a gain from resurrecting Reynard and Isaac. If Ice Assassins were used instead of clerics, they could be easily replaced, rather than if a person died.
#+end_quote

Ah, right, I missed your point. Yes, that's true.

#+begin_quote
  So would this be a viable strategy for mass resurrections?
#+end_quote

It would help, but not solve the problem. It's not just the people at the resurrection that are at risk; if the people doing the resurrecting miss whatever Neklos sent back, the entire population gets screwed. And Neklos is smart enough not to send something back every time. As Drifa said, they miss something about one time in four, which is why they don't do many resurrections any more.

  And could the Ice Assassin order this new Assassin to obey all the orders, not harm and prevent harm coming to etc the original person,
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  so it's essentially the same as if the original person had made a new assassin?
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  Who could then do the same and so on, creating an exponentially growing supply of Ice Assassins. Have I mentioned how completely and utterly broken this spell is?
#+end_quote

Yeppers.

#+begin_quote
  Incidentally, what happens to the Ice Assassin if it's creator/target dies? The spell description doesn't specify
#+end_quote

There's no RAW on it, so I ruled that the IA melts.

EDIT: Fixed a lot of places where my friggin' phone browser 'corrected' things into incomprehensibility. Stupid phone browser. Note to self: proofread more carefully.
