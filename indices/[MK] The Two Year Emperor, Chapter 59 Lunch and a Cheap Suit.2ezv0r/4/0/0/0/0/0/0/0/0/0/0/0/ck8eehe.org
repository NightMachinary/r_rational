  If the original dying means that all of the Assassins die, does that mean that no Landguard will be doing important and dangerous stuff anymore? After all, anything which risks their death also risks the death of a lot of powerful others.

That's...a very good point. One that I hadn't considered. Since it hasn't actually come up yet, I may actually change my ruling on what happens to an IA after its original's death.

  And now that time is less of a concern, could the Resurrectees be quarantined until they are sure that they're safe? Or could some things slip through even so?
#+end_quote

Well, think of it in a real world scenario: you're the security guards at a major airport. There's a steady stream of passengers going through. You know that many but not all of them are terrorists. Failing to identify a terrorist will result in hundreds or thousands of deaths.

Some of these terrorists are carrying bombs, bioweapons, etc on their persons, making them relatively easy to identify with a search. Some ARE bioweapons (they gargled with Ebola before getting on the plane). Some are sleeper agents. Some are mules for information or weaponry. Just to make life extra special, some of the people going through are totally innocent.

What do you do?

  And would things like mummy rot or a plague be catchable by an Ice Assassin?
#+end_quote

Mummy rot, yes. It's a curse, not an actual disease. A plague...probably not, but I'd need to go back and re-read the IA spell description more closely. If not, that would be one way to identify IAs.
