+What is a soul rider?+ And given that a plague can presumably be easily cured by clerics, why would Neklos have sent it when he can send more damaging things? As a god, he presumably does not lack the resources to do that

EDIT: Forget that first question, I found a quote about it

#+begin_quote
  "We've had different ones. Sometimes it will be a demon that rides along with the resurrection, using it like a reverse Gate. Sometimes there will be a taint on the person's soul that works like a communicable form of mummy rot. Sometimes the dark gods have modified the mind attached to the soul, so the one resurrected returns as an agent of evil. Sometimes...well, the list goes on. The dark gods are very creative, and Neklos in particular is both cruel and evil.
