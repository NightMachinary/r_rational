It will be a bit of a mix. The first time or two, I'll show it, then I'll largely elide it. When the answer is no, I'll generally show it.

Reasons:

1. When adding a new and important yet repetitive plot element, it's important to make clear that it's happening. Therefore, show it in the beginning.
2. When the element continues to happen normally (i.e. when the answer is "yes it's ok") it's repetitive and uninteresting; elide it.
3. Remember that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee][stating your plans in advance is considered harmful]] and elide that.
4. When something changes about your plot element (in this case, when the fragment says "no") that's interesting and should not be elided. It gives the audience information by which they can reason about the story, so don't cheat and deprive them of it.
