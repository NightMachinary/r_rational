Ah, so others recognise my omnipotence. I thank you for this endorsement. Use of AO3 would be acceptable. Although, should the ring's nigh-omnipotent power be capable of generating writing of superior quality to your own, it would surely be capable of posting them to both sites. And responding to reviews on an arbitrarily large amount of writing does sound like a definite logistical challenge. Wish for a Cube of Ice Assassin? And you may as well give Jake one while you're at it.

Jake will presumably be doing a lot more munchkining now that he has access to that shambling travesty of a deity inhabiting Reynard's animated corpse (as far as I can gather from limited evidence. Shambling is as of yet but a conjecture), but every little helps.
