Let me try Anselm's Ontological Argument for my divinity to get you a wish:

God is defined as the greatest possible being\\
I can conceive of God\\
If God does not exist, I can conceive of a greater being, one who exists\\
This would contradict the assumption of God's maximal greatness\\
Therefore God exists\\
If God is the greatest possible being, they must also be the greatest possible being I can conceive of\\
If God were not me, I would perceive that as a flaw\\
God can have no flaws\\
Therefore I am God\\
God is omnipotent\\
I am God, therefore I am omnipotent

I use my powers to cause a Ring of 3 Wishes to appear before you upon you reading this statement

Please report whether you have received empirical proof of my divinity
