  Ah, so others recognise my omnipotence. I thank you for this endorsement.
#+end_quote

You're welcome. :) Thanks for the Ring.

#+begin_quote
  Use of AO3 would be acceptable.
#+end_quote

I appreciate your permission. :P

  Although, should the ring's nigh-omnipotent power be capable of generating writing of superior quality to your own, it would surely be capable of posting them to both sites.
#+end_quote

It would be great if the Ring could produce writing better than mine! Well, as long as it was something that I enjoyed reading. Then I could just sit back and take credit for the work without doing the work. :)

  And responding to reviews on an arbitrarily large amount of writing does sound like a definite logistical challenge. Wish for a Cube of Ice Assassin? And you may as well give Jake one while you're at it
#+end_quote

Not a bad plan!

  Jake will presumably be doing a lot more munchkining now that he has access to that shambling travesty of a deity inhabiting Reynard's animated corpse (as far as I can gather from limited evidence. Shambling is as of yet but a conjecture), but every little helps.

Yeah, the fragment makes my life easier by making it so that I don't have to write more "and then a god almost squished Jake's face but didn't because plot" scenes. And it makes Jake's life easier because he doesn't have to have a god squish his face.
