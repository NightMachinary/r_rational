Most appreciated for both the ring and the XP!

I'll be happy to wish up some more writing for you, but I'll most likely be putting it on ArchiveOfOurOwn.org -- I am fed up with FFNs failings and intend to migrate new writing to a better site. I'm checking out AO3 because I've been told it can do the things I really care about, such as threaded reviews replies.
