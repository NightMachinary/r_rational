I hate gods.

If Arros' behaviour shows how the gods /normally/ treat humans who are on their side, Loki's been impossibly nice to Jake so far.

I think Loki has a more personal stake in this matter. If this was just the war between the gods, Team Life vs Team Death, then you'd expect all the Team Life gods to be equally helpful to the humans, modulo differences in personality. And the God Of Playing Cruel Pranks is not the one that you'd expect to be straightforward.

Either that or Arros doesn't care as much as Loki about the outcome of the war. Afi's minions have a lot of spellcasters among them, so Arros doesn't really stand to lose a lot if Team Life dies out. Not as much as the God of Chaos loses if everybody is replaced by mindless servants.

Yeah, that's probably it actually. Still, I'm keeping an eye on Loki's motivations. There's a lot we don't know.
