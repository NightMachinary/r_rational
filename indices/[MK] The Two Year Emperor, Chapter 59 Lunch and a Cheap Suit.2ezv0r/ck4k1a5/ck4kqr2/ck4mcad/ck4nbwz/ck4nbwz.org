Why not? After all, if someone does enough legendary things, they become legends themselves. And it's a small step from praying that a god will save you to praying that the legendary hero (who lives just over that hill) will save you. Once you've had a 'Big Damn Heroes' moment a few times and saved the day for people who were praying you would (even if you didn't know they were)...well, at that point you're probably at least half-way towards having honest-to-you worshipers.
