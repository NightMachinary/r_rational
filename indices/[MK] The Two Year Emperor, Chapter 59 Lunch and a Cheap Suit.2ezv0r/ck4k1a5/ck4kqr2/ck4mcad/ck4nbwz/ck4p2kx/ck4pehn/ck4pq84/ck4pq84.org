There's one more detail to consider. In D&D 3.5, the gods are "just" extremely powerful Outsiders with infinite spells per day and a wide assortment of powers and immunities that dwarf anything mortals have access to.

They can still be killed by dropping their HP to 0. Maybe they're worried that will happen to them if they let one person get too much power.
