The gods most likely LOVE FLEA. FLEA gets lots of people up to high level, which means they don't need to be saved as much. That means they'll look to other people to save them far less. Also, it generates at least some clerics of different gods (though they are focusing on a single deity at the moment).

Lots of high-level people means that there's more powerful worshipers, and when level 60 people are common, it's a lot harder for a single person (or party) to become legendary.

Infinite Wish loops are a threat to the gods because they can produce a single mortal (or group of mortals) with improbable levels of power. Individuals or groups about whom tales will be told...and those tales are a form of power.

How many people will tell tales about how bravely Flobova shouted 'Reducio' to slaughter unsuspecting monsters in a trap that others prepared? Especially when there are 300 others who have the same story?
