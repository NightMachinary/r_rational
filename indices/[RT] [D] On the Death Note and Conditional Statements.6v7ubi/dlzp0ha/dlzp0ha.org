I think this violates, like most of the ideas for extracting information using the DN, VI rule #5/6:

#+begin_quote

  - The conditions for death will not be realized unless it is physically possible for that human or it is reasonably assumed to be carried out by that human.
  - The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either. So, you must examine and find out.
#+end_quote

It is not reasonable to imagine a dying human reliably solving NP-hard problems at random or otherwise serving as an oracle, so the Note would be well within its rights to simply kill the victim with a normal heart attack or make them take random actions once the conditionals or instructions get difficult enough, and if you are foolish enough to use any of the 'answers' without checking, well, neither gods of death nor death notes "has no obligation to completely explain how to use the note or rules which will apply to the human who owns it".
