That's a good one. It's also in the spirit of the series: if some paper ripped from a DN and squirreled away can later be used, why not time-delay writing? You could imagine multiple variants, like ripping a sheet in half and writing the first name/surname down the middle, it becoming only 'legible' to the reader as the name of a specific person when taped together.
