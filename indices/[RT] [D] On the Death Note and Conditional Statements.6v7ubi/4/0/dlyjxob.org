Or that path would lead to early deaths, so something goes wrong preventing your plan to send to Mars from ever succeeding. Your assumption is that you can force the person with a long lifespan into a scenario where the seemingly impossible would happen to keep them alive, but it's very possible things go wrong first to prevent that scenario arising under these rules.

It's also possible that since death notes can cut someone off early in a setup where they manipulate things to preserve lifespans they might have a different death note become responsible for killing you in order to prevent these scenarios.

Generally just don't assume your plans will work, and don't assume the incredibly powerful pseudo-sentient device can't get mad at you for trying to abuse it.
