Edit: This seems like it gets a little long, I blame having written it on my phone making judging the length of my half rant half musings hard.

Who says it has to make it that far? If it's manipulating fate at a global scale I was thinking you'd be dealing with more subtle problems. Financial difficulties, manufacturing problems, stubborn politicians failing to approve things, manned flights to mars would take a lot of steps. Hell, it might just end up swept out of control and actually meeting safety standards so nothing has to go wrong and you don't need anything crazy happening. Stop you from arranging the situation with an incredibly improbable method of survival in the first place, or someone else writes their name in a death note so they can die anyway.

It doesn't inherently counter things to need caution, but it does need delaying. Plus there's how the Death Note seems to have an awful lot of rules, and don't forget we know there is actually beings behind the whole thing with the shinigami, and if it's similar with something like Ryuk doing this for entertainment? Well then the death note being potentially dangerous is abused isn't really the problem, it's keeping Ryuk appeased. Shouldn't be too hard, but Ryuk is perfectly capable of writing your name in a death note if they decide they don't want you alive anymore.

It's a tricky problem, but it's the kind of thing that should be looked at, the conditions and circumstances surrounding it make it more interesting in my opinion. Knowing that you don't have the only death note, that there are a race of spiritual beings that created them and only they know all the rules to their usage. Your only knowledge of the rules comes from someone that is doing this for their own entertainment, and who will kill you if they think the situation deserves it. This means you've got to take a totally different approach from the simplistic omniscient wish granting device without any baggage, it makes for a better story too. A story of someone trying incrementally larger and more complex experiments to try and break open reality is going to be limited, you need the antagonizing force, and it's too easy to perform untraceable deaths. Anyone you know the name and face of? Social media and public obituaries break the challenge, the face is only an identifying system too so old images shouldn't matter. Get your hands on a yearbook and there's hundreds if not thousands of potential people with no link to you, of course killing of random people runs into ethical and moral issues but it does lead to trains of thought realizing just how easy it is to get info. Just choose your line for how far is too far and run with it, conflict based off the character murdering others for knowledge is going to harshly limit any story, even a real scenario that's going to be the primary conflict. Well that and trying to decipher the rules and loopholes in them.
