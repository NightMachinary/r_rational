If I recall correctly, this rule is about the extra details of death that you write for your target. For example, if you write "X dies after getting a machine gun and shooting tons of people to death", X just dies of a heart attack because your written conditions cause other people to die as well. It's not very clear however, on what it means by "causes more people to die". Do underlying causes count? Can you write "X dies after getting a machine gun and shooting tons of people, who miraculously all survive but are now paralyzed from the neck down"? All more experiments Light really should have done.
