I don't think that follows. Remember, if someone is supposed to do something implausible with the Death Note, like hitch a ride on an ICBM, they just die of a heart attack. I suspect the same would be true of trying to force impossible conditions: if there is no plausible way for a person to survive, they die of a heart attack.
