Based on what we know about how Death Note deaths work, the time of death is very "sticky", but not infinitely so. So for example, while it would have been physically possible for the convict to get to Paris in that timeframe (the military decides to put him in a Mach 20 fighter jet, for example), the circumstances are so unlikely that the override the designated time of death.

So I would say the same thing is applicable to natural deaths. If you shoot someone whose designated time of death is 20 years later in the head, they'll probably survive, because people sometimes survive headshots, but if you detonate a nuclear weapon in the same room as them, they won't, because there is no plausible way that a human could survive the situation.

On the other hand, no one can ever survive past their designated time of death. If you prevent the circumstances which would have naturally killed them, they just die of a heart attack.
