I consider (1) to be unlikely, because it renders the very concept of lifespans meaningless if they are so easily changed. They would either fluctuate wildly or not display the actual time of death for a person.

Plus, there is evidence that suggests people's lifespans don't change when they get put into lethal situations. Instead, those lethal situations are taken into account far in advance. Case in point: Misa's original lifespan. There was a Death god stalking her for ages in advance, noting her lifespan and wondering why she would die so young. Turns out, Misa was suddenly put in a lethal situation right before the end of her original lifespan. This lethal situation was not premeditated: the human stalker didn't intend to kill Misa until Misa rejected him. Yet the lifespan counter didn't change at the moment the human stalker decided to kill Misa, it stayed exactly the same.

Now, it is conceivable, that there were underlying factors that would have influenced the human stalker to kill Misa anyway, so her lifespan counter may have changed when those underlying causes arose, rather than when the immediate cause appeared. But, by that logic, the lifespan counter should change at the moment I decide to begin hunting for people with long lifespans anyway: that would be the primary underlying factor as I would be planning to put them in lethal situations.
