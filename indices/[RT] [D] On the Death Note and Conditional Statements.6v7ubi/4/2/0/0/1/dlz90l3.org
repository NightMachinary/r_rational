More on this: If the value embedded in the code above their heads turns out to be a derived quantity, consisting other variables other than lifespan then decoding it would be impossible. Conversely, it could very well be the case that the value embedded is a fundamental quantity from which lifespan can be derived given other knowns, in which case breaking the code is also neigh impossible.
