Note that this could only work if you have multiple Death Notes. Per the rules, only the actual owner of the DN can trade for more lifespan. And of course, you can't just give up ownership temporarily, because you'll lose all DN-related memories the instant you do.

Even if you /do/ have multiple Death Notes, giving one to some vengeful orphan basically means trusting that said orphan will mindlessly obey you, will never betray you (especially since, unlike you, they've got the eyes), and will never get caught and reveal your secrets. I don't know about you, but I've never met anyone I'd trust in all those respects, and I especially wouldn't trust some random bloodthirsty orphan to that extent.
