Well, that's simple enough, we can address all those points of failure.

  First, you're assuming you can find a vengeful orphan who's willing to trust a nameless, faceless stranger so far as to willingly walk into a room of poison gas, give up half their lifespan, and then leave, all the while knowing that if they betray you you'll kill them.
#+end_quote

Trust is easily bought. Find an orphan with vengeance against multiple parent-murderers. Tell him that you will kill one of them as a freebie, and let him specify the details of death so you can prove that you killed the murderer. Tell him that if he wants the rest of them dead, he now has to give up his lifespan and obey your orders.

You can pass yourself off as a great wizard with multiple supernatural artifacts. Get the orphan to sign a (fake) blood contract of loyalty before even letting him get the Death Note.

  so you'd presumably need to commit hefty resources to monitoring this minion-child for the rest of their life.
#+end_quote

Well yes, but getting resources is really really easy with a Death Note. Invest in companies, kill off rival companies. Write "X dies in a completely unsuspicious manner".

  I'm not sure any orphans fitting those requirements even exist in the real world, but assuming they did, somehow tracking down an orphan with such a specific disposition, without leaving any trail, seems nigh impossible.
#+end_quote

I don't think it's that hard, vengeance is kind of a big human motivator... but assuming it is, you could always make those orphans. Kill their parents yourself (with the Death Note of course), setting up a bunch of other people. Write "X dies in circumstances that make it seem like Y killed X, but not actually provide enough evidence for Y to be convicted."

    Assuming your non-Death Note possessed self is willing to follow those instructions.
  #+end_quote

  To me, that's also a huge assumption.

Do you have a recognition code? Like "Recognition code 927, I am a potato"? It's kinda handy so if you ever return from the future or have your memories wiped, you can give yourself messages that you know are from yourself.

Barring that, you could always take your own self hostage. You "wake up" in a room full of explosives. Or wearing a bunch of explosives. Instructions tell you to obey or the explosives go boom. If you aren't selfish enough to care about your own life, take more hostages, show them on camera. Tell yourself to obey or hostages die. It doesn't even have to be real. Fake camera footage is probably safer.
