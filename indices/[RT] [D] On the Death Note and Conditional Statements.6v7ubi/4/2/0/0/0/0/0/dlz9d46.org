  And of course, you can't just give up ownership temporarily, because you'll lose all DN-related memories the instant you do.

Just get them to pass it back to you immediately?

  giving one to some vengeful orphan basically means trusting that said orphan will mindlessly obey you, will never betray you (especially since, unlike you, they've got the eyes), and will never get caught and reveal your secrets

Which is why you take the Death Note back immediately. Don't risk letting them write your name in a Death Note. One way to do this is to set up a secure room with bombs everywhere, set up to soon explode if you don't stop them with some method/password only you know (you keep memories not related to the Death Note). Transfer the Death Note to your minion inside this room, with strict orders for him to return it, otherwise your bombs explode and kill you both.

Or better yet, don't even meet your minion face to face. You lose memories when you give up a Death Note, but your circumstances don't change. So you can easily write a bunch of instructions/knowledge/memories for yourself then give up your memories and follow those instructions. (Assuming your non-Death Note possessed self is willing to follow those instructions.)

Your instructions would be to tell your minion to enter the room full of explosives and cameras. Pick up the Death Note you left on the ground in the middle of the room. Get the Eye deal. Put the Note back on the ground without writing anything in it. Go to another distant and explosive-filled room and wait. If they try anything funny, explode the bombs. Wait, actually that might destroy the Death Note. Better plan: Poison gas instead of bombs.

Now that they are safely far away in another room, you can enter the first room and retrieve your Death Note. Now you have a minion who, even if disloyal, knows nothing about your name or face, and so can never write your name in a Death Note. If you limit your interactions with your minions, they won't even have any useful information about you to betray you with. At best, they might try to report the wrong lifespan, but this can be resolved by having multiple independent minions, all checking the lifespan of the target and reporting it to you without talking to the other minions.
