Eh, Light had the right idea here: get minions to take the eye deal for you. It wouldn't even be hard, plenty of people around would gladly trade half their lifespans for all kinds of goals. Go around orphanages, talking to kids and seeing if any of them are obsessed with vengeance against their parents' murderers. Offer them a chance to use your Death Note to kill those murderers, and they will likely be your loyal minions for life.
