  Rule #1: "The human whose name is written in this Note shall die."
#+end_quote

I would think that 'shall' means 'may', which would mean that the death note is open to the use of conditionals. Granted, the use of 'shall' could also only be because (as you state) the Note is unable to make targets perform certain actions.

While it may be true that the Note /uses information from the user's and victims mind only/, I think that the condition would only be applicable to the performance of actions that result in the victim's cause of death. The use of conditional statements does not test the victim's or users mind since it is not related to their cause of death but rather to the circumstances by which the death occurs (from a death note casual perspective). I suspect then that what those statements would test would be the mind of higher powers like the shinigami king who is supposedly in charge of all the death notes and their shinigami, who I assume is privy to such information.

Whether the Note only uses information from the user's mind as you have raised is indeed problematic, but I think I can show that the note does have the ability to use information that is not held by both parties. For example, when Light wrote down Kiichiro Osoreda's name (ep. 4), he specified the condition that it would be an accidental death after conducting the kidnapping. The result was that he died by a traffic accident (car collision). I would think that the fuzzy language here suggests that the Note has the ability to /decide and execute/ the most probable cause of death independent from the thoughts of both the victim or the user, since 'accidental death' could mean a range of possible things. It also suggests that the Note is capable of influencing individuals unrelated to the victim or the user, i.e. the driver of the car. This opens the floor to whether or not the note contains some form of omniscience that could be accessible via conditional statements.

Yudkowsky also captures this sense well in his [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/29qonq/q_what_would_you_ask_about_the_death_note/cioylzf/][post]]

  Can the Death Note ensure that the past (from before the command was written) is in conformance with the required result? What if I write that in 30 seconds someone will die from atherosclerosis or an advanced brain cancer? This doesn't distinguish well between the atherosclerosis having been retroactively added, or just magically materialized, but there may be other ways to check.
