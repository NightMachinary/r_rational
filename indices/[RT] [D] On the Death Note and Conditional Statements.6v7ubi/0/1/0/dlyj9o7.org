#+begin_quote
  I would think that 'shall' means 'may',
#+end_quote

Shall doesn't mean may. I remember being in a one day contracts course stating that "shall" is a good word to use in contracts because it means that doing it is required, whereas "may" is optional.

(The Death Note rules were written in English in the original manga, weren't they?)

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shall_and_will]] goes into some more detail and it turns out that the whole Shall thing is pretty contentious, but the following passage seems most relevant to /Death Note/ to me:

#+begin_quote
  In statements, shall has the specific use of expressing an order or instruction, normally in elevated or formal register.
#+end_quote
