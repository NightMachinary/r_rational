It's really interesting but I don't think it's right.

Rule #1: "The human whose name is written in this Note *shall die*."

Rule #2: "This Note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected."

That's it. If your name is written while Light is thinking of your face, you die. No matter what. You can't use "if" statements the way you're describing. The only conditional statements Light can use are things like "Hideki Ryuga [performs this action] and then dies [at this time] and [in this manner]." Ryuga dies no matter what: If any of these conditions are impossible, Ryuga simply dies of a heart attack. Writing "Hideki Ryuga dies if [statement] is true," would just kill Ryuga.

I also get the idea the Note uses information from its user's and victim's minds only. Before the FBI stunt, Light tests the Note on prisoners to determine the extent of his control. He is able to make them write phrases and perform actions of his choosing, but he is not able, for example, to have them travel to Paris or draw a picture of L's face. As the prisoners lack the information or ability to perform these actions, they die of heart attacks. If the Note is all-knowing and this information was being introduced, the prisoner would've drawn a face.

In "Encounter," L is actually being pretty sharp, introducing himself as someone so well known that the user of the Note would have trouble NOT picturing his face as he wrote the name (like introducing himself as "Tom Cruise"). Light is smart enough not to try; he knows he will probably accidentally picture the actor and kill him, immediately revealing himself as Kira.

That was more than I meant to write. Sorry, this is by far my favorite anime and manga and I've read/watched it dozens of times. I know it pretty well and would love to argue about it more!
