  That's it. If your name is written while Light is thinking of your face, you die. No matter what. You can't use "if" statements the way you're describing. The only conditional statements Light can use are things like "Hideki Ryuga [performs this action] and then dies [at this time] and [in this manner]." Ryuga dies no matter what: If any of these conditions are impossible, Ryuga simply dies of a heart attack. Writing "Hideki Ryuga dies if [statement] is true," would just kill Ryuga.

This is pretty easily fixed a la [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6v7ubi/rt_d_on_the_death_note_and_conditional_statements/dly9b45/][this comment]] (man, we've got some link-ception going on here); all you have to do is vary the /method/ of death rather than the death itself.
