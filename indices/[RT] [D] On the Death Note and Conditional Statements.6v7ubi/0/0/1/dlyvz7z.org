This could work, but only if the methods of death did not include the default method of heart attack. There is always the possibility of the Death Note just defaulting to heart attack if it doesn't understand the conditional statement or can't possibly figure it out.

For instance, someones writes this in a death note "Bob dies in a car accident if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false." Bob then dies...of a heart attack. A non-answer, that would have been a false positive or negative if heart attack was used for one of the options.
