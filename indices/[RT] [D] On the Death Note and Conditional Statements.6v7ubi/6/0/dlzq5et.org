Okay, real idea for munchkining the Death Note that might actually work (albeit a significantly less ambitious one than most of the attempts elsewhere in this comment section):

The Death Note rules, page VII states that:

#+begin_quote
  The instrument to write with can be anything, e.g. cosmetics, blood, etc. as long as it can write directly onto the note and remains as legible letters.
#+end_quote

Given the legibility requirement, one possible use might be to write someone's name down in the Death Note using invisible ink while visualizing their face. This would allow you to pull some deadman's switch-style tricks where you or someone else could then apply an agent to make the ink visible at a later date, thereby triggering the person's death.
