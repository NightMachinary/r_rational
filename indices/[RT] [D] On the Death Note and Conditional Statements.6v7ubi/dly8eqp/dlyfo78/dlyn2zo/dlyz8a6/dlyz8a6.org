But each bit of a string of code (or bits as in bits of entropy) represents a doubling of the number of possibilities, so halving the search space with every death still means the number of bits maps one-to-one to the number of deaths required.

This would mean it would require a lot of deaths to produce complex output even if you could make the death note do so.

If the first two paragraphs of this comment were represented in ASCII (i.e. 7 bits per character) it would come out to 2,555 bits, meaning 2,555 people would have to die to encode that portion uncompressed.

As you can probably tell, this is not a particularly profound or worthy comment. Something that is profound and worthy is likely to either be much, much longer, or require us to ask a specific question (and obtaining that question is probably beyond the scope of a death note or just as complex as the answer would have been).
