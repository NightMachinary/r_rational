Omniscience via the usage of death notes, with 1 human death needed per bit? @_@ This will need a lot of deaths. I want the code for a friendly super intelligent AI that will solve all our problems, but that will probably need more than 7 billion bits...

Ok, step one would be to use a relatively smaller amount of Death Note kills to figure out how to crank up the birth rates of humans really high so we can kill them off for more data... so asking things like the formulas for optimal fertility drugs... which we then force-feed people to make them make more babies... which we then murder with the Death Note as soon as possible...

No wait, make that step two instead. Step one would be the figure out how to conquer the world and force humanity into slavery to stop them from trying to kill us to stop us from forcefully breeding them and killing them for data... and various mind-control/paralytic drugs to stop them from killing themselves...

Erm... I think my soul is turning black. Help.
