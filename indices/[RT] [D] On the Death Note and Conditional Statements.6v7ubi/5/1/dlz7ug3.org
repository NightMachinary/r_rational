In other words, the Death Note may also allow you to reverse entropy XD.

Currently, we are stuck in a universe where everything is going from "what is possible" to "what is probable": like sandcastles turning into a disorganized mess of sand. But the Death Note says that if the conditions of death are "possible", it will happen that way.

The question then is, what's the most efficient way of killing people to reverse entropy? I don't think there's an actual limit, since you can write the conditions of death before the name itself, and you can write as many conditions as you want. So just write "X dies after the occurrence of the following improbable but possible events a, b, c, ...".
