A little late to the party, but I think I know another way to use the Death Note that no one mentioned^{1}: steering the course of history through causes of death. [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai][u/ShiranaiWakaranai]] mentioned something similar, but focused on contradictory rules rather than practical applications.

As everyone starting from Yudkowsky noticed, the ability to choose how someone dies is theoretically unlimitedly overpowered. It's limited by "physical impossibility" here, but what is "impossible" becomes less and less impossible as time passes.

"Ryuga dies in two minutes of blunt force trauma caused by a hard drive containing the full code of a FAI falling on his head" leads to Ryuga dying of heart attack, because HDDs don't usually appear ex nihilo. Similarly, you can't have a Japanese prisoner dying in an hour in Paris. What you /can/ do, I think, is have him die in Paris in a week. An ability to manipulate history to at least this extent opens many possibilities.

If there's a plausible way for the history to go in such a way that what you want happens, then Death Note would allow you to force history into this.

As easiest example, you could try writing, "John Doe dies in year 2430 of heart attack". If John Doe doesn't die in the next seven minutes, then you a) determined that there's a likely-enough way for him to survive until 2430s, and b) ensured that he will live until 2430s. You could add on conditionals, which become less and less unlikely depending on how far into the future you place his death. "... seconds before his mind is uploaded to a computer", "... on a business flight to Jupiter", "... in the capital of the eudemonic transhuman utopia", "... as FAI is taking control of humanity". If any of this is still "too implausible", you just add years. Year 2700? 3232? 5000? 10^{6}? Whatever works.

The most useful way to manipulate this aspect of Death Note in short-to-middle-term is, I think, manipulating future statistics and news. "Y dies in year 2031, of heart attack after looking at truthful mortality and crime rate statistics which said [include desirable numbers]". "Z dies after reading news about political party S issuing statement A".

And so on. As long as you write neither impossible nor implausible scenarios, you can do anything. It's still ludicrously powerful.
