Why are we restricted by binary division? There are a lot of ways to die, and each one of those would allow for further division per death.

Ex: Person dies in manner A if statement 1 is true, manner B if statement 2 is true, manner C if statement 3 is true, etc.

We can also narrow it down further with variations. Manner A could be a car accident, but we could refine this further with Manner A1 being as a driver, A2 a motorcyclist, A3 a bicyclist, and A4 a pedestrian.

We want to maximize information gained per death, right?
