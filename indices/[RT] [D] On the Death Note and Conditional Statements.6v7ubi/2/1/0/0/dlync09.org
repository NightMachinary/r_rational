I suppose you could compress the code of a Friendly AI as much as possible (which makes the number of deaths needed as small as possible), but even then, going under 7 billion deaths seems unlikely.

This is also fairly dangerous, seeing as the difference between a friendly AI and an unfriendly one could be as small as a single incorrect bit. Considering an unfriendly one could potentially wipe out all life in the multiverse, you really want to be careful here and put as much redundancy in your questions as possible.
