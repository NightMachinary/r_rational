Not one death per bit, one death per binary division of the search space. For comparison, the Earth's surface is ~510.1 trillion m². That's a bit more than 2^{49} which means that 49, maybe 50, people /at most/ would need to be sacrificed to establish a location accuracy of 1 m². (Assuming you use no logic or common sense /at all/ to narrow it down further, like "sea or land", "urban or rural", etc.)
