It's a sound idea, for sure. Have to use people we'd want to get rid of anyway, of course. Fortunately they're not in short supply. On that note, it may be possible to algorithmically establish a utilitarian morality - if we're /wrong/ about someone deserving to die, we'd want the Death Note for them to fail.

"Alien lifeforms with human-level intelligence" is probably already covered as a "yes" by the Shinobi.

Heart attacks are not a good choice of test death, since (1) while they're fairly rare, they have a non-zero chance of occurring anyway; (2) they're the default method specified if death can't occur any other way, it's like programming an error-finding subroutine to return a 0 if an error is found, it might return a 0 because there's an error in the subroutine.

I wonder if "else" statements are permitted?

Binary searches are also useful.

I wonder if information can be sent backwards in time by subsequent Death Note writings, eg "<person> will die of rectal impalement on a cargo boat anchor iff the next question will not result in a death", then wait to see if he dies in the specified manner, then write something else.
