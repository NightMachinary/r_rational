  I wonder if information can be sent backwards in time by subsequent Death Note writings, eg "<person> will die of rectal impalement on a cargo boat anchor iff the next question will not result in a death", then wait to see if he dies in the specified manner, then write something else.

I wouldn't think so, since this implies the Note's ability to---borrowing a term from Yuval Noah Harari---predict second order chaos (i.e. changes in the system resulting from the arrival of a prediction of the system itself).

Unless what you mean is time travel, in which case if the note could do such a thing by those means then the note has just solved whether or not the world is deterministic.

  Binary searches are also useful.

What do you mean by this by the way? I'm sorry, I'm illiterate in computer science.
