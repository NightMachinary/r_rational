  I consider (1) to be unlikely, because it renders the very concept of lifespans meaningless if they are so easily changed. They would either fluctuate wildly or not display the actual time of death for a person.

Alternatively, lifespans remain unaltered by the actions of any /ordinary/ human... but it is in fact possible for a human with the /Shinigami Eyes/ (i.e. the eyes that let people see other people's lifespans in the DN universe) to alter lifespans using their actions, the same way it's possible for someone using the Death Note to inadvertently alter the lifespans of other people. (In story terms, people with Death Notes and/or Shinigami Eyes are no longer NPCs, and can change the plot.)

This actually does make sense from a meta-perspective: unless we're postulating some kind of Time-Turner-esque consistency-enforcing ability for the Shinigami Eyes, there ought to be no way they can predict the outcomes of their /own actions/, or else you could use them as [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][outcome pumps]]. (In fact, I'm pretty sure that's what your original comment was trying to do!) It's doubtful that /Death Gods/ have /time/-related powers, so I'm pretty sure this is most likely the case.
