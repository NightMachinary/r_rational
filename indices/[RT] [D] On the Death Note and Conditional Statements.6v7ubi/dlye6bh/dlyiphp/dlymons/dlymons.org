To clarify, I wouldn't be using the Death Note to make them do the impossible. So the "heart attack if impossible" rule doesn't apply, they haven't been marked for death. I would be using normal, mundane methods, to make people do the impossible. In this scenario, there are two possible outcomes:

1) Their lifespan changes. This seems unlikely, because if lifespans could change based on mundane actions, then their very concept is meaningless since they would be fluctuating all the time from all the mundane choices that people make and all the butterfly effects from them.

2) They do the impossible without dying, since they still have lifespan remaining.
