  I don't think it's that hard, vengeance is kind of a big human motivator...

I mean...there's no orphan backstory search engine, AFAIK. How would you actually go about this search? In-person interviews? Interview via proxies (in which case, you've now got even more loose ends)?

  ... but assuming it is, you could always make those orphans.
#+end_quote

Well, that's true. You've probably lost any claims of the moral high ground at this point, but if that's not a worry, then this may work (although there's always at least some chance the orphan-minion finds out, in which case he's now /highly motivated/ to find a way to take you down).

  Do you have a recognition code? Like "Recognition code 927, I am a potato"?
#+end_quote

Yea, in my comment I recognized that you could utilize some signal or recognition code (including one from HPMOR, if that's your preference). But personally, I don't think I could ever be 100% sure my code wasn't cracked or extracted from me, especially if I was missing large chunks of memories. I certainly could never be sure enough to willingly commit child murder.

All in all, I agree with you in that you could probably find a method around any specific obstacle using the DN, especially if you're willing to murder non-criminals (including innocent parents and potentially innocent orphans) to achieve your goals. However, each new convoluted method of covering your tracks [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][potentially costs a high amount of anonymity]], which to me is the most important factor in using the DN, far above acquiring a hopefully-obedient minion with death god eyes. But your priorities may differ.
