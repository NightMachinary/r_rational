I think there are too many points of failure with this plan...

First, you're assuming you can find a vengeful orphan who's willing to trust a nameless, faceless stranger so far as to willingly walk into a room of poison gas, give up half their lifespan, and then leave, all the while knowing that if they betray you you'll kill them. They could also go to the police and put them on your trail (even without a name/face, I can't imagine that creating a room of cameras and gas wouldn't leave any sort of trail, and you'd need to keep in frequent contact with the kid to use their eye powers), so you'd presumably need to commit hefty resources to monitoring this minion-child for the rest of their life.

I'm not sure any orphans fitting those requirements even exist in the real world, but assuming they did, somehow tracking down an orphan with such a specific disposition, without leaving any trail, seems nigh impossible.

To me, that's also a huge assumption. You wake up unsure of where you are, with a list of instructions that included:

- Look at these camera feeds. If a small child appears and does anything besides pick up this random notebook, say something, put it down, and leave...kill them, and retrieve the notebook.

- Once the child is gone (either by voluntarily leaving, or by murder), enter this mysterious kill-chamber yourself, and claim the notebook.

You know nothing about a notebook that can kill people. Even if you leave signals that the instructions are from you (including passwords, facts, etc that only you could know), would you still really trust it enough to murder a child you don't know? Or, if you didn't know that pressing this big red button would gas a child (say, you leave that out of the instructions), once you did it and unknowingly /killed a child/, would you really /continue to follow those instructions/?

All this to say, if you only have one Death Note and you need the eyes, I think it's way less risky to part with half your lifespan, than to attempt such a convoluted method of minion-accrual.
