Hmm, but surely there's some way to decipher them? In the anime, the lifespan of a human is just a short sequence of numerical digits floating above their head. While yes, that isn't in a nice year/month/day format, it shouldn't be too difficult to experiment and crack the code when there seems to only be about 100 million different permutations (8 digits seems to be the most anyone has above their head).

Seeing as you can literally set a person's lifespan to a specific number (within the 23 day limit) using your death note, it shouldn't take too many experiments before patterns emerge that let you approximate the amount of lifespan people have left, for some small group whose lifespan numbers luckily match the codes you have deciphered.
