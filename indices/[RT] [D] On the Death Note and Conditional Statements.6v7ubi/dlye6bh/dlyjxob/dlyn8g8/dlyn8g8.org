  Or that path would lead to early deaths, so something goes wrong preventing your plan to send to Mars from ever succeeding. Your assumption is that you can force the person with a long lifespan into a scenario where the seemingly impossible would happen to keep them alive, but it's very possible things go wrong first to prevent that scenario arising under these rules.

Hmm, this actually sounds like an interesting experiment. You could engineer situations where the only possible way for a participant with a long lifespan to survive is for one of two highly improbable events to occur, and look at which event occurs. Presumably, the one that is more probable should happen.

In this manner, you could check the probability of various improbable outcomes, like finding life on Mars, by pitting them against other improbable outcomes, like a continuous series of non-lethal rocket failures.

  Generally just don't assume your plans will work, and don't assume the incredibly powerful pseudo-sentient device can't get mad at you for trying to abuse it.

Sound advice, but if we take this into consideration, then this entire thread is moot since any suggested usage of the Death Note would be countered by saying the Death Note kills you for trying to use it that way.
