Before that, there's one rule of the Death Note that really bothers me:

If the death of the target causes more people to die (because of the extra conditions of death you wrote), the target simply dies of a heart attack (without causing those extra deaths).

That makes no sense to me because of the butterfly effect. The slightest change anywhere is extremely likely to cause a tons of deaths, way down the line. And death is a pretty massive change, since you are literally truncating the timeline of some person. Every thing they would have done after the specified time, all erased. This is the plot of basically every time travel story, you go back and just kill Hitler, and suddenly Nazis own the white house, or Stalin takes over the world, etc etc. Unless the target person is utterly insignificant, like a hermit living in the middle of nowhere, you just can't kill them without causing a lot of additional deaths.

Unless of course... the Death Note has some kind of fate-like power that determines destiny, wiping out the butterfly effect. This might actually be true, after all, owners of death god eyes can see people's lifespans. If Death Notes don't have destiny power, Misa should be seeing the lifespans of people wildly fluctuating all the time, especially when she uses the Death Note. Since she makes no such observation, I assume the Death Note strictly keeps the lifespans of non-targeted humans exactly the same, even if circumstances around them change. They will live even if subjected to lethal conditions and die even if kept on life support and with artificial hearts pumping blood through their bodies.

This brings us to another way of abusing the Death Note, which actually doesn't even need the note, just the eyes: making people with long lifespans do the impossible. For example, you can send someone with a long lifespan on a one-way rocket to Mars with only small supplies of food and oxygen. Since they can't die before their lifespan is up, and the Death Note's destiny power ensures their lifespans don't change, they will inexplicably find food and oxygen on Mars. Maybe by meeting aliens. Maybe by unearthing an underground biome. Don't pack parachutes in the rocket, and make sure to surround the rocket with lots of fragile unprotected humans with long lifespans. That way the rocket can't explode without killing them all, which is impossible since the Death Note's destiny power says they still have lifespan left.
