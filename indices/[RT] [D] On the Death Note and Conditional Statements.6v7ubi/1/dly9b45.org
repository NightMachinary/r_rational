  Can the Death Note reveal facts via its operation? What are the limits of what it can reveal? E.g, "Bob dies of a heart attack if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false." "Bob dies after jotting down a critical insight into proving the Riemann Hypothesis."
