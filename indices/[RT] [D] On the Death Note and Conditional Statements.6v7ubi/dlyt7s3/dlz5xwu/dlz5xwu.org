  1. Man, the Death Note is sure exploitable.
#+end_quote

Given the number of rules and restrictions there are, I'd assume the authors of /Death Note/ much agree with you there!

EDIT: What I mean is that of all the "munchkin this artifact" threads I've seen, the Death Note is the only one for which discussion consistently follows this pattern:

#+begin_quote
  A: Let's try clever idea X!

  B: Doesn't work; rule LXXVIII states that [something-integral-to-X] is disallowed.
#+end_quote

If that's not a compliment to the authors' anti-munchkinry instincts, I don't know what is.
