I'd say "phooey", but the next rule contradicts that:

#+begin_quote
  /If you write die of disease like before with a specific disease's name, but without a specific time, if it takes more than 24 days for the human to die the 23 day rule will not take effect and the human will die at an adequate time depending on the disease./ --- [[http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note#How_to_Use:_XXVIII][How to Use: XXVIII]]
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how to reconcile those... Oh, wait, I already had this discussion! [[/u/696e6372656469626c65][u/696e6372656469626c65]] previously [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/619fo1/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dfdd1lf/][speculated]] that these rules mean the /cause/ of the death must occur within 23 days, i.e. the Death Note can influence reality according to any given entry only within 23 days of this entry's writing.

I model it this way: each entry creates a death spirit capable of manipulating probability with 23-days long lifespan, and with utility function that implores it to carry out the entry.

If we generalize it like this, it should still be possible to implement part of my idea: after all, the drop in crime statistics could be caused by influencing future criminals right now, for them to not commit crimes years later, rather than directly influencing them before crimes are committed. And the roots of a FAI development could be put down within this month, by causing a few researches to come up with a few insights. The tricky part is tying each death to each cause, but it's possible.

But fine, let's assume it's impossible and the exception is only for diseases. I'm thinking we could lock a few people in sterile quarantined facilities, infect them with particular diseases, keep them alive, and stop medical treatment in the future iff certain conditions are met. We then write in the Death Note that these people die of disease, and watch conditions being met.

Would need rather strict precommitments and security systems, so that accidental death is less likely than the fulfilment of our wishes, but it's doable, I think.

*Edit:* Hm, Rule LVII says that the date of death cannot be set after the victim's original lifespan. Okay, so history-manipulation could only be done within this century. It's sad, but it's not a deal-breaker. Also, Rule LVIII confirms that it's possible to lengthen lifespans of people other than the victim.
