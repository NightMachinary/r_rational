  As easiest example, you could try writing, "John Doe dies in year 2430 of heart attack". If John Doe doesn't die in the next seven minutes, then you a) determined that there's a likely-enough way for him to survive until 2430s, and b) ensured that he will live until 2430s. You could add on conditionals, which become less and less unlikely depending on how far into the future you place his death. "... seconds before his mind is uploaded to a computer", "... on a business flight to Jupiter", "... in the capital of the eudemonic transhuman utopia", "... as FAI is taking control of humanity". If any of this is still "too implausible", you just add years. Year 2700? 3232? 5000? 106? Whatever works.

Death note can't have a death that's delayed by more than 23 days:

  How to Use: XXVII

  If you write, die of disease for the cause of death, but only write a specific time of death without the actual name of disease, the human will die from an adequate disease. But the Death Note can only operate within 23 days (in the human calendar). This is called the 23 day rule.
