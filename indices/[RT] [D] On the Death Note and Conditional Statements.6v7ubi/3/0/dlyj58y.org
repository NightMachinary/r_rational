It's not quite that simple. Victims can be made to do even more unlikely things than spell out L's name. For example, write out a whole letter to L from Kira. And, the death note does seem to have unlimited knowledge for determining whether something is possible.

For example, if the Goldbach conjecture is true, it is possible to die while the Goldbach conjecture is true. If it is not true, it is impossible to die while it is. Then, "dies by suicide while the Goldbach conjecture is true" will result in suicide if it is true, or default to a heart attack if it's false.
