Unfortunately, the complete rules for the Death Note ([[http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note][read here]]) more or less rule out variable causes of death based on impossible things. So using different types of death as an n-ary answer system only works for things that are sort of plausible. Finding out whether intelligent aliens exist is right out. However, something like "Bob dies in six minutes, suicide by gunshot, just after writing down a proof of the Goldbach Conjecture," would plausibly work if a) the Goldbach conjecture can be proven true and b) Bob is theoretically capable of doing so, i.e. he's a mathematician whose mental corpus is sufficient to assemble a proof, plus the proof can be written in the time allotted before he's slated to die.
