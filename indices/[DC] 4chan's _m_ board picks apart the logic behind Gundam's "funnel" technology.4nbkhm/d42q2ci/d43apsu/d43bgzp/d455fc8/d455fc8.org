Thank you, yes, that's a typo. It scatters things [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/electromagnetic_spectrum.png][lower than infrared]]. It scatters radio and microwave communications, and makes radar useless. In several shows they used laser comms and optical scanners, but as far as I know they never explicitly mentioned LIDAR.

There are lots of different Gundam shows. I like G Gundam, 08th MS Team, and Turn A Gundam the most. Wing was eh. G no Reconguista was okay. Unicorn is turning out okay.
