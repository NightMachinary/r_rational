The "reasonable" explanation for arms on a spaceship is that it lets you vector all of your thrusters freely, which lets you point your main thrusters in any direction (which means you can carry as many thrusters as you need for your maximum desired acceleration in any direction, rather than separate fixed thrusters for every direction) and use your main thrusters for major attitude control if appropriate (lol). You mount them on lever arms instead of circular tracks basically because levers are mechanically easier to deal with. Mounting them on long levers additionally moves them further out, simultaneously giving you better attitude control giving you more freedom to move your thrusters around without burning your other arms off.

With unlimited materials science and power engineering, the maximum-maneuverability spaceship would be... roughly the shape of your main gun, missile tubes, engineering spaces, whatever else you want to stuff in, with three-plus main thrusters mounted on tentacles with lengths roughly around to the diameter of the sphere, increasing with the number of thruster-tentacle pairs and decreasing with the sphericity of the ship.

These conditions... start to go away as you reach more and more real-world-Tsiolkovsky-limited engagement ranges. If reality encourages year-long missile duels at light-hours of range, then this entire thing goes entirely out the window. If reality encourages laser duels at a tenth of a light-second, then maneuverability becomes paramount.
