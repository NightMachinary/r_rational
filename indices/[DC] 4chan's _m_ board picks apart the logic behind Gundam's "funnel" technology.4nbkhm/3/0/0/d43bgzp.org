Is that a typo, and you meant that they scatter lower than infrared? Higher than ultraviolet would be x-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Lower than ultraviolet would be visible light.

How much of the show happens in space? If it's any reasonable portion of it, then I feel like I could win the setting by putting a bunch of effort into camera optics and computer vision for detection, visible-light comm lasers, and lidar scanners.

At some point I probably should watch some Gundam. I marathoned Gundam Wing one weekend, but it was the weekend after I'd gotten my wisdom teeth out and I don't remember any of it.
