  Is that a typo, and you meant that they scatter lower than infrared?

[[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki:Technology#The_Minovsky_Particle][The wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt *low-frequency* electromagnetic radiation, such as *microwaves and radio waves*. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous electromagnetic pulse on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged.

  How much of the show happens in space?
#+end_quote

Most of the conflicts have separatist space colonies on one side and Earth (plus loyal space colonies) on the other side, so battles usually occur in space, but some may be fought on Earth as well, depending on how well the Spacenoids are doing.

  At some point I probably should watch some Gundam.

Several series are (probably temporarily) available for free, legal viewing [[https://www.youtube.com/user/GundamInfo/playlists][on the official Gundam YouTube channel]]. /[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/SWVAHJ2d9DShI][Gundam SEED]]/ in particular is considered by many to be a modernized retelling of the original series' storyline.
