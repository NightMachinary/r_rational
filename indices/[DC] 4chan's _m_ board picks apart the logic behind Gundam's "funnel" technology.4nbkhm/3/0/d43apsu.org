The Gundam universes have a lot of interesting technologies. Depending on the suit and the era, many mobile suits and large ships are not limited by Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation.

In the Universal Century timeline, and in shows that reboot it, there are Minovsky particles, which are the ultimate chaff. They scatter any frequency of electromagnetic radiation higher than the near ultraviolet, making radar and radio useless, and allowing interesting things with nuclear reactor designs. They're what make Newtypes' collaboration with Bits and Funnels so amazing: it's long-range communication without radio or lasers.

Some shows have autonomous AI-driven mobile dolls - these are almost universally deployed by the bad guys. And because of Minovsky-particle-constrained combat, there's not usually a way to issue a recall order. These are Unfriendly AI.

If you want a realistic hard-sf Gundam show, watch 08th Mobile Suit Team.

If you want ludicrous power, watch G Gundam.

Anything else is in between.
