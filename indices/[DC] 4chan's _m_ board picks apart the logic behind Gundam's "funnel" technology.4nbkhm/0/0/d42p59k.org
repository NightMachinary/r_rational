Wait, this all started because of a retsupurae video. I was not expecting that...

For all the other [[/r/rational]] viewers, take the time to feast your eyes also on:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_1MPYda_KI][Totally reasonable nanomachines]](warning, Metal Gear nanomachines are more reasonable than this).

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXTSx0RvwEM][Absolutely safe deathbed]].

I like to think that the Dahir Insaat videos serve as a good example for cargo cult technology interpretations, but on the other hand they're patent trolls so... heh?
