Oh my god YES. It's not often that I see people pointing out the flaws inherent in mechs. Mainly because I don't go looking for them and people (and me) usually accept mechs as part of the the suspension of disbelief. (I love Macross but hate the mech parts.)

But I have this one friend that will defend the shape and functionality of battle mechs to the death. He'll proclaim that limbs with detachable weaponry provide superior firepower and coverage despite exposing more surface area, having more moving part complexity than a turret. He'll say a human-shaped hand acts as a great way to hot swap modular weapons instead of having universal hardpoint that, I don't know, actually connects the weapon so the vehicle can provide ammo or additional power.

"You can't know that if technological progression will makes mechs viable" he says. MOTHERFUCKER, by definition a mech has unneeded moving parts and extraneous surface area to volume that would reduce the theoretical effectiveness a war vehicle could obtain.

To be fair though, my dislike really only applies to Gundam/Macross style mechs where it tries to mimic the human form unnecessarily combined with long-term hover/flight capabilities. Exoskeletons get a pass because they're working at a human scale. Certain leg-using vehicles get a pass if they're using the leg part for terrain purposes and don't have infinite-hover/fly. Like mechwarrior is fine. They need the legs to traverse terrain, they don't have stupid fingers but actual hardpoints, and usually the cockpit is in the torso without extra random head parts.
