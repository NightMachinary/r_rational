tl;dr (edited for English):

  Just by existing, [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Universal_Century_Weapons#Funnel_and_Bit][the funnel]] disproves the entire military legitimacy of [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Weapon#Mobile_Suit][mobile suits]].

  If you can pack the maneuverability and firepower to kill a mobile suit or a [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Battleship][battleship]] onto something as small as a funnel, then there is no excuse for anything like a mobile suit to exist in the first place. Just build bigger funnels with more room for ammo and fuel, and send them on hunter-killer missions. If you still need [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Newtype][Newtype]] control, you put that Newtype on a battleship protected by lots of armor and cannons, not on a robot he's piloting himself.

  If you don't have the technology for funnels to be practical, they are worthless. If funnels are even remotely viable, then a [[http://homeworld.wikia.com/wiki/Hive_Frigate][Hive Frigate]] setup makes mobile suits laughably obsolete because they can deliver all of the offensive ability of mobile suits from a safe distance at a fraction of the cost.
