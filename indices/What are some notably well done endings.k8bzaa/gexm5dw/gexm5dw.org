Personally I'm a little ticked off that Akoja didn't get a date re-do at the ending of MoL. For that matter, it was a little annoying that she rarely showed up despite the spectacularly well-done failure the two of them had in the beginning, which to be honest was the entire reason I decided to keep reading. MoL was like that- it teased the harem/romance elements but rarely indulged them in a satisfying way. It felt like Novelty got the most screen time on that front. To be fair, there were attempts at closure, but it needed some more attention. Ako's response to Zorian's early delinquent behaviour seemed to set the tone for the whole story to me and felt like it was forgotten too easily. But that's probably just me being weird.

That said I can't say that I care too much about endings. I tend to like stories that attain some "high point" anywhere in it while ignoring all the bad elsewhere.

My favourite rational story (Origin of Species) isn't finished yet, and I can't say I've had any strong feelings about the endings of ones I have finished. HPMOR was a slightly anticlimatic end to a great story. I guess you have to be [[https://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/30rpqn/if_chapter_104_had_been_written_by_someone_much/][someone much stupider]] to end that story well. Metropolitan Man's ending was about the same as the rest of the work, ie. perfectly competent.

For bad endings, I'd say that the worst ending of a great work I've seen was Drunken Angel's pedantic last line, which was something like "Just follow your reason!" It kinda ruined Kurosawa's otherwise-masterpiece. So I guess endings do matter a little.

As for good endings, the most memorable (it seems, because I remember it) was the film Nightmare Alley's rather haunting fate of the protagonist- noir endings are often great, perhaps because there's no incentive to lie about how it went down. The Judas Contract had an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_U4MykT20c][ending]] (obviously spoilers) that I felt made the film. The most objectively well-done ending I've seen has to be Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

It technically doesn't count, but the ending of the Earth: Final Conflict episode [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn8k9rUujdQ]["Atonement"]] (seems to be the full episode, lots of spoilers) is a favourite. "What an inhuman world we live in." -Ronald Sandoval
