This also always bothered me - its not like I wanted MoL to have romantic or friendship arcs per se, but in fact in the text there are multiple times where those arcs are set up, like with Akoja or Tamien, and then just don't go anywhere. Power escalation got precedence over the characters and that is rarely a smart call when those characters had this sort of foreshadowing for interpersonal drama/arcs.
