Are you referring to the fact that I end the spoiler section before the end of the sentence or is there something else I'm missing? I usually like to put spoiler tags on only the spoilery part of the sentence and leave the non-spoilery stuff visible. But given that you're the second person in this thread who has complained about my spoiler formatting I feel like I'm doing that or something else wrong haha
