Quick note on the final question before I have to head off, how detailed the ending to a rational work should be seems like an interesting question. On the one hand, rational work does want detail and specifics, by and large, rather than leaving the reader/watcher/etc with only guesswork for determining features of the world/setting/characters. On the other hand, rational work does encourage characters acting in ways that fits their motivations over what is narratively convenient, so it can be hard to fit in explanations of everything that was going on (on non-essential plot threads mostly) without having to shoehorn them in or just have a character infodump whatever was going on "offscreen". It seems like an interesting balance to have to strike.
