Worm has an incredibly emotional ending, still the first time I vocalize something while reading. (no spoiler: could have been a shocked No! Or a joyous Yes!)

But that's all undercut in the epilogues. My headcanon is that epilogues don't exist and the story ends at the last chapter. It'way better this way.
