If you don't know (and if you're referring to it), the epilogue with Taylor is specifically written to be ambiguous-- it could be showing an afterlife, a coma dream, or it actually happens that she lives a normal life on an alternate Earth. I think it's cathartic to know that Taylor gets some peace though, whatever form it takes, so I personally like it.
