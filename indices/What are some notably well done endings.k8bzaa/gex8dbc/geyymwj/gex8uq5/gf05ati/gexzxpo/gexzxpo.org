I stopped enjoying worm around when clockblocker died. The weaver arc was so half-baked, like one mission and suddenly she's back with the old crew for a kaiju mission. It was very rushed, and wildbow so clearly just didn't want to take the trouble to write up another fun gang with actual interpersonal relations.

Then I started noticing the plot ramifications of wildbow's system of "I roll dice and kill characters randomly" (not a figure of speech, he literally did that). Interesting characters get created and get killed too fast, others have unsatisfying and unresolved plotlines. Cool for an experiment, I guess, but it really rubbed me the wrong way after such a strong first half. Almost felt as if it was only good by chance; one errant dice roll and he'd have killed skitter and then we 'd have to watch him struggle to make bitch into a protagonist or something.
