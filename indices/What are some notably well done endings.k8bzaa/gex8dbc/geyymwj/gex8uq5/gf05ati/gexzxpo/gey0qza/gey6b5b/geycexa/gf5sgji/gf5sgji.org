I've currently caught up on Randidly, and while nowhere near rational it's a good LitRPG in general. The parts in your spoiler text all get revealed/expanded upon in time, like the exact reason of why the society of Tellus is so focused on the spear and eschews every other weapon - you might not like or agree with the reasoning but at least it is consistent with the world the author has built. Also he introspects on his "bad" side like killing off innocents like the guards (and other similar situations in the future) many times in future chapters, and changes his philosophy regarding his goals as a result.\\
Teleportation between worlds is pretty limited actually even if its possible and known to the society at large, although we see more of that in the future chapters and the reasoning of why it's limited.\\
PoV changes happen quite a lot randomly between chapters without being marked as interludes - not just one or two chapters but sometimes multi-chapter arcs as well although never extremely long like the MC's arcs, but till now Randidly has remained the MC and the focus always returns back to him.
