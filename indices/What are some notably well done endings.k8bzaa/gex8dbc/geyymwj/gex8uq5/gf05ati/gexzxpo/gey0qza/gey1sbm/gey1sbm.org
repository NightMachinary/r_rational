Had he let people in ward die... It would have been a better story.

A central theme of worm was that all of these people wore silly costumes and didn't fight to the death with their very destructive power s because the endbringers kept everyone to afraid and the passengers limited the combat.

In Ward, the endbringers are docile, the passengers are uncontrolled, the world has ended... And everyone still wears silly costumes and doesn't fight to the death.

And no one dies or even get injured.

Reading the 18th chainsaw fight where no one gets hurt... There was the woman whos power is making rooms that forcibly rape and impregnate you. She does this to our protagonist who has to pull a patented wildbow body horror growing fetus out of her face...

And then our hero doesn't kill this woman... Her power is literally making rape babies which she has deployed against innocent people .. And wildbow doesn't have his characters kill her when they have the chance... Because ...It's never clear.
