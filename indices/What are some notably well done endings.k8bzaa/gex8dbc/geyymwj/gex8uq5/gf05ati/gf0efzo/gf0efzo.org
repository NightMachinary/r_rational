I actually think Ward is better, but it has a very different story and thematic focus from Worm. Wildbow does a lot better at exploring the internal psychology of his characters in Ward, but worse at consistent worldbuilding and power mechanics. The prose is better, the pacing still lurches aimlessly from villain arc to villain arc. The thing he does where superpowers are a metaphor for trauma doesn't really make sense in either, but in Worm the trauma side doesn't quite fit together, and in Ward the superpowers side gets the short end of the stick.

And while I enjoyed it, I think the whole thing was probably a mistake, as making a sequel that's very different from the original means it'll only be enjoyed by people who like both of those different things. It needlessly narrows the audience that'd enjoy it

I can't help but think it'd be better as a completely separate superhero setting by the same author - it'd still miss a lot of the people who liked Worm, but it'd at least have more of a chance of being read by people who didn't.
