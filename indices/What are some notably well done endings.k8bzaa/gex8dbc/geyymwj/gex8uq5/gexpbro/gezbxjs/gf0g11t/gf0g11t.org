I thought the ending was good, but I'd agree that the second half as a whole is quite a lot worse. Everything from the end of the Slaughterhouse Nine arc (which still goes on too long) to the final final fight is basically filler, minus one notable scene (which gets nowhere near enough breathing room and support in the surrounding text). It all escalates the superpowered pew-pew lasers stuff, but has no impact on Taylor as a character. None of it is even really thematically tied to her overly self-sacrificing, self-oblivious, compartmentalizing self. The final arc manages to tie the explosions into her character flaws while cranking them both up past any reasonable sense of scale, so that's neat.
