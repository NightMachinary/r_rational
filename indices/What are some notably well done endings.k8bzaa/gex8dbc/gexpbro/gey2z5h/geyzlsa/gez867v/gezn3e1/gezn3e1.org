Yes, most people took it at face value. A lot of people hate it though, feel it is too unrealistic. In response, Wildbow has written some contradictory, purposely trollish things about it, to the effect of: "do you really think it's possible to give someone brain surgery with a gun? I'm joking, obviously that's what happened because that's what I wrote. Or am I? Yes, I'm joking. No, I'm not joking." And so on.

My heartfelt opinion about the subject is that authors need to know when shut the fuck up sometimes.
