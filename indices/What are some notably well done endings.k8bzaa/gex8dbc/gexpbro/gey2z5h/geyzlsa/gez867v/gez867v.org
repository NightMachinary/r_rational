Yeah that's what I was talking about. When I read it I didn't think it sounded ambiguous if it was real or not but I would be happy to be wrong about that. I interpreted it as Contessa using her power to determine where to shoot to completely disable Taylor's mutated power, and then smuggling her into one of the parallel dimensions they were cutting their connection to as a form of reward for her contributions in the final battle. Which sounded plausible but a bit too powerful and convenient for me to enjoy it. I'm also not a big fan of coma scenes in fiction, but given Contessa's power it's at least more plausible that she put Taylor in a permanent coma so I guess it kinda works. For me personally I'm content with just removing that part of the epilogue from my head-canon of the story :)
