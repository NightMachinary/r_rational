  wildbow's system of "I roll dice and kill characters randomly"
#+end_quote

He did that exactly once, for the Leviathan fight. Every other character death in the story was chosen on purpose, there were no other dice rolls.

Also, he is on record saying that if he didn't like what the dice said for Leviathan he'd have re-rolled, and if Taylor had died there the next protagonist would have been a Brockton Bay Ward (maybe Aegis if Aegis lived, if not then somebody else).
