I can see this. I just don't know what people would think the themes of any sequel could be. Worm practically hits you over the head about escalation leading to bad outcomes. Maybe as someone who's experienced trauma I think that ward has to be a different type of story and had to confront what healing looks like. I do think that the idea that a sequel can't be different is a bit puzzling, a sequel of more worm would make the first story pointless. The natural follow up to escalation being a bad idea is asking what is, and I think ward does that fairly well. I'm some ways I wonder if the deeper inspection just brought the subtext from worm into just straight text is a change, but I did appreciate actually talking about those problems upfront instead of the normal winks and nods. I was extremely satisfied if it is wasn't clear.

I do get how it's a different type of story and if you enjoyed the wow cool powers it does down play that. It also it's a harder book to follow, if only because Taylor's sense of awareness combined with TT's explanations means that worms action were just inherently clearer than vic in ward. I just didn't feel like worm needed more worm in the end
