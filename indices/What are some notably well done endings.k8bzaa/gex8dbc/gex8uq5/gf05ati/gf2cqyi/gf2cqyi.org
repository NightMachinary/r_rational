Someone did a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gdd7kj/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][long review here on why Ward fell so flat]] and you can't kill it any deader than that. There was also a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gdfrv6/wildbows_ward_the_sequel_to_worm_is_now_complete/][discussion thread]].

The part I can't over is the setting/worldbuilding. If Wildbow wanted to build something new, the possibilities were endless in a post-apocalyptic world..
