I really liked the ending of Waves Arisen. It was a great fight that felt genuinely unwinnable until he pulled out his ultimate move, which had been foreshadowed for a long time . It's genuinely one of the most well earned badass moments in fiction I can think of. Parts of it felt a bit iffy to me namely the Uchiha + Uzumaki bloodline thing, but it was from the canon and I think they also foreshadowed it a bit so it didn't really bother me
