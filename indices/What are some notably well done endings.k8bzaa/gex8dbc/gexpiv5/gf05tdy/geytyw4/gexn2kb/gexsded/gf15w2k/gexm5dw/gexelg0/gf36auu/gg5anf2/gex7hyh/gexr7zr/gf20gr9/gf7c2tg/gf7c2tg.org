I guess thinking the ending of MoL is its worst part is not a popular opinion? MoL got way too big in its scope for its capacity by the end, as new actors and new powers were just being thrown on top of each other with much less foundation than in earlier sections, so the action sequences were just a lot of shiny stuff coming off the page. Red Robe turns out to be...this guy the protagonist has never met before? Who was a lawyer once? Uh neat I guess, shocking reveal it was not. And most importantly, characters arcs are there but are given minimal room to breathe - in particular the epilogue spending no time on the main duo's actual post-plot life seems like a misstep. Note that "worst" isn't "bad", it had its moments and maintained its consistency, but I definitely thought the seams were showing at that point.
