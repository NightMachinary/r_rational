The manga and anime /Kanata no Astra/ has a really neat and well self-contained story. It starts in a futuristic setting with a group of kids leaving for some kind of survival camp on another planet and, because of a mysterious accident, finding themselves orbiting another world thousands of light years away. It goes on to follow these kids' trip to return home through multiple alien worlds with decently creative (if not very realistic) biospheres, all the while slowly unraveling the mystery behind their accident.

It's not perfect, but the amount of details and foreshadowing that go towards building the ending is still impressive. There's a number of things starting from episode 1 that will likely make you go "haha but that doesn't make sense!" and will turn out to be actually very purposeful later on. Fair warning though, it's a very optimistic and upbeat story overall, sometimes to the point of stretching disbelief a bit. But it'll give you a lot of fun and likely leave you with a smile on your face. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vfN190quJI][Here's the trailer]].

And by the way, since the anime is made by studio Lerche, that makes me think about /another/ very optimistic series they made about a group of kids overcoming great difficulties together, /Assassination Classroom/. That one too had a great ending, though in that case it was less from an intellectual point of view (that show's lore doesn't make much sense) and more in terms of emotional payoff.
