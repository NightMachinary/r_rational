I mean I'm not expecting Akoja to go /Zorian no baka!/ but its a little annoying when Novelty makes Zorian depressed all the time while Akoja's traumatic first loop ending is barely remembered for his character development. You would think that being not-so-subtly told that you're a resentful and rude idiot /please be nice to me/ right before you fail to save anyone would be a significant memory as Zorian slowly realizes that, yes, he was an idiot. Its a great story anyways but you just don't do that to such a sympathetic pair.
