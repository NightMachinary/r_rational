I would agree with the realism, I just think narratively it lacked payoff - and its all about how a story is constructed. Its fine for someone's secret identity to not be a Big Reveal, but the story put a lot of groundwork into making it the Big Mystery (many sections spent on the puzzle and the speculation), so you are expecting said reveal. Of course given the story as is there wasn't going to be a satisfying candidate - you would have to rewrite the story itself in notable ways to make it work. It was a structural problem with the story that revealed itself at the end, as it were.
