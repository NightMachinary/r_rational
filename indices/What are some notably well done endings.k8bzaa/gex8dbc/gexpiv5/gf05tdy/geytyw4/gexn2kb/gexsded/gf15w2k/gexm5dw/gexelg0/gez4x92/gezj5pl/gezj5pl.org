There's like 3 works of fiction online with the name Chrysalis, the one you're talking about, the ant one on royalroad and the genocidal space ai one on HFY.

The space one i was talking about starts with the ai attempting revenge on an alien empire and ends the story with the MC reconciling itself with the idea of forgiveness.
