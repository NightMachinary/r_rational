The TV show Leverage has an excellent ending. Emotionally satisfying, touches all the top beats of the story in order to provoke nostalgia, and brings in major secondary characters to wrap their lines up as well.

In related news, there is going to be a Leverage 2.0 series that continues where the first one left off! [[https://leverage.fandom.com/wiki/Leverage_2.0]]
