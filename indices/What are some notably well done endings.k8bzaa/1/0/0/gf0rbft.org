Hm, while I tend to think Unsong was only an okay book overall, I'm curious as to what parts you thought were poorly explained. I can definitely see how if you aren't well-versed in Old Testament stuff (and I'm not either!), many of vignettes can seem random and wacky, but I never felt like I lost the plot as to what was happening. Although the plot does still leave a bit to be desired
