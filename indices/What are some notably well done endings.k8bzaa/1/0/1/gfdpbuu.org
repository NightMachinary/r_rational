If I may suggest, most of my knowledge that allowed me to enjoy that book came from /another/ novel, one you could also arguably call rational: Umberto Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum". It's a great send up of conspiracy theories of all sorts that also works double as a compilation of esoteric and kabbalistic knowledge. The story is basically centred around this conceit: three rather geeky (in the humanities/history sense) friends work for a vanity publisher that makes money off deluded cranks who write books about magic, Templars, freemasons and so on. One day, some guy shows up to them with a small scrap of medieval parchment that could literally be anything, but through high level mental hoops, he interpreted as a fragment of a secret message passed between an order scheming for centuries to take over the world. They don't believe in it of course, but they take it as a challenge to actually build a /truly/ believable conspiracy theory around that fragment and spanning the entirety of medieval and modern European history. Cue hundreds of pages that are just them literally geeking out over the tiniest fucking details as they basically plan out historical fanfiction. That's it, that's the novel (ok, there's a little more plot than this but I won't spoil it). It's ridiculously niche and something that I don't think I've ever heard anyone else outside of me managing to finish, let alone enjoy, but personally I love it. The gematriah? Heard about it there. Using computers to recombine letters and find the Names of God? That book did it. The Tree of Life and the sephiroths? You bet. I learned so many tidbits of obscure lore from that book it's ridiculous.
