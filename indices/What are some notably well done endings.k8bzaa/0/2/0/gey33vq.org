I mean, I haven't read Ward apart from the very beginning but the end is not really that cut and dry. The "obvious" interpretation is that Taylor has gone to another Earth, but you could also see it as she being dead and going to some kind of afterlife, she being in a coma and all of that being some kind of delusion or some other thing. IMO, the ending itself can be whatever you prefer
