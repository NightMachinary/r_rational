Talking about a protagonist swap...

I was reading the Legend of Randidly Ghosthound, which is not the greatest LitRPG ever, but was mildly interesting, though very very strange in some parts. At any rate, not seemingly at a "book" boundary, the PoV character changes along with a large timeskip. I didn't get the sense that the protag's story was over or anything like that, it just stopped in the middle of him traveling to another location. Some plot points were resolved, others still open. Possibly an unrequited love story too. And then the next chapter is some completely different character who hasn't been previously introduced, and it turns out there is a large timeskip as well.

Spoilers for the part I did read: So some of the things in that story bothered me. Mostly you could consider the protag a "good guy", but then he cold-blooded murders a caravan guard to go to prison, because the prison itself is a good training ground. Up until that point, sure he had defended himself from attack, and had indeed killed people. But not murdered anyone. I found that very strange. And to have an entire society devoted to... spear fighting. OK, so a magical society with poor technological development is a common trope, but they even know of other weapons and other fighting styles, but they just don't care. Also, I'd think that being able to teleport between worlds would have much more impact on society.
