Endings are incredibly important. It's where the story is forced to stick the landing, stumble or fail utterly.

Personally I didn't give Chainsaw Man much attention past the bombgirl arc, because the author's previous work, Fire Punch, taught me not to trust the guy. I might give it another shot now that it's over, but all the manga I've read that ended this year have had terrible rushed endings. Then again, maybe Fire Punch would've benefitted from getting cut short.

I personally don't think it's the ending's job to tie every plot thread together. That's just a responsibility that ends up there because it's where all of the expectations end up after being kicked down the road. Ideally, stories should reach their endings with little baggage, though I do think it's impressive when a story manages to wrap everything up right at the very end (I wouldn't risk it, though).

Read Hoshi no Samidare if you haven't.
