Someone's mentioned Unsong, and that is probably the gold standard for web serials.

Lois McMaster Bujold has written n>0 books of rational fiction (Falling Free) and every single book in the Vor or Chalion setting with the exception of one of the Penric novellas has a satisfying ending with real closure.

(What? Recommending Bujold? Who, me? Yeah, I'm a bit of a stopped clock.)
