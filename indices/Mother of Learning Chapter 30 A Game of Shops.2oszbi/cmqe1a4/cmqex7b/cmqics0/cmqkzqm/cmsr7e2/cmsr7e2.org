While I generally agree with the Chekhov's Gun principle, truthfully, it has its own drawbacks. The one I always think of is that it gives way too much information to the reader if used. If nothing ever described in a book is random, an unimportant generic detail or just colorful imagery, then you can be /sure/ that everything has some meaning to it, some relevance to the general plot. In real life, you can't just guess that a random meeting with some stranger on the way somewhere is important just because you paid enough attention to it to describe it. It skews expectations unrealistically and leads to reading too much into every insignificant detail.
