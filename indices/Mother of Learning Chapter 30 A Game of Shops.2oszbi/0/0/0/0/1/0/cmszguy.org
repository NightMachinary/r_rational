Well, the larger point I'm trying to make is that everything that's in the book should be there by intent. The author should be trying to /say/ something. There's a whole lot more to writing that just plot, there's characterization and spectacle and a bunch of other things. If you put a sentence down on the page, that sentence should have some reason for being there. If there's a scene, that scene should reveal /something/ to us. It doesn't have to be plot - it can be there to show what a character's motivations are, or their value system, or it can be exposition, but it really should have a purpose to it, and ideally it should serve multiple purposes.

My problem with /Mother of Learning/ is that quite a lot of the time it's not doing enough work with its prose, and I think that's why it can sometimes seem like it's moving slowly. But I fully expect people to disagree with that assessment.
