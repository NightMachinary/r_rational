Thanks for the reply. That's really interesting and I actually agree. I also think you're right that that's a very fanfiction-y quality and that its effects depend on the reader. A lot of readers don't mind fluff, or even like it, since part of the point of reading fanfiction is (I think) wasting time and spending time with characters.

The Vonnegut quote reminds me of the Lesswrong meme about every movement needing to cut the enemy, or every step of reasoning needing to cut towards the truth, only applied to fiction.
