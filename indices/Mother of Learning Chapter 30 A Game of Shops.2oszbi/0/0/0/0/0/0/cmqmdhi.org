It's certainly possible that he'll come back to it - that's one of the major problems with making commentary on a work in progress, because it might be that the girl and her bicycle are somehow vital to the plot and I'll have egg on my face.

A few times when I was reading the early parts, I thought that he was setting things up for "one perfect day", which is how Groundhog's Day ended. But I'm not sure that's going to happen now, what with people changing the timeline around from the outside, and some sort of pressure being placed on him that prevents trying over and over until he gets it right. And anyway, we've gotten far enough along that most people won't clearly remember the early chapters where that setup was, so even if it's a more conventional sort of Chekov's Gun, I'm not sure that it will elicit more than a "Oh, right, that" from the audience.
