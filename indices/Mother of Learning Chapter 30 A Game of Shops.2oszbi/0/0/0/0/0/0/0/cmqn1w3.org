Well, that bridge and the girl were mentioned again in Chapter 12, and it's about halfway trough the story so far.

So I overall agree with your point that the story is too stretched out in places, but I think you've chosen a poor exaple for it. That scene is too pointless to be meaningless, there's got to be more to it :)
