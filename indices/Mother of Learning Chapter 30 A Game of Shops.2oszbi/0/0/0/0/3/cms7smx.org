  The first chapter spends a few hundred words on Zorian helping a girl to get her bike out of the water, and I just cannot figure out the point of that.
#+end_quote

It is the first scene of impressive magic by Zorian and it sets up for the later mention in one of the restarts where he checks if anyone else fished it out and some cat sadly looks and gives him the creeps. The first message is that despite his antisocial character he is a good person while the second one shows us how him making minor different choices in subsequent restarts and not letting the happenstances of normal live guide him have repercussions that are minor to him but very major to random "bystanders" who in truth have their own lives that are just as important to them. In this particular case the fact that he now knows beforehand that the bridge is blocked leads to endlessly repeating cycles of a little girl receiving no help. And if I got the undertones right she may well have tried to get it on her own and drowned, which is why her little kitty is sadly looking at where it lost its owner.

Or that is how I understood that scene.

In general though I actually /like/ when mundane parts of a character's life are described. It gives a feel of the character's life which in many stories seems unrealistically focused and action packed. This way of writing makes you feel like you reason and grow alongside the character. It also avoids readers trying to predict everything by judging the various "guns" laying around, which is something that plagues DMs especially. You describe a tower in the background being white and the players immediately want to go explore it because they expect treasure there.
