I have to issue a few caveats first: my own writing is imperfect, I'm not an expert storyteller, various people subscribe to various schools of thought on the subject of the written word, and I do actually like /Mother of Learning/ in spite of what I see as its problems.

One of Kurt Vonnegut's best pieces of advice on writing was "If a sentence, no matter how excellent, does not illuminate your subject in some new and useful way, scratch it out." There's a trap that writers fall into quite often where they're just writing without doing the primary things that a piece of writing should be doing, like adding to characterization or advancing the plot.

It's pretty easy to just write a paragraph about how someone is getting his mail because you think that's what the character would do on a Tuesday morning. So you write about how he walked down the stairs, you write about how he found the small key on his key ring and opened up the mailbox that was stuck in with all the others, how he looked through everything that he'd gotten and threw away the junk ... and you know what's easier than that? "John got the mail." And if the mail isn't revealing something to us about John - the medical bills that let us know he's got cancer, the forlorn sigh when there's no letter from his pen pal, an invitation to wizarding school - then there's no point to the scene, and it should be cut.

/Mother of Learning/ is full of those scenes. The first chapter spends a few hundred words on Zorian helping a girl to get her bike out of the water, and I just cannot figure out the point of that. If it's to let us know that Zorian can levitate things, there are a lot better ways to accomplish that goal. If it's to tell us something about Zorian, it doesn't really do that either, and again, there are better ways of doing that. The whole story has a lot of passages like that, and that's why editors are so lovely. An editor would ask what the purpose of the scene was, and once they'd been told, they would help to make that scene more effective (or they'd cut it). Anton Chekov also gave this advice, by the way: "If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there." That's a pretty extreme way to put it, and I wouldn't go quite that far, but you do need to think about why you're including details.

It's really easy to fall into the trap of just /writing/ without thinking about what your purpose is. Writing is imaginative, and you can pretty seamlessly slip into narrating your imagination. The problem is that unless your imagination is really tuned to creating narratives, you're probably not going to end up with great prose, even if you've got a good story. A lot of the chapters could have 20-30% of their words cut, sometimes more, with nothing of value lost, and the piece would be better for it.

*tl;dr* Yeah, it's mostly the slowness, but the slowness is a symptom of writing that's more focused on simulation of the world than stimulation of the reader. (And yes, I get the irony of using so many words to say what can be said in a single sentence.)
