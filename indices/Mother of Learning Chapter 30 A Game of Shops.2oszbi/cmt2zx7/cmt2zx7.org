I'm not sure if this has been mentioned before, but the name Knyazov Dveri has been looking suspicious to me for a while. After taking a moment to ponder what was bugging me, I realized all the letters of the name Zorian are contained in Knyazov Dveri. It could be a cooincidence, but I'm wondering if it might indicate there could be a message contained in the names of locations, which could imply all sorts of things.
