I know you're not being serious, but that gave me chills. How self-absorbed and self-righteous would a person have to be, to think that they are that much more intelligent and moral than the average? That even accounting for the losses in the system, it'd still be better for the world than working in charity /yourself/ and letting everyone else spend their money how they feel it should be spent - because the general, irrational public is just /so/ irrational and /so/ immoral and /so/ far beyond help that they shouldn't be allowed to make spending decisions that affect the world? And you /can/ make those decisions, because you're far more intelligent than everyone else?

I've always thought the textbook description of a utility monster was unrealistic, and now I've found the example I was missing.

But just in case you're actually thinking of doing this: making a profitable company from scratch is far from trivial. Behind every billion-dollar Farmville and Candy Crush there's ten thousand games that barely recouped development costs and a million games that crashed and burned. Even if you think you've got a brilliant revolutionary idea that can't possibly fail... well, that describes half of Silicon Valley, and most of their startups still don't work.
