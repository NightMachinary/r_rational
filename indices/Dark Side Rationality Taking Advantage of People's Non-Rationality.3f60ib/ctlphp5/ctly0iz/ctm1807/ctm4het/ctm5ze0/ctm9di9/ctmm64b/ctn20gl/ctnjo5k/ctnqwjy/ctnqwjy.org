  Do you not think it plausible that someone might see enough evidence of their intelligence and altruism relative to others' that they can be confident in the statement that they are "much more intelligent and moral than the average"?

No, I really don't. Rationality is not about being better than everyone else, it's about recognising and overcoming one's cognitive biases. And several of those biases are actively pushing in the direction of "you're better than everyone else" - the Dunning-Kruger effect, the bias blind spot, the way your own moral code is the standard by which you judge everyone else's so by definition you'll always be the most moral person, etc.

The wisest man is the one who knows he knows nothing, and the easiest way to lose your rationality is to assume that you've got it.

Anyway, the number of people who could actually be a truly benevolent dictator is massively less than the number of people who could become an evil but misled dictator, to the point that even if you've spent a long time self-reflecting and analysing your motivations it's still more likely that you're in the second group. And even if you're not... is it worth sending the message that taking over people's lives for them is OK, as long as you're more moral than them? Do we want scientologists and creationists to take home that lesson?
