  Every skill worth the name ought to be able to be leveraged into some or other variety of benefit, and at the end of the day, every competition is a zero-sum one.

I don't see how this is true. A zero-sum game is one in which the gains and losses of all the players are balanced against each other. If you and I both go hunting a single deer, only one of us can get it ... but at the end of our competition, one of us /does/ have a deer, and the sums of our gains and losses are not zero (because you have not "lost" a deer).

Or perhaps as a better example, you and I enter into a pie-baking contest. Both of us will have gained (by at least one pie) at the end.
