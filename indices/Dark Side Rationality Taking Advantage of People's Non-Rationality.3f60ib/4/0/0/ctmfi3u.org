There are differences, but in both cases the victims have been fooled into engaging in a contest that is either unwinnable, or has an extraordinarily low probability of winning decisively.

'Winning' is a practically unattainable goal, but a lot of people will see the goal and not understand the impracticality of it.

A sufficiently unscrupulous rational individual can implement 'entertainment' that will attract irrational people who are attracted to winning.

Is there a functional difference between a tiny chance of winning and no chance of winning?

No, not for most individuals. Most 'winners' of games of chance end up losing more than they win before they are 'lucky' and win big. Occasionally, some newbie gambler will win big after just a few hands or a few slots, but that's rare. It has to be. If it wasn't, the house would lose money.

The game specifically referred to is simply a gambling operation with no way to win /against the house/. You can still win /against other players/.

A lot like poker.
