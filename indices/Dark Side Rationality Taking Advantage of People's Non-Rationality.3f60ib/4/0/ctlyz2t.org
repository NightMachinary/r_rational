There's some differences, though. Take a look at, for example, blackjack:

- Pay to play; you know you're spending money if you sit down
- Can win money, and the money comes from the house
- Players don't interact [1], and can't gain or lose money from/to each other
- Can leave at any time, no consequences
- When you leave, you keep all your money and whatever you've won from the house.

Now look at the linked game:

- Sit down for free, but lures you into spending money
- Can't win
- Continually interact with other players by costing them money
- Can't leave without cost
- When you leave, you steadily lose all the money you've put in

The house's money is never at risk, and the player can only lose, not win or break even. Furthermore, players are directly pitted against one another to make each other lose faster.

[1] Technically blackjack players interact to the effect that if I take a card then the next person gets a different card. That's not generally relevant, though.
