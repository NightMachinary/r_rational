I won't speak for daydev, but one argument that could be raised is: munchkining magic systems doesn't hurt anyone. Munchkining evolutionary bugs actually does hurt people -- for example, in the linked article you'll see that gamers spent thousands of dollars on the game. That money could have been used to help a lot of people, but instead it was spent on virtual goods that were then destroyed; if people had skipped playing the game and just set a giant stack of money on fire the result would have been /less/ harmful, because the opportunity costs wouldn't have been paid.
