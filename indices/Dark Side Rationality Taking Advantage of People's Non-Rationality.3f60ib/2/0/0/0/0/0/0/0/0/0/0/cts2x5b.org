There are various methods to accomplish that though. There's definitely a case for exploiting irrationality to make money and then using that money to promote rational thought in some concrete manner that I can't think of. Hell, even if you do it and just keep the money you're disincentivising irrationality.

As far as bad PR goes, as long as the people engaging in 'unwholesome' applications of rationality don't proclaim themselves rationalists then I'm not sure I see much of a problem. Anyone who manages to connect the dots enough to realise they're rationalists is probably something of a rationalist themselves.
