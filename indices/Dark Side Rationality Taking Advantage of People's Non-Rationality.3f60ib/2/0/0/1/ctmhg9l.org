Well, rationality presumes that we should "rise above" our flawed biological hardware. So it's kind of hypocritical to pronounce that everyone should overcome the evolutionary bugs, but in the meantime take advantage of those who haven't.

And it's "not fair" precisely because they are bugs. It's like hacking computer systems. It may be fun as intellectual exercise, but if you then proceed to steal people's money through hacked systems, you're a crook. So pranks for fun may be OK, but cons for money are not, and this kind of freemium is almost an industrialized con. It's not exactly the same, since you're actually getting what you're paying for, but they arrange the system to suck you into paying for things you never would've wanted to pay otherwise. It's like middle ground between extremely aggressive marketing and cons.

Also, as eaglejar said, you can't hurt the universe by exploiting its rules to get an advantage. But you can hurt people by exploiting their wiring to get and advantage.
