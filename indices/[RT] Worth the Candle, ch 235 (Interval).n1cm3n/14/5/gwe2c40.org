One thing that kind of threw me, but possibly deliberately:

#+begin_quote
  There was a sound of a gunshot, then a second, and then the woman was shot twice in the chest. The camera held on her as she groaned and bled out. In the distance, footsteps were heard beating a retreat.
#+end_quote

I thought the above described two gunshots, how the scene then cuts to the woman, a sole victim. But then later this is followed by

#+begin_quote
  It turned out to be a story of revenge. The guy in the apartment at the start, the one who'd got shot
#+end_quote

They were /both/ shot? Were four shots fired? But even having formed that hypothesis I am confused.

If the missing piece is another instance of Midwestern cultural commentary, it went by a bit too quickly to quite let me think I'd solved the puzzle.
