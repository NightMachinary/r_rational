I bet that's looked down upon like... torture is here. Imagine the common demon who'll never spend more than few hours torturing every few years hearing this. It's bad that the elite is hoarding all the mortals but this! Absolutely horrible, it would hurt them on a physiological level. Other states/fiefs would accuse eachother of selfishly refraining from torture. It'd be like Guantanamo Bay.
