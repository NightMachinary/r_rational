Yeah, Amaryllis loves to shit-talk the Dorises, but I think a lot of people would eventually crumble in a similar situation. Mary is pretty unique in how single-minded and dedicated to a cause she can be.

Other people might not crumble as fast, or might not be as bad (less prone to back-stabbing, at least when dealing with outsiders; less slavery; etc.), but it really is something a natural consequence of the particulars of the magic.

They talk a bit about how a functioning person would need to have people do each role, but like, I would hate to be the clone assigned to be a doctor or firefighter or plumber. I definitely relate to those clone stories, where the clone is like "well, why do /I/ have to be the one to go to school?"
