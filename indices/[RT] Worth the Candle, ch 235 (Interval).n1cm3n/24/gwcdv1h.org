  The Dorises had gotten their collective act together. There were, apparently, a few factors involved in that, but the biggest thing that had happened was that resource scarcity had been virtually eliminated. Grak could, apparently, set up a ward that would prevent duplication of a Doris, but not her things, and these had been set up in public places all around the zone, enough so that a Doris could duplicate her possessions once or twice a day.

Oh.

I'm a bit disappointed. I thought Mary was going for a social solution to the Doris problem. Something like, having rules against spontaneous cloning on pain of death, permanent surveillance and enforcement through Blood God Doris, using sedatives to allow them to farm-duplicate without feeling like their life is in danger, etc.

Having a "no more resource scarcity" ward feels like kind of a copout, even if it's plausible given the powers at the characters' disposal. I wish they'd had to solve it using the same means Doris had at her disposal, by coordinating better.

  She nodded. “Two of them were,” she let out a breath. “Lovers. It was utter narcissism.” She blushed slightly at the memory, then paled. The muscle in her cheek went taut. “I didn't manage to convince them. They didn't think that I would have the same love for myself as they had for each other. They argued that they could be just as effective without merging. I just merged them anyway.”

/Now/ you're Doris Finch.

Seriously though. Mary, what the fuck?

  “And ... you're okay?”

  She reached over and threaded her fingers through mine. “The world is coming to an end, but for the first time, I feel like we're back on track.”

That's not a yes.

It feels like, of the companions, Mary is easily the one who suffered most from the timeskip.

She feels closer to snapping than she ever has so far in the story.
