Everyone else is replying about the resource scarcity thing and I just wanna chime in that what Mary did to her clones is super fucked up. At that point, they're basically individuals, and she murdered them. Or worse? It's very not okay.

It also reminds me of the book House of Suns, what with the whole “we are separated clones of someone who have fallen in love” thing.
