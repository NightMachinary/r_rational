A person is not merely the sum of their memories. There's also motivations and a body to pursue them with. The clones had their own goals that diverged from Mary's, and now they're no longer free to pursue them. You could claim that those motivations are still present, somewhere inside her psyche, but they've clearly been drowned out by the rest. She finds them abhorrent now, and the clones no longer have the option to engage in a physical and emotional relationship with each other.

  If a clone is "murdered" because they get all the other memories added to theirs, then Amaryllis is committing suicide every time she does it.

No, that's Amaryllis killing them all those times, it just isn't murder because they all usually consent to it (meaning it's suicide from their perspective), except in this case.
