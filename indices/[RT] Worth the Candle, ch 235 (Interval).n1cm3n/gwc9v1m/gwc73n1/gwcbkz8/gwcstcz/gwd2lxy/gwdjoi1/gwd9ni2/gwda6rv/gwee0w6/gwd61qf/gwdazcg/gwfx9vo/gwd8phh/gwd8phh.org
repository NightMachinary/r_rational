I enjoyed this peak behind the curtain. I think one thing that's hard to deal with is how in a serial, we might build up ideas of some of these plots in our head only to see them skipped. I think the Doris finch bit was one of the best, but to some degree it begs the question “oh what will glass land be like”

Less details in the quest prompts that won't be fulfilled might make that easier to accept.
