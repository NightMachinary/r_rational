Ironically, both of these two issues you mention are a common problem when DMing. Namely, giving the players too much options and power, and more importantly, managing to balance the main hook between "you have no urgency at all to proceed to with the plot and can meander for months of real time" and "you must beeline to this threat and don't have time to explore anything you find interesting".

Nice hearing your thoughts, even when pulling back the curtain must go against your natural instincts. Since it dawns to me that the only two comments I've made to this work were critical (plus a pun) I'll add that it is a great ride and the idea space has been extremely refreshing. Particularly enjoyed memes, antimemes, Harold, couch potato, unicorn magic, the Outer Reaches, and everything in the infinite library. The list goes on.
