Some of this is, yes, stuff that an editor would probably fix, but the way an editor would be likely to fix it would be to hack at the upstream stuff from (literally) a million words ago. If I could make two major changes to the story, which are basically impossible to do without so much editing and rewriting it would take another year or two of my life, they would be:

1. Less magics available to Juniper, maybe a hard cap of ... five or so. This would unfortunately preclude some stuff that I liked, including a few chapters of magical exploration, but it would cut things down to a more manageable size.
2. More time/outside pressure to force a reason not to go on a ton of side quests.

But a large part of the problem, which started /way/ upstream of all this, is one of the core conceits of the work, which is that there's a honking big world with a vast number of magics and species and adventures to go on, a world that might not be infinite, but could be twenty seasons of a TV show. I wanted it to feel like it was dozens of D&D campaigns mashed together, or fifty splat books, or a hundred mods added onto a videogame, and while I think it largely succeeds in that feeling, it creates some problems, namely that a lot of the stuff Juniper does is stuff that Juniper would necessarily do given the facts as presented in the story. The choice then is:

1. Skip over them, and hope the audience doesn't notice.
2. Do them entirely off-screen.
3. Do them on-screen, in brief.
4. Retroactively edit them out.
5. Do them in full, even if it screws with the pacing and you don't really have anything to "say".

WtC does a combination of these, largely with the exception of the first one, which I think is particularly bad. The best way to handle them, in my opinion, is the retroactive edit, but in a work of serial fiction, especially one of this length, that's not really that feasible (and I don't really think that I've ever seen it done, not at the scale it would need to be done here).

A lot of the pacing that feels like the overpowered party is going through a checklist of things they can easily do for some reward before they do what they think is the final quest is ... because that's what they're doing, in-universe. I unfortunately don't think that's really enough to justify it, though I /have/ been mostly enjoying it on a scene-by-scene level ... mostly.

(I also don't love the idea of time pressure forcing a premature end, because in my mind, part of the metanarrative is there as a counterpoint or complement to one of the central themes of suicide. They want to get to the end of it all because the thought of this going on forever is intolerable in various ways. Having the ending forced on them through outside forces is counter to that in a way that I really don't like. Even now, with the events of this chapter, at least the decision is largely as a result of one character's actions, which thematically fits better. Not that it's a /clean/ theme, but I do like my messy themes.)

*tl:dr; Mostly agree, and it's been a reason writing was slower for a bit, and I'd do it differently in the future, but I'm still more-or-less happy with the work given some of the unfortunate constraints I placed it under and some of the hard-to-execute things I've been dumb enough to try executing.*

(This is more than I usually say about writing, hopefully it's not too much. Once WtC is done, I'll have a post mortem that goes more in-depth about what I thought worked and what I felt didn't, and why.)
