I think it goes back to something Joon said before to her about the first attempt: at a certain point you're fooling yourself if you think you're going to just attain enough power to beat Fel Seed that way. They aren't going back because they feel stronger. They're going back because of the combination of so many things simultaneously going bad on Aerb at once as well as feeling like it makes sense narratively. They're banking on the narrative giving them a win this time, or at least a chance to actually get through the door this time. Because if they don't have a shot through the narrative helping them, then they don't have a shot at all. Because Fel Seed cheats.

Also, all this could be moot, because the plan hasn't actually been discussed yet, and it could start with a quick run to finish her quest before heading to Fel Seed
