Yeah. As I was reading that I was thinking it would have made a great arc to see told from her perspective, a la the Wards arc in Worm. It happened at the end of the timeskip so it could have gotten us fully up to speed on everything that's changed and then launched into her trip to p-space. I would have loved to see how she's changed from the vantage point of her own headspace, how she's handled being without Juniper, her own reflections on herself, etc.
