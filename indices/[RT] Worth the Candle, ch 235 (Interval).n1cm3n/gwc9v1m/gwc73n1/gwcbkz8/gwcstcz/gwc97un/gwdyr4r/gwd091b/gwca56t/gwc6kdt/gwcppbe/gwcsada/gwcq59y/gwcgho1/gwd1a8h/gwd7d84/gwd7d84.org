This was /almost/ how it was written. Juniper dies, then some certain number of chapters from Amaryllis and maybe the others about how they're coping and what they're thinking, some more "pushing on after the death of a loved one" stuff that would be thematically appropriate, solo or group adventures, socialization between party members of characterizing opportunities with either their own narration of things or their interactions absent Juniper (or both) ... I think I /probably/ could have made it work, but it risked going against what I'd been building towards, and it would have taken a lot of words.
