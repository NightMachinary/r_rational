Valencia's arc is extremely reminiscent of Tenar from Earthsea. Especially if you count Tehanu. I prefer to pretend the story stops at the first 3 myself. Granted [[/u/alexanderwales]] might not have intended the parallel but from my perspective I expected most of her arc, disliking it mildly the whole time, and it really is a strong correlation. As soon as Joon decided not to actively pursue a key for 7 locks it was clear Valencia would always remain a side character/deus ex machina. Basically as soon as the first mention of her and Jorge.
