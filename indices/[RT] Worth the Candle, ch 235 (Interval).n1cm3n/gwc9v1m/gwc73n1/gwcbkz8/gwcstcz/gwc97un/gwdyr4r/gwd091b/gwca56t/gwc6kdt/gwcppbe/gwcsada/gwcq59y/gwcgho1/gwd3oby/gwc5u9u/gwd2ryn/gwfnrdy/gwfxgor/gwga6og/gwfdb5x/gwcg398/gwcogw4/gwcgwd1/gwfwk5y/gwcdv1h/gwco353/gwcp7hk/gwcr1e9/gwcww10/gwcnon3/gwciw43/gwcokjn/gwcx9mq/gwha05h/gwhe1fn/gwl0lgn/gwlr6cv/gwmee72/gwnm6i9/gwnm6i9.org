I am not in favor of forced merging, but it does not seem particularly abhorrent.\\
A clone was given a body, a mind, and memories. In return, they are expected to share their new memories, and accept other's memories. They are not slaves or automatons.

If later a clone decided to renege on the agreement, I think Primaryllis has some moral authority to enforce the agreement.

As far as the initial agreement, it was made with full informed consent, because at the moment of clone creation, both sides were effectively Primaryllis who was informed and consented.
