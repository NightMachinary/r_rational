Eh, I think the Fel Seed walk-up well exceeds what Juniper hypothetically opted into. Also the Bethel rape. Dude hasn't been having a benevolent god-crafted experience.

Unless you're suggesting Juniper is god and really, really bad at it. Like, original timeline Juniper continued to spiral into depression, became a bigger asshole throughout adulthood, somehow became a god, then copied his high school self and tried to subject him to a "learning experience" with a "reasonable level" of pain and suffering.
