That's why I specified isolated communities that still have to grapple with the environment on their own. Not some kind of integrated hell hotel where Infernals suffer as human servants.

Infernals know that there are billions of souls not getting tortured every day. And lately they didn't even end up tortured after death. If the mere fact of souls living a mediocre life is torture to them then they are already in constant suffering if they can't afford a human or live in weird and isolated cults that deny the existence of a beforelife.
