I understand what you are saying. If there is no implied contract, that is absolutely true.

If you ask me to sing a song for you, and I change my mind and retract my consent, you should not coerce me.

But what if we agree that I will sing a song if you buy me dinner, and after dinner I change my mind? Is that retracted consent, or violation of contract?
