That's a very good question. The initial plan was already extremely questionable, it feels like they're going at this under-prepared.

On the other hand, they've had a look at the door now. If they can figure out the password ahead of time, they only need to survive Fel Seed for 20 seconds instead of having to solve a riddle while being butchered.

(on a similar note, it's very unclear how going past the door and finding Uther will help them solve the threats facing Aerb; they assume that the end of the game will somehow give Joon god-like power, but it's not like Arthur/Uther will go "Hi Juniper! Here's an entad that makes you omnipotent that I've been sitting on for centuries for no reason!"; at least, there's a chance that bringing back Uther would help them fight the other threats, but there's no guarantee it'll be an automatic win aside from story logic)
