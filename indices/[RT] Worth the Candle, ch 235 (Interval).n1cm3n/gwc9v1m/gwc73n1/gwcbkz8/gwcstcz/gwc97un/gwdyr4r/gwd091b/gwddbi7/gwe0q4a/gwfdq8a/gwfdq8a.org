I think but don't fully recall there being a lot of non-anima checks that Valencia had to bypass, which were mostly removed from play due to the soul exclusion and her companion perks.

Plus any individual non-anima seems to have competition between devils controlling them, they are not exclusively owned. So there's an incentive for any individual devil controller to just maximize suffering in the short term to benefit themselves, rather than follow a plan with a longterm and abstract payoff.

At least until infernal unification.

And the rune magic antimatter bomb required a lot of research and resources in fixed and heavily regulated locations (runeforges), so creating a rune magic exclusion would have been a hard target for infernals to manage.
