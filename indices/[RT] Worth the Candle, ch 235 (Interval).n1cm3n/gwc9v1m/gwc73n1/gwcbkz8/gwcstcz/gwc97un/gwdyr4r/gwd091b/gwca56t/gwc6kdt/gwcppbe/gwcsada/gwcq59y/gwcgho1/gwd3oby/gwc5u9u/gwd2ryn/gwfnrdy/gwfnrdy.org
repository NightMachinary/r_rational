Oh BTW, I forgot to mention it last time, but apparently Juniper doesn't seem to know that Microwaves don't boil you from the inside - they actually have very penetrative power in a human body, and will cook you from the outside in.

Being exposed to microwaves feels like a very intense burning on your superficial flesh from the moment it's turned on, and it stops just as abruptly if the source is turned off before it causes damage.

Of they must be magical microwaves, but then why bother calling them microwaves.
