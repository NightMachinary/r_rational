Huh. That's a good point.

So the "cruelty-free cloning" stations would be important not because they'd provide new resources, but because they'd represent an easier way to access resources that isn't hoarded away or require violence, and would therefore facilitate trust between Dorises.

On the other hand, the chapter as written says "a few factors involved in that, but the biggest thing that had happened was that resource scarcity had been virtually eliminated". That's a little odd if the takeaway is supposed to be that resource scarcity wasn't the limiting factor.

I don't know, I kind of figured a solution to the DFEZ (beyond what was already shown) would focus on the progressive increase in trust, and the social structures Mary and BGD would put in place. But I get that you were trying to get it covered in one paragraph and you probably want to move on with the story.
