It's also stated in an earlier chapter that being famous was one thing that helped Uther breach into p-space:

  “We did hundreds of impossible things,” replied Raven. “Though technically, we didn't go to p-space, our conceptual selves went there instead. P-space interactions are common, but usually trivial, nothing more than a query about whether or not some object belongs to a certain class, or whether an object is actually an object. To get into p-space, we had to go to the extremes, those entads that allowed for definitional changes, or the creation of new definitions. It was complicated enough that only Uther really understood it. To hear him tell it, it was helpful that we were as famous as we were, because that meant that there was some foundational concept of us to work with in p-space, though that wasn't typically how p-space worked. And after a week of preparation, away we went.”
