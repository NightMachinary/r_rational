I really like that there's immediately a little bit of friction between Fenn and Juniper and that we see some of her worst traits right away. It gets back to what she said in her letter after she died, about not idolizing the dead, and it makes her feel like a more whole and complete person beyond just "comic relief" and "Juniper's love interest."

Also, the idea of Amaryllis being on every TV show (including Aerb's version of Law & Order) is hilarious. It makes sense, it gives her an unparalleled level of control and influence over the public's views on any number of topics, but the idea of channel-surfing and seeing her face as the one constant feels like something right out of a comedy.
