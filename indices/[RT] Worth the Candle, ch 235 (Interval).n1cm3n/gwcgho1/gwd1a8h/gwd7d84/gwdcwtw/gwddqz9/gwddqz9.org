Yeah, but I think you'd have to change some things around in order to make it work properly, since there's not really a point in having Juniper wondering about what's going on when the audience already knows. That might just be a matter of how it's framed/narrated though.

It would be a much longer route to the same point though, and much more focused on the experiences of others, I think. Like, a "Raven returns to the Library" chapter, a "Grak single-handedly clears an exclusion" chapter, "Valencia decides to bring children into a world like Aerb against the advice of Amaryllis", things like that.

(Anyone reading this should feel free to write some fanfic, if so compelled.)
