Abstractly? Sure, that's possible.

But Joon is talking about doing a real-like RPG ethically, and most definitions of ethical consent include the ability to withdraw that consent after it's given. And most of the exceptions to that are dependant on the subject losing some of their mental capability between granting consent and an attempt to withdraw it.

I don't think that a Joon who wants to be an ethical god would have done what the DM did to Arthur.
