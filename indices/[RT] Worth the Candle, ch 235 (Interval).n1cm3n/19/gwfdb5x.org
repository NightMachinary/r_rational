So, any theories on what advantage they actually gained in those three years against Fel Seed and/or opening The Door? I can't really see anything relevant that's different this time except Mary being +literally+ +figuratively+ conceptually The Assassin Princess plus the moment of surprise thanks to worldline teleportation.

Are they just barging in again with the same Fel Seed Plan, expecting different results, hoping DM would just let them through?
