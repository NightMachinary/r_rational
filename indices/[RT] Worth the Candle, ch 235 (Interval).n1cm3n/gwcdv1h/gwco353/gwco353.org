I don't think know what Mary's snapping would look like, but she's become a literally insane narcissist outside of Juniper. Now that he's no longer a goal and has no interface that's very scary. It seems like this might be a mirror to the Fenn/Juniper we see, he worked through not putting her on a pedestal, kind of gave up on her, and is dealing with the time frame changes now. Mary/Juniper probably has much more issues without support, has a massive time frame difference of 3 yearsXclonesXdilation, and we've seen that Mary was able to be intensely focused in the library futures when less alone.

When in moderately different short term circumstances two of HERSELF started literally loving herself enough to wage clone war against herself. That's a huge red flag, but then it's worse: "I just /merged/ them anyway" meaning those experiences that pushed her over the edge didn't get lost, they got added into Mary!

She's saying and showing throughout the chapter that she's essentially holding up the weight of the world including: shaping it, organizing it, ruling it, protecting it, and completely isolated. She doesn't seek comfort in others, doesn't make friends, and doesn't trust anyone even enough to be the main actor in her shows. She took more mantle's than useful in p-space, and produced huge amounts of suffering in part due to wanting to create beauty.
