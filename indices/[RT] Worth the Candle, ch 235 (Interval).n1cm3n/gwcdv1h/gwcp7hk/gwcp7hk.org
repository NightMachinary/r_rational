  Oh.

  I'm a bit disappointed. I thought Mary was going for a social solution to the Doris problem. Something like, having rules against spontaneous cloning on pain of death, permanent surveillance and enforcement through Blood God Doris, using sedatives to allow them to farm-duplicate without feeling like their life is in danger, etc.

  Having a "no more resource scarcity" ward feels like kind of a copout, even if it's plausible given the powers at the characters' disposal. I wish they'd had to solve it using the same means Doris had at her disposal, by coordinating better.

I mean, while I sort of agree, the issue is that the problems in the DFZ were more than just "the Dorises are shitty to each other." The Dorises were shitty to each other in large part because of the extreme resource scarcity, which they could only overcome by murder-cloning. Without murder-cloning, they wouldn't even have the clothes on their backs, and cloning without murdering doesn't fix the problem, because it creates more mouths to feed to match the resources it supplies. They can't trade with the outside world to overcome this either, because they're under brutal sanctions in addition to having very little to offer in trade.

The DFZ had severe social problems, but those problems were largely a result of the material conditions. You need to change the material conditions to actual fix things, and doing that in a purely mundane way (i.e. building infrastructure that can sustain the population without murder-cloning) would take decades.
