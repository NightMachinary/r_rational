I don't see it as murder.

Each clone has memories and agency.

If I understand correctly, when they merge, they all gain the memories. That's it. The memories are not erased, they are compiled.

If a clone is "murdered" because they get all the other memories added to theirs, then Amaryllis is committing suicide every time she does it.

Is a merge an overwrite of each clones (and Amarllis's) mind, and does it change the person that they are? More an append than an overwrite. And all experience is adding information, and may change your life.
