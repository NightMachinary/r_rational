  I'm a bit disappointed. I thought Mary was going for a social solution to the Doris problem. Something like, having rules against spontaneous cloning on pain of death, permanent surveillance and enforcement through Blood God Doris, using sedatives to allow them to farm-duplicate without feeling like their life is in danger, etc.

  Having a "no more resource scarcity" ward feels like kind of a copout, even if it's plausible given the powers at the characters' disposal. I wish they'd had to solve it using the same means Doris had at her disposal, by coordinating better.

I was about to be disappointed for the same reasons because I was interested in seeing what the social solution would have been, but I think removing resource scarcity makes a lot of sense as a solution to Doris' problems the same way that it helps with coordination problems with other players in other scenarios. There's something satisfying there, like being reminded that sometimes social problems can have technical solutions. It feels somehow optimistic and defeatist in equal measure.
