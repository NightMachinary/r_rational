Yeah, this is probably down to how it was worded. And the evolution of the DFEZ over the course of three years could have been its own book, but one of the things that I like about timeskips is that you can just do things in brief in a way that helps fire the imagination.

Edit: A better way of saying it, or maybe thinking about it, is that when people aren't desperate for food, clothing, shelter, and safety, they do a lot better when asked to have faith in each other. Grak's wards /help/ with that, in that they lower duplication costs/friction, as does flooding in entads, but a lot of it is indeed coordination problems, many of which stem from the attitude that Dorises hold toward other Dorises. (The entad thing had been tried before but largely failed, due to Dorises hoarding useful entads, using them to hold power over each other, etc.)
