  Having a "no more resource scarcity" ward feels like kind of a copout, even if it's plausible given the powers at the characters' disposal. I wish they'd had to solve it using the same means Doris had at her disposal, by coordinating better.

Resource scarcity was largely not the limiting factor, and in fact, Dorises are already shown being able to do something very similar, just more messy:

  There was only a little bit of looting before we got going. One of the ways that Doris's power was busted was that it cloned over her equipment too, but the big drawback was that the clone's gear would disappear after twenty-four hours. The loophole was that if a clone with an hour left on the clock for their equipment made a clone, that new clone would have their clock reset. The answer then, at least some of the time, was to just make a clone, kill it, and take its stuff, keeping both sets of equipment until the timer was up, when you would find out which one had the longer timer. The clone would naturally resist that, but the Dorises had methods of clone production that would put the clone in a position to be easily murdered. Most of the equipment that was laying on the ground, if looted, would simply disappear by the next day.

and later

  We saw other Dorises as well, though usually only briefly, or peeking out through windows. My crown let me see through the eyes of those holed up in their ugly buildings, and I regretted looking, because I saw a Doris going about the process of butchering her clone, and another in the middle of eating raw chunks of flesh. It was no secret that this was how the Dorises kept themselves fed, but it was still disturbing to see. A few of those rooms had tiny closet-like structures, the entrances so small that you couldn't get out. Those, I knew, were used for clone killing.

That is to say "make a clone such that you can easily kill it and take its stuff" was the default already (though available only to those who could secure a regular murder hole), and adding in "actually, you don't need to make the clone, just make the stuff" reduces the inherent violence/murder, and some of the friction, but it's relying on a process of eliminating resource scarcity that's already present.
