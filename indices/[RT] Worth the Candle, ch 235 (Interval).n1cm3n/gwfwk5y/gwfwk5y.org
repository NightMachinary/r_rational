Interesting to hear the stories of each of the different characters with Juniper away. Kind of reminds me of things like the epilogue slides in Fallout New Vegas or other rpgs, where you get to see how things turned out for people in the wider world.

Solcace was notably absent, but I guess she's fulfilled her role to some degree, and the focus shifted to the locus. (Interesting that the DM nixed the DMPC idea). I feel kinda bad for her, she got what she wanted, with the locus being freed, but it then proceeded to reject her, keeping her sick and thinking of her as a jailer. Then its final resolution came from Juniper without her involvement. I guess this maybe shows the negative side of the Locus's nature, the inherent unpredictability and resistance to patterns means that it also won't express gratitude or consistent affection. Would be interesting to see how she feels about baby!Locus, (Junicus? Frocus?)
