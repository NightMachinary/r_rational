Eleven days ago when Hell Arc started I was crossing my fingers and hoping we'd get more focus on Valencia. Valencia and Bethel are my two favorite characters, and with Bethel undergoing major development that largely wraps up her character off-screen I was really hoping we'd get to see more of Valencia. So having her mostly removed from the story here is a bit... oof. I'm stoked with the life she's managed to get for herself, but I wish the "camera" had been there to see it.
