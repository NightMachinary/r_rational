I legitimately adore this new posting schedule.

Something I've been thinking about for a while, but it's often /really/ hard to process and discuss 35-70k words batches, and it kind of loses some of the strengths of web-serials. Makes me feel like I have to binge an entire day of reading just to keep up.

The way this batch was split up was much more satisfying, and allowed for breaks to theorize about and discuss each section properly. Love that!
