Next chapter will be later in the day on Sunday (Central time), or the day before if you're an Early Bird supporter on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]]. Apologies for the different posting schedule than usual, but when better to try new things than 1.5 million words into a story?

(Note: it's a subreddit rule that you should only post your own stuff at most once a week, but I'm hoping that this isn't cause for offense in this case.)
