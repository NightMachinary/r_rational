There's a famous web novel called "Worm", wherein the protagonist has the superpower of controlling bugs. She uses them creatively, to devastating effect. Aerb has referenced other web novels (for example, there's canonically an Exclusion Zone where one person loops back in time), so it's plausible that there's one with a similar premise.

The idea is that somebody filed a bug report saying "T used bugs to do xyz, too OP, plz nerf". Then when that was nerf, they filed another bug report saying "T now using bugs to do abc, too OP, plz nerf". And another. And another. Etc.

...

Having thoroughly explained the joke, I trust that everybody will now find it hilarious.
