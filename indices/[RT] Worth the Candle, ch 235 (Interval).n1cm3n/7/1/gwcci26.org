Probably because every second they delay means thousands of souls going to the hells. Add to that the difficulty of trying to do a quest without the UI (they wouldn't necessarily know if they completed the quest, if the quest changed, what reward they got, etc.), and whatever marginal benefit they get likely isn't worth the time it would take. Especially considering it's Fel Seed, so one companion quest perk is unlikely to make a real difference.
