I still think that's unethical. I don't think that future me should be forced to act as past-me decides he should act. Go far enough into the past, and past-me was extremely religious; I know he would disapprove of some of who I am now, and I frankly don't give a fuck. I have a pretty good idea about who I want to be in the future, but I don't expect future me to care about any of that. Part of being human is the freedom to change your mind. There are consequences, of course, but I am under no obligation to become the me that any previous version of me wanted me to be.

Your motivations are, along with your habits, right at the deepest essence of who you are. If Arthur consented and then the reason for giving that consent is taken away, that core motivation removed, is it really the same person giving the consent anymore?

I think that there's a fairly strong argument (depending, of course, on *what* is removed) that it wouldn't be the same person anymore, and therefore that the consent shouldn't be considered binding.

Don't get me wrong; I don't think that present-me should never be accountable for the actions and promises of past me, or that future-me should not be responsible for present-me's actions and promises. There are consequences for breaking your promises. But anyone who says that someone should never, ever break a promise should ponder that keeping promises have consequences too, and those consequences are not absolved by the promise. And if the person I am now wouldn't have made that promise, knowing what I now know, then it's a choice of which consequences I can live with.
