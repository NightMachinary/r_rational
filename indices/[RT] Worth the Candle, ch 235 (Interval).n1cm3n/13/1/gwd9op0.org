[[/u/axiomsofdominion][u/axiomsofdominion]] mentioned a character with similarities to Valencia - for anyone else who enjoying reading Val, let me share another character who reminds me greatly of her and whom I also greatly enjoy: Dahlia, from the Warhammer 40k quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/suffer-not-%E2%89%A1-%E2%89%A1-40k-inquisition-quest.58591/][Suffer Not]], which is an outstanding story in its own right.
