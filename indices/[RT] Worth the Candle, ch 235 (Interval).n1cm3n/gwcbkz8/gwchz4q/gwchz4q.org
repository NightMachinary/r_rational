I kind of have to wonder how the public deals with it.

I mean, imagine being in the timeline where your country's ruler is a reality-show actor... okay, yes, but imagine they're doing the acting as a side gig while they're still busy being the unofficial emperor of the planet.

In the morning, you get your newspaper article about Amaryllis Smith's emergency border control procedures, and about how she's mounting an expedition to the hells to prepare for the upcoming War For Salvation...

And in the evening you get reruns of Games of Gold where you get to watch the will-they-won't-they tension between her and the handsome lead as her character desperately tries to convince him to give up on gold magic before he does something he can't go back from, while he's preparing his one last heist.

Aerb politics gonna be /wild/.
