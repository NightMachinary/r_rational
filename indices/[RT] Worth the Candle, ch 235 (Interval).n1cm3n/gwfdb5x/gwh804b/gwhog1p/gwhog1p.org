Their best bet of defeating Fel Seed is probably going to p-space and creating weaknesses for it. Once they've defeated Fel Seed (and Jun has a quest for it, so it shouldn't be impossible), getting past the door should become much easier.

Taking the stairs back to Earth might allow Jun to become the DM, allowing him to remake Aerb to be less shitty for the people living in it.
