*BUG REPORT WTC-#3405933 - progress lock triggered by death*

*Description:* when you die with the helldiver and diamond ironman harcore settings on, you get a GAME OVER screen. all game features are subsequently disabled.

i triggered this by going after fel seed and getting killed. the thing is, there are still features that allow me to continue the game. a companion did a quest to get me out of hell, and now i'm back in the main game, but everything is still disabled, the interface won't load, and several progress-critical quests are locked. pls fix.

*Steps to reproduce:*

- turn on helldiver
- turn on diamond ironman hardcore
- die because of stupid gm bullshit
- you get a game over screen, the interface is locked off, you go to hell
- have a companion travel to the outer reach and build a gate out of hell
- take the gate out of hell
- you are now alive and theoretically able to complete all the quests, except the interface is still locked. you don't get messages or level ups even if you complete the quests

*How often does this happen?* idk man, it's not like i can reboot a game to try, is it?
