  A lot of the pacing that feels like the overpowered party is going through a checklist of things they can easily do for some reward before they do what they think is the final quest is ... because that's what they're doing, in-universe. I unfortunately don't think that's really enough to justify it, though I have been mostly enjoying it on a scene-by-scene level ... mostly.

I actually think this worked really well in Chapter 221 (Targets Of Opportunity). But I think it'd work better if burning down the checklist took up an entire arc, with the more interpersonal developments filling in the gaps. Instead the recent arcs feel more like they're composed of mini-arcs glued together, with the focus and pacing suddenly shifting to accommodate. Interleaving these pieces more, and papering over the places this could be jarring by inserting the checklist quests into scene changes, could smooth things without a full story edit.

(And while I'm a huge fan of structural editing, I don't think a traditional full-book edit makes sense for a work that's already 15 times longer than the average paperback. Reworking things more than 20 or so chapters apart would take an entire editing team, not just an editor.)
