If you ever feel like talking shop here or in the eventual retrospective, there are a few editorial bits I would love to hear your thoughts on. In no particular order:

1) Something that always stood out to me was how /awful/ Juniper's adventure would be as an actual tabletop campaign. For all the early talk with the DM about Juniper acting like he'd want his players to act, there's a lot of mechanical and DM stuff that would be very aggravating or borderline toxic in the real world. I was expecting it was an intentional touch that was going to be brought up later on, but as far as I can recall it never was. Was this at all intentional, or just an unfortunate side effect of having to make the actual story engaging?

2) Tying into the game structure and the weird power curve they followed, I always thought that soul magic would be a prime candidate for an editor to brutally execute, since with 20/20 hindsight it becomes apparent how heavily they relied on it to game the system. Are you ultimately happy with its inclusion, or would you have stripped it out entirely if the story weren't far too large to comprehensively edit?

3) It felt like a lot of the late story's reliance on soul magic and loophole abuse stemmed from the weird, suboptimal build that Juniper committed to long before he understood the system. Was that an intentional writing decision? Did it work like you wanted it to?

4) Probably best held for the retrospective, but I would be really curious to know which parts of the story you like and feel were really well-executed, and which if any you'd wave a magic wand and revise if you could.
