you're right. it would probably stand out quite a bit more to anyone who disagrees with you if they reread the whole thing.

but i think it's less a problem of pacing and more that the subplot finales don't really have anything to do with the main plot finale. (and are far less interesting to the reader, because they won't come with answers to the two outstanding mysteries). as the author says in his reply, this was largely unavoidable unless he wanted to elide a bunch of stuff or info-dump it. so instead we got vignettes.
