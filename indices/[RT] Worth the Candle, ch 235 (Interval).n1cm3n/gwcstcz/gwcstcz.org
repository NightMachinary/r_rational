Since there are many positive comments, let me give an alternative opinion. I loved the story, but the pacing has been very weird since after the Doris Finch and Captain Blue exclusion zones. Pretty sure an editor would have had some strong advice.

It has basically been starting to wrap things up, dragon fight, several chapters of wrapping things up, exclusion zones off screen, nice but very short fel seed fight, very short hells "adventure" for something that has been foreshadowed to hell(heh) and back, another chapter of wrapping things up. With Amaryllis mentioning an extremely cool adventure of hers in three sentences, that we'll never get to see.

It feels to me like a (very extended) version of a fanfic author wrapping everything up in one or two chapters to move on. Doesn't feel like the pacing of a natural end.

One more criticism of a story I've actually enjoyed. This clicked for me on the last conversation with the DM: Nobody ever had fun in this. There was no wonder in the journey. That's obviously the story the author wanted to tell, but because of this, even the downtime wasn't "restful" to read. The entire adventure was a chore for mostly everyone in the cast. Contrast it with something like Practical Guide to Evil, which still has high stakes, but also some happy people.

Still, I understand that this may have been intentional. I'm mostly baffled by the pacing.
