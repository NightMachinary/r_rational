In particular there was that whole Earth bit with someone's high level rogue character auto-succeeding on stealing some basic object...and perhaps more to the point, the game goes the way the DM wants it to. I imagine at this point he just wants to get to the climax, so that's what's happening. You can see it being nudged that way by how infernal unification slapped on a massive sense of urgency.
