This is why I categorize it as a deconstruction of a power fantasy. It has a lot of the aesthetic trappings of a shonen isekai harem etc etc, but in reality the whole thing is too high stakes, and the characters are too real, for it to really be that for any appreciable amount of time. The few times Joon seems to actually have fun he gets basically scolded for it, like after the fight with Onion.

As for the pacing, it makes complete sense to me, and is spelled out explicitly in the narrative. The stuff that's getting skipped over just... doesn't matter. We as readers might enjoy reading about it in more detail, but the outcomes are already set and the real stakes are elsewhere. I think it works, personally.
