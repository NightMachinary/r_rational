Yeah, there's actually a huge difference in the look and feel of real violence versus physical violence that's being ignored. Even the bloodiest action/horror movies are recognizable as /unreal/ in a way that the viewer can process as fun.

It is, unless you're at least a little fucked up, not fun to watch actual people be actually hurt. Especially not with fatal wounds.
