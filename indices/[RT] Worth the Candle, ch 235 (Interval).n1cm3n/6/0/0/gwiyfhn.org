Wouldn't they already be able to make these deals, simply by not torturing certain loved ones in exchange? That's actually something that confused me about the hells. That there were no souls treated decently at all. At least some of them should have been able to provide stuff that's more valuable than their suffering, even if it's just to serve as an example that hell doesn't /have/ to be terrible if you are loyal enough to the Infernals in life.

Example: The right to get one loved one (or yourself) into an isolated little village of unmolested souls who only have to content with the local hell's horrible environment, in exchange for nine thousand unbottled souls, to be delivered in your own pace.
