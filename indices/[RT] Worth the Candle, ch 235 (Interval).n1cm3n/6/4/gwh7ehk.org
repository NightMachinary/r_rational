I thought the internal justification for the portal would be "Let's build a portal that lets internals invade Aerb... dang it only works on humans, let's sit on it until we can come up with a use."

Infernal invasion of Aerb has been discussed frequently, you would expect failed research on accessing Aerb from the hells to be pretty common in Omega Hell.
