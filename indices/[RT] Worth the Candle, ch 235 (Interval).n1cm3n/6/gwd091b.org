I know that the "actual" reason why the Omega Portal back from the hells exists is the need to bring Juniper back and Mary's adventures in p-space, but if anyone's wondering why the demon/devils would have such a device, it's actually infernally obvious: they can get more souls by sending some back to aerb.

Not even in the exchange itself, I mean just by bargaining with the person they send. "Look, you've seen a lot of what Hell has to offer at this point. You've been here for thousands of years. You've gotten so tired of torture on one level that you've actually killed yourself multiple times in the futile hope that it gets better. It doesn't. It never well."

"But we can send you back to aerb. All you have to promise to do is kill people and not bottle their souls. The more souls you send, the better we'll treat you when you end up back here. Sure, you might consign yourself to oblivion instead. That's fine. But think about the odds that you might end up back here anyway, and how pissed we'll be if you don't send at least a dozen more souls down. Hell, commit some real mass murder and we'll set you up in a palace!"

Hell cultists with these sorts of deals are something we haven't seen in the story yet, probably because this portal didn't actually exist until now, but if it did I bet the infernals would have taken great advantage of the ability to send humans back on occasion.
