Speaking of infernal plans to get more souls: why didn't they try to get a rune magic exclusion?

From what we've seen of Valencia, it sounds like a devil's persuasion powers would make it quite easy to talk a rune mage into creating some terrible device via a possessed non-anima, and we know from Joon's venture into the runeforge that you can plan out an entire design without actually having magic yourself.

It's definitely a serious task, but given that there are literally trillions of infernals, surely someone would try - if you succeed, you'll be given all the accolades the hells can offer and thousands of mortals 24/7.
