I love this story, it's probably one of the best stories I have ever read, but man in this last arc I don't have “fun”. It's just so heavy. Everything is in the air, everything can happen, the plot is moving quickly and on top of it all the relationships are changing so fast.

It's really good, it's making me feel a lot of things, but it's messy and confusing and so real. Those characters feel so alive and they are hurting so much.

You are certainly not pulling any punches, but I desperately hope for the Good End.

Keep doing what you are doing, you are really good at it.
