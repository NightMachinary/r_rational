  She nodded. “Two of them were,” she let out a breath. “Lovers. It was utter narcissism.” She blushed slightly at the memory, then paled. The muscle in her cheek went taut. “I didn't manage to convince them. They didn't think that I would have the same love for myself as they had for each other. They argued that they could be just as effective without merging. I just merged them anyway.”

The lovers are hilarious :)\\
Also damn, that's the closest she's ever had to an internal conflict, in a while.

Did she get pregnant?\\
Did she set up a void factory to blow up, if she's merged against her will?\\
Did she learn Spirit Magic and/or set up a suicide precommitment as deterrent using linear protocol?

Is that the Maryiest Mary of them all?\\
I must know more!
