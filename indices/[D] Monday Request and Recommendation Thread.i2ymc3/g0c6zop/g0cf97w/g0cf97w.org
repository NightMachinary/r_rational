I'm using Stitcher, and my standbys are basically everything by [[https://www.doofmedia.com/][Doof Media]], the guys who did We've Got Worm/Ward, Deep in Pact, and are now doing Pale Reflections, Kingslingers, Decomposing Worm, and others. Basically a lot of people talking about works of literature.
