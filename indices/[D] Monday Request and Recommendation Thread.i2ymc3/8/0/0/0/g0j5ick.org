Okay I started reading it and am on chapter 20 now. This guy's absolutely right. It's really enjoyable in that Joffrey takes the time to enjoy his loops, going to the different parts of the world in different roles. This results in short 2-3 chapter arcs that flesh out the world of GoT really well. The author also does a good job of showing Joffrey's descent into madness, ascent from madness, reconstruction, and development throughout the loops. And I'm surprised to say, but Joffrey becomes really likable! Highly recommend.
