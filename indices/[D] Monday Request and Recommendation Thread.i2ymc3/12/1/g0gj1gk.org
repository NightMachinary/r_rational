[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit?usp=sharing][Extracted]] is my favorite of the few I've seen despite it being very unfinished and aggressively weird. There's also [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Posthuman]], which is fun, and the [[https://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Legion-We-Are-Bob-audiobook/dp/B01L082SCI][Bobiverse]], which I didn't really like but other people do.

I wish there were more stories about ems, there's a lot of untapped potential there.
