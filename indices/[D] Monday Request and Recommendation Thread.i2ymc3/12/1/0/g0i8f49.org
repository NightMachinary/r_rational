I'm ambivalent about the Bobiverse as well, but it's what I would give as an intro to a lot of the ideas for Transhumanism / rational / optimization strategies. It's a kinder into than HPMOR at least.

Bob never optimizes as much as possible, and he let's his own emotional hang ups stop his duplication's when he might literally be the last Human alive. It's frustrating.
