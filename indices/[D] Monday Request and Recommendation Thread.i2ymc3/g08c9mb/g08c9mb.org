I recently got into the works of Morgenstern--[[http://bloodismine.com/][Blood is Mine]] and [[http://mda.wtf][My Delirium Alcazar]]. There's all kinds of weird shit in there, including body horror, eldritch gods, strange magyyks, and futuristic technology. It's extremely fun and very bizarre. The comics are both quest-style, with readers inputting commands for the characters, so you get that good gestalt hivemind rationality; the settings themselves are also internally consistent and NPCs are played according to their motivations & capabilities.

They're set in the same future Earth and BiM precedes MDA, but they can be read in any order.
