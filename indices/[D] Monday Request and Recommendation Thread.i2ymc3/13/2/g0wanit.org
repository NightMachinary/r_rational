There's nothing rational in isekai manga. If you're willing to go afield in media, I can recommend webfiction and fanfiction. Likewise, if you're fine with budging on the rational bit, I can reccomend some isekai stuff I enjoyed. But the best I can do with the overlapping venn diagrams is get "sorta close."

Youjo Senki has some themes you'd often see in rational works, and I enjoyed it, but its structure is more of a misunderstanding comedy. It seems to be fairly popular among people here as well, from what I've seen, so insofar a rational fiction is a tallying symbol of "things people on R/Rational like," it's there. It's not rational, though, and everything else I can reccomend is even further from the search criterion.
