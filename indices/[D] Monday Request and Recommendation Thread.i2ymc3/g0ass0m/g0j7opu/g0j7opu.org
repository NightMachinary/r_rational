Ajin is a really good manga with reasonably smart characters (for the most part). It's about these humans who revive to perfect health upon death, and how they are faring in a ruthless Japanese society.

20th Century Boys and Monster by Naoki Urasawa are really good mystery mangas. Monster is about this surgeon who saves a kid, but later on the kid turns out to be a serial killer. 20th Century Boys is about this group of adults that start to realize that the story they wrote in their childhood is happening for real, and they try to stop it.
