The first arc of [[https://mangadex.org/title/19531/yakusoku-no-neverland][The Promised Neverland]] is possibly the most rational story in manga ever. From there on it switches genre but it stays good, or at least it kept good as far as I've read.

Not a lot of people seem to recommend it, but I think [[https://mangadex.org/title/9570/ajin][Ajin]] is the most rational manga I ever read as a whole.

Besides that you can probably take your chances with betting manga, such as [[https://mangadex.org/title/3148/tohai-densetsu-akagi/chapters/4/][Akagi]], [[https://mangadex.org/title/1874/tobaku-mokushiroku-kaiji][Kaiji]] (both from the same author) and [[https://mangadex.org/title/104/liar-game][Liar Game]] all of which I've heard a lot of praise but haven't actually read yet, so, take your chances.

If you actually want to forgo the high stakes, fantsy and sci-fi and actually want some slice-of-life romantic comedy, then I can recommend [[https://mangadex.org/title/1171/koi-dano-ai-dano][Koi Dano Ai Dano]] and it's prequel [[https://mangadex.org/title/1708/warau-kanoko-sama][Warau Kanoko-sama]] (read the prequel first; it's not as good as KDAD but you need it to understand it); [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru/][Oregairu]] is also a good recomendation for slice-of-life romcom. Obviously, been romcoms, the rationality of these last few titles is not exactly in the same level of the first few, but they are enjoyable nonetheless.

Most of the recomendations have animes which you may or may not prefer, but, with the excetion of Oregairu, which I've only seen the anime, I haven't seen the anime version of any of the others, so I can't speak for how rational the anime is. Most anime will be just a straight up adaptation from the manga, but I know for a fact the Ajin anime is different from the manga, so you might want to be on the lookout for that.
