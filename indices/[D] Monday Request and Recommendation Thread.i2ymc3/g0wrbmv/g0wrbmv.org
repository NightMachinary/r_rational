Okay, so. Uhm. I have about had it up to here with the standard mildly-sociopathic male protag. You know exactly the guy I am talking about. No more hufflepuff bones, no more "hard choices". I am suffering from Exhaustion by over-exposure as regards this entire Stichk.

So. Recs for things with a female lead that is /not/ worm fanfic (Also overexposure) or things with a male lead that has actual empathy. Please. Does not have to be web fiction, books, movies ect are all fine and dandy, but it does need to be available in electronic format.

And, of course, I should drop a rec of my own while here. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun]]
