I'm currently reading [[https://qntm.org/][qntm's]] SCP [[http://www.scpwiki.com/antimemetics-division-hub][Antimemetics Division]] (he wrote /There Is No Antimemetics Division/ and /Five Five Five Five Five/). It has a female lead, but still falls prey to the "mildly-sociopathic" trope you mentioned. Also, it's completed.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][r!Animorphs]] has multiple main characters, with a 5:2 ratio of male to female, although it starts 3:2 in the first few chapters, and each chapter is from a different person's perspective. The characters all have feelings, and undergo constant emotional struggle throughout the plot (moderate spoilers: they struggle emotionally with the harshness of war, make human mistakes in heats of passion, mourn losses, etc.. also, be warned, just because the characters have emotions doesn't mean they don't make harsh decisions). This one is not yet complete, but it does have 64 chapters, and it took me a few days to catch up.

Edit: if you want something a bit more fun, then I suggest [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world][I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!]]. It doesn't have a female lead, but there's no hard decisions, and it's pure escapism.

Edit 2: Thinking about this a bit more, I think what you're looking for is [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]]. It's short, it has a female lead, no hard decisions, the characters feel emotions in a broad sense but there's not much character development. It may induce some existential angst, but hey, what doesn't?
