Im in need of some podcasts to listen to and a good app to listen to them on. What do you all use and listen to?

I would prefer the podcasts be about writing or something similar to Welcome to Nightvale. To be more specific, I love the off beat comedy of Nightvale and how it manages to gradually build up a sense of what the mythos and structure of the town is like. Kind of like Malazan Books of the Fallen, you get little tidbits of world information that ultimately lead you to a bigger understanding of the world.
