The Magnus Archives is a series of horror stories that slowly tie into a greater plot. It's from the point of view of an archive manager who works at an institute that handles paranormal events, and he's digitizing the archives in recording.

Wolf 359 is a scifi audio drama taking place on a spaceship of the same name. Mainly follows one goofy guy and his antics aboard the ship, but later on gets serious as you learn more about the world beyond the spaceship, and intrigue.

Honestly, there's a whole subreddit for story based podcasts in [[/r/audiodramas]]. Check out some of their recs for good dramas.
