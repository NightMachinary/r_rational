Course textbooks for forensic ballistics, maybe? They'd be mostly talking about gunshot wounds, but if they provide formulas for armor penetration that could be a starting point.

I've had a class in ceramics, and the prof talked about a ballistic vest project they had, I can dig it up if you're interested. But we didn't cover javelin impacts, I'd have remembered that.
