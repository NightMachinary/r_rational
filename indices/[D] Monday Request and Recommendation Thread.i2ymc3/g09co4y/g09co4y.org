I'm looking for physics data on the hardness of materials, average strength of human thrown javelins, how to calculate penetrative power and damage levels etc. Can anyone point me out in a helpful direction ? Maybe a forum or subreddit where people know these things and can answer questions.

​

Been making due with speed of thrown baseballs, force equations, and armor protective levels given projectile speed and mass but it's been quite convoluted, and I can't be sure it's accurate..

​

I'm trying to build a magic system that's very grounded and low powered but with high utility for a story and I'd like to check some number so I can put the proper limitations in place without having my characters becoming more powerful than I want them to be, while also having tools be physically useful to mages.
