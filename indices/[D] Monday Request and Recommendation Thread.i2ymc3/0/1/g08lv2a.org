[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire][Enlightened Empire]] has some flaws in its its prose and plot, but on the whole it's probably the best, "uplift," story I've read.

It does a great job of interesting overbuilding, follows a relatively plausible uplift timeframe and has a plot that provides realistic and balanced challenges for the MC to overcome.
