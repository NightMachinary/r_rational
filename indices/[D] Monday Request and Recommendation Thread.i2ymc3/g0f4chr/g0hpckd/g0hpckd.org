If you are familiar with /Worm/, then the fan fic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hebert-wind-of-death-worm-warhammer-fantasy.486847/threadmarks][Hebert: Wind of Death]], a "Warhammer Fantasy" crossover (knowledge of Warhammer not required), may be worth a look. The MC means well and tries to do the best she can with the necromantic tools that she has been given. She is young and emotionally damaged, so things don't always work out, but that's the Worm universe for you...
