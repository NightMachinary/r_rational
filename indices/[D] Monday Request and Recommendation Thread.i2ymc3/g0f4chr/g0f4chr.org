Are there any well-written stories where necromancy is viewed in a positive/neutral light? Or even just stories where necromancy is used, even if it's viewed as a sort of necessary evil? It seems like most novels have the necromancer be a big bad evil guy who tortures puppies for fun because he's just that evil.
