I want to give a strong recommendation for [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]], an ASOIAF time loop story about Joffrey. It was recommended to me last week and I'm only about a quarter of the way through, but I can't put it down. It's very reminiscent of Mother of Learning and is nearly as long (740k words).
