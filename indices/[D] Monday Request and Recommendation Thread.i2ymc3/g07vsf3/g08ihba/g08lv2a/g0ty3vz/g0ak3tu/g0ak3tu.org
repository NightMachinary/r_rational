Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time is a ridiculously over the top Japanese web novel that ends up including a degree of uplift (and nonchalant body horror). The uplift isn't particularly well done - even in universe - as it pretty much all depends on the MC's ability to generate an infinite number of golems, but he does at least use his over-powered abilities well.
