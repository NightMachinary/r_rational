In short, from chapters one through fifty,the MC accompanies the heiress of a dying kingdom across the world to her home, Malten. Along the way, he learns basic magic that can be modified with scientific knowledge, of stone behemoths called heathens that invade from the coasts, and meets a faerie that can read emotions. He doesn't become OP in the strictest sense, so he has to rely on building infrastructure and connections to survive.
