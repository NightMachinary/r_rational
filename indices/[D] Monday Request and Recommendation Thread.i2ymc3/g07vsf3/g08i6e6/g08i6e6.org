There's [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugi-yuusha-no-oukoku-saikenki/][Genjitsushugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki]] (How a Realist Hero Rebuilt The Kingdom). It's about a guy summoned as a hero that decides to focus on overhauling the politics and policies of the kingdom.

Despite being a neat and somewhat more realistic take on the hero isekai genre, I remember it having typical JP LN tropes and enjoying Release that Witch much more.
