I reviewed an anthropology/social science fiction story called [[https://recordcrash.com/blog/learning-to-live-with-orcs][Learning to Live with Orcs]] that I recommend to everyone in this subreddit.

I was definitely a bit too easy on the red flags, but I think the mystery and how it's steadily solved will make it really enjoyable.
