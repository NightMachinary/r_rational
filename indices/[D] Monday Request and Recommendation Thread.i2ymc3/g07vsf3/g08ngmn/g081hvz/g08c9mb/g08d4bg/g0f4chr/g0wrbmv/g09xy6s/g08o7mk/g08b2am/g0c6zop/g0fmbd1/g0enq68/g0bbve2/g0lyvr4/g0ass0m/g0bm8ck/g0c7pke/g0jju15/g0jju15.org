I binged it all in one day and absolutely second this recommendation. I'll add that while there are many cardboard cutout characters as a necessity of the choose-your-own-adventure MSPA-style format, there are rational actors with complex and even sympathetic motivations, both antagonistic and allied to the main character. It also does a good job of justifying certain absurdist aspects that seem counter-rational at the beginning, namely that the reason the Hospital is so awful and dysfunctional but still functions and receives patronage is that a conceptual, antimemetic corruption has taken root in the facility as well as the greater uni/multiverse to a lesser extent.
