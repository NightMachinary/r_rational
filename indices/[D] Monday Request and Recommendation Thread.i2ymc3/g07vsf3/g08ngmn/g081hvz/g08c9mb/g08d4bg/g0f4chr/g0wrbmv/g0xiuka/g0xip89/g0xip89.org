[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293][Ave Xia Rem Y]] takes the extremely cliche xanxia tropes like a sociopathic mc who has a sole focus on gaining power and turns it on its head. In this story, the mc just wants to help people by becoming a doctor like his father. The standard cliche sociopathic xanxia characters exist, but their inclusion only shows just how different MC is in comparison. The story covers topics like what it means to extend kindness in world where power is so coveted and if revenge is ever justifiable. The first, book/arc just completed so it's a great time to jump in.
