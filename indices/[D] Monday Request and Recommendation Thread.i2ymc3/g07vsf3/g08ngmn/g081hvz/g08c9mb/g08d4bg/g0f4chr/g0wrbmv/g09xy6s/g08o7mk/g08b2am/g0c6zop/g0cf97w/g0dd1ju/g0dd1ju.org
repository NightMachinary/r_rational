I use Overcast. While I don't listen to many writing podcasts, and don't know what Welcome to Nightvale is, I will still recommend [[https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/][Dan Carlin's Hardcore History]], and [[https://www.martyrmade.com/][The Martyrmade Podcast]] (particularly the Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem series).
