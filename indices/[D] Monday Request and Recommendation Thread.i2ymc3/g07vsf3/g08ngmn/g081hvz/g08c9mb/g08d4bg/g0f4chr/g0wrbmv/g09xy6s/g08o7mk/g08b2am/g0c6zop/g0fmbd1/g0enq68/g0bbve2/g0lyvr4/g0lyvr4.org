hello everyone, can You please help me find a web series I read some months ago.

Its a magic school setting with a male MC that is socially awkward and has an (initally) rather weak skill. THe skill itself is something like a magic crafter.

The main dungeon ist a tower, which members of the school climb as an entrance exam (which is also the beginning of the first book). ALso, the goal in the first book is for him to climb the tower as high as possible to find his brother. He never came back from his entrance exam in the tower.

Last time I looked there were two full books available with the autor working on the third

Thanks in advance for Your help!
