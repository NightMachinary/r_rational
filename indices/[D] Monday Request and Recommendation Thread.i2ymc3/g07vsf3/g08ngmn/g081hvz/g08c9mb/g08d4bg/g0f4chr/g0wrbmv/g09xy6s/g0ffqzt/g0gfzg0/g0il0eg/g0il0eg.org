The extremely surreal Christopher Pike YA book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137967.The_Starlight_Crystal][The Starlight Crystal]]. It is paced /extremely/ fast for the amount of crazy bullshit that happens in the story. I don't unreservedly recommend it, but it's a very fast read, and different from what I've read of his other work.
