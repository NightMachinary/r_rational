Johannes Cabal the Necromancer is a nice fantasy series about a necromancer who sold his soul to learn necromancy, and is now working to get it back. It's charming and witty, and sometimes really funny.

Inexorable Chaos on royalroad has the main character be a necromancer. He's overpowered, but imo it's done in a fun way. He's also supposed to be a Hero of the world, but he was hired to destroy it. It's a fun mindless story.
