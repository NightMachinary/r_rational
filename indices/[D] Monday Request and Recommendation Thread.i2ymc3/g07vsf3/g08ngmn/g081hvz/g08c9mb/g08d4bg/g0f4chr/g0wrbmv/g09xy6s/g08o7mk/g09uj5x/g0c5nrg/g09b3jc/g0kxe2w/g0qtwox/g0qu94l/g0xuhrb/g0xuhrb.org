Hard to say. On one hand, it definitely feels written as if the reader is familiar with the characters and setting. On the other, I'm pretty sure everything gets introduced satisfactorily eventually so long as you don't expect everything to be fully established at first appearance.

Also, it spends a lot of time in parts of the world that are mostly unexplored even in supplementary material, so knowing the series doesn't help much there to begin with.

Looking at a map of the known world probably wouldn't hurt though. Especially once the story gets past the initial sequence and he begins exploring more.
