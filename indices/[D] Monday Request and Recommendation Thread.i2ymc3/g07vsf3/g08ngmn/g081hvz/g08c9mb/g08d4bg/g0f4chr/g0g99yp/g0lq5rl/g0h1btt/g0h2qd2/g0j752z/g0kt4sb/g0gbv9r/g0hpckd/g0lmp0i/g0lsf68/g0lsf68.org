I am afraid not. There were 10 updates in early 2017, one in 2018 and another one in 2019. I guess it's "on life support but not quite dead"?

Also, I should probably add that although the MC starts out /trying/ to do the right thing using necromantic tools, things don't always (or even often) go as planned. Events escalate, bodies pile up, evil masterminds plot, supposed "heroes" are not exactly paragons of virtue, etc.

In other words, it's pretty close to the canon /Worm/ universe, although the body horror aspect is not as pronounced and the pacing is not as suffocating. Bonesaw would find it somewhat underwhelming.
