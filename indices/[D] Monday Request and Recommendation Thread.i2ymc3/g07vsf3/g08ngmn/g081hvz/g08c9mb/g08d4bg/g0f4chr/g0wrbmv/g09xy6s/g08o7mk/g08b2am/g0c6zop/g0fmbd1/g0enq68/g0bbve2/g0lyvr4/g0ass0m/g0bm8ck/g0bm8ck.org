With all the webcomics getting recommended over the past month, I'm surprised no one has ever mentioned /[[https://bogleech.com/awfulhospital/intro.html][Awful Hospital]]/.

The world has weird but consistent rules that are slowly getting broken by higher powers in weird but consistent ways; the story is fueled by readers' suggestions which leads to sometimes absurd, sometimes very rational choices (with very few in-betweens); readers are a part of the setting which leads to some fascinating interactions; tons of foreshadowing; characters have well-defined goals that they pursue.

Not rational, but a very fun read regardless, IMO.

I have to warn though that the story has a lot of body horror and gross-out, and having nice, detailed art style definitely doesn't help if one is squeamish.
