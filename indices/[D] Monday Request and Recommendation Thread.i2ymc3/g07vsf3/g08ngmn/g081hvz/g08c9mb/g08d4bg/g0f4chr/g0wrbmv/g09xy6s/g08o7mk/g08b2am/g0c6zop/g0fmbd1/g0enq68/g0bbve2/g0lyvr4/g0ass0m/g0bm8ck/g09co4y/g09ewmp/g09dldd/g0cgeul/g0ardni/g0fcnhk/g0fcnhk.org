[[https://acoup.blog/resources-for-world-builders/]], section "Armor and Weapons", and especially the linked posts [[https://acoup.blog/2019/06/21/collections-punching-through-some-armor-myths/][/punching through some armor myths/]] and [[https://acoup.blog/2019/07/04/collections-archery-distance-and-kiting/][/archery, distance, and 'kiting'/]].

Generally a fantastic blog for pre-modern military history, often illustrated with detailed walkthroughs of fiction. I'm particularly fond of the Tolkien series where he compares book, film, and real-world history.
