I started reading this a while back, but I found the flippant attitude of the isekai'd characters to be too disruptive for suspension of disbelief. There's one moment of trauma that the main character struggles through and then he's cured forever. Also the comedy can be pretty hit or miss, and it was miss for me most of the time.
