I'm surprised [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia][Qualia The Purple]] hasn't been mentioned. I would recommend going in blind. It's a short completed series, that picks up steam after playing with it's concept at the start to barrel headlong into the consequences of the ability the protagonist acquires.

For those who don't want to go blind,

Essentially a time looping optimization story, with the ability to traverse 'alternate' quantum realities only tangentially related to the starting universe. So one universe is normal, one universe the protagonist is a Magical girl, another her own Mother, another the head of the evil organization after her ability, etc. All of this wrapped around a fairly generic love story that serves as the end goal of the loops more than the plot focus.
