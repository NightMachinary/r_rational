What I was doing was looking up tables on the ratings of armor based on what weapons and at what distance they can protect from what weapon, with projectile speed, mass and density.

To get the forces applied to a javelin and how likely it'd be to penetrate said armor I just imputed the data from javelins, mass, speed, material density and doubled the minimum required force to penetrate because the javelin has a higher surface area than a bullet.

With the forces I was using things got confusing and I'd need to determine the damage it'd be likely to inflict if it didn't penetrate, effective range etc.

If the penetration didn't happen frequently enough people would likely use something simpler and cheaper like rocks or metal balls. But I like the aesthetic of the javelin more for the setting.

I want it to be unit on unit, and military applications in general. Nations of mages vs nations of mages warfare where magic isn't overpowered and common.
