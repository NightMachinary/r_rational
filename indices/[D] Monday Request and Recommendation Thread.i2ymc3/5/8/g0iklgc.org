[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/13437/necromancer-and-co]] about a guy who gets isekai ed and uses coding to up his capabilities with Necro magic. Necro magic seems general accepted where he starts out and the phenomenon of other worlders showing up isn't unfamiliar to the natives. There's even a group chat that connects the MC with other isekai ed people.
