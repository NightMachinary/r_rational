I played a game a while ago in which time worked like a large circle instead of a line, everything repeated in an interval of a few thousand years (seamlessly, without a hard reset that time loops stories like mother of learning do and without anyone able to act 'outside the loop'). It was done well, in part because it was never stated explicitly. But the game also tried to do a lot of other things, with less success. I wouldn't recommend it unless it seems like exactly your jam. The game was evoland 2. Title is in spoiler tags in case you'd rather stumble upon it without knowing this.

I'm looking for stories with a similar twist in their worldbuilding. I understand that such a recommendation might be a spoiler in itself, I've decided that I don't mind that.
