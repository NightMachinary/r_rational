As for simulated consciousness fics, I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity][Transcendent Humanity]], a Mass Effect AU where the Mars beacon didn't contain tech but a warning to stay away from Mass Effect tech, causing humans to develop more into computer/AI tech and upload themselves. It's very HFY-heavy, basically in order to enjoy it you have to stop treating the humans as main characters, and look more at how /humanity/ is developing in the aftermath of the contact with the galaxy.

An original fic that's very heavy on the subject is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design][Grand Design]]. Basically, humanity was wiped out some thousand years ago, and civilizations have developed in their abandoned space stations. The protagonists are two human-ish gynoids who are still searching for the cause of Humanity's extinction and a means for revenge. The mind upload stuff only really starts to appear about a third in, and becomes increasingly important. This is an /actually/ good story, not just compared to most of RR.
