Absolutely not recommending /The Promised Neverland/. It went so incredibly bad in the latter half, it can only be rec'd as a prime example of fucking up what started as a good writing. First arc is great, but I recommend dropping the story after finishing that arc. There is still good stuff after that, but only to get your hopes up so they can be violently crushed by the later chapters.

/Liar Game/ is awesome, but its finale is a bit underwhelming. Still, I enjoyed it a lot. The main character is a trusting, innocent cinnamon pie abused by smart participants of the Game; she gets a very intelligent friend who quickly starts using her naïveté to trick people in very imaginative ways. It's a great example of an otherwise annoying trope done right.

[Edit] Content warning: one of the /Liar Game/'s deuteragonists is trans, and it's not handled as well as a person spoiled by modern Western media might expect. Yet, it's one of the better representation pieces in manga.

The author of /Liar Game/ has also done [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/11327/One_Outs][/One Outs/]] which is a rule-breaking wank. Not rational but somewhat adjacent in a sense that one of the main characters superbly munchkins the rules of baseball.

/Kaiji/, I think, is as rational as manga gets, though there were some parts which I disliked.

As for rational slice-of-life rom-coms, you can't go wrong with /[[https://myanimelist.net/manga/90125/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen][Kaguya-Sama]]/.
