/Local/ police and a /smart/ enemy? I don't really see it as winnable, then: the assassin would never do another job in this city until a significant amount of time has passed. Pure OCP, gg no re.

But even if the assassin can't or won't leave the city for some reason, we can only have these slight statistical anomalies for evidence, and then we're left with the classical problem of building a serial killer's profile, except with more uncertainty regarding the victims and (I imagine) much lower number of victims. If we're talking a maniac instead of a professional killer, it gets much easier, but as it stands...

What technology do we have? If we have ubiquitous video surveillance and powerful face-recognition programs, we could cross-check all likely victims' interactions with public in days prior to their demises, and possibly find a common face here. I imagine a smart killer would expect this, though, and either wear face-concealing disguise, or work with the assistance of someone capable of rendering camera feeds irrelevant, or just not touch the targets where there are cameras. The problem here is, of course, that we have no reason to suspect that direct presence is necessary for killing, a priori. Why would we assume that, instead of the killer having a Death Note?

Hm. If we're aware of some high-level players that could employ this assassin (which can't be such a high number of people --- this person's services must cost a lot), and know which kinds of people they would likely target, we would be able to either put a surveillance on possible targets, or try to bait the assassination. I can't imagine it would be actually /approved/, though, if all we have to work with are slight statistical anomalies and vague guesses about superpowers. If someone important was killed in such an inexplicable way, perhaps...
