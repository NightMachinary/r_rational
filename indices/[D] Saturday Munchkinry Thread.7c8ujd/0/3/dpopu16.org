Local police? Can't really do anything unless you're really high up the ladder. In which case, you can try passing laws for health and safety, requiring people to wear protective clothes and take actions to minimize skin contact. That way the individual's power becomes much less effective, since they can't just touch anyone, only people they are very intimate with. And if they start killing people only after getting intimate, that leaves a very clear trail for the police to follow since all the victims got close to the ability user before dying.
