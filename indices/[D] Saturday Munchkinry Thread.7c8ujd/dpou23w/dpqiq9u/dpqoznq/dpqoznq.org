Random thought, what defines a cell as being part of his body? Its DNA? It being once attached to his body?

Both allow for mass production in different ways. In the former, you could create clones of him. We have cloning technology, it just doesn't have the accelerated growth + artificial womb parts. So you would need lots of women to be surrogates, and...

Actually I'm being silly again. Forget clones, just produce mindless blobs of his cells. Extract some part of his body, like skin, and then give it cancer (with carcinogens?) while keeping it alive. The cancer will cause it to grow rapidly, which means you now have an abundance of cancer cells with his DNA, which you can keep producing as long as you have the equipment to keep the cancer lumps alive. Only use the clone method if cancer somehow damages the DNA to the point where he can no longer explode it.

If the cells have to be part of his body at some point, that's even easier. Surgically transplant tons of body matter sequentially in and out of him. Give him massive skin grafts to increase his body size, and thus the speed at which you can transform body matter into explosives. Might be even faster to just use blood, hook him up to a dialysis machine, except instead of pumping his blood back into his body, pump in new blood extracted from other people and siphon off the used blood into explosive packages.
