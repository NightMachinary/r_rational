Well, obviously he can cool his blood for storage... at normal donation rates he could get 3.2 liters/year. I'm not sure whether there is an optimal diet that will reduce that or if the FDA just uses higher error bars than necessary so they don't accidentally kill people...

So if he optimizes and does the research it might be higher.

Blood is <50% cells by volume though, and you seem to be implying that the cells are what matters. Lymph... Low cell content things like urine... other fluids... are much less usable in this case.

Now: see here:

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991899/]]

"For a reference man mass of 70 kg, 25% is extracellular fluid [37], another 7% is extracellular solids [37], thus we need to account for â‰ˆ46 kg of cell mass (including fat)."

Now, this source is actually looking at cell counts of bacteria mostly. Which does bring up the question of whether they count.

Fortunately in spite of accounting for about half of your cell count, they don't have too much mass.

Looking at figures 2 and 3 in that paper, we can see that Erythrocytes (red blood cells) are about 3 Kg, Adipocytes (Fat Cells) are about 13 kg, and muscle about 20.

So. 3.2 liters per year? the average human should have somewhere around 5.5 liters of blood and in that 3kg of cells.

So that's ultimately only 1.75 kg of explosive!

And just detonating yourself all at once... 46 kg of explosive.

This doesn't actually help us munchkin much.

But it does add some deeper perspective. Perhaps cultivating muscle mass or fat then having that removed would be more efficient? But at that point... you can just grab an anarchist's cookbook and make your own explosives...
