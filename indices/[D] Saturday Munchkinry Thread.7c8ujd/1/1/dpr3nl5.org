So, undetectable explosives that can be remote detonated in a way that can't be jammed by mundane means? Obvious things are obvious: Become a terrorist and have people smuggle vials of your blood past any mundane security measures.

Alternatively you could become a hit-man. If you have sufficient control over your powers you could put some of your blood in all the drinks on a party and only detonate the cells that end up in your target; you don't need much explosive power to kill someone from the inside. If you feel like being a comic book villain you could even force someone to drink some of your blood and threaten to detonate them unless they spike the drinks for you (though it is probably more convenient/reliable to just bribe/threaten someone the old fashioned way).

More interestingly: You have a magical method of sending signals. First figure out what the smallest amount of tissue is that you can detonate, then make a device that can keep that amount of cells alive (and preferably refresh them from a culture of your cells). Hook that up to some mechanism to detect sudden spikes in heat and you have a nice one way communicator.

How useful this is depends a lot on the details of how your powers work. Ideally you'd want your ability to work instantly over any distance as that means FTL-signalling, which provided you can set up the required reference frames allows you to send messages back in time. If not, a message that can't be intercepted, jammed or traced probably has some uses to various military groups, even if it is one way and only capable of sending a few bits at a time.
