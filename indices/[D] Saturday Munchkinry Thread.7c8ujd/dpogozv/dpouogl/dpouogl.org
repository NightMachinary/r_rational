Don't try to track the deaths. Track the /payments/.

Celebrity X dies, and one of his heirs slips up and says something after a few too many drinks about hiring an assassin to get his inheritance. Ask him a few questions, then arrange a sting by finding out how to hire this particular assassin and catch him when he turns up to collect his advance payment.
