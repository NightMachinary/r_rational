Well, however good this defence is, it is by definition not perfect, since the premise involves the police noticing /something/ amiss in death rates. Once we've narrowed it down to statistics, it becomes a matter of determining which deaths were ~100% actually truly natural, excluding them, and figuring out whether the remaining ones may have been intended; if yes, by whom.
