  there is precident for superpowers
#+end_quote

Are there any general "rules" of superpowers, that we could use to narrow down whether or not these deaths are being caused by superpowered individuals? Like, what sort of basis are we as police working off of?

If we have no inherent knowledge about powers and their limits to work off of (other than that we know superpowers exist), then it seems /extremely/ difficult to track this killer down, unless he makes mistakes, or generates enough clear data for us to find a pattern. For example, in Death Note, Light was killing off tons of criminals every day, using the exact same method (heart attack). L was able to use this data to establish some baseline rules (requires name + face, seems to be able to control victims prior to their deaths, etc). But it sounds like that's not at all the case here.

Sure, we could start examining any surveillance of the victims for the days/weeks prior to their deaths, to establish a pattern. However, as [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]] pointed out, we have /no reason/ to even suspect that physical presence is even required in the first place. And since the assassin is not sticking to any particular pattern, we can't even know /which/ deaths were his.

The only potential approach I could imagine, would be if we could establish a death we were sure was caused by the assassin, to track who would want to pay for their death, and start interrogating those potential buyers until we figure out who they hired, and how. If we were lucky enough to get that info, we could set up a sting operation to attempt to track the assassin down (or at least get clues on how they works), by posing as potential buyers. But it would be an extremely long shot.
