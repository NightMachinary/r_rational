Reverse munchkin: Whenever this individual touches someone they can choose a series of forces for that person to be effected by up to 3 days later, along with this individual's medical training this can be used to precisely fake a very wide variety of causes of death from heart attack through gunshot(minus bullet but worth mentioning) to some kinds of poisoning, even no apparent cause of death by crushing a few key nerves. This individual is smart, some rich guy wants a celeb dead and has a contact then this person is just one of thousands who happen to meet this celebrity a few days before they drop dead appatently of natural causes.

Let's say you are all in the local police department and only suspect something due to slight statistical anomalies, let's also say there is precident for superpowers so you don't rule out this possibility on principal but have no reason to suspect it yet.

Edit: Four things to note is that the assassin occasionally frames other people especially when there's not a better cause to blame I.E. smoking, is not willing to leave the city for various reasons but mainly because lots of business comes up there (think New York, Hollywood, a capitol or something in that vein), it does not have to be the local police(but preferably something like that, as opposed to sayyyyy, batman or someone with powers.) and finally although the assassin is very good at using the powers other relevant skills like planting other evidence or sneeking into building to poke people and will avoid such things when possible.
