Also consider that the limiting efficiency may differ between spells. Perhaps a missile can be optimized to 99.9% efficiency with only minute radio emissions, but a haste spell is maybe 60% efficient at best at typical conditions and acceleration. The Flash doesn't suck at haste, he's in fact so good that he's the only one to be able to use it cost-effectively in combat.
