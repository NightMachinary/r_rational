How about a waste heat model? There is no 'perfect spell', only perfect enough for a given energy level.

This means a perfect missile isn't actually invisible. Rather, at the energy levels being pumped into it, the flaws that still exist don't give off enough light to be visible. If you dumped ten times the mana into the spell, much more energy would be wasted through the flaws and the spell would glow again.

The Flash works in the same way. His 'speed spell' is optimised to be able to handle very high energy levels and that is how he casts it. A normal haste spell would explode at those speeds. But because of the high energy levels, you get waste light and more of it.

He's no bad a shaping. He's juggling mountains (which takes really good shaping to be able to do at all!), but because mountains are so big, of course some boulders get dropped.
