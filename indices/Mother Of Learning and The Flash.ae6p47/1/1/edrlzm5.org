In any munchkining story haste pretty much already is the single best spell ever--so long as you don't just accidentally age yourself to death. In any combat situation where your opponent isn't arbitrarily immune to damage, you can cause arbitrary amounts of damage with correspondingly arbitrary amounts of speed--and avoid damage to yourself similarly.

DC's the Flash always makes me roll my eyes because he should be able to instantly win any engagement. Even mental attacks shouldn't work because his speed of thought, which is required to run that fast without hitting anything, should allow him to notice the onset and avoid or disable the attacker before serious harm occurs. Even if his powers require staying under the speed of light to avoid the weird running-into-the-speed-force stuff or whatever it should be basically impossible for anyone to beat him, and even just throwing pebbles gives him firepower on par with all but the biggest intergalactic villains.

MoL's restarts are in some ways just another version of haste--after leaving the loop it's like he's been hasted for a decade with the caveat that he couldn't affect anything in the world permanently except his own mind/soul.

In some respects even intelligence is just haste. While there's certainly a working memory component (things you can keep in mind at once), intelligence is mostly just about coming up with ideas /faster/ than other people. If you come up with them fast you can afford to discard more of them and consistently act on better ones.
