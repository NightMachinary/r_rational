Actually, that makes it more reasonable.

It might be divinely granted ability. He has an insanely huge mana pool, but very very poor mana shaping skills. So much infact, that he can't cast anything. But he has also been granted a divine ability to autocast Haste. That and instant autofill of mana pool.

That is, his mana pool regenerates while he is standing and delivering punchlines. That is why he is so talkative.

I am pretty sure Zorian would want to analyse him, in that case. Now that he CAN sense divine energies.
