Let's try to replace "magic" with "character" in the laws!

#+begin_quote
  1. An author's ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with characters is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said characters.
#+end_quote

That's just good characterization.

  2. "Limitations > Powers"
#+end_quote

This one holds up straight off without referencing magic at all. If your character is the President and also a Karate Champion and an alien space princess they're cheap wishfulfillment ("powers"), but if you actually consider how their obligations under the presidential oath clash with their duty to their space queendom ("limitations") things become interesting.

  3. Expand what you already have before you add something new.
#+end_quote

I don't know if this fits, but if we look at how Sanderson describes it..

#+begin_quote
  Sanderson points out that [characters do] not take place in a vacuum, a good [character] should be interconnected with the world around [them]. [They are] related to the ecology, religion, economics, warfare, and politics of the world [they inhabit]. The job of the author is to think further than the reader about the ramifications of the [character].
#+end_quote

Sure sounds like good advice that way!
