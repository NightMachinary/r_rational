Harry Potter magic is very limited, in a sense. In canon, you never see tricks like using /wingardium leviosa/ on a person to make them run faster and jump higher, transfiguring big things into small things and then back to serve as a deadly weapon, casting /accio/ on a person's clothes or wand, /aquamenti/ as a propulsion engine, etc.

I think the lack of creative use of spells is not because canon characters are morons, but because canon magic really is restricted that way. /Wingardium Leviosa/ levitates objects (to levitate people you use /levicorpus/), likewise /accio/ can't move something someone is holding (Bellatrix tried with the prophecy orb and failed), and you can't just accio someone's wand, you have to use the very specific spell /expelliarmus/.

There is an inherent functional fixedness on the Harry Potter magic system.
