I'd recommend Brandon Sanderson's Laws of Magic for this:

1. [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.]]

2. [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Limitations > Powers]]

3. [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-third-law-of-magic/][Expand what you already have before you add something new.]]
