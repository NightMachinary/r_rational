#+begin_quote
  On the other side of the continuum, we have hard magic. This is the side where the authors explicitly describes the rules of magic. This is done so that the reader can have the fun of feeling like they themselves are part of the magic, and so that the author can show clever twists and turns in the way the magic works. *The magic itself is a character*, and by showing off its laws and rules, the author is able to provide twists, worldbuilding, and characterization.
