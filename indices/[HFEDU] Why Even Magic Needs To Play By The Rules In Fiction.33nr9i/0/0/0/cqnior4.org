That is true! And you definitely cant easily define "magic" along one mechanical/mystical axis, it has multiple "traits" that it can be defined by. However, while any one spell in HP might be limited, there is always /some/ spell that will do any job, because the magic has no mechanics. if you cant accio someone's person, then there is a different spell to disarm them, because the limit on accio is just arbitrary; there is no "rule of force magic" that interacts with "physical contact" or even "abstract ownership". And none of the magic generally ever builds on itself; you dont cast expelliarmus by modifying an accio charm, or combining 3 channeling techniques or whatever, you just do a different wave and say a different password.

There are a few rules (no bringing back from the dead, no true love potions, aka classic genie rules!) but in the main the limits dont fall on any structured line. That is the meaning behind my use of the phrase "rules of magic" at least.
