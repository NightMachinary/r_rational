Haha yeah, the food one is just hilarious, its not like the magic world has any farmers anyway! So its not needed to like, preserve the world's power structure (which would be a fine reason to have an arbitrary rule when telling a story about social inequality).

i dont know if you were a big HP theorist back in the day, but the "love beats Avada Kedavra" thing was a big point of debate. Most/many people thought that it cant be /just/ love, since like every mother on the planet would die to save their children, surviving AK's should be fairly common. There was therefore a lot of speculation about love being an /ingredient/ in a spell Lily cast, since she was supposed to be an awesome witch and at one point, Rowling said Lily's profession would be "relevant". So there was this big fan theory edifice around Lawyer!Lily who cast some magical contract spell or somesuch, and that this sortof "love as ingredient" thing would be learned by harry and be key to defeating Voldemort.

That theory died a very sad death on the crucible of the later books :( Such was the fate of everyone who thought there would be a "secret" to magic, or at least a kind of magic, in later books (old HPfandom rant over!)
