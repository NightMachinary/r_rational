Right off the bat, Harry Potter having rigid rules of magic? i think thats confusing style for substance; sure you learned the magic in a classroom and it has a password instead of "just believe", but HPmagic does whatever you want whenever you need it to. The authors core idea is very good, and HP magic violates it pretty hard: there is no source of definition of magic anywhere outside of a few vague hints.

(None of this is critical of HP btw, its vagueness worked pretty great for the story!)
