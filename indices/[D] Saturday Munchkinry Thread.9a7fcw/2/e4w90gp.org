You have the ability to produce Truth. Truth being, statements (spoken or written) which are consistent with underlying mathematical foundation of the universe and its particulars, interpreted through some number of layers of abstraction.

When you produce Truth, you temporarily black out and lose control of your body, while it utters or writes the true statement. You can control how long the state lasts when you initiate it, and can likewise influence whether the statement will be uttered verbally or written down, as well as exert a small influence on the 'topic' of the truth. Statements are selected randomly from all true statements which it could completely state in the time you've allotted it.

Truths are stated in a unique and unambiguous language and notation system, which you possess an intuitive ability to understand, but which you do not /initially/ possess the expertise to formally translate it into a conventional language. Such a skill can be developed with practice and research.

Certain Truths will have anomalous effects on people you tell them to (once translated into a language they understand). These effects can range from the subject instantly forgetting the statement, to lethal brain hemorrhage, to gaining the ability to speak truths in an identical manner as you, to have sudden and radical changes in personality, to losing the ability to understand or produce language, and more. You (and others who gain the truth-speaking ability you have) will never suffer anomalous effects of any kind upon hearing a truth, translated or not.
