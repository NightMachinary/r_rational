Yeah but it is like participating in a lottery where the only cost is time (and pen and paper for writing), and where the rewards may far exceed mere money. For example, if you get the truth that states the most concise program code for a FAI, or the name of the programmer/organization you should support to maximize the probability of an FAI's creation. Incredibly unlikely but incredibly rewarding.

There's not much else you can do with this ability unless you want to use it to hurt people: Enter the truth-production state for a split second over and over to compile a massive list of truths. Since they are short, they are probably useless in terms of content. But translating them is fast, and the translated truths can still cause anomalous effects on people you tell them to. Mail out these translated truths to your targets and hope they die from brain hemorrhages or suffer other horrible effects.
