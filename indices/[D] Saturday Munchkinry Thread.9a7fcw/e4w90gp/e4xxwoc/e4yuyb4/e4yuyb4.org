Sorry for the delay in responding.

The anomalous effects of Truths is an emergent property of human neurology and psycholinguistics.

You can get the same truths multiple times, though I imagine for truths of any significant length the chances of rolling the same one more than once in a human life-time is vanishingly rare.

I don't know what you mean by this? I never actually finished HPMOR, and didn't read to the point where Harry got to the Mirror of Erised.

If you put effort into it, and do some research, especially with the help of scientists, mathematicians, logicians, etc. whose fields happen to be sufficiently relevant to a truth you produced to start trying to use truths as, basically axioms to prove further truths which you haven't produced, though given that doing so isn't tapping into the same font of Truth that your innate ability is, its reliability isn't 100%.

I also, don't really know anything? Hypothetically, they'd be genuine true statements about the universe, and I don't really feel like I know enough to make a reasonable guess at what one of them might be.
