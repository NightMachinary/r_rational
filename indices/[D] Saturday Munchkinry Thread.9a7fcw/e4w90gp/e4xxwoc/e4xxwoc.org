Is the way in which these truths influence people an emergent property of the universe, or an additional tacked-on magic system? Perhaps they are to be seen as adversial examples to hack the human neural net...

Can I get truths that I already know?

Do I understand them in the same way that Harry "understands" the Words of False Comprehension on the back of the Mirror in HPMOR?

If the first, no and no, I would like to see whether I can spot patterns to cover lots of truthspace. Can you give some example truths?
