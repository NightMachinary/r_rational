I like the idea of trying to convince others to hurt him with his puppets, though how would the soul work? Suppose the hero's team didn't believe in souls, how would you go about it?

Breaking the glass wouldn't give control as it isn't part of you. You would have control over whoever cut off the toe though.

I love the idea of finding a way to grow multiple limbs so they can be cut off!
