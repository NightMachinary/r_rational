> I thought that grown ears required tinkering with genes in the embryo? Have they found a way of stimulating grown mouse to do it?

​

According to the wiki article, they didn't actually tinker with the genes, they just transplanted cells from another animal onto the mouse, and the cells then grew into an ear. Which actually raises an interesting question:

​

The ear on the mouse was non-functional, but you can naturally transplant functional organs into yourself, like other people's kidneys. So suppose you transplant 10 kidneys into yourself, and get 10 targets to each remove a kidney from you. Would that give you control over those 10? Can you keep transplanting and removing organs into yourself to control more and more people?

In the came of multiple arm cutting it depends a little on the situation. You would get some control over everyone but the power would choose only one that you get total control over - either the one who did the most damage or if none such exist the person who gave the last most important blow. In the poisoned last you would gain control over the person who poisoned it the worst or the last person who contributed to the poison. In the court example you would gain control over the guy wielding the whip.

Huh. This actually can be useful for detective work. Sip a bit of poison and you learn who the culprit is.
