The types of injuries that would give you control are just not worth it. An abdominal gunshot wound would likely end up with you needing to poop into a bag through a hole in your side for months, if not permanently. The pain, the issues with constipation and bowel obstruction and various medical treatments you'd need for it would worsen your quality of life enough to make it a net loss. Same thing for losing fingers or limbs, you don't really get how much it sucks to be disabled like that until it happens to you.

The best strategy is to leave this power on the shelf. Do not go out in search of getting injured, it's just not worth it.
