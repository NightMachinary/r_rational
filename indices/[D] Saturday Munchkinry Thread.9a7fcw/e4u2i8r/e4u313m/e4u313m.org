There's not much use for this power in a PvE sense, since you can accomplish the same thing just using mirrors or cameras. So the main thing would be PvP: tricking other people into thinking that you can't see things when you actually can. But then, the same can be achieved with tiny hidden cameras in your clothing, so I don't see much point either.

If this power exists in real life, I would develop it mainly for insurance: if my eyes get injured in some horrible accident, then at least I can still see through my skin.
