  How is that possible?

The book says that playing cards are so thin and flimsy you can just see through them.

I had a quick google and it's surprisingly hard to find how thick playing cards are, but it looks to be on the order of 500 microns, so say the power lets you see through anything 500 microns (half a millimetre) thick. So you couldn't see through skin, as it's thicker than that. Or packages for bombs, etc.

On light: that's a good point, so you probably can see in the dark as long as it's not Complete Darkness (since some number of photons pass through a playing card; source: have held a playing card up to a light a few times). So your night vision would be pretty damn good but probably not supernaturally so.
