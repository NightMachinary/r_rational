> Point of clarification: you can see the top card in a deck of cards, which you couldn't do with a hidden camera.

â€‹

Wait what? How is that possible? There's no light reflecting off the bottom of the top card in a deck, so being able to see it implies that your power's vision isn't using light to see. That means you can do things like see in the dark, but more importantly, you can see inside solids. You can look inside patients without opening them up, or look inside tungsten superheated containers to observe high temperature experiments or look inside packages to check for bombs.
