I'd develop the power for sure. Reading in bed without straining my neck, in the dark, while turning two pages at a time, would be pretty nice.

I'd work in a gas station. All the winning scratch tickets would be mine. It would probably become necessary to switch gas stations after a while, since gamblers would notice their luck not being very good. Or maybe one could just take some of the biggest winners that can be turned in without documentation, and leave the rest to try to preserve sales.

The bigger ones that do require documentation to claim, well, I'd save those as gifts for friends. I might claim a very large prize myself if it happened to pass by.
