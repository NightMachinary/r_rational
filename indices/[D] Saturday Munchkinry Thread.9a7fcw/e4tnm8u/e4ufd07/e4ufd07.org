When the superhero injures me, I send him back to his base with his team. He is in a stupor because I have partial control over him. In a moment of lucidity, he communicates to his compatriots something like "That evil super villain's power... is to steal souls and store them in the body! Save me, cut off the toe with my soul in it. If the villain dies before you do that, I'll die as well!"

Before long, I'll have a permanent superhero team and I'll be down a foot.

Another idea: sever my toe, but keep it alive in a jar of nutrients so that it could be reattached. If an enemy breaks that jar, do I get permanent control of them?

Of course, I'd look for a person whose power is to heal 'permanent' injuries, like lost toes, to facilitate my experimentation. Biological alterations are even better. They call me Tentacle Glass, because I convinced a super healer to make most of my fingers have twenty knuckles. Also for some reason a finger gets shorter every time I capture a hero.
