I'm re-reading /The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar/ and am wondering how people would munchkin the power described within.

This power allows you to see without your eyes, but some skin on your body has to have "line of sight" to the object in question, and although this isn't covered directly, presumably the vision is normal human 20/20 vision. However, for some reason, there's an exception to the skin thing: you can see through very flimsy things, specifically they say you can see the other side of a playing card in a blackjack shoe.

One character who has this power ends up working in a circus, basically. Another character who has this power uses it to see through cards to win at blackjack.

How can you munchkin this power?

In the story, the power takes anywhere from three to fifteen years of ~1 hour daily meditation practise to develop. The amount of years of practise is completely random, it doesn't depend on your "calmness" or previous ability to meditate or anything like that. Would you put the effort into developing the power, if it existed?
