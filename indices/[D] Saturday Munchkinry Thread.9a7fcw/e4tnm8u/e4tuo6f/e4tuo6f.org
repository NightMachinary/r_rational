Look for ways that give you a lot of control for very little actual damage. For example:

​

#+begin_quote
  A bullet in the guts gives complete control until the wound is healed or you die of bloodloss,
#+end_quote

​

What counts as the wound healing? If you recover but the bullet is still inside your body, do you still get to control the shooter? Because you can actually survive with a lot of bullets stuck in your body. They aren't that different from having implants if they end up in the right places.

​

​

Also, can't you strengthen your control over anyone iteratively? For example, if you have slight control over someone, you can make them hurt you. Then your ability gives them more control over them, so you can make them hurt you more. Repeat until total control is achieved.

​

#+begin_quote
  Can we find a workaround for the limited number of permanently controlled people(give you only have a limited number of limbs folks can be cut off.)
#+end_quote

​

Depends, do they need to be functional limbs? Scientists have already figured out how to make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacanti_mouse][mice grow (non-functional) ears on their backs]]. You could use similar techniques to repeatedly grow some non-functional limbs on your back, and have people cut them off to control them.

​

I'm also really curious about something:

#+begin_quote
  people who cause you pain or harm.
#+end_quote

​

How does your power know who caused you pain or harm? If you are sniped by a bullet from 1km away, does your power automatically let you gain control over the sniper even though you don't know where he is?

​

What about if someone poisons you? If someone gives you a bottle of poisoned wine, and you store it away for 30 years before drinking it, does your ability magically remember that you were poisoned by that person?

​

I'm also curious about how collective responsibility is handled. What if multiple people cause you harm, do you get the same amount of control? For example, say 5 people cut you in the arm over and over until it falls off. Do you get total control over all 5? Or say you take a swim in a polluted lake and fall sick. Do you get control over everyone that polluted that lake? Or say you are unjustly tried for a crime you didn't commit, and sentenced to whipping. Do you get control over all the people that voted for/supported that terrible justice system?
