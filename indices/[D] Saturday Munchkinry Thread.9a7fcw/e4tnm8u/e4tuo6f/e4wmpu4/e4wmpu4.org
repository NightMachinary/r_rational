'What counts as the wound healing? If you recover but the bullet is still inside your body, do you still get to control the shooter? Because you can actually survive with a lot of bullets stuck in your body. They aren't that different from having implants if they end up in the right places.'

It's on a continuous scale. So if the bullet was inside but the rest of the wound healed there would be some but not so much permanent control.

'Also, can't you strengthen your control over anyone iteratively? For example, if you have slight control over someone, you can make them hurt you. Then your ability gives them more control over them, so you can make them hurt you more. Repeat until total control is achieved.'

You absolutely can!

'Depends, do they need to be functional limbs? Scientists have already figured out how to make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacanti_mouse][mice grow (non-functional) ears on their backs]]. You could use similar techniques to repeatedly grow some non-functional limbs on your back, and have people cut them off to control them.'

They don't, though some of the severity of the wounds is measured in functional loss. I thought that grown ears required tinkering with genes in the embryo? Have they found a way of stimulating grown mouse to do it?

'How does your power know who caused you pain or harm? If you are sniped by a bullet from 1km away, does your power automatically let you gain control over the sniper even though you don't know where he is?'

The power recognizes the harmer as either the person with the most responsibility or the most immediate link in the causal chain regardless of distance or time. In the came of multiple arm cutting it depends a little on the situation. You would get some control over everyone but the power would choose only one that you get total control over - either the one who did the most damage or if none such exist the person who gave the last most important blow. In the poisoned last you would gain control over the person who poisoned it the worst or the last person who contributed to the poison. In the court example you would gain control over the guy wielding the whip.
