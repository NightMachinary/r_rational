There isn't really an exact definition to minmax but we share an understanding of what harming means. In general you only gain control over 1 person per injury and the power recognizes the harmer as either the most immediate link in the chain of causality or the most responsible, depending on the situation. It has no limitation on range or time. It's powerful but dump.

Taking small a very small tip permanently of a finger would give low but permanent control. I'm not really sure what the other examples was.
