If it does need to be in one piece, attach them with a retractable line. Make the projectile part bouncy to allow for bank shots. Use compressed air to add power to the shot so you don't need as much mana in your mech to start with. If even that's not enough to get you there, I would experiment with a two stage mechanism. First shot gets a smaller mech piece closer to the wall. Second has its own gun to get an even smaller piece the rest of the way.
