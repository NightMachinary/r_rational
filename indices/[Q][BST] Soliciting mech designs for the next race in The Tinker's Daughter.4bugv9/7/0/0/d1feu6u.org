A big slab of snapped-together lead manabatteries with hidden containers full of ball bearings buried all through it, each layer carved with massively redundant and inefficient processessing that can continue to function even as it's ripped apart. All outside edges have little wheels on each battery that coordinate with really basic movement sequences. It responds to being smashed by rolling away, while the attacker has to deal with a bunch of little ball bearings fouling everything up. The maker has set up an assembly line that lets them reclaim and recast the lead really cheaply, and the minimal everything, ability to break along preset structural lines instead of rupturing expensively, and low mana loss on each component makes it a sure survivor, if rarely winner. Maybe have a weapon buried at the bottom to extrude and use on the last crippled survivor, if it comes to that.
