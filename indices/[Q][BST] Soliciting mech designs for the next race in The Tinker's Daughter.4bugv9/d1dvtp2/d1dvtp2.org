Something built along the same lines as Rob, but in a much flashier fashion, and much cruder. A mech with a series of programmed modes that marry rune function with structural function, for something like an actual generalist mech.

Ropesnake tinker is back, but this time the mech's got an actual skeleton (probably wood) in which the "muscles" are each cheaply-built ropesnakes. They can act as actual muscles, for a light, agile mech, or they can leap off the skeleton to attack. Oh, and he took heavy inspiration from Rob's use of his snake as a flail.

For the fighting category, some joker submits a lump of manasteel with minimal processing that is basically indestructible on account of having virtually nothing to damage, and registers to most mech AI as "scenery". It had a single stupid-looking limb it extrudes once all the other mechs have smashed eachother to pieces so it's technically the last mech moving.
