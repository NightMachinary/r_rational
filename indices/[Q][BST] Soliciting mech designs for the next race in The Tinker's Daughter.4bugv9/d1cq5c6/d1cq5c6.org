1. A slinky! You need a slinky for this race. If nothing else someone would have invented just for the hell of it. It moves around like how you'd expect a slinky to move and it can jump over tall obstacles by compressing itself before firing itself at it's destination. It's too funny not to try!

2. A tiny transformer-style mech that can change between a ball to a cube to a circle and some other basic shapes.

3. A mech with a grappling hook that it constantly shoots at a particular destination, pulls itself as it retracts, and repeat. This is more of an accessory than a single mech idea, but you get what I'm trying to suggest.

4. A self-directed arrow-mech where it aims itself at the goal. Think ridiculously high-tech action movie-style heat seeking missiles that could bend it's flight path as much as it wanted to get to the goal.
