a tank

literally a tank with treads

i mean, they designed those treads so they could climb mounds of things, so it might do okay in the situation. i don't know what you'd give it for armament, i don't think projectiles like a normal turret and cannon would work, but maybe they would? it would probably just roll as-the-crow-flies to get over to the destination, shooting things with it's amazing magic auto-reloading cannon

second idea is a buggy built for speed, with little bumper things underneath it. the bumpers have high pressure piston things which cause the bumpers to shoot downward (or at a diagonal) at high speed to cause the vehicle to fly through the air if necessary. give the thing an extensible sensor array so it knows what the field is like, plot the optimal route for going SUPER FAST and MINIMAL JUMPING and rob has to throw something or maybe the tank will take it out, or else it'll just zip to the end line right off the bat
