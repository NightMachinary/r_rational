Does the mech have to stay in one piece? The rules from chapter 2 don't seem to require it. And the win condition is to 'touch' the far wall, and any single piece would suffice for that. So you could have a cannon that launches a small part if itself towards the target, over all the obstacles. Or a mech that splits into multiple fragments, each trying a different route.
