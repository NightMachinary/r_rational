I have not read your story so maybe my ideas are no applicable.

1. Wheels inside wheel. Like Mecanum wheels from alocholic stepfather [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXTo16KKm8Q]]

2. Drills. Ancient russian prototype. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=relPtvgZDEg]]

3. a robot that from outside is a giant ball of steel. Mechanisms inside allow it to roll.

4. A purcupine that shots the needles as harpoons and when they are embeded in earth pulls on them to move around.
