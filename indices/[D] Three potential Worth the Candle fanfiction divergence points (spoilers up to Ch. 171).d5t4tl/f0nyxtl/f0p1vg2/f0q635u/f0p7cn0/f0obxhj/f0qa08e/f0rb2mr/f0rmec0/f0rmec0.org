Sure, I think I said a similar thing to a lesser degree at the start of my post. In any case, that's why I picked 3 divergence points that mostly allow the story to maintain the same plot and momentum. A /really/ divergent WtC fanfic wouldn't have June as the MC at all, or have him swap places with Arthur as the original dreamskewer, or have him explore a world other than Aerb.

That said, I think you may be overestimating how much rational-fanfic authors differ in this regard than others. I think just about all of the major ones that I've read substantially change enough of canon, or explore substantially new directions/characters, that I could see why someone might think they might as well just make their own story, and yet we choose to write fanfic instead because it's the world itself, for the most part, that we want to play with.
