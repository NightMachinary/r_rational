Consider an other grand tradition: swapping. Imagine an Arthur entering a world full of things June created, and legends of a hero that turns out to have been him. Did Juniper create a world with such suffering just to have fun in it? Did his DM obsession crush his ethics when he got some mysterious power to create world? Or was he but a victim, like Arthur? These questions would trouble Arthur through the story.

And how are the legends of the Grand King Juniferious Smythe different from the legends of King Uther? Maybe he revealed the full truth to his companions, some of whom are still alive. I think there is plenty of juice here.
