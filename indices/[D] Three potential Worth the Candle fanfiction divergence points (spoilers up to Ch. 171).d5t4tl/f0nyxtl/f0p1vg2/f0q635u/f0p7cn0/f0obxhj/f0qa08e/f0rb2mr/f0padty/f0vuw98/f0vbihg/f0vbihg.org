One idea is that Aerb!Reimer is the POV character.

He starts with no clue and no power. Once he finds his old friend with new clothes, he would have to munchkin everything just from his knowledge of the game. Perhaps the first step is trading his knowledge for Entad's instead of gold. Maybe he should become a companion? Or just hide in the time chamber and take up woodworking.
