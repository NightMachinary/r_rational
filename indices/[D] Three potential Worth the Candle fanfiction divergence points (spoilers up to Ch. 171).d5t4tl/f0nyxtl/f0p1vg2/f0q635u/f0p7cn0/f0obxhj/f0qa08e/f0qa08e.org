This seems (to me) to run into the problem that the world isn't all that developed outside of what Juniper's interacting with, from the perspective of the reader. The author has put a great deal of thought into the setting, and it shows, but the lack of familiarity with the setting and limited viewpoint is a key part of the story.

Where something like Naruto isn't all that well-written, it has an expansive setting the audience is passingly familiar with, somewhat cares about, and understands. There is an established sandbox to play in.

In Worth The Candle, fanfic authors have two options: to follow the path set by Juniper and only work within those bounds, which would feel forced (see "stations of canon"), or follow the inevitable course of different starting conditions/circumstances and move into areas the story hasn't covered and reader isn't familiar with - at which point, the whole thing starts feeling a great deal more like an AU/Original fiction, and the author and readers don't have the same built-in attachment that other series have.

It's probably not an /insurmountable/ problem, but it's a pretty big one, and I don't think it's likely we'll see much fanfiction at all.
