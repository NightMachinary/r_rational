Oh, I like that one. All the others seem more like "fix-fic" kinds of hooks where June just does something better, or takes decisions that are better on the long term, but this hook actually has the potential to increase conflict by a huge amount.

On the other hand, I dunno. Joon told Mary /everything/, like, as soon as she got a little bit suspicious, same thing for most companions. To hide something so huge to every one of his friends, he'd basically have to be a completely different person.
