One other point is that with SOC, Jun would be a nicer character to read, and may also accelerate progress in the therapy storyline. He may get error messages from raising SOC, instead of the ones he got for MEN. If the DM is making the therapy progression a key plot driver then this may accelerate the overall plot.
