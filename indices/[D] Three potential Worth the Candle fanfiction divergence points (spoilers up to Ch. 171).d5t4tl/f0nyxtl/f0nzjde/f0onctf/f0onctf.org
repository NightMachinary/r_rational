I actually think that it might be possible to make it at least somewhat compelling to run on LUC. Rather than what Wales suggests in the post of randomly walking around, I would make a list of quests and/or locations and roll a random die or something to see where to go next. You could then plan extrapolate from location and quests why you might be lucky to go there and make plans in case of the various situations.

It would depend a lot on the mechanics of LUC, i.e. does luck take you roads that the gamemaster thinks is good for you or does it prioritize your wishes and priorities? If it's the latter it could potentially be very powerfully combined with soul magic and spirit possibly prompting Juniper to be forced to compromise with his ethics regarding self-manipulation. It seems at least plausible that this approach would have taken Juniper 'home' before the game rules were burned.
