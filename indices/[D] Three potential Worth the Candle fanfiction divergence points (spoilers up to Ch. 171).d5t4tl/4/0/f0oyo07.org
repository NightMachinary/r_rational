I wouldn't be surprised if Joon actually went to the time loop exclusion in the story. The author at one point talked about how the story was kind of designed to contain every trope that he personally loved, and said that he would have even included a time loop if he could. It's possible the mention of the time loop exclusion was his attempt to make that possible.
