For shorter fics, there's also the plot hooks and quests that have been dropped along the way that could be elaborated on further.

It's unlikely, after all, that we'll ever find out what the deal was with the Risen Bile in Barren Jewel, beyond the small amount that intersected with the storyline. Fenn's companion quest and backstory is closed for the foreseeable future. We're not going to see Joon visit most of the exclusion zones (and, heck, there's one that comes with a built-in Mother of Learning crossover opportunity).
