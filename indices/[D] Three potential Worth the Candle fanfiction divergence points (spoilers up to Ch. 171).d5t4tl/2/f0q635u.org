I think there's a lot of crossover potential that's going untapped.

- Protagonist of a different story shows up on Aerb instead of June, either randomly or at a common jumping-off point from their own franchise. This has a nice self- balancing aspect, as most protagonists are more competent but lack June's knowledge. May or may not include an AU version of the Can't Go Home Again village, meeting with a DM who's a fan of the canon DM, etc.

- AU where June read [story] and ran a game based on it so it's included in Aerb. Harry Potter wizards are a known race/magic with their own aethenum, Parahumans are around as "trauma mages", there's a city/ country based on Marvel with a powerful Avengers Guild (Quicksilver the Velocity Mage, Iron Man the Rune/Gem Mage, Bruce Banner the Passion Mage etc.)

- June finally investigates Star Magic and finds a plane based on [story], either as a thing that's always been part of Aerb offscreen or as a result of him levelling Star Magic to superhuman levels.

- Characters from a big, flexible universe meet the DM and enter/are trapped in the simulation. Neo discovers an experimental test Matrix, the Enterprise crew finds an abducted 21st-century human, the X-men find a powerful telepath/reality warper tormenting some highschooler, etc.
