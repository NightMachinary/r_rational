Not necessarily. All it'd take is for the DM to add a term to Joon's isekai adventure that if he tells anyone about his true origins, then he instantly loses. Not that he'd know that immediately after being mindwiped, but a little notification window telling him he'll die if he reveals he's from earth would do the trick.

Of course, that would likely end with Joon's quick death since he can't lie worth a damn to start with and wouldn't gain Amaryllis's trust without further tweaking, but it's more workable.
