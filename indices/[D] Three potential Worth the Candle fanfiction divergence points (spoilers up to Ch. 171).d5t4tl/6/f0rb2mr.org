I think you're misunderstanding the reasons why people think fanfiction for WtC is hard to create. It's not that the story is lacking for interesting divergence points or alternate universe setups, it's that Aerb is a huge setting that has a very narrow path cut down it called canon. It is such that any significant change to the story would entail writing almost entirely new settings, plots, and characters from whole cloth, which is a helluva lot more work than most fanfiction entails.

Take Harry Potter: you can mess around with its plot on a micro scale a lot and not have to worry about the overall structure changing, because Voldemort drives much of that conflict, and he'll do his thing independently of any schoolyard shenanigans. It is exactly the kind of narrative crutch that makes writing fic appealing to authors: someone has already done a lot of the hard work in figuring out what's going to happen.

In comparison, fanfiction for WtC would be like the Alexandra Quick series for HP; it is set in the same world, but functionally is an original story. And fics like AQ are few and far between, for the simple reason that an author comfortable with taking on that much of the burden for story creation is more likely to just make an their own story altogether.
