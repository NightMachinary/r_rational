So, like, the fanfic that interests me, the one that I would write, is "Juniper doesn't go Full Disclosure". Like, he just doesn't tell anyone that there is a dungeon master or he has a character sheet, etc. He just does the Uther deal.

â€‹

So no one is aware of narrative stuff at all, no one understands the loyalty thing, Juniper's power ups are inexplicable to them, they don't know he has Quests, etc. He is much more alone in his team, he has to sort of manipulate/fiat people into doing the stuff the DM is making him do, can't appeal to the sheet in his mind.
