Hm ... I think if I was to create a point of divergence it would be that the rest of the old crew showed up on Aerb. I really, really thought I was going to get my wish when Reimer appeared. Have Reimer, Tiff, and Craig show up at the same time or alternatively: Joon dies with the helldiver setting on, DM decides to give him and Aerb one more chance, Reimer, Tiff, Tom, and Craig all dream-skewered and have to figure things out from there. I think if I were to write it I'd give them loyalty scores relative to each other and say 30 skills (simplifies things on my end and increases their interdependence) each rather than 40 like Joon but otherwise leave thing the same. They have to figure out what's up with Aerb, find and save Joon from the Hells, find the lost king, etc.

Whichever.
