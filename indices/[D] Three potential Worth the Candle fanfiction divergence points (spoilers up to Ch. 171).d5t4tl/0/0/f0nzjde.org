Neat, I totally missed those. I assumed the early-game would all go mostly the same because Juniper would need PHY to survive and wouldn't cotton onto SOC value until the debacle with the mercenary group, but that start is interesting too.

Also considered a LUK beginning, but had the same issue he cites: I don't think Luck is a particularly compelling trait in a main protagonist. Not for our genre at least.
