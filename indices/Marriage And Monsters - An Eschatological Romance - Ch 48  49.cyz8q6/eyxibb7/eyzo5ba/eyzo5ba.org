Zeno's Paradox argues (somewhat convincingly in philosopher nonsense) that motion is impossible. But obviously motion is possible, because we all move all the time. When Sherlock first trapped the Dog with it, he said the Dog's metaphorical nature made it especially susceptible to these thoughts. Haley just kind of helped it get out of the loop I guess, of thinking motion is impossible and thereby being motionless, by focusing it on the fact that motion is possible (and perhaps with the snappy philosopher-quotation way she said it, given the Dog's bullshit Wonderland mechanics).
