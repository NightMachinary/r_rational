Finally got around to reading this version.

Still very good, although I liked the original version a bit more in some respects, to be honest. I've got the impression that in this version Accord is going to be a more down-to-earth fallible kind of guy, rather than a terrifying rationalist mastermind he was shaping up to be in the original, and I'm a bit disappointed.

Taylor continues to be a constant source of irritatingly suboptimal choices as well. I mean, wasting her time on school drama? I guess it's good that she has a lot of room for character growth at the start of the story, but it's still very frustrating to read about her faffing about. Setting herself up to be a single point of failure for global economy, as she is planning to do, is not smart either. It's such an obviously bad idea, in fact, that I'm forced to suspect shard mind-fuckery as the reason for her not noticing it, which, as usual, makes it hard to properly sympathise with the character.
