Glad to hear you're better, and glad I've been some help!

There's been a little bit of GBG discussion in the alexanderwales Discord server - a few people tentatively onboard, but waiting until more of the story's out before they, ah, cast their votes, so to speak. A couple of people praised the parts of the description I took out, so definitely trust your instincts when making edits...

I just caught 1.10 - it's a rare thing for a story to play with audience expectations so effectively. A question occurs to me, and I see it acknowledged or answered just a few sentences later. This first trial scene is the perfect culmination of everything that's happened throughout the first arc - the established character voices shone through, and I'm interested to see more from the likes of Lu and Soso.

Keep up the good work!
