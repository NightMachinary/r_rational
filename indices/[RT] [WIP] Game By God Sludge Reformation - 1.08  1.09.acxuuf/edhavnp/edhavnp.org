Blew through this pretty quick, and am really enjoying it so far. It's got strong prose, likeable characters (including, crucially, its protagonist), an interesting premise, and a good sense of humour. It's also the first story I've seen to comment on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] web serial format in such a direct capacity, so that's novel - although I realise that you're setting out more to explore the structures of mystery stories, something that I'm not really qualified to talk about.

My main criticism isn't actually in the story itself, but rather in your description! I'd recommend toning it back a great deal - I don't think the story's currently suffering from most of the problems it's branded with there. It's well-paced, tonally consistent, and /exactly/ the kind of convoluted and unconventional it should be. It's certainly not as obnoxious as you make it out to be either - ZB excluded, of course - at least in my opinion. Unless your backlog of chapters is significantly worse than what's already up, there's no need to sell yourself so short. I'd strongly suggest a more concise description, more along the lines of the following:

  If you would like to start reading without any spoilers, click /here/.

  */Game by God: Sludge Reformation/* is a biweekly web serial about a young woman who participates in a murder-mystery elimination-style death game - one intended to be televised for the enjoyment of millions worldwide. With a functioning index finger and a lifetime of pretending to know how to spot contradictions, will /By Menachem/ have what it takes to beat fifteen opponents (the majority of whom are shorter than her) and win the grand prize?

  The story draws inspiration from many sources, but is most reminiscent of "finger-pointer"-style whodunits. If you've enjoyed media in the past involving /lawyers, detectives, puzzles, killing,/ or /escaping,/ and you get a small twinge of excitement whenever you see one person point towards another and call them a liar, this is especially written for you. If you haven't experienced that type of media before, don't fret - it's still totally cool to read this! Younger or more sensitive readers, on the other hand, should be warned of potentially graphic or uncomfortable portrayals of dark and despair-inducing situations.

  A new chapter is released every Wednesday and Saturday, without exception. I'm big on meeting deadlines, so a sizeable backlog has been written to help avoid the pitfalls of procrastination and whatever life happens to throw at me. In the event of my untimely death, a trusted friend has been given the keys to a small safe buried somewhere on a secret island seven-hundred miles off the coast of São Tomé and Príncipe, which contains a full plot synopsis of the story yet to come, several DNA samples, and detailed instructions on how one would go about creating and raising a perfect clone of myself in order to finish the story. In other words, I'm very committed to this. What's that? You don't believe me? Well, you'll have to take me at my word...

(As a side note, is there any way of getting forwards/backwards navigation links at the top of each chapter, in addition to the bottom?)

You say you haven't had to dip into your buffer yet - I'm correct in saying the new chapters you write go into the buffer, so for any given chapter you publish, the next twelve have already been written?

Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds - hope you get well soon!
