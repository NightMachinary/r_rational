Nice. Something that I haven't seen noted is that I'm /pretty/ sure that the properties of the sludge is actually impossible, according to modern medicine. Fast acting sedative? Sure, if you're doing it /intravenously./ Inhalants can also get that fast, but even GI absorption is pretty slow, generally speaking. /Through your skin?/ Pretty much impossible to do safely. I wonder if that has anything to do with the Cold Minute, because it's been implied that it was supernatural in some aspect.
