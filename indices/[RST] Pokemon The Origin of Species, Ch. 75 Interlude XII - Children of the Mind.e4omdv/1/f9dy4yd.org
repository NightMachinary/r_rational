Hey everyone, welcome back! Technically still the 1st, with apologies to anyone living east of Germany.

Quick note, I'm henceforth referring to the Mr. Mime family by its Japanese name, Barrierd. There will be some reference to its "real name" when it comes up again in the future, but the simple reason is that its English name is just badly designed on a number of levels; it's the only pokemon family whose names have two words, which makes lower case for non-proper-nouns look strange, and one of the words is an honorific, and it's a gendered honorific despite there being female Mr. Mimes. So yeah. Now it's barrierd, except for regions like Galar.

(Oh yeah, I guess Sirfetch'd has a gendered honorific too. Well at least it's region specific. (Also it clearly should have been called Absir'd, come on...))

Anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter, and if so, you should totally check out Crystal Society, by Max Harms!
