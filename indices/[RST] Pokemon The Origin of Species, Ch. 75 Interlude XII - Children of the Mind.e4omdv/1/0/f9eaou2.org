Your reasoning for changing Mr Mime makes sense, for sure. Do you have alternates in place for Mime Jr and Mr Rime as well?

Also, on a slightly unrelated note, I'm curious about how many of the legendaries actually exist in TOoS. Mostly because some, like the Sinnoh Trio plus Arceus, seem more suited for being a religion instead, but then we have the reveal of Groudon and Kyogre potentially being actual creatures... Well, maybe I'm just caught up in excitement for the worldbuilding, but it does seem a pertinent question.

And I guess while I'm on the topic of asking too many questions, does Kanto have a lower level of Pokémon diversity than other regions (considering the others generally have more Pokémon due to being post Gen 1) or are the native species mixed up compared to what they are in the games?

Sorry for grilling you, but your worldbuilding is so fascinating! So many questions!
