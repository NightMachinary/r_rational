  you should totally check out Crystal Society, by Max Harms
#+end_quote

I really liked the first two books, and the society-nature of those first two was the major thing I liked; the third book was rather disappointing in how little of the AI view we got.

Related to the Crystal trilogy, I wonder if Victory lacks identification-with-Prime because it was created by the other tulpas, and so will seek to maximize its personal victory rather than a gestalt, kind of like what Growth realized very early.
