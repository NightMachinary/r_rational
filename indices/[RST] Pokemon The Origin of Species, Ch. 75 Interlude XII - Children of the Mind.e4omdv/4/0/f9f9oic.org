I'm fairly sure Mewtwo prefers to be called Mazda since that is what Sabrina calls it. Prime is only what its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa][tulpas]] call the part of Mewtwo's mind that directs them. I would not think Mewtwo would refer to itself as Prime if it were fully merged with the tulpas, but I could be wrong.
