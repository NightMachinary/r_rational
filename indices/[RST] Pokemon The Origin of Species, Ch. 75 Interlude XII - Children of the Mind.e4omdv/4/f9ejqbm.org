This was so incredibly cool. Mewtwo's chapters continue to be my favorite ones, and they just keep getting even better.

I guess Prime is his actual name? It feels good to have something to call him that he also feels comfortable calling himself.

Just, holy shit. What an amazing character, I can't find words to describe how much I love him. I just want him to be happy! I have no doubts about Red Blue and Leaf having eventual happy endings, whatever form those take, but I'm very anxious about Prime's fate, he is so complex. All of them are, and I love seeing how each of their stories develop, even if I sometimes don't agree with them, but Prime is my treasured favorite.

Thank you so much for the chapter!
