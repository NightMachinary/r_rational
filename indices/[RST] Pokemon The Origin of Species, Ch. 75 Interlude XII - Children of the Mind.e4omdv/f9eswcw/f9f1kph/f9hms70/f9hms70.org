I don't think it will happen to that extreme, I just suspect that something along that spectrum will occur. The creation of Victory will definitely tilt the plot /more/ than simply making Mewtwo better at combat. You can already sort of see how Victory already has all the others on the back foot even from birth. And as we saw with Safety who was suspicious of all the other tulpas (although not of prime) so it's possible for them to go into conflict.

We've already got a weird situation where Prime is effectively a naive character which is manipulated by the others while the partition is down, which means that Prime is not in full control of this situation.
