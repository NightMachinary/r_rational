This sort of scenario, where not even your own thoughts are considered safe, and the ruse must be upheld for years on end all while advancing your own agenda, is one that comes up every now and again in sci-fi/fantasy.

This is the first time that I've enjoyed it. Mewtwo is explicitly superhuman, and it doesn't break my suspension of disbelief that he can do it. I find all the tulpas to be amazing to read, always scheming and analyzing beneath the surface only to occasionally send single thoughts or emotions to the surface, and always doubting, always analyzing, never feeling safe, contrasted with the happy and friendly prime who they gently puppet/serve/subvert/are.

Giovanni being their opponent is also incredible. Given his role in the story, he should be considered HPMoR!Voldemort levels of smart and prepared. All that scheming might really be necessary.

Thanks for the chapter.
