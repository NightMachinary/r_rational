Typo:

#+begin_quote
  ... and was rewarded for it by eiI feel immeasurably...
#+end_quote

Should be something like

#+begin_quote
  ... and was rewarded for it. I feel immeasurably grateful...
#+end_quote

?

And should the "~ 1 ~" before "perhaps if i..." a little later be there?

Also, why do you not capitalise the Pokemon's names? Is that just your convention so far? I confess I've only read the Mewtwo chapters haha.
