What an amazing chapter. So unique, and I have enjoyed every word, I feel I could read a whole book of just this. Mazda's mind is fascinating, I want to grab inspiration for a sapient AI. And the way you are connecting it with how both blue and read think.

And the references to groudon and kyogre... I need more of that. "Pokemon the Origin of Continents" please

Btw if mazda gets his hands on some TMs... Oh boy. Thunderbolt, flamethrower, ice beam, shadow ball, focus blast.
