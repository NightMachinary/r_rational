How does Sabrina hide from Mewtwo the fact that she is suspicious of him having a partition? I know that the tulpas inferred that she was suspicious of them, but wouldn't all of Mewtwo (including Prime) be able to sense that because of the total merger? How is Sabrina hiding those thoughts? Any ideas?
