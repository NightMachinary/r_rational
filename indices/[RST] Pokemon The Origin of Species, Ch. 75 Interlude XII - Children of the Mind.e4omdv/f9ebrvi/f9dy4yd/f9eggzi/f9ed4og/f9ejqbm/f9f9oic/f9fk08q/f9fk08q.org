He got disillusioned with Sabrina pretty quickly, and that tainted the name she gave him. That's how I remember it.

  In the early years, this too filled me with pride, and joy, to have a name, even if it was a private one between myself and my teacher. Its charm has long since fled.

  I would not think Mewtwo would refer to itself as Prime

Why not? The way I see it, he wouldn't call himself Mazda (for the reason mentioned above), and he would definitely not call himself Mewtwo. He'll get asked what his name is by someone, post-escape, and he'll have an internal monologue about it, and he'll decide to use Prime out of habit, if nothing else, mark my words :D

  Only Dr. Fuji thinks to ask me. Only he wonders over a name for who I am, not what I am. But the others find his comments uninteresting.

He wanted to choose a name for himself, and I think tulpas still do count as “himself”, but of course we shall see.
