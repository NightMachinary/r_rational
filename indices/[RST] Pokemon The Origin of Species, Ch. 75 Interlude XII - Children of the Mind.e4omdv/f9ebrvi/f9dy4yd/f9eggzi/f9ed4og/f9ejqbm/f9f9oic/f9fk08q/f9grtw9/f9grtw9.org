Oh right, I had forgotten that Mewtwo stopped liking the name Mazda.

I agree that he will probably choose a name for himself eventually, but I still don't think Mewtwo would pick Prime because that's just the name his tulpas use because they seek direction from it. Also because in my personal opinion that would be kind of dumb to call himself Prime, but I can't really defend that reason, haha. I would probably start to inadvertently imagine Optimus Prime fighting the legendary birds!
