  It prompts some more questions (are the latest four regions isolated from the first four such that we don't have, as an example, Unovan pokemon in the first four?)

Well, yes, since the first four regions map to regions of Japan, but Unova is the eastern United States (which is why Surge, who is in Gen 1 referred to as "The Lightning American," is in this fic Unovan), Kalos is France, Alola is Hawaii, and Galar is England. So you'd expect the Pokemon unique to those to not show up in the first four regions, given how far apart the real-life counterparts are.
