Yes Mewtwo chapter!

It looks like Red's multithreading theory is the most correct. Currently Red's aspects can't be detected, so if he (or Rowan) figured out how to keep them /active/ without merging that'd replicate what Mewtwo's doing. Heck he's already had live discussions between his aspects back in the psych visit chapter, without apparent partition swapping.

When did Zapdos pass over Cinnabar, was this an unrelated attack from the one the gang faced? Did they simulate the experience with a more mundane storm and some lesser, unseen pressure user (like the Absol)?

I'm still really curious about what exactly happened that prompted Sabrina's task/AWOL, it doesn't look like she suspects anything yet. Fingers crossed for a double interlude!

(We're up to what, /seven/ alternate personalities now? Sad Red, Past/Future Red, and Doubt/Trust/Flourish/Victory-Two? Any Disassociative Identity Disorders cases on your mind?)
