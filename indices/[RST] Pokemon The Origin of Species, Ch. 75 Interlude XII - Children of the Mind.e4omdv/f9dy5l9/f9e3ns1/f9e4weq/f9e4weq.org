Fixed! Though the ~1~ is in the right place :)

And yeah, pokemon specie names aren't proper nouns. There's really no reason for them to be treated as such, and it makes it extra confusing when a pokemon's name /is/ its specie name, for trainers who don't nickname all their pokemon.

How did you know this was a Mewtwo chapter so fast? Do you check each interlude as it comes out?
