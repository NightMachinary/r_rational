Not sure if a typo or if foreshadowing, but Mewtwo refers to itself as “we” twice during the last scene. I'm inclined to believe this is a mistake because (iirc) Mewtwo isn't supposed to be aware of his tulpa's existence while his mind is partitioned, and I like Crystal Society the tulpas can't fast track anything directly to the surface, just concepts and memories. If this was intentional I'm interested in what it implies.
