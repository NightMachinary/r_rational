I get the impression that this is happening after she gave her students the assignment, that she suspected that Mewtwo was hiding things before this even happened.

It's kind of funny to me how Mewtwo is so careful to not let on that he's more suspicious than he is and/or knows more than he does, but he's blowing it with something stupid like that. It's funny that he doesn't even realize it in retrospect.
