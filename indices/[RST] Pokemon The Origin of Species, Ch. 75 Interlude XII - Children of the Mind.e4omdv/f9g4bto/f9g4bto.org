This was a really good chapter. I actually ended up waking up in the middle of the night and planning out how an eventual confrontation between Giovanni and Mewtwo would go, assuming the desired end result is a narrow action packed Mewtwo escape. You may have something different in mind, like a stealthy section where Mewtwo escapes via teleportation before they even finish realizing he's not on their side, or maybe Giovanni WINS and shuts down a Mewtwo escape by planning THAT well. And if so, that's fine too and I will happily read them! But since I really felt inspired about this, I wanted to share:

First, it seems inevitable that a confrontation will happen and you've set it up nicely. Giovanni and Sabrina are skeptical that Mewtwo is being honest about fighting prowess. The general approach to dealing with a Pokemon that isn't doing what you want, but that you don't want to kill, is to put it in a pokeball, because they come pre-equipped with training and analytic technology. Giovanni has pokeballs that work on sentient targets. There is no way I can imagine Mewtwo accepting being put into a pokeball. It would be weird if Giovanni didn't think to do this, unless I missed something about the scenario, although since I can predict it will lead to trouble, he can too. But if you assume that Mewtwo is going to resist being put into a pokeball, a confrontation might go something like this:

Giovanni assumes that Mewtwo will resist being put into a pokeball, and also that because they are generally skeptical of his mental state, it's not safe to assume he is actually sleeping when he is sleeping. So while he is sleeping, under guard, he gets a Wigglytuff or some other sedative style pokemon to further deepen his sleep.

Mewtwo has multiple partitions, so likely a front partition will fall asleep, but a rear one (Victory) will not. So the initial pokeball probably gets deflected at it's user and sucks him up instead. A bunch of backup pokeballs get tossed at Mewtwo by the rooms guard trainers, and he deflects them all back at their users. All of the trainers had their pokemon told to take backup orders from Giovanni, so Giovanni orders their pokemon to attack. Mewtwo endures the fastest attacks (priority breakers like Quick Attack) while he tears down the ceiling and uses it as a shield to block the dark attacks that are a bit slower. Mewtwo is hurt, but can continue to tear through ceilings to fly right out.

Giovanni will guess healing is available (otherwise Mewtwo would know it would be doomed in an escape attempt) and will shrug off suggestions that Mewtwo is dying and immediately calls in reinforcements, led by Sabrina to find him. Those reinforcements teleport in to some nearby point that had been previously kept out of Mewtwo's line of sight (I can't imagine they'd want him having practice teleportation until he's VERY trusted) But Mewtwo has been hiding his talent at psychic powers, so he can reverse engineer the effect to teleport back to where the reinforcements teleported from, and then heal and fly away. This also sets up, but doesn't require, Mewtwo running into Red in some sort of early appearance, if Sabrina teleported from her Gym to get there.

Thanks for writing and I look forward to the next chapter!
