Sounds like future red has a better system in place than mewtwo prime. Once an adversary detects any secondary mewtwo they know what's up and will be ready for it, while an adversary against future red will think they know what they're up against and that they can easily see through it but in reality the main red is hidden beneath the surface, guiding both present and past red

That said, since Trust is the one who created Victory, the Tulsa probably has way more access than it should. If it decides Trust is in its way to victory it may decide to find a way to take advantage. Hopefully Prime will get to meet and guide Victory first.
