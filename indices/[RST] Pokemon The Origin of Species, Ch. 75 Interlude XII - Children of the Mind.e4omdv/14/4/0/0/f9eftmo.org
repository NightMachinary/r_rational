I just saw it at the top as I was checking r/r and it was called "Children of the Mind" so it seemed interesting. It's not as if I would have been super disappointed if it wasn't. I will say though I don't typically read your story, preferring Alexanderwales stuff :) I like the podcast you do though, helped me a lot as a writer.
