Damn, Victory means business! It'll be interesting to see how Victory affects the others , and most importantly, Prime. Very enjoyable chapter to read, the interaction between them all was great, and it is nice to have had an update Mazda's situation, and the implications it may have for Red. Speaking of Red, I hope he'll start following a similar thread to Mazda, but in his own seperate way, from the ground up with his unique position.
