Daystar writing characters from pokemon: YOU get an alternate personality that isn't another person exactly but rather just another pattern of neurons firing in your mind that you aren't constantly aware of that you can consciously switch between, talk to, and share memories so it doesn't quite have the traits that would qualify it as dissociative identity disorder and neither personality can be called "real" or not because they are all the same self just with different outlooks but at the same time they are definitely not the same person even though they /are/ the same brain so it begs the question of what a "person" or the "self" is and--

--Anyway, I continue to be unable to predict this story (or start off a comment with anything other than a joke). Was not expecting a Mewtwo interlude, and was not expecting the tulpas. I'm dying to know how Sabrina detected Mewtwo's (Prime's) perfect partition, considering he's literally not even aware of it himself. I'm really impressed by your ability to show-not-tell by letting us feel that Mewtwo in the beginning was acting /off,/ but not straight out saying so. It's like Past Red in that he was still "Mewtwo", but the Mewtwo we knew wasn't quite there...then it turns out the guy just casually split himself into different Mewtwos that could guide his actions and then it made more sense. Fantastic as always.
