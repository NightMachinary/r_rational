I don't think they have enough evidence behind them for non-psychics in our world for me to have a strong opinion about them one way or the other, but I do have minor anecdotal evidence that points in the direction of something like tulpas being possible: namely that characters I write often enough often feel very "alive" in a way that makes them actually feel like independent conscious beings at times, commenting on what I write about them and having independent thoughts/ideas about what they should do.
