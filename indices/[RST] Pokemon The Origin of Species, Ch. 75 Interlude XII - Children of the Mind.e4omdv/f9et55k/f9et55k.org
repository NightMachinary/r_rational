I wonder how Mewtwo discovered tulpas in the first place? Also why exactly can they be shoved behind a partition and evade the mind scanning for the partition while still being able to influence Mewtwo at all?

But also like there's certainly a part of me that wonders about the you know psychological issues that would ensue from the lack of physical comfort and nurturing that a human would need in his(?)/it's(?)/they(?) place. Like we have more than a little reason to believe that Mewtwo is at least of Human equivalent intelligence/awareness/sapience/whatever, but given that they are a new species and with a new biology it's not my first assumption that they would need to be cared for as a human would in order to not face developmental issues. Or like even within say real life animals there is a lot of information that a lion cub does not receive when raised by people to the point that they need to be taught/trained to be able to exist in their natural habitat. Of course it's that's not a perfect metaphor for the current situation, but like how do you determine normal for a being that's the first/only one of it's kind?
