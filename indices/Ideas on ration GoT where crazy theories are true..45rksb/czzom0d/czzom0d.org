What about Benjen = Daario = Euron and other similar identity conflations? Implies a pretty horrifying level of deception, like a Faceless Man except able to impersonate people with strong social ties (we see Faceless!Pate slipping up around relative strangers, by contrast).

A shapeshifter that can blend in to an established character so effectively is practically an unstoppable force all on their own if they use their abilities wisely. The Faceless Men are limited both by their ethos and their relatively poor skills at deception; they are still excellent performers, but not so good as the Benjen = Daario = Euron hypothesis implies.
