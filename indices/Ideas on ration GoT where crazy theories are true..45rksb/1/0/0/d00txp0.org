And too far away too.

We're talking about what seems like an ossified feudal society, one that's stayed relatively similar for thousands of years (though there's some doubt cast on how many thousands of years). If you cannot mine some conflict and drama out of this situation...what the fuck can you mine it out of? Dany's storyline, while infuriating, is an example of the writer trying to show the problems of just throwing more unconditional power at the situation and forcing people to change. Even if they are abhorrent, it's fucking /hard/. Now imagine that across all of Westeros.

I think part of the problem is that the problem is too big for most people's expertise. You have the inherent problems of OCPs and then you have to layer on outside, future knowledge and you have to deal with how these medieval people would react to that knowledge and what the knowledge is or can do or can be used to do and so on and so forth all while considering the specific nature of Westeros itself.

You don't need to give Sauron a Death Star when there's already a thousand vibroblade-wielding fighters hiding behind every rock

It's hard. Even the professional ISOT writers who throw people into the past with future knowledge often get a lot of criticism. The level of historical literacy required must be incredible. Then you throw in fanfic problems like writer's focusing more on the plot they read and not the plot they /could/ write...
