A necromancer who works to end death? A noble goal and despicable, though rational, methods? A dozen knife's edge escapes requiring very careful and specific actions? Yes, please!

Hard high fantasy in a Lovecraftian homage, set in the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic universe. As a fan of MLPFiM, I thoroughly enjoyed this epic adventure. As a potential fan of HP Lovecraft, this made me want to read the original works. As a fan of HPMOR, I found the dark lord's plotting and goals eerily reminiscent. Everything about this story, from the outside, says it shouldn't work, yet it works far better than I expected.

The author's other MLP fanwork, /Mendacity/, is also an epic and fascinating read, meant more for fans of Celtic mythology and fantastic races.
