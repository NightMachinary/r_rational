Oh, cool, so there's some canonical basis for her existence.

I was wondering about her personality. She's not like any MLP character I know of, but she also doesn't really fit into the cosmic horror parts. I think she's the author's original creation (name and appearance aside), but if there's a third part to this crossover then I would not be surprised at all.
