As far as I can tell, only the names of Sassaflash and the town Hollow Shades are canonical. Her personality seems to be original, and the town's magical heritage seems to be original Lovecraftian fanfiction set in the pony mythos.

The author has some serious skills at integrating multiple mythoi. The other story on that account is Mendacity, the tale of a changeling and a member of the fey on a road trip. It's high fantasy, art, and it has heart. It's not particularly [[/r/Rational]] material, but it is in a consistently rule-driven universe extended from the show by the author.
