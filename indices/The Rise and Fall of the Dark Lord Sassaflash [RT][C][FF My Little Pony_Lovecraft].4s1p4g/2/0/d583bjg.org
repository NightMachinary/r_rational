That's because the Mule is the audience viewpoint character, and Sassaflash isn't telling her side of things yet. It gets rational when they find the tomb. It gets downright sciency about magic after that, because she knows she needs help and allows the Mule to aid her beyond "move this" and "carry that". (She also gets smarter when she is forced to stop doping herself to dull the pain.)

The forgetting is necessary to prevent apocalypse, as she makes perfectly clear. True, the Lovecraftian things are vast powers unbound by logic from outside spacetime materiality. But in a world overshadowed by such hideous things, she's trying to save her race of sapient beings from their eventual extinction, and all its individuals from death, using the full breadth of her mind and all possible tools at her disposal, disregarding social mores and appropriateness. Totally a [[/r/Rational]] character.
