It's excellently written, with many twists and turns and some great yet believable characters. Highly recommended to cosmic horror fans, and to anyone who likes it when the protagonist is a villain plotting to take over the world. Knowledge of My Little Pony and the Cthulhu Mythos is not required, though each will add some context to the story if you do happen to know it.

The story has some nice rational influences. The Dark Lord Sassaflash's plots make her almost a pony version of General Chaos, particularly when she overestimates herself. The MLP influence shines through, and in the end it's more optimistic than most stories you'll find on here. With a constant undercurrent of horror and tragedy that comes from the Lovecraft parts.
