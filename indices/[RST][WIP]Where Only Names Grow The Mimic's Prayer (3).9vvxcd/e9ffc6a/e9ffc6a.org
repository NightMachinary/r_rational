I'll probably drop to posting this in this sub maybe once a month soon, but right now I'm still in the early desperately-fishing-for-feedback phase, so it's probably okay to be a little shameless.

I'm still finding my feet and not on a proper schedule yet, and looking for ways to maybe tweak the story to improve reader retention. I'm particularly thinking of maybe cutting the first half of the prologue and dispersing the information elsewhere, but I'm not sure it's a good idea or if there are actually even any problems with it. I'm also not sure if the general slow story pace is good for the format, or how I could improve on that if it is. Vagueness vs over-explanation is another thing I've been considering.

If anyone is following, let me know your thoughts! Writing traditional mystery is tough.
