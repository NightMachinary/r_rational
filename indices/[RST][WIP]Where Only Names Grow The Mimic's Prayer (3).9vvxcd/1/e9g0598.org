Plenty to chew on here. I'll hold off on speculation but I think I'm putting a few things together.

Sidney and Sasha work together pretty well, both in the literal sense and that I enjoy reading about their interaction.

Sasha is 2/2 for disappointing food or drink. Get her something tasty, she's working hard!

For what to cut from the prologue, I don't know if the description of Edward is needed in that much detail right off the bat. It might work better as something we get in-between one of the main arcs. I was interested as I originally read the passage, but I think I would have cared more about it if I'd already spent some time with Sasha. Also, I think the bit at the end of Mimic's Prayer (1) works better if you are wondering why Sasha is feeling that way instead of having a decent idea based on Edward's description.

Thank you for the Glossary. It's hard to keep track of what I don't know about the setting because they haven't been revealed yet and what I just missed, so the extra context is very helpful.

Few typos:

#+begin_quote
  alongside a statue of a man holding up *a spears*

  contact with her *my* virtue of my position

  April 22nd, 873.
#+end_quote

(That's from Mimic's Prayer (1). Glossary says Summer Revolution ended in 878, and Michelle was murdered five years after the armistice. I think that's supposed to be 883).

And I'm not sure if this last one is a mistake or not but

#+begin_quote
  where the young swore the First Oath and became full citizens.
#+end_quote

Are they not swearing the full Five Oaths to become full citizens?
