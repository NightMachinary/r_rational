It's tounge-in-cheek, certainly. Creating a Thieves' Guild to give the local mafia bosses legitimacy, but make them answerable to you? That's an insane plan with far too many points of failure.

But the Ankh-Morporkians accept it as normal, and so it works. And I think that's the point. We accept the System that we've got as normal, and so we contribute to it and reap the benefits. Incremental improvement is possible, but it has to come from within the existing framework - the only alternative is a catastrophic change from an Outside Context Problem.

At worst, elections and parties are a local maximum of history. Assassination markets might exist at a different local maximum.

Whatever people accept as normal is normal. If you ask me, there's many parts of the world today that I'd have thought "shouldn't work in real life", but they exist so there must be something to them.
