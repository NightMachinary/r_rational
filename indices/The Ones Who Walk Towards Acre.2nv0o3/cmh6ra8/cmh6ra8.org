Interesting. A lot of that echoes Dr. Cruces and, especially, Lady T'Malia's speech from Terry Pratchett's /Pyramids/. I had occasion to listen to those particular speeches just earlier today watching Mark Oshiro's markreads.net videos for this week - he is currently going through Pratchett's Discworld in publication order at a rate of 5 sections of 20-30 pages each per every fortnight and he /just/ hit the relevant section of Pyramids this week.

From /Pyramids/, part of a lecture given to a class of student assassins:

  'And thus,' she said, 'let us consider the position before the founding of the Guild. In this city, and indeed in many places elsewhere, civilisation is nurtured and progresses by the dynamic interplay of interests among many large and powerful advantage cartels.

  'In the days before the founding of the Guild the seeking of advancement among these consortia invariably resulted in regrettable disagreements which were terminated with extreme prejudice. These were extremely deleterious to the common interest of the city. Please understand that where disharmony rules, commerce flags.

  'And yet, and yet.' She clasped her hands to her bosom. There was a creak like a galleon beating against a gale.

  'Clearly there was a need for an extreme yet responsible means of settling irreconcilable differences,' she went on, 'and thus was laid the groundwork for the Guild. What bliss − ' the sudden peak in her voice guiltily jerked several dozen young men out of their private reveries − 'it must have been to have been present in those early days, when men of stout moral purpose set out to forge the ultimate political tool short of warfare. How fortunate you are now, in training for a guild which demands so much in terms of manners, deportment, bearing and esoteric skills, and yet offers a power once the preserve only of the gods. Truly, the world is the mollusc of your choice . . .

Dr. Cruces' speech is on essentially how pure their motives as profit-seekers are compared to others who kill for reasons of desire, belief, etc.
