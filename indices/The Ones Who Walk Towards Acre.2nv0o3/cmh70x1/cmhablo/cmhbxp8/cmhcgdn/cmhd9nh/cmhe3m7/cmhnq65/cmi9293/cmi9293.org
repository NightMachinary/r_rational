  I will simply note that if each city state has someone in charge of the assassin market that provides an obvious target for someone trying to destroy the tactic.
#+end_quote

Running an assassination market is simpler and easier than running an invasion. These asymmetries are what power the concept, in both the full-strength cryptoanarchist version and my simpler medieval version.

#+begin_quote
  Pretty much all ancient city states and nations and the like had a bunch of norms against anything we'd think of as assassination and murder (such as poisoning, killing people when they're sleeping, taking pay to be a guard or servant and then killing them, etc, etc.)
#+end_quote

They all tended to have small elites too. Funny how that works. See also: current USA rules on who isn't - and who is - allowed to be assassinated.

#+begin_quote
  I submit, however, that if you have all the elements that list of assumptions requires sorted out adequately you can probably do better than the assassin plan for peace.
#+end_quote

I submit that none of those assumptions are realistically what is necessary.
