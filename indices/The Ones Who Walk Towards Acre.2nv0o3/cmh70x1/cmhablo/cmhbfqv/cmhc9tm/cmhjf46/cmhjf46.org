I still don't really get it...are you saying assassination is just too expensive? Why can't people pitch in for assassination /now/?

Okay, so you're both fighting over something, right? In one case, both of you acquire soldiers (or, if one of "you" is a disorganized mob, you fight and the "wages" are collectively winning at whatever it is you are fighting about). Soldiers from both sides kill each other. It is expensive and bloody. Both sides /also/ attempt assassination, if possible, to make it less expensive and bloody. Basically, all parties interested in harming each other try their best to harm each other.

Okay, now the fictional case: I'm a group of people in the fictional world, and I want to secede with half the land, or something. I can pitch in blood money for all members of Acre-gov who oppose allowing me to secede. They do the same for me. I hire body guards, necessitating a higher price for my death due to higher difficulty. They hire body guards, necessitating a higher price for my death. We both ramp up our "armies" via ever-more bodyguards and assassins.

But wait, are we alone? Surely we can't secede with no political support, or we'll be assassinated. Oh, that's right- all our respective political supporters are pitching in for the hiring of bodyguards and assassins, like a great game of chess. Surely, the assassins kill the bodyguards at times - perhaps there are even sub-bounties on the body-guards, corresponding to strategic importance. We can increase the number of supporters by sharing the bounty with with them in proportion to their investment, and at that point it becomes eerily like a stock market.

But even if the leader is killed, the political supporters are still there. They're still going to want to secede. So they just send someone else when the King is down to take over the government. If desire is high enough and it's strategically advantageous, it's not that hard to just ditch the "take over the government" step altogether and start attacking civilians directly, instead of sending soldiers /ahem/ I mean assassins and bodyguards to play capture the flag with the political leader.

...and it goes on. The longer time one spends thinking about this, the more it just starts looking like regular war, with some complications thrown in, and not actually something that would cause people who stuck to the system to have an edge to people who just went in old fashioned.
