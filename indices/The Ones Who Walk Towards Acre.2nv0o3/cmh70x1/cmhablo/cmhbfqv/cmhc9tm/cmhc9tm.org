Right now it's not an option. Or rather, it's an 'option' in much the same way that becoming a billionaire or sailing around the world is an 'option' for people - yes, it may be physically possible in some sense, but it's extremely difficult for most people & an all or nothing thing, and as any economist could tell you about price floors, they lead to much fewer transactions.
