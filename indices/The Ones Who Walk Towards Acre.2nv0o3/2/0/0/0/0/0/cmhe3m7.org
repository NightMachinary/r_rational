  The payout for every assassination of a Roman General might be responded to by offering a large bounty from the Romans on the paying authorities' head. And then they retaliate.

The paying authorities aren't the ones trying to organize an invasion - they simply want to maintain their decentralized status quo, not lead a fragile organization to war. (More than one army has been defeated simply by waiting.)

The paying authorities have more to lose in a regular war and less to lose in an assassination war - the situation is not symmetric in terms of offense vs defense, nor is there necessarily the same number of leaders (in a confederation of city-states, who's the 'leader' equivalent to that of the general of a invasion?). Consider just the financial aspect: the defenders aren't supplying or paying an entire army (which is extremely expensive) so pound for pound have more money to spare, and can put everything into bounties if they want to.
