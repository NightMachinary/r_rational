I was going to write something long and complicated responding to this argument, but I will simply note that if each city state has someone in charge of the assassin market that provides an obvious target for someone trying to destroy the tactic.

That said: There would also be major incentives not to institute such a tactic for most groups of city states in history. Pretty much all ancient city states and nations and the like had a bunch of norms against anything we'd think of as assassination and murder (such as poisoning, killing people when they're sleeping, taking pay to be a guard or servant and then killing them, etc, etc.) Pretty much all of these ancient codes of morality/fairness in war and killing basically worked to reinforce the ruling class's advantages and disempower the third estate. In medieval times, knights and trained fighters had better nutrition and food, better training, better equipment and materials, and relatively small numbers - so the ethical rules of the society were that you didn't gang up on people, poison food, slit throats while asleep, etc. This naturally served to empower the warriors and fighters and noble castes over the others. Legalizing, normalizing, and making ethical and common and a major option in all disputes the idea of assassination would naturally empower the weak against the strong, and the strong and powerful of the time would perhaps be unwise to advocate for it's use - I can't see it working out great for any existing nobility and authority to legitimize the practice of cutting monarchs' throats or shooting dukes with crossbows from whatever the medieval equivalent of a book depository is. And assuming that we have perfect coordination and smart game theoreticians as nobility in all or at least many city states to implement the assassin guild plan but that those wealthy and powerful people would not try to think through the logic of perpetuating their own wealth and power seems very optimistic.

If you had a decentralized alliance of consensusing city states commited working together for their common good and productivity and wealth-generation like they had all read relatively modern economic texts and understood the value of labour and how to grow economies by specialization and reducing overheads from unnecessary governmental costs to allow for investment in infrastructure to increase productivity even more, and they all wanted to prevent each other from raising armies and none had existing armies or indeed power structures or authority figures of any sort, the assassin solution would probably work, assuming also perfect coordination between and among the city-states, perfect legitimacy and fairness and honor among the assassin paymasters, and reliable extremely skilled assassins in plentitude willing to risk their lives for filthy lucre in perpetuity against any target no matter how protected and how unlikedly the assassin's escape alive, and finally a highly educated general populace or at least leadership in each city-state group that is comprised with a high percentage of game-theoreticians and highly intelligent people that will understand the desirable equilibrium that could result from going along with this all. I submit, however, that if you have all the elements that list of assumptions requires sorted out adequately you can probably do better than the assassin plan for peace.
