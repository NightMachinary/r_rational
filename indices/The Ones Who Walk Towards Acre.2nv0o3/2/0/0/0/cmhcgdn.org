  Assassination and murder were already a leading cause of death in the emperors in Roman times, with additional huge cause of death being likely participating in a war; that didn't seem to dissuade Emperors of Rome from war all that much. I mean, if the major enemies of Rome had offered a big cash bonus for the head of a Roman emperor whenever those emperors declared war, do you think that the emperors would have never gone to war?

The Roman system incentivized war as a way of obtaining prestige & wealth for the leading general so they could progress along the cursus honorum, build up a following, and buy support; if the standard response to a Roman invasion by, say, the Parthians or the Sassanids was putting a huge price on the general's head and usually succeeding, ambitious young generals might think twice before sailing east to find their fortune.

If the death rate from assassination for all generals (and of course, bounties could be set on lower ranking officers too) was a third per campaign - not per lifetime in the most coveted highest office in the land - or higher, then perhaps the Roman elites would find some other ways to handle their status games.
