Scott Alexander (Yvain) linked [[http://www.theawl.com/2012/05/roman-emperor-deaths][The List of Roman Emperors in Order of How Hardcore Their Deaths Were]] some time ago in one of his essays (can't remember which one).

One can't help but notice that of 84 of them, there were some ambiguous maybe-murders (5 total: 60, 59, 54, 41, 18) and a lot of pretty unambiguous murders (24 total: 53, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 40, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 12, 11, 10, 9, 3). Only about a quarter of them died of natural causes or incidents that might be accidents, less than the fraction assassinated, with the majority of the remainder losing wars and being executed or killed after that or dying in battle.

Assassination and murder were already a leading cause of death in the emperors in Roman times, with additional huge cause of death being likely participating in a war; that didn't seem to dissuade Emperors of Rome from war all that much. I mean, if the major enemies of Rome had offered a big cash bonus for the head of a Roman emperor whenever those emperors declared war, do you think that the emperors would have never gone to war? Just because the murder is legal in the land you are going to war against, doesn't likely mean that the emperor will necessarily be murdered. Indeed, if you know that there's a land that has a city which will pay a gigantic sum of money for you to be murdered because some people dislike you, that is also very definitely an incentive to put the city to the torch and ride off into the sunset with all it's assassin-money for all it's potential victims in a big sack if at all possible. The only way to make it work is to have every society switch to this system spontaneously and homogeneously and stay that way.

In modern times such a system might conceivably be made to work better, of course - distributed cryptocurrencies and similar wealth transfers that are independent of a specific prinicipality and are for most practical purposes unseizable and unconquerable, for example. But I don't really see it working in medieval or similarly unsophisticated society as in the story - and the problem with assassination to affect politics in a modern society, almost every major politician is a figurehead and replaceable with others representing more-or-less the exact same sets of interests, and killing civilians, even those you disagree with, isn't viewed as a deterent to war so much as a causus belli.
