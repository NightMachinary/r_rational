  I still don't really get it...are you saying assassination is just too expensive? Why can't people pitch in for assassination now?

I'm saying assassination is a coordination problem: there are many people who would value a leader's death but at something far below the expected-value 'trying to assassinate the leader themselves, probably failing, and losing their life'. If I tried to kill Obama, I would probably fail (not being the sort of person who makes a good hitman or sniper or has the resources to properly prepare), and I do not want a small chance of him dead more than I want to not throw away my life. I might, however, value his death at $10k, which is something I can spend, and along with all the other people who want him, put up a big enough pot so that some deadeye ex-special-forces can spend a year preparing and whack him and retire on it.

(I can climb a mountain, step by step; I cannot leap it in a single bound.)

  But even if the leader is killed, the political supporters are still there. They're still going to want to secede. So they just send someone else when the King is down to take over the government.

Think carefully about what you're claiming in your little story here: that leaders literally do not matter at all, 0%, have no power at all, and that the masses decide and execute everything. Does that sound like reality to you? Think about why the Mongols didn't conquer Europe too.
