One question left: Why /Acre/? As in, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel][Akko]], the actual city across the bay from me?

And my main objection, still mounted after all this time since reading it the first time: Gwern's lack of a model for how to run a society with zero systematic violence is not a proof that doing so is impossible. It's not even a proof that doing so is /improbable/, since /the map is not the territory/. Hell, many modern First World countries /already/ run with very minimal systematic violence and ever-more-unobtrusive systemic violence, /and I say this as a devoted socialist/.

I feel a rant coming on, and it's the same one as always: /pain is not Bayesian evidence, and darkness is not a probability!/
