So I suggested on the other thread to add "prev/next" thing on top of text in addition to bottom, so we don't have to scroll down.

I have another suggestion though. You don't seem to have a table of contents. Yea, the stuff on home page is adequate now, but if you'll have hundreds of chapters, it's really not.
