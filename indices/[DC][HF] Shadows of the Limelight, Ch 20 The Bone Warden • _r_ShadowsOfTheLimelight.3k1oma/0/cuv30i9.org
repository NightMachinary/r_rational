It's interesting that on some level what's going on here is a legitimate worldwide revolution. The magic system in SotL is cool, but by nature it causes concentration of power. A democratic or semi-democratic system won't really work, not when a small number of heroes or a single ruler could seize power and control it to make themselves more powerful. Although there are the same forces for a new government in this world, they're fighting greater enemies than our intellectuals did. With an artifact, though, one like that, there's hope for something better.

The Iron King, for all his horrors, at least created an urban-seeming society, with towers and elevators and maybe a better life for some of his citizens. How rare that must be! How much more common it must be for people to be effectively rule by fear and for fear and power to feed upon themselves, fame breeding fame for a ruler of a kingdom. With the artefacts, perhaps a new world is possible. The conspiracy may not be all bad, though they do not seem particularly morally virtuous.

Welexi also seems a little villainous for what he did to Dominic, but if his goal is to preserve what he views as the only way to have a stable society, he did what was necessary, ugly though it was.
