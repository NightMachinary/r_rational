I broadly agree. But kindness too is an effective way to improve one's standing. Illustrati who go around bettering their community (in obvious and memorable ways, of course) may not be as rare as you think.

Also, while the artifacts have the potential to create a better society, they also have the potential to concentrate even more power in the hands of an even smaller group of people, who couldn't even be challenged by other illustrati if they go too far.

(Welexi has gone power-mad - or, quite possibly, has been replaced by a shapeshifter a while back - and is barely even trying to hide it any more. I wouldn't put much hope in whatever his goal is.)
