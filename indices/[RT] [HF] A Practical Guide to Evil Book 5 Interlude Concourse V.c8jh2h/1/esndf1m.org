Goddamnit Cat what is that timing? I mean yeah it would have been bad if the Grand Alliance was sundered, but you've been offering to go as far as possible for Cordelia for the last two books, it's only karma for her to suffer from her past decisions. Also love the chain of misunderstandings and how Hakram was this close to using it all as leverage for one of Cat's major goals. Also that Rozala saw that there were larger consequences but that she's already been ordered to back Cat to the hilt.
