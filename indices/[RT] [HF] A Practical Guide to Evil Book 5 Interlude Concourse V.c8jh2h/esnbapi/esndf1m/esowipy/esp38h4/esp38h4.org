They're aware that Archer was resurrected.

I think Tyrant already made it out and his forces were observed to be retreatinf

I think the main points for it being Cat are:

- that they arrive at dawn
- two figures hobbling in
- narrative weight being with Cat and Pilgrim, especially in this moment. It being Archer and Rogue would be anticlimactic. Masego was already whisked away by Ivah IIRC
