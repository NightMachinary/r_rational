So, everyone's assuming it's Cat and Pilgrim, did I miss the part where Archer, Rogue Sorcerer, and Hierophant had already made their way back? If I'm remembering correctly Cat said that she'd be a while longer as everyone else headed back, but I don't remember them being announced as having returned. Same with tyrant, though he was crawling last he was described so I doubt he caught up with anyone.

It'd be weird for two people to return, and the way it's written

  Princess of Aequitan felt the world change

would make you assume it's Cat and Pilgrim, but it could also be a 'world changing' event if it's say Archer and Hierophant, since visions of Archer dying were seen, or if it ends up Tyrant and one of the others due to some honest trickery.

It's a stretch, but Tyrant tends to make stretches much more likely when he's involved.
