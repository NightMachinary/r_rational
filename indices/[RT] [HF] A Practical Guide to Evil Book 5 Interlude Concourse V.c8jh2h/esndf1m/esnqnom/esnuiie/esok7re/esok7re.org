We don't know if Tariq's going to support her bid. He might though: his main concern in not was keeping the Grand Alliance from being destroyed over it. Cordelia's taken full control over Procer (not that he knows, but the Ophanim might tell him), and Levant's amenable since Cat resurrected Pilgrim. Ashur's a concern, but they've been made irrelevant for a generation, with the fleet being destroyed and Assassin wiping out the third tier. They're definitely in a good position to push to join.
