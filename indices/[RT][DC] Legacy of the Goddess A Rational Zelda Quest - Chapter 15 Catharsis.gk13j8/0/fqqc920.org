Thanks for the chapter, QMs! It's a very interesting decision point.

Some thoughts on each of Zelda's potential approaches:

*Ruler Zelda*

/Pros:/

- More direct control over politics in Hyrule.
- More direct control over military resources in Hyrule.
- More direct access to information that comes through Hyrule.
- More time and ability to work on Zelda's research projects, which may help with large-scale issues in the nation.
- /Probably/ lower risk of Zelda being killed, but this is hard to adjudicate due to unknown levels of assassins and other risks vs. the risk factors from adventuring.
- Zelda's appearance within the kingdom has significant potential to improve morale.
- Placing Zelda in a central location may help manage events once we're dealing with larger scale map-wide issues.
- A lot of the cool adventurer stuff that Zelda wants to do (e.g. going for fragments) could be potentially done more effectively by others (e.g. Link or another powerhouse marked).
- Zelda being able to negotiate directly may be superior for things like talking to the zora, gorons, etc. than having someone who is not perceived to be as high status do it.

/Cons:/

- Zelda has been noted to not be particularly deft at politics. This may improve over time.
- We, as players, do not appear to have a strong enough grasp on the politics to necessarily make optimal choices in regards to resource allocation. There is a very real risk that political actions we take may be worse than what the default would be in Zelda's absence.
- Zelda doesn't seem very enthusiastic about this option.

*Adventurer Zelda*

/Pros:/

- She would probably be sincerely happier this way.
- Assuming we link her up with Link (heh), keeping them together may help with both their happiness and their survivability. They've each saved each other once already.
- If we split her and Link up (which would have to be a separate call), we can potentially race for fragments and dungeons much faster than Link could do it on his own.
- Higher potential to get Zelda direct power upgrades.
- If we find Wisdom fragments, she can potentially bond them immediately. I'd like to note that this could be a huge benefit if we get enough to clarify our dreams or help detect other fragments.
- Likely higher rate of VP earning due to heroing, but I don't want to lean on this because we don't know enough about the mechanics.
- Higher chance of unlocking Lightsworn powers for Zelda, if those require visiting specific locations.

/Cons:/

- More direct, obvious risks, like the risks from dungeons themselves.
- Fewer people to protect Zelda directly.
- Hyrule running without us is going to be a problem eventually; someone like Taetus is very likely to take over in our absence. Ever returning to power there may be difficult.
- If we're not in Hyrule, it's more likely that they could make alliances we disagree with, or directly subvert plans that are integral to our overall success with our world-saving agenda.
- Less time and access to resources for magical research.

*Overall Assessment*

We're faced with potentially huge problems regardless of which route we choose. Either route could lead to Zelda just getting killed (assassins at home, dungeons or monsters otherwise, etc.) A political coup by someone who is taking orders from Demise could be catastrophic, and our absence makes that easier. Ganondorf getting fragments (and other resources of value) faster than us could also be catastrophic.

Currently, my leaning is toward a middle-ground solution. I don't think we can fully abandon Hyrule, but we are not necessarily the best equipped to handle ruling it directly. I also see there being some situations outside of Hyrule that Zelda may be best equipped to handle - notably, immediately bonding any wisdom fragments, as well as political dealings with certain factions like the gorons.

My current leaning is to do something like:

- Have Zelda head back to Hyrule proper and share the situation with her council.
- Choose someone that we feel is politically savvier than we are - but can still be trusted - to become the regent.
- Install the regent in a public ceremony to improve morale while we build up a reputation for Hero Queen Zelda, Champion of Hylia. Make it clear that she is not abandoning our kingdom, but out actively working against the mastermind of the blin and uniting the world against this devious power.
- Plan for the regent to mark other council members, allowing us access to their thoughts and motives. We can rotate which ones are active to check for potential betrayals. (We may have to check how long it takes to make marks active and inactive; if we can do it super rapidly, we could potentially have daily checks for every marked to make sure they have not been compromised.)
- Once we've done what we can to get the kingdom stable under the control of the regent and council, we can send Zelda out again, either with Link or with a second team.

(This is not a formal plan; I'd like to discuss it with people before making it one.)

Alternatively, we could take the opposite approach and mark a third marked to go adventuring in Zelda's place.
