  She was /not/ going to worry about Link. She was going to relax and hit things. /thwack!/ Link would be fine. She had asked Koja to look after him. /thwack!/ Koja could handle her brother just fine. It would be no problem for her to make sure Link looked after himself. /thwack!/

I think you might have unwittingly assigned Link another therapist, Zelda. I'm sure it will be fine though.

  “Mmhmm,” Laylith said. “And why is the dummy wearing a red wig and makeup?”
#+end_quote

Lol, just practicing for when we back-stab the Lynx... After we save the world obviously.

#+begin_quote
  “You /could/ do that,” Laylith said. “But how about something fun instead?”
#+end_quote

Uh, Laylith? This is Queen 'drug addict' Zelda you're talking to...

#+begin_quote
  “/Ha!/ Yeah, I'm fine,” Zelda said, feeling giddy. She broke out into a fit of hysterical laughter. “Heheh. Hahaha---/ahahahahah!/”
#+end_quote

Called it.

#+begin_quote
  Link had been in favor of setting up right next to the oasis, but Koja was insistent that she didn't want to risk dealing with more bandits if they could help it.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how this is going to help with your therapy jo--

#+begin_quote
  Link appreciated working with Ryn. With her it was always simple and straightforward. No unnecessary banter.
#+end_quote

Wait, Koja are you doing what I think you're doing?

#+begin_quote
  She peered back over her shoulder. “No? Just saying, we're out here all alone. By ourselves. Not expected back anytime soon. Nobody around for /miles/. No one has to know.” She winked.
#+end_quote

You are! Also Link sticks his foot into his mouth at least half a dozen times. I'll spare him the indignity of me laughing at him. And Ryn, actually Fi's around. But I'm sure that won't be a problem.

  “/A Warlord!/ We've slain another Warlord!”
#+end_quote

2 down, 1 to go!

#+begin_quote
  She started with the war report. It didn't have much more high-level information than what Olvas had already provided---mostly dry details on logistics and troop movements as per usual. She was certain Link would be ecstatic to look over it when he returned. Speaking of...

  “Fi? Could you let Link know what Olvas told me? About the Warlord? I'm certain he'll be excited to hear it. And let him know the reports are waiting for him when he returns.”

  /Yes, Mistress. I will do so./
#+end_quote

...Yes, Link is going to be ecstatic about Fi telling him the good news.

#+begin_quote
  /I request in the strongest possible terms that you not involve the Faith in matters of governance and diplomacy. I would like to speak with you personally at the earliest convenience./
#+end_quote

Uh, oh. Aunt Vestele is /mad/! Ministers Against Delegating

#+begin_quote
  One last thing to do for the day, and then she could rest. Zelda was determined to keep it brief. It was just business. Just a mutual update of information. That's all. Five minutes and she'd be back in her tent. Ten at most.
#+end_quote

Not if we players have anything to say about it. And we won't. Because we will definitely not stuff our plans with tons of questions.

#+begin_quote
  If you have any actual suggestions as to how I can do /more/---please! I'm all ears.
#+end_quote

Preach it! Sister! She won't have any, because it's Shesan, but it's the thought that counts.

#+begin_quote
  More than conjecture, but nothing specific. Call it a hunch.
#+end_quote

..That's pretty much the same thing.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure.
#+end_quote

I think your catch-phrase could use a little, something. Maybe some more confidence? Not sure though.
