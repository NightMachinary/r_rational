[Decision: Zelda]

*Plan: To Rule Hyrule*

*Broad concept:* Both abandoning Hyrule and allowing the world to be destroyed are unacceptable. Therefore, to best ensure the survival of her kingdom and the world as a whole, Zelda begins moving on a plan to attempt to address both issues to the best of her ability. To do this, she will designate a regent to rule in her place and mark the regent. This will give Fi information on what the regent is thinking that can be relayed to Zelda, ensuring the regent's loyalty. It also gives Zelda immediate communication with the regent regardless of location.

Once a regent is delegated and she has taken some immediate steps to stablize the kingdom and raise morale, she will head out to seek fragments and other ways to save the world. While adventuring, she expand her efforts on magical research, conveying useful discoveries to her kingdom that could improve the war effort and the daily lives of her citizenry.

*Future Plans:* Everything below this point is intended to be an idea of what we'd be doing for the /next/ plan. QMs may ignore the section below for the time being if desired; I will repost it (likely in modified form) after the dungeon crawl.

*Next Steps:*

- Zelda makes the decision to designate a regent and resume her adventuring. The specific regent will be chosen after she gets back.
- (OPTIONAL): She asks Laylith what Laylith's impressions of the council members are in order to get another data point on who to make the regent.
- Zelda conserves VP until she is informed the dungeon crawl is completed, using it only for emergencies and safety, in order to give Link the ability to spend VP/mana safely during his dungeon crawl.
- Zelda realizes that some of her magical projects may be more applicable now than ever before, especially because she has access to new tools in the form of old magic and Fi. Once Link's dungeon crawl is completed, she begins working on research projects while traveling back to Hyrule, brainstorming ideas with Laylith and testing things with Fi when possible.

*Research Ideas:*

While traveling, Zelda will attempt any of the following projects that she personally feels, based on her magical expertise, have any reasonable likelihood of success. She will employ reasonable safety precautions, such as putting Luck spells up before testing anything potentially dangerous, Foretelling right beforehand if applicable, and having a healer nearby (but outside of any predicted potential blast radius). If applicable, she may have someone else physically do any dangerous components of the testing and stand nearby to do the healing herself.

/Rod/Imbue Research/:

- Attempt to draw on Blue Burst and Blue Imbue at the same time with the intent of creating an ice rod.
- If this does not work, attempt to mix a Blue Burst with a Green Imbue and see what happens.
- Attempt to imbue an item with all three colors of magic at once in a sufficient quantity that it would normally cause the item to glow and reach the state of conceptual improvement. See what happens.
- If none of the previous methods have caused the creation of a new form of item, but also have not caused anything dangerous to occur, attempt a triple color imbue + Blue Burst on the same item if it is physically possible to do so.
- If we manage to get a triple imbued item, but it doesn't seem to do anything different than a normal imbued item, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP to see if that does anything.
- If we manage to get an item to hold both an imbue and a burst, but that doesn't make it into an elemental rod, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP.
- If none of the mixed imbues work, attempt to power a normal imbued item with up to 50 VP and see if that does anything.
- If any of the tests seem like they are noticeably working toward successfully making something like an ice rod, spend up to 500 VP to make a functional ice rod.

/Empower Research/:

- Spend up to 50 VP attempting to research the Empowerment function that was used on Zelda with the intent of learning how to create a scaling version of the effect with variable power output.
- Utilize any data that Fi has available from pre-empowerment Zelda, during empowerment Zelda, post-empowerment Zelda, and other baseline scans of Hyleans in this research process.
- Also utilize information from other forms of temporary magic transfer, e.g. siphon, and similar abilities such as Marking, Imbue Object, and Invigorate.
- *Intended magic goal:* /Scaleable Empowerment/ - This empowers the target, temporarily granting them a tremendous increase in ability by suffusing them with old magic. The level of improvement scales with VP expended, with a minimum expenditure of 100 VP and no upper limit. This lasts a variable duration based on the VP expended in this process.

/Triforce Research/:

- Spend 10 VP on general scans on Zelda and the fragments when they are not obviously in use to develop baseline data for them.
- Spend up to 50 VP running scans on Zelda and her fragments while Zelda is sleeping, attempting to discern any changes in Zelda's mental and spiritual state that may be linked to the wisdom fragments activating and giving her prophetic dreams.
- Spend another 10 VP scanning Zelda when she casts Fortelling to see if there are any similarities.

*Plans for After Returning Home*:

- Get updated on the current situation. Assess regent candidates. Choose a regent.
- Explain marks to the council.
- Mark the regent and explain that the regent will be marking other council members over time (or Zelda will directly if she is present at the right time).
- Explain VP conservation rules to the regent and make sure they are not using VP frivolously.
- Plan to also mark members of other species, e.g. goron, zora, etc. to help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities.
- Make a public speech to raise morale before leaving her kingdom again, both to raise support for the regent and to clarify that she is not abandoning the kingdom - she is gathering allies (like the gerudo and zora) and taking the war to the enemy.
- If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.
- Based on the results of the dungeon crawl and any information gained during this time frame, plot a plan for Zelda to either meet with Link to continue adventuring in his company or set off without him.

*Taken from [[/u/Mathematicae]]:*

- Meet with Vestele personally, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using it for more power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
- Get some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly so Fi can listen in and be capable of translating the language. If we can have Zelda and Fi relay translations for the dungeon crew if need be that would be nice too.

*Fi Memory Projects:*

Defer this to a future update or ignore entirely if the QMs do not feel it is appropriate to include in this update.

- Ask Fi if Marking someone who speaks another language would give Fi an easier time comprehending that language.
- If Fi consents and believes there is any possibility of success, attempt to use Healing magic to restore Fi's lost memories. If this does not work or seem viable to Fi/Zelda, discuss if it may be possible to restore Fi's lost memories through other means, such as direct applications of VP.
