*Plan Shesan is not Gandalf: [Decision Zelda]*

Sheshan's only goal is stop Demise and she would, by her own admission, happily sacrifice Hyrule if need be, but that isn't true for Zelda. If she saves the world and Hyrule is destroyed, then the victory wouldn't be bittersweet, just bitter. Just like how she felt after the battle of Castletown, /never again/.

Furthermore, the resources of the kingdom are not entrusted to her for free. She's made promises to her vassals like Niabi, and indeed to every Hylian. They trust her to work to further the kingdom. If she betrays that trust, the kingdom's resources will eventually be refused to her. And besides, Wymar, Lensa, Vestele, and even Taetus wouldn't help her sacrifice Hyrule.
