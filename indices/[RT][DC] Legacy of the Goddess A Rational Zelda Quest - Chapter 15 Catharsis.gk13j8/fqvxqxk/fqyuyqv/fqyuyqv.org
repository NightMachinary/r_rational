I approve of this.

I would also like to recommend adding the following:

- Signaling whistle (if available), for in case the party gets separated.
- Easily usable hunting traps that could be deployed in a dungeon environment (e.g. bear traps), if available and if the party has the relevant skills to use.
- Empty bottles for liquids that may need to be collected.
- Empty bags for loot that needs to be collected.
- If someone has the skill set to use it safely and it's available, possibly a couple vials of acid. Could be useful for eating through locks quietly, destroying traps, etc.

I'd like to emphasize that we should not bring any traps or tools (e.g. poison, acid, etc.) we cannot safely use.
