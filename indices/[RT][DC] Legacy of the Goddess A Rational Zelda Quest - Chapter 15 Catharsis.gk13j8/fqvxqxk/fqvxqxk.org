Decision Link

*Plan: Link's Adventuring Kit*

Based on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOJV6B7MSJ5dAVx7HdJ5T4YPTCmQtqMjyTWwfD1asvQ/edit][google doc]] [[/u/Cariyaga][u/Cariyaga]] kindly made.

General approach: Liberally use Scry/Foretelling before entering rooms to look for traps and any magic applicable during dive. Have Fi convert 700 VP to MP during the trip. Tell Zelda that the trip is beginning and to not have Fi use VP/MP unless critical. Also ask her to find a Gerudo in case we need to translate something. +Have Ryn take point.+

Equipment:

- Ink, Paper (several sheafs)
- Reference Material, Gerudo (mostly useless, but pictures may help)
- Rapid-onset poisons, antidotes (intended for use with meat if dangerous beasties are encountered)
- If and only if it's possible to conceal meat from critters with sniffers effectively, extra meat for the former
- Chalk (multicolored if available, one set per person.)
- Magnifying glass
- Hourglass
- Small balance (for weight comparisons)
- Extra water
- Bandages, lengths of cloth
- Lengths of wood, long and short (usable as splints, crutches, half a litter or 10-foot-poles at their longest)
- Small and medium-sized hooks
- Bindings of various forms (ropes in quantity, twine, glues, etc.)
- Needles, both sewing and operating
- Sutures
- Fishing line, fish hooks, weights
- Small and medium-sized wrench (if available)
- Candles, torches, lanterns, hat-mounted lanterns if available
- Air bladder (to be used if swimming is a necessity)
- Oil (for burning, in quantity and apportioned such that it may be used)
- Chain
- Caltrops, in quantity
- Marbles, in quantity
- Small mirror
- Pitons, hammer
- Grappling hook
- Compass
- Spyglass
- Whittling tool
- Climbing harness (one each)
- Crowbar
- Lockpicks (if one of the party knows how to use them)
- Metal file
- Hollow reed
- Metal wedge
- Fi's Void Magic Radar item
- Desert camo change of clothes
- Flint and Steel
- Tarp
- Signaling whistle (if available), for in case the party gets separated.
- Easily usable hunting traps that could be deployed in a dungeon environment (e.g. bear traps), if available and if the party has the relevant skills to use.
- Empty bottles for liquids that may need to be collected.
- Empty bags for loot that needs to be collected.
- If someone has the skill set to use it safely and it's available, possibly a couple vials of acid. Could be useful for eating through locks quietly, destroying traps, etc.
