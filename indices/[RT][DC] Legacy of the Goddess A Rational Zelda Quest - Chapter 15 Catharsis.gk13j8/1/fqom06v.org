+*Voting time!*+ E: Voting has ended.

We are tentatively proceeding with the planned live DM session for the Obsidian Spire. Assuming we can get the requisite work done over the weekend, it will happen sometime next week. If not, we will publish an opening scene, take another vote, and proceed more conventionally. There is an open vote in the [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/588230711987798026/710528153461719111][Discord]] regarding the best day for this.

In the meantime, we are opening two votes on two topics:

(1) How does Zelda resolve her dissonance at the end of the chapter? What do you think her overall outlook and disposition should be? Your choice will inform her characterization going forward.

(2) What preparation has The Party to Totally Lay Waste to all Evil done prior to setting out for the Obsidian Spire? In terms of shopping, supplies, etc? And in general terms, what is Link's approach? What does he plan to do himself, and how does he plan to utilize his team?

*Note*: Supplies are constrained by simulationism and also by what has already been shown onscreen. Any supplies must be light enough and small enough to be carried by four people riding horses across the desert for several days. In absence of specifics we will assume a sane default loadout -- this is to allow for interesting ideas, not to have you play tetris with Link's inventory.

Similar to before, please preface plans with something similar to [Decision: Zelda] or [Decision: Link] for them to count. Approval voting for plans you agree with can be done by replying with a comment stating your approval. Keep in mind these are intended as relatively straightforward decision points. Thousand-word essays aren't required unless you just really dig that sort of thing.

--------------

Your previous Void Power total was 2291.

Fi used 9 VP for telepathic communications and 70 VP for seven intangible avatars.

Fi used 465 VP restoring stamina for Link & co.'s horses over five-and-a-half days. They were able to push the horses about 30% harder than normal without strain, though the horses required more food and water to compensate. This was easily made up by looting the bandit camps they encountered. For some reason one of the bandit camps had several crates of bananas.

Fi used 151 magic restoring Link. She converted 178 VP to magic to restore the total to 400 as per the SOP.

Chapter 15 spanned 5 days, and during that time you earned 136 VP from Zelda and 149 VP from Link.

You have earned 165 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250), maintaining the same bonus from last chapter since this chapter was effectively a timeskip. Total = 825.

*You currently have 2679 Void Power.*
