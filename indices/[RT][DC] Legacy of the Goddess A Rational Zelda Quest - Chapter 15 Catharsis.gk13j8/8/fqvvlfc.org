I'm going to list out some additional things I'm hoping for Zelda to do. If you have other ideas then chime in below. If it's written down, then we're more likely to remember to include it with our next plan.

1. Blindscriers (aka optical telegraphs). Based on my +extensive research+ reading of wikipedia it seems like it was mostly used for military and administrative purposes, not economic like Zelda originally intended. I think the project might work better if she talked to Wymar about linking Castletown with the three main border forts (Talos, Hylia's Watch, and Last Bastion). This could replace the scry network freeing up valuable blue mages or be in addition to the scry network to allow more bandwidth.
2. Meet with Vestele personally, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using it for more power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
3. Getting some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly so Fi can listen in and be capable of translating the language. If we can have Zelda and Fi relay translations for the dungeon crew if need be that would be nice too.
4. Some more testing with Imbuing and marking. One thing proposed was imbuing and object and then trying to mark it.
5. Marking an actual person and finding someone suitable and politically acceptable to bond with the Power fragment. Taetus and Naibi have both been proposed.

Edit:

1. Zelda keeps working on physical training. Maybe practice with Izu on using foretelling since she's best at blue magic.
