Well, that would be spoilers.

I will say that as a general rule I tend to dislike repeating myself, and I think 'go to place and kill person' probably would not make for terribly compelling reading by the tenth one - seems like you would eventually just have action and planning without any character change or plot revelation. (Not to say that it's impossible I would decide to do that, and some TV shows can manage on doing monster of the week, but if you're worried that it would drag on after a while, then yes, I would share that concern.)

(Edit: If you're asking whether they all exist, that is, if they are all something other than a number, then yes, they are, because I love world-building wankery.)
