I'm more concerned about quickly giving up on the other (43?) zones. It seems like pumping MEN should give you more options in regards to things that can't be punched until the get better or at least there should be someone out there figuring out what went wrong with the Rising Lands and how it could be reversed. "Help X research gather data for project Y" seems like a common enough RPG trope but I guess the group wouldn't realise that looking for things that Joon can do on his own. Anyway the proper way to get low difficulty side quests is obviously to go into a local bar and buy a drink to the most depressed looking person there.
