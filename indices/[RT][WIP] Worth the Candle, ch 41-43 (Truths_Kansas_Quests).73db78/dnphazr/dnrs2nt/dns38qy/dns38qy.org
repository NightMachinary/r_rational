I've considered it, sure, but don't plan on doing it. After this is finished, I'll probably try to get in contact with an agent or publisher in order to get some it properly published, like with an editor and cover art and everything. If that doesn't work, then I'll pay out-of-pocket to get it self-published with a decent level of professionalism.

Part of what's working for me right now is that I don't have commitments to anyone and I'm not writing for anyone's sake but my own, which gives me a lot of freedom that (I think) has helped with keeping output/quality high.
