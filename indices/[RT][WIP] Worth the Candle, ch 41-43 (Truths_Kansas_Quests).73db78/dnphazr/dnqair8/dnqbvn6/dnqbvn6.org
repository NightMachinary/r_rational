Yeah, but I'm really frickin' lazy. I keep thinking that I should make a TV Tropes page too, but then I think that seems like work, and I don't do it, because I would rather put my efforts toward writing.

Also, I'm not sure that they take submissions from things hosted on Ao3:

#+begin_quote
  Note: we do not list stories on large sites like FictionPress or Authonomy, as they have their own very extensive communities, and we really can't handle the volume.
#+end_quote

That's from their [[http://webfictionguide.com/about/submissions/][submissions]] page, and it's unclear whether Ao3 would count as a large site - I'd assume it would, but have no idea, and that means that it's more work and might just be pointless. (Also, Mother of Learning is on FictionPress, and still listed, so I don't think that's actually accurate to their policy.)
