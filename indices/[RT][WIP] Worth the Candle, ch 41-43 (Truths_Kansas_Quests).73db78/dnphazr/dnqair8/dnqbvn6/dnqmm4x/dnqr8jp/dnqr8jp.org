Ah, thanks for that. I do recall that now, but it's one of those things that I guess I assumed had fallen off the radar or something. I appreciate it.

I /am/ working on the pitch a bit; my plan is to just write a new one whenever I post and figure out blurb-writing through iteration. It's difficult for this story in particular, I think, because it's somewhat deliberately generic in a few regards in order to give me room to play with the differences.
