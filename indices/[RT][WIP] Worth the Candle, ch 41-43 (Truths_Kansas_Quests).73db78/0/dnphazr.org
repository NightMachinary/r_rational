/Worth the Candle/ is a webnovel about a teenage boy who gets dropped into a fantasy world that's a conglomeration of the ones he spent every night of his adolescence working on. He is, to all appearances, in a game of some kind, one that's brutally real and reticent to show its true nature. Forced to fight for his survival, he moves through a world that's both alien and familiar.
