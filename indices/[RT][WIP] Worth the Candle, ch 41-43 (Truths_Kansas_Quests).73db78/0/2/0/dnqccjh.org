Noted. I think that's my preference too, but I kind of don't like the idea of releasing chapters where there's just some people talking and no conflict/resolution arc, or only a weak one, which makes me want to Voltron things up into a better-digested chunk. I've been around the block enough times to have seen people commenting on web serial chapters saying "meh, nothing happened" and I would rather that's not how people come away from any chapter of this, which I think they're less likely to if they can continue on to another chapter right away.

But I also don't want to give in to the temptation to force every single chapter into the same setup/payoff or conflict/resolution format, because sometimes I just want space to breathe for a bit, and have something that's a tiny bit more slice-of-lifey (though I can't off-hand recall whether there are any individual chapters that actually do that).

The compromise I make is with chapter chunking on occasion.

(Alternately, sometimes there's a granular-level story beat that extends for 10K words, which is a little bit long for a chapter in my opinion (longer than a lunch break), and the chapter gets split in two partially in order to ensure that a more casual reader has good stopping points and doesn't have to push ahead, even if they're in the middle of something that should narratively be a single gigantic chapter.)

I don't actually have anyone doing editing or beta reading (with this chapter set as an exception - I got some early feedback from some people on the discord, thanks [[/u/ketura]]) so that's not an issue. I write fast enough and at odd enough hours that I don't really want to wait around or talk things over or whatever, most of the time.
