From that submissions page, they say

#+begin_quote
  The editorial board of the Guide has the final word on what to list and what not to list. If we think it belongs in our listings, we'll list it.
#+end_quote

Which I gather to mean that they'll waive their restriction at their discretion.

And yeah, it would definitely be work to put your story up somewhere new, but in terms of effort/reward I think the balance works out to be pretty good for your story. You've got an existing fanbase to quickly propel you up the rankings on your first week, and then it'll really pay dividends. Speaking personally, I at least check out any work new to the top ten or so, and I've read a bit from 17 of the top 20.

But hey-- ultimately, it's your decision. If you need some motivation, however, think: can I really justify my SI practicing some inane task for hours on end, when I can't even self-motivate enough to submit my work to a webfiction catalogue? ;)
