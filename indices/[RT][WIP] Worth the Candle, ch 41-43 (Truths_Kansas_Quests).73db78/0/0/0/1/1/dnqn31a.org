I already submitted it to webfictionguide, but if or when it gets nominated for the topwebfiction list is another story.

I've known some authors who get drained by ancillary inane tasks, so I definitely prefer his prioritization of writing the story. Muses wait for no one. Plus these things can be done by fans.
