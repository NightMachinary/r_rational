I made a submission to topwebfiction's parent site (webfictionguide) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vy8h8/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_2425/dm4u4i7/][about a month ago]]. I'm unsure whether ticking the I'm-the-author box would have expedited the process, but they do say it takes about a month for them to get to it. Details below - let me know if I should change anything. From the flavor of the week summary above, I venture you're still polishing the perfect pitch. I hope any changes don't set it to the back of the queue.

*Tagline*: Is the game worth the candle?

*Tags*: fantasy, magic, adventure, rpgs, sword and sorcery

*Summary*: A self-insert litRPG portal fantasy.

A young man (the SI) suddenly finds himself falling off a plane into a new fantasy world. Being an old hand at D&D, some things seem disconcertingly familiar... but there's no time to ponder the similarities to the campaigns he used to run because there's a character sheet attached to his soul and this "game" is getting lethal real fast.

This story uses some custom CSS for the character sheet and definition tags to allow mouseover on various game terms, so mobile and touchscreen users, you're missing out.
