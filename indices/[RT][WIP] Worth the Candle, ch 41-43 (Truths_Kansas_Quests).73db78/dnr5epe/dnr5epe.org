I've been caught up for a few chapters now, and it's been great.

After 41 I thought looking over the initial chapters, armed only with a bit of hindsight, might be interesting.

e.g. from chapter 3

#+begin_quote
  /Please, please don't have Fel Seed./
#+end_quote

(No such luck)

or chapter 5

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't help but wonder if the pets had been turned by whatever apocalypse had hit Comfort, or if they had all starved to death in their cages and then risen as zombies after the fact.
#+end_quote

Has this been answered by the story yet? In favor of the former, I thought.
