I love Juniper's reaction to the Fel Seed quest. Also, finally arriving at what I expect to be there big plot thread of the setting, if not Joons personal story: Fixing this crapsack world. A lot of quests are hinting at it... Fix all thirteen personified exclusion zones, become a God, rescue your best friend who may very well be in the 4000 hells, punish the wicked and reward the good kind of stuff.

The one question I'm surprised his minmaxing instincts hasn't jumped on is... Can he draw unicorn time wankery out of the bones they collected? That would make fixing his boneitis much easier, assuming he can unlock soul manipulation at all.
