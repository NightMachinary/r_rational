So the quest says Juniper knows the Fel Seed guy's weakness. Can anyone think of something we already know that might apply?

I'm thinking it might be a DnD friend of Juniper's, whose favoured character has flaws Juniper would recognise. Alternatively, it might be an addiction to leveling up or maybe something related to simulated intelligence that isn't actually super-intelligence (though that one is pretty abstract).
