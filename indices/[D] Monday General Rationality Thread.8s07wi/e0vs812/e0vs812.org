Is there a list of preexisting probabilities in day-to-day (or at least frequently occurring) matters? I want to get back to making predictions, and I think it'd be easier if I could say to myself, "Well, [x] is generally judged to happen 80% of the time, and [y] 90% of the time, and I think that [z] is is more likely to occur to than [x] but not quite as likely as [y], so let's say 85%."

An alternative method would be to make a lot of tiny predictions in my own life and generate a pool that way, but it'd be simpler to get back into this project if I didn't have a lot of minutia to work through first.
