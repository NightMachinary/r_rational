While I appreciate the attempts, I am reminded of the joke:

A man finds Truth! and the devil's minion is worried, but the devil is not: "I'll just tempt him to institutionalize it."

Make no boxes and we'll have no arguments about what deserves to be in them.

That said! Maybe a Rational Tropes sort of setup? List the elements of rationalist fiction, and note where they were first observed, and fiction that uses them?
