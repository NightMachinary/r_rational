True. On the other hand, we won't even have an empty box!

I think it's worth occasionally at least discussing what we would see as the canon, and the reasons behind our choices - to find new things to read, build a shared understanding of what this 'rationalist fiction' thing is, and reflect on our own thinking.

Challenge: write a dialogue between a constructivist and a positivist, about the definition of "rationalist fiction" :p
