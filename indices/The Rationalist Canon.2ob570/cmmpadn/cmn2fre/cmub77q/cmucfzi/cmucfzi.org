Hey ouri, yeah the experimentation is what I said is "rational trappings".

It is only my opinion, but for me there is some pretty big breaks in rules 1, 2 and 4 in the sidebar.

Eriko left alive several times by people who are characterised by wanton killing. Outright evil factions with no other real motivation.

And there are plenty of examples of applications of her power that either get nerfed after a single use for story reasons (the kaiju popper, for example) or have been ruled out by you for "story reasons", like cutting enemies with portals.

The story is still fun to read, but it just doesn't fulfill the criteria. Some rational elements, but not rational enough that a reader can extrapolate solutions to problems.
