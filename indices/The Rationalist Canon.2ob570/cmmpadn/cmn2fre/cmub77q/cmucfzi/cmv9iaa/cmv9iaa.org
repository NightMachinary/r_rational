The bit about portal cutting I'll concede.

Being left alive... Downfall retreated twice, mostly cutting his losses (even if he later retells it differently). Murder was toying with her the first time, but WOULD have killed her if she hadn't retreated.

Outright evil factions... Well, the demons have their motivations. It's just that those motivations are no more rational than those of the Holocaust's showrunners. The Elysium is imperialistic. He Who Laughs is pursuing his own interests while treating the multiverse as an entertaining show.

As for the kaiju popper, it requires a few elements to work. One of them is an enemy who's not moving quickly even while you're somewhat close.

Your mileage may vary.
