For obvious reasons, I don't feel entirely qualified to pass judgment on Saga of Soul. I would, however, submit for your consideration that one of the most central aspects of the story is that, when the protagonist is faced with an afterlife and physics-defying power, she refuses to accept "it's magic!" as an explanation, and immediately sets out to analyze, quantify, and experiment on her discovery - and that, furthermore, the knowledge garnered from her experiments plays a large role in allowing her her victories.
