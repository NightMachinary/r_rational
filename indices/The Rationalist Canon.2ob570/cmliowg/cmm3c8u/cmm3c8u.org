We could also add [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442][Cenotaph]] and it's sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754][Wake]]. Both of these have unique, original flavour of wormverse and personally I consider them better than the original (Wildbow's work desperately needs editing)
