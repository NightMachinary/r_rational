Challenged accepted!

P: "I would posit that the basis of an enjoyable rationalist fiction is one with believable characters who react appropriately to existential threats and utilize all tools necessary to steer the future where they want it to go. The rational actors will at least be able to predict their opponents. Superior optimized players will always try to think at least one level higher than anyone expects them to."

C: "It is impossible to write "rationalist" fiction. Your human qualities with cognitive dispositions, heuristics and biases lead you through deep unconscious pathways and you can't go "one level higher" than them, no matter how much you try to "simulate a theoretical objective decisional computer in your brain." The closest type of fiction you can write is "fiction that appeals to left-brained thinkers who value cool calculation over warm emotion based on shared constructed "memes and models."

P: "Are you proposing that in order to write a rationalist fiction, I would need to construct a story devoid of humanity? As in, I'm banned from using human language or social cues for my story? I'm merely talking about instrumental rationality in maximizing the quality of interactions between characters in a story."

C: "Additionally, you cannot call it "fiction" without recognizing that is a social construct, not based on reality. Using the "cached thought" of the map-is-not-the-territory, what is the territorial basis for your fictional world?"

P: "Ugh. You know, normally people consider me to be overly pedantic. Thank you for showing me that it is possible to over-think things."
