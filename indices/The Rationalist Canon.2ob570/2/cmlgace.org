I personally would have put up the original Friendship is Optimal by Iceman over it's derivative fanfic; the derivative didn't really add a whole lot of interest, it mostly felt like it was an exercise in going through standard objections to uploading. That said, even for that story going strictly by the sidebar I am not sure how much there is of the Rational/ist/ techniques and the like in the story - one character conducts a very limited investigation of a virtual environment, but with zero stakes and a pretty silly investigative methodology (play with a toy until you start to get puzzled, come to a conclusion, and havsan omnipotent AI trying to maximize his happiness 'confirm' the results of testing. There is not a lot of puzzles or rationalist techniques in the story. The story has a LOT of transhumanist and LessWrongian trappings, but I don't know that it actually qualifies as rationalist merely because of having plot devices like omnipotent artificial intelligences derived from Lesswrong or related organizations.
