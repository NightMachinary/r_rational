Sorry I was trying to be generic, but I'm not particularly good at it. Part of it is that I'm struggling with coming up with a system that meets my needs especially because the actual capabilities of any magic system are not going to show up for decades after it appears on the world stage. Think about what would happen if some force on a similar level of importance to electricity suddenly appeared.

To make a long story short though I'm thinking localized changes to the laws of physics without allowing for violation of any of the conservation laws or causality, but most of that isn't actually going to be possible without the aid of tech. As to what an unaided human can manage without practice. Lifting stuff up at a distance. Say a couple of meters, with similar levels of energy used as actually lifting said object up by hand. Disrupting complicated electronics and from a significant distance. Surviving in environment that a normal person couldn't manage, high radiation, maybe without air. Making biology stop working or maybe just lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions in an area such that everything organic bursts into flames. The ability to essentially split the mages mind and send part of it off to do the action without human intervention, though this would start to get into the territory of mage tech that shouldn't show up right, right away.

In my mind everyone with the genes gets a the same basic set of powers, but practice is a thing as is technological aids.

Biggest limitation is attention and numbers. Generally two mages will wipe out a single mage every time.
