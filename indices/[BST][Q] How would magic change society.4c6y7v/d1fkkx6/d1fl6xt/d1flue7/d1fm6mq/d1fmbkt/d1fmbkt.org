We already have superstar athletes, genius scientists, people who can sing like angels, but since their abilities don't allow them to conquer the world or commit mass murder, we accept them within the variation of human society. Those who are sociopathic and cunning enough to organize murder-cults or shoot up schools we deal with harshly. If mages are just "athletes", people would adjust. On the other hand, if they could make bids for control of society, they'd have to somehow avoid fighting the already established, highly effective military and security apparatus established by certain world governments for fighting terrorists, drug traffickers, and dissidents.
