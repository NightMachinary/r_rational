I guess part of my thinking here is examining the effects of a tech revolution that by birth only a small percentage of people could actually take advantage of. Right now any innate ability an individual human has is incredibly limited, on the other hand maybe it's not innate ability that maters, but I just think it would result in an interesting dynamic. People are generally good, but how would they react if suddenly 30 percent of the population was better than everyone else in a very real and material way.

Maybe it's similar to the situation we already have with wealth for that matter.
