It depends on how homogeneous the magic is. Are the powers unique to the individual (most superhero settings) are there several sets of powers (Avatar, Mistborn) or else is there only one type of magic (Harry Potter, Ra, and many others)?

In the first option, individual mages would become literally irreplaceable in many places. For example, a weather-controller could produce billions of dollars of economic gain, but also a huge upheaval when they die or retire.

The third option is just a special case of the second, where n = 1. They could become another force in the economy, like plumbers or doctors. If one fire-mage quits/dies, then you can just get another one to replace them.
