  Overpowering: a single mage could comfortably take out an entire nation of non mages

This is a problematic requirement. I don't think you'd end up with any kind of surviving civilization if any significant number of people got that kind of power, right off the bat. Each mage would be an existential threat, and even with only a hundred or so the odds of at least one going off the deep end just gets too high. This is the Marvel/DC universe, except without the plot holes that keep the supervillains super-dumb.
