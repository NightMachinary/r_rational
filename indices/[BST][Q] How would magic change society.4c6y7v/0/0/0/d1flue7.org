There are several technologies you can look at as analogues for a magic suddenly discovered or introduced: Electricity and oil required infrastructural support from society's elites to make possible. Only those with access to money and the tech to exploit them could benefit from them initially.

Birth control dramatically changed the structure of the family, human relationships, and had broad-reaching economic and demographic effects on society. Powerful interest groups and governments still attempt to limit aspects of it ranging from birth control to abortion.

Although trading in drugs is illegal, the flow of resources that having access to their source allows drives organized crime and long-distance international networks.

The rise of the tech industry led to a new culture of professionals skilled in information technology. They developed their own business culture and style of dress, and became accepted as well-paid professionals.

Hoverboards and jetpacks have long been a dream of many that reality has failed to make legal. People still build their own drones as hobbies. The government used to adopt a laissez-faire attitude to them but has begun to crack down. Although technically everybody in the US has access to superpowers in the form of guns via the bill of rights, the actual legality of carrying a firearm varies regionally. Every time a mass murder occurs involving firearms, there is a strong movement to further restrict their use and access. The same might hold true for both inherited powers and those gained via tech.

What is the introduction of magic most analogical to? There are more histories of innovation than those I have listed.
