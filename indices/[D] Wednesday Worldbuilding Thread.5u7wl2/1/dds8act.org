I've been trying to train myself on tracking meaningful cultural exchanges; basically how multiple cultures interact within a confined space.

Basically, I have an Island and there are four different factions on it. Two of them are extinct and have left behind only relics, while the other two are either declining or stagnant.

The first, and the only "true" natives on the island are the Scaled Folk (lizardmen). Due to "reasons", they are now unable to advance culturally and so can only copy instead of innovating (aside from a few individuals). They're split into five different tribes that resemble their traditional five elements: Shadow, Light, Water, Earth and Air. They're a migratory people, and they circle the island following the next tribe in the chain. Each tribe mainly consumes a different type of resources (like Shadow are the scavengers, Earth are the vegetarians, Water are the hunters, etc) and each has a different philosophical outlook. This affects not only how each tribe views the other tribes, but also how they interact with outsiders and the other faction on the island. Air are largely extinct due to "reasons" (yes, the same reason why they can't advance culturally).

The second faction are the cannibalistic tribes. These three tribes are the remnants of an Island-spanning civilization that was struck by a cataclysm. Unable to handle it, they fractured into three separate tribes and are now slowly declining on the fringes of the Island. The three tribes were once the different castes of the civilization (the priests, the warriors and the farmers), and they each view their culture's "fall" differently; one tribe thinks they overreached, another thinks this is a necessary trial for Ascendance, while a third believes it was due to "Outside Interference". More broadly, each of the tribes has a different outlook; one tribe focuses on the present, another obsesses over the past while a third seeks a better future (no matter the cost).

At the moment, I'm struggling to keep the myriad relationships in check. I have a good understanding of how the internal faction politics work (or don't, if the case may be), but I getting a bit of a headache trying to detail how individual tribes view other tribes. Like how would the Warriors view the Shadow Tribe, and how does that affect their relationship with the Priests, given the Priests view the Shadow with suspicion, etc.

Oh, and I saw Factions, but there's not a lot of cohesive unity. Sure, if the other faction attacks wholesale then they will band together. But there's a lot of competition given the harshness of living on the Island; the Warriors will sometimes even raid the Farmers for food and women.
