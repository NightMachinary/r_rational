If I were you, I would look into real-world examples. There are a lot of surprising but interesting relationships. For now, I think the middle-east is the most useful in that regard. Diplomatic relations there are heavily influenced by culture/religion. (About that, how is religion on your island?) Religion is important in the middle-east but other factors also play in. For example, the rivalry between Iran and saudi-arabia is caused by multiple things, one of the biggest being religion, but there is also a rivalry because Iran is a republic that came after a revolution and Saudi-arabia is the opposite, an absolute, dynastic monarchy. (conservative also).
