If I took a stab at it, I'd set some initial conditions, iterate progressively over the tribes in time steps of a few years, and find some plausible setup. Of course, such a setup would be an incredibly bad approximation, but that's perfectly OK. International relations is very sensitive to intial condtions regardless, so what's more necessary than finding a stable state is having relations plotted to be realistic with reference to previous events.

Imagine if two near-identical polities are contacted, but in a different order across two different timelines. One set of natives have a blue flag, and the other has a red falg. Meanwhile, the contacting civilization is a big fan of yellow. In a ceremonial display, the blue and yellow flags contrast (because there's not much in nature that's blue and red) while the yellow and red flags look very fitting. In timeline #1, that's not a big deal; this is the contacting civilization's first contact with these natives, so they're not inclined to judge. In timeline #2, after seeing how well the red and yellow flags work together, the contacting civilization thinks of the blue natives more poorly.

And from there, you can already see how politics would wildly differ.

Now, I think that in sufficiently complex systems, relatively stable states are fairly likely to be found because so many sub-states are happening that a near-optimal sub-state is found and outcompetes other states (for example, enough strong, centralized governments have popped up to make having a strong, centralized government the only effective way to deal with other strong, centralized governments). But on a smaller scale, equilibrium is more difficult to find because I think international relations would, at best, oscillate between a few states.

(note-- I've been using "state" to mean "state of being" here, not in the sense of a polity.)

tl;dr think of some basic ways the character archetypes would interact, determine which factions are more volatile than others, then try running a short simulation on them.
