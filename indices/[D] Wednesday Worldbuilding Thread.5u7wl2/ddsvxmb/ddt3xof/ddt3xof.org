I think that by pulling attention away from the Monday/Friday threads, the Wednesday/Saturday threads have reduced the total interaction between community members. Of course, removing the Wednesday/Saturday threads will lead the Monday/Friday threads to have more off-topic stuff, but once their level of commenters becomes high enough again, we can add back Wednesday and Saturday threads.
