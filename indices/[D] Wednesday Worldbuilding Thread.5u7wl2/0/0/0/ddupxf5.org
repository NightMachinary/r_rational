The rapier idea is fantastic. I'm definitely going to include that. I like it as a stylistic device too, where finding a hollow rapier (or cane, or spear) might unveil a blood mage that was hiding their status.

If the setting has the technology, you could also make a projectile attached to a hollow tube and use it to launch into targets at range.

I'll look up whether early 1400s Europe had vulcanised rubber or other similar hollow, flexible tube materials. My vague memories say that's too early for even the rubber plant in Europe, but I could always fudge the details a little as a deviation from real history (which has already happened with the cardiopulmonary system, due to secret blood mages publishing research). I'd just need to justify that departure.

I think I'll have to rule that dilution doesn't affect resolution, but does affect power (and vice versa; pure red blood cells would be a little over twice as amenable to blood magic).

It may however require a thicker rope to qualify as connected (and the converse for pure red blood cells). Since the area is proportionate to r^{2} you could dilute it by a factor of 16 and only need it 4 times thicker.

I'll have to tweak the numbers if I want the ropes to be viable then. Changing it to be linear might be too much, but reducing the evaporation rate could work.

Although if there are things like hollow weapons and projectile tubes then it might be okay for open-atmosphere blood manipulation to be too expensive to be viable.
