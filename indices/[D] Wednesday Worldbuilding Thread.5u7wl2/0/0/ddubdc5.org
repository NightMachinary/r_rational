Blood Blades: Make a rapier (or similar sword) with a 1mm tube forged in it, running from the handle to the very tip of the sword. This creates both a cheap way of extending "touch" range (as it is a small amount of blood, and not exposed to the air), as well as allowing you to do "impossible" things with it, driven by telekinesis instead of muscle power.

How does dilution interact with the required radiuses? For example, if I put 1 drop of blood (normal radius 3 mm) into a sealed container of water (radius 100 mm), could I control it at 3 m or 100 m? Can you concentrate blood instead of diluting it to get better effects?

Blood ropes are very expensive. The loss rate is 62.8 ml / sec for a 1m rope, and it scales proportional with length^{2.} A 10m rope would cost over 6 liters of blood to maintain for a single second.
