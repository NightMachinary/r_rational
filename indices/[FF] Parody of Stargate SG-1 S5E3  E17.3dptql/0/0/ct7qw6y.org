  Could you turn your radio's battery into a grenade, sir? It's the same thing, just with longer words."

In fairness, it probably WAS possible. Based on the episode I just did, where setting off an explosion next to a huge pile of naquadah was going to make an even bigger explosion...well, the feeling I get is that naquadah is unstable and goes boom if too much energy is applied. Quite possibly, turning that thing into a bomb was as simple as duct-taping a grenade to it and pulling the pin.
