I don't think the original story violates common sense. I got the impression from the original that the "stalker" was supposed to have limited experience with human society and emotions. If Sam understands this, she could legitimately not want to treat him like one would treat a normal stalker. Any actual real life stalker is someone who is willfully ignorant of another person's boundaries; this willful ignorance is absent here, and plain ignorance isn't the same thing.

Also, it isn't necessarily wrong to ask someone for a report and then to say that the report that you asked for sounds crazy. Asking for a report implies that the report may get a certain amount of unexpected results, but not an unlimited amount.
