Naquada supply is a problem? I thought we already have enough naquada for as many reactors as we need, anything that would require a ZPM just takes impractically (in the sense of "its a lot of work to make them and hook them up") many naquadra reactors, and the public still has to pay for energy because telling them everything would produce "mass panic".

It would be interesting to see a ratfic about the SGP going public (and the ensuing mass panic?).
