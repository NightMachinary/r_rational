Oh, also: for the most part, this show is damn smart. The acting is excellent, the plots are interesting and fresh, there are arcs but they are deftly handled so newcomers aren't totally lost, and it's pretty rational. Keep in mind that you're only seeing the ones that are worth parodying, and note how far apart the numbers are. There were a bunch in the first couple seasons that I didn't get around to doing, but after early season three the parody-able episodes are getting thin on the ground.
