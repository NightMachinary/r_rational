  You don't have to make the characters constantly do the rational thing for the story to be rational though. Joel had his daughter die in front of him and has been haunted by it ever since, he's accepted Ellie as his new family and suddenly finds out that after all their hardships and grief, she's now going to die.

  Him valuing her life over the rest of humanity and deciding he can't accept this outcome isn't irrational, it just means that he has a well established and believable character flaw that has made him value things differently. Changing his values to be in line with the greater good doesn't make the story more rational. After all, villains can be rational too.
