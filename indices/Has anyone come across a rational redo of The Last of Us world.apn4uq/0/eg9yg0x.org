Human cordyceps strikes me as a bioweapon. Cliche perhaps, but it's the only explanation that makes reasonable sense. It jumped whatever hotlab it was in, was way more effective than by design, and there you go.

Unlike a lot of zombies, cordyceps has potential for rationality. It's harshly simple to get infected - no bites necessary, just inhale some spores. Spores that are bursting out all over the place, because humanity has provided plenty of warm and dark environments for them to grow in, even putting aside infected getting immobilized and consumed.

Useful modifications:

-Infected aren't mindless, at least at first. Cordyceps cannot control. It's a fungus. Cordyceps /manipulates/. It floods the brain and body with a mix of hormones and neurotransmitters to reach particular behaviors (I couldn't find any clear info on the mechanism of real cordyceps). The smell of human sweat triggers aggression and paranoia, unless mixed with another agent emitted by cordyceps. Light sensitivity keeps them out of the elements, while little modification is needed to make humans seek warmth.

-So runners can still reason, but they can't be around other humans very long without going into fits of rage, which with the preexisting tension means things are unlikely to go well. Cordyceps can also trigger cravings for meat or just consume enough calories growing that the body will crave the density of meat anyway. Only so much meat available in the apocalypse... You could also get syrup-guzzling infected trying to resist the inevitable.

-The inevitable being becoming a clicker. Clickers have had parts of their frontal lobe eaten along with the face and are no longer rational. The clicking is no good for actually locating anything (which, to be fair, it isn't in the original either), it's just a common tic caused by the massive brain damage. Clickers can't really hunt (well) or cook anything, so they're almost always hungry, and humans are one of the few species that humans can run-down in pure speed.

-Eventually though, clickers get too hungry, too tired, and too brain damaged. They seek out a warm closed space and die there, bursting into spores that are going to engulf the first poor motherfucker who opens the door of what was once an Arbys.
