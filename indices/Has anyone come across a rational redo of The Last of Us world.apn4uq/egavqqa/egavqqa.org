Cutscene: Joel meets with the researchers. "Are you sure you can manufacture a vaccine with the data of the autopsy? Whats your confidence level? Have you exhausted any other alternatives?" Susan, the head researcher, earnestly nods. "Yes." She pushes a file folder over her desk to you. "This outlines what we know so far. Best guesses, detailed analysis of the attack vectors, possible immune system responses. These are the historic cases where something similar was done. This-" She dumps another huge folder on the table "- contains the compiled records of other labs, back when the Centre of Disease Control stil was active." She takes a second to open up the report and taps a conclusion at the bottom. " Quote: our best chance of long-term success in finding a vaccine is a natural immune carrier that will probably spring up in time. We leave this report and procedures to be undertaken in case this happens to the capable hands of our successors. End quote. Note that this report was writen a year past the outbreak, making it a successful prediction."

  Joel sat and tried to do his best to integrate all this information. With a sickening feeling in his stomach he struggled to accept the inevitable. The calculus was clear, Ellis life just didn't weigh up against the thousands and thousands of lifes that would be safed just this year alone. Not to mention that a return to technical civilisation on the the pre-plague level was impossible without a permanent solution. Crying, his face in his hands, he chocked out "Give us a week, will you?"<!

Later, when Joel had the talk with Elli... Over their journey together he had come to expect this level of quickmindedness of her. His heart burst with love and agony as she just calmly nodded "Yes, that makes sense."
