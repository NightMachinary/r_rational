do I have a treat for you:

*Cross Time Engineer - by Leo Frankowski.*

1990s mechanical engineer is accidentally sent back in time to 1220s, about two decades before the Mongol Invasion on Europe.

He decides to put all his knowledge to work o industrialising Medieval Poland, Hungary and Moravia to fighting strength before the Mongols kill everyone in the eastern half of the continent.

It mostly depict the attitudes and mores of 1200s correctly (showing how alien their ways of thinking would be to ours, combining extreme conservatism in some aspects with astonishing liberalism in others).

The hero, who not strictly rational, is by heart an engineer, trying to solve all problems as if they were technical issues (which sometimes fail spectacularily).

The books tend to be a bit "red pilled" at times, strongly masculine (sex, violence and badassery by the truckload), and relentlessly techno-positivist ("I can save them all, we just need MORE TECHNOLOGY!").
