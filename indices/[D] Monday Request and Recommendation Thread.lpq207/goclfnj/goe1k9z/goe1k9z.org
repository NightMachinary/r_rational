"Lest Darkness Fall" by L. Sprague de Camp is a pretty classic example of this. "Modern" (mid 20th century) man gets transported back to 500 ADish Rome. He makes a bunch of money by introducing distillation and double-entry book keeping and then does a bunch of politics and generally attempts to stave off the dark ages.

It's been a while since I read it, but I remember liking it at the time. IIRC it has reasonably intelligent and rational though otherwise somewhat 2D characters, and the plot was interesting enough, but is mostly the sort of story you get when someone has a neat idea and wants to explore the implications, but it does that fairly well and is short enough that that doesn't start to drag.
