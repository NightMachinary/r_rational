I can't think of any novels/webfiction that qualify, but there are a few mangas that are fairly rational that I know of where the MC makes use of future knowledge. There aren't a lot, but some are quite good and void the usual tropes common in mangas. It's not in the format of western literature, but if you'd like I can try and find them.
