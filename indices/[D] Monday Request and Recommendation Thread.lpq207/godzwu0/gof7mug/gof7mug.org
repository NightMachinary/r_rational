I like how John Dolan, the author, describes things in a manner that's simultaneously pompously self-important and somehow tongue in cheek. Like all the stuff about how unlikeable Agamemnon is, or how pathetic Menelaus is, or how Zeus very much liked the smell of a virgin bull burnt as an offering, the fat and the gristle and the bone.

The author is both faithfully transcribing whatever the tone that Homer was going for, the weighty, epic mythos around the story, but also skillfully jabbing fun at it. The reader is meant to understand that the people depicted really, actually believe these things, and yes, they are pretty absurd. It's delightful.

I read so much shitty webfiction prose that I sometimes forget how good skillful professional writing can be like.
