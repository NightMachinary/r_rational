I've been reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34381315-the-war-nerd-iliad][The War Nerd Iliad]], and I have to say it's much more of a alien world than +90% of fantasy stories I've ever read. The people are actually different, the gods are portrayed interestingly, the customs are very interesting and based on interesting facts, the priests are interesting, the characters are different and interesting.

​

I went into it with no expectations, just the iliad written differently, but it's a whole different experience to anything I've read in years. You feel the antiquity, you can almost smell these guys were small tribes a couple centuries ago, that still hold onto a lot of it's tribal customs.

​

Give it a try if you like interesting settings, who knew cliche boring old ancient greece could be so interesting when compared to scifi / fantasy.
