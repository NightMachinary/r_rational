Apocalypse: Generic System is a newish series that's pretty good, notwithstanding the dumb name. The first book is out on kindle unlimited, and the second finished yesterday, should be out on KU in late march. Both are available if you sign up for at the $10 tier on the authors patreon. Same author as Wake of the Ravager(good) and The Outer Sphere(good until chapter ~100), both well over 500k words.
