Heretical Edge starts out as an urban fantasy magical high school story but later evolves into more of a magical civil war / revolution setting. The basic premise is that certain humans can see all the Strangers and Monsters that normal people can't see (vampires, werewolves, chimera, dire wolves, slenderman-types etc.) and then they go to magical school to become "Heretics" who gain the ability to absorb abilities from killing Strangers. For example, if a Heretic kills a werewolf, they might suddenly be able to smell better or have more stamina or if a Heretic kills a ghost, they might gain the ability to possess people.

Summus Proelium is an original superhero story + setting which involves the protagonist (who wants to be a hero) finding out that her family are all hardcore villains. Has many parallels to /Worm/, probably because the author started out writing Worm-fanfiction, but it's more fun in general and the protagonist's existence isn't an endless parade of suffering.
