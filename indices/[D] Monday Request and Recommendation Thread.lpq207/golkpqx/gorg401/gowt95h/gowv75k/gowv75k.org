I don't have an infinite amount of time to try new things, so I tend to use simple heuristics to both give or not give things a chance. An author that uses emojis liberally like that is something that I would model as less likely to produce fiction that matches my tastes.

Additionally, I'm confident that if it actually is any good, it will pop up again here or elsewhere, whereupon I'll reevaluate.
