Plenty of warning signs on this fic -- written in present tense, started with a harem tag (removed in response to reader feedback), MC earns a Darwin award before it even starts... But it also has munchkinry and science. Follows a primitive tech progression (pottery, charcoal, iron working, etc) and talks about the stoichiometric composition of raw materials, so I'm curious where it will go. Goofy in tone rather than dark like a lot of dungeon core stories. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40265/dungeon-io-crafting][Dungeon I/O (⚒ Crafting ⚒)]]
