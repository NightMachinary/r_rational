There's a movie called Drishyam 2 that came out this week. It's not in English, and you should watch the first one too, but I think other people on this sub would really like both movies.

The first one revolves around a man whose daughter murders a boy threatening to rape her and her mother, and who tries to cover it up and evade arrest. It's decently intelligent by film standards (I'm thinking of Death Note's style being only slightly better), but while I liked it, I didn't love it. I did love the new sequel though. The ending is a tad expository and the first half slightly bloated, but that's borderline nitpicking. If you like dramas with plotting, gambits, and fairly decent planning, you'll probably like this. It's on Amazon Prime in most countries, I think.
