Honestly didn't expect a rec for a Malayalam movie here. Drishyam and Drishyam 2 were both pretty nice, but the second movie does suffer a bit due to the pandemic conditions as it had to be rushed.

I'd second the recs. Check em out if you are okay with a foreign language movie. And make sure that you watch the Malayalam version with Mohan Lal as the protag; there are remakes for the first one in many languages but not for the sequel (it's too new).
