I'm really enjoying this so far!\\
I'd classify it as almost absurdism, but with some amount of logic throughout it. Though I do kinda wish people would argue with Junji more. He tends to make assertions/suggestions about a topic, then everyone (often Tex) who tries arguing against that just kinda fails at putting together an argument.
