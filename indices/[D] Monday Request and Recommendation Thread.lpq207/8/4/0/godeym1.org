I'm going to de-rec Heretical Edge.

It is long, but it's also /so repetitive/. Half of it is essentially family drama combined with high school teen drama just replayed over and over again between additional characters. It feels like essentially every other chapter is revealing all of the DEEP IMPORTANT SECRETS to a new person, concluding with a "we have a lot to talk about" as long lost relatives feel the need to catch up with each other.

It has the potential to be really cool but it needs about half the characters to be cut out and then a bunch of other stuff to be cut out as well. I got to chapter 17-06 before I finally gave up because I realized I was skimming most of each chapter because it was just boring reading the exact same emotional and story beats over and over again.

Not to mention the fact that, it got to the point where it seemed like practically every single character, bar 1 or 2 was actually secretly on team "strangers aren't all bad", but no one knew that about everyone else, so I was really confused at how they had not already won, and with the number of people that have been inducted into the secret, it became increasingly improbably that whatever powers in charge that /weren't/ on aboard wouldn't find out without extreme levels of incompetence.
