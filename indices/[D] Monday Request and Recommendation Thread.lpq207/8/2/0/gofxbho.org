I'm in full agreement about every single one of your points about DCC, to the point where I could have written your first paragraph myself and then forgotten about it. It's a little scary.

I really think DCC is a good fit for this sub precisely because of the clever munchkinry and how the MCs win through competent planning. Outcomes make sense and are never chosen for plot reasons. Even when there's some degree of Deus Ex, like when Carl sees something shine and picks up the container for the Doomsday Scenario, it's justified in-universe as the game giving players a chance to succeed. And yep, it's rare that authors pull off the whole humor thing. It usually falls flat for me.

I've never given light novels a chance, but maybe it's time. Thank you for the detailed response!
