The first book is weak, and the story changes quite dramatically after for the better.

I've always compared TZKS to Hunter x Hunter, and the openings are one similarity. HxH is a decent but unremarkable shonen to begin with, until the arrival of Nen and the York Shin arc. Similarly, TZKS is just a variation on a super hero story until they defeat the first bad guy (Damien?) and the arrival of the Vanguard and Abolish to the story. Both get a lot more interesting as powers open up and the world gets expanded.
