Something that I found particularly amusing in Starwink is how the casual mention of how any attempt to create a really powerful AI causes the computer to melt down in That Alien Message is interpreted as enabling the creation of power plants that are more efficient than nuclear energy. This is the type of exploitation of esoteric phenomenon that has been used in the real world to create the foundations of modern technology and is so rarely explored in fiction.
