Ah, you might be right that having context makes the experience much better. I recommend watching the anime over reading the novels, though.

The usual light novel translation issues apply, and honestly the anime has a better take on the protagonist's dynamic if you ask me.

The fic meshes both works very well, and does some worldbuilding for Boku no Hero's setting while giving the conflict stakes that don't exist in the original. It's very good.
