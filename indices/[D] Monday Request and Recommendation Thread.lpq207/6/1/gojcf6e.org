Only BNHA fic that I have read is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/slouching-towards-nirvana-worm-my-hero-academia.863129/reader/][Slouching Towards Nirvana]], a Worm crossover where post-story Taylor gets summoned into the body of Yanagi Reiko (the ghost girl). Full spoilers for Worm, if you haven't read that yet. Actually, if you haven't read Worm yet definitely just read Worm, it'll scratch that itch.

In PoE related stuff, I made a Minion Instability golem build utilitizing the Elementalist changes this league causing golems to resummon four seconds after they die, and it's wonderful. Objectively worse clear speed than a normal golem build while being nearly as expensive, and you have to spend time summoning golems at the start of each map, but after that it's completely automated golemsplosions. I love it.
