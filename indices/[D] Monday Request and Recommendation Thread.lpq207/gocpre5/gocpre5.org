I'd like to recommend a great story from royal road that is not a litrpg and that never got popular. I might in fact be the only person who read it, which is a shame because it's pretty hilarious.

A group of weirdos find a high tech device in a dumpster that can detect suffering. With it they discover that many people use computers to create simulations to torture the inhabits of these fake worlds. So, the group assassinates the sick overlords and offer the virtual inhabitants destruction or a few eons of torture free simulated life.

That's just the set up, though. The topics and plot are all over the place. It's very clever, but is far too quirky for rr or other sites except perhaps this subreddit.

I wrote a fuller review on rr at the link. Check it out...
