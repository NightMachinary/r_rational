Just saw it on the slush pile of recent posts back when it was updating. The weird title made me check it out.

Yeah. There are a few super rational characters and moral/ethical topics. And I find the dialog is amusing.

  "...been teacher's assisting a Biopsychology course since I know a lot about the subject." the taller man finished to Junji.

  "I enjoyed Biopsychology." Junji replied.

  "Uhuh. Did you know that when you have an emotion, you're only having that emotion because of the chemicals in your brain?"

  "Yes, that is what emotions are."

  The man nodded.

  "That means that when humans help each other, it's just cause of the chemicals they get that make them feel good for doing it." he continued.

  "Mhm. I find it quite optimistic."

  The man's face twisted with confusion.

  "What?" he asked.

  "I said I found it quite optimistic. I would find it pessimistic if humans inherently valued sabotaging each other. Because they do not value this, I feel the opposite."

  "...We're all just machines, man. That's supposed to bother you."

  "I love machines. I consider it an honor to be one."

  After shooting Junji a look of disbelief, the taller man turned and left with a scoff.
