Could someone recommend me book with really over the top ruthless protagonist who stops at absolutely nothing?

I feel like lot of rational stories eventually have some kind of moral dilemma and although I enjoy them I would for once love to see a protagonist that doesn't care and is perfectly willing to just murder his way through.
