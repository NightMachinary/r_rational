These are the ones that are historically accurate:

- *Nobunaga no Chef* - A chef finds himself in 16th century Japan and ends up working for Oda Nobunaga, using modern cooking to help advance Nobunaga.

- *Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan: Noukou Giga* - Also set in 16th century Japan and the MC working for Oda Nobunaga, though this this time the MC is a teenage schoolgirl who specializes in agriculture (though the does bring a few novel ideas from the future for other aspects of life).

Based off of history:

- *Youjo Senki* - A middle-aged HR company man gets isekaied to the equivalent of early 20th century Europe in the body of a young girl. He finds himself on the frontlines of their world war (which is basically WW1 but it happens a bit later and uses magic). It's an alternate world, but it kinda follows the same history as Earth

Future knowledge, no history:

- *Isekai Tensei Soudouki* - Not really time travel since it's an alternate world, but it's set in the past and the MC uses his knowledge from being raised in modern times to advance his fiefdom economically and scientifically.

- *Shadow Queen* - The MC is adopted and raised as a sacrifice/puppet killed in a plot to replace her with another woman. She reawakens before the events take place and has to pretend to be the same passive girl while scheming and undermining her adoptive family.

- *Ernak* - A gamer finds himself in a game several years in the past. He uses his knowledge to change the storyline to survive in an upcoming war.
