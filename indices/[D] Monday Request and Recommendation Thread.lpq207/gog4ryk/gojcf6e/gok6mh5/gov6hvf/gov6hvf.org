  I read that on a whim and got up to like chapter 24 or something, then a giant pissed off ghost appeared and half the readers in the thread talked about the story jumping the shark. I ended up getting distracted and reading other things, is it still fine past that point?

It's pretty good past that point; the author realized that what was basically a sidequest was getting a lot more intense than intended, and went back and retconned a couple of things so that it could all be wrapped up in another chapter after the giant ghost thing.

The part immediately afterwards is a lot of social fighting with Nezu, who's convinced there's something wrong with Reiko (which there is)
