Any Boku No Hero Academia related recommendations? I'm kinda in a BNHA mood lately. The reason why is that consistently the biggest draw to me in media is novelty, or people exploring uncommon or inventive concepts, motivations, or abilities. Modern/indie superhero-centric and sometimes magic-centric stories do this quite a bit, as does a lot of fiction that ends up on this subreddit. (I also go back to playing Path of Exile every few months just to make characters centred around dumb interactions, which should serve as both a recommendation and another way of understanding my tastes. I still miss when they accidentally made a skill's number of hits scale exponentially with reduced move speed and it was incredibly dumb and hilarious and barely playable all at once). Any other recs that fit that motivation are certainly welcome, fic or not.

I'm on mobile right now and pretty checked out for the night, so I'll edit this post and go through a bunch of BNHA stuff I've read that had something stand out about it tomorrow. For now I'll point out that Daymare does a reasonable job of being an engaging story, although the talent the author has for descriptions is brilliant, and gets put to work given the central difference to the story is the Midoriya has a quirk that feels like something meshed together from 3 parts Zerg and 1 part Lovecraft.

(oh also sort of rec for the manga Chainsaw man for doing the above stuff with inventive worldbuilding and also being able to wrap up its story with a ending that encapsulated the story perfectly and tied everything together, although the narrative feels pretty JoJo-esque so not exactly this subreddit's preference in many a case. ...also good if you like hot characters in suits.)

Edit: Here's the stuff I've read. Memory's not perfect for these, and there's enough common themes among BNHA fic some of it is going to be blurred together in my mind. Semi-sorted by trope.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13661763/chapters/31380618][Looking Glass]]: ~5 year old Midoriya goes missing. Turns out he was specifically kidnapped by the League of Villains since they knew (for Reasons) that he was coming into a quirk that basically gave him the deductive capabilities that tv shows try to write for "generic genius *totally not autistic* detective" from shows like Sherlock, etc. Don't mistake my disdain for shitty tv shows as disdain for this fic, since its overall a fairly reasonable fic, if a bit grimmer than standard fair. Plot basically starts at the USJ attack where Midoriya runs into All Might by chance, gets arrested, and once it comes out that he was kidnapped and tortured for years the heroes decide that carting him off to jail when he is: A) a child B) a very useful source of information C) already heavily traumatised D) resistant to legal interrogation techniques E) more or less trying to be a decent person, all combine to make them decide to hide him in UA instead. Story is "finished" in that there's a satisfying climax and all, but the last update was 3 months ago and there's supposed to be an Epilogue so the story ends on something more fulfilling than "fight over, time to pass the fuck out." idk if a "book 2" will end up being written later as well since there's still plenty of canon left to work with.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11277075/chapters/25222215][Daymare]]: Same description I said above. 330k words, last updated end of January. Arguably the best written one, but that statement is largely on the basis of its use of descriptions and language, so its not necessarily the best recommendation for the people reading this post in this particular subreddit. Honorable mention to non-canon antagonist Mincemeat, who is basically "what if Setsuna's quirk (canon student from 1B) got turned up to 11 and mixed with a horror movie serial killer antagonist."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/chapters/32073363][From Muddy Waters]]: Midoriya is All For Ones kid, but still wants to be a hero. It's an uphill battle when he and his mum and in hiding from his dad and All Might and co. recognise Midoriya's origin and are varying degrees of scared shitless. Actually read this a while back so my memory's a bit fuzzier, but I read it all, enjoyed it, and ended up waiting for a further update that hasn't come. 160k words, last updated mid last year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1151561][Deku Sees Dead People]]: Midoriya basically has the kid from The Sixth Sense's shtick. Spends his childhood hiding it since explicit confirmation of post-death existence is apparently a step too far in a world with superpowers. It's a reasonably interesting approach overall, although I don't think it gets the exploration any talk of "immortality" that the typical denizen of this subreddit wants, so your mileage may vary. >420k words and ends at a reasonable point, although the author started writing further short stories in the setting afterwards that might have original been building up to a "book 2" type of thing after the pseudo-interludes before petering out. I haven't read any of the extra ~40k words tho so idk for certain.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7392847/chapters/16792135][But You Gotta Get Up At Least Once More]]: Story started from the idea "what if Midoriya had Saitama's powerset (One Punch Man)" and ended up being the fic on this list that goes the deepest into emotions and trauma instead, despite having arguably the strongest power involved. Ignore the "6 chapters" detail, its 100k words long. Unfinished, last updated mid 2017.

Quirkless + Intelligent Midoriya fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11088315/chapters/24735288][Erased Potential]]: Midoriya looks for inspiration in other places. Finds out about Eraserhead, realises all the fighting he does is basically quirkless (besides dragging the other guy down to his level more or less, unless they've got a mutated/permanent body quirk that can't be cancelled), so he tracks down someone who doesn't want to be found and ends up getting impressing him enough to get trained by him. 180k words, last updated half a year ago, I don't know if it's coming back.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1633756][For Want of a Nail Collection]]: 4 fics by the same author where the common thread is that All Might completely fucks up his first conversation with Midoriya in different ways. I've only read the first two so far, where Midoriya focuses on information support instead of directly fighting people in both. The first one is where he ends up getting in touch with a bunch of underground heroes anonymously online, helps them out, and gains a reputation that way before ending up getting recommended to UA. Second one is where he gets anonymously gets in touch with a random villain online, points out some hero vulnerabilities and complementary strategies, and builds a reputation through that instead. Basically ending up an independent contractor for planning things for villains. Both fics I've read bring up discrimination against quirkless people. First is 140k words, second is nearing 100k (there's a part 2 underway). They're not bad fics, but arguably the weakest on this list (although there's one critical point in the second fic which is just really dumb and contrived). Still updating.
