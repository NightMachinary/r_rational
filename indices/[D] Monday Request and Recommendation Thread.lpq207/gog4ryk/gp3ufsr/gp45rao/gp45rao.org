Eh, I read things with a focus on novelty, as I send in that first paragraph, and I'm more the type to power through reading than sit and try to slot everything together to see how much sense it makes (and if it qualifies as rational). I'm posting here because I find a lot of rational work is adjacent to my interests, owing to inspired and detailed worldbuilding frequently cropping up in works, rather than that I exclusively peruse distinctly rational work.

I could've been clearer about that I guess, but I didn't want to go off on a big tangent before I even started on the actual topic I was keen on. And also I wrote that first chunk on mobile which can be a pain to do a bunch of typing on.
