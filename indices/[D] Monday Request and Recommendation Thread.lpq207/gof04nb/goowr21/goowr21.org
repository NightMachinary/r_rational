I can recommend DARK - the Netflix show, that is. Though it only /starts/ with Stranger Things vibe, and gets wildly different as the story goes on. Really good show tho, and although I wouldn't really call it rational or anything, the characters aren't stupid. There were no "Thorin turns back after getting a little too early" moments that I recall. I recommend going in on the show blind, and committing to watch at least the first 3 episodes.
