Alright, I've asked a similar question before, but the hunt continues! I'm looking for fiction recommendations (preferably in the format of western literature) which focus on *someone going back in time and utilizing their future knowledge somehow.* This can be anything from an "alt-history fix-fic" to just someone going back in time and killing Hitler or whatever, but specifically, I am looking for such stories which place a big focus on being historically accurate and representing the attitudes and actions of people at the time as well as modern historians can.
