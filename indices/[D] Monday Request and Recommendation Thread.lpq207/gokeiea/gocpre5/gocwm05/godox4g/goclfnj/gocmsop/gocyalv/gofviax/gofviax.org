Do not recommend the arthur wellesley fick. It is quite badly written with non-exiatent characterization except for MC, who's only characterization is that he is perfect. He's nothing but a typical Mary Sue. The other characters are completely irrelevant being there only to show how great MC is.

Every freaking time you yout a different characters, he is either tell the MC how brilliant he is, listening mc explaning his ideas and then telling him how brilliant they are or masturbating with other persons on how great the MC is.
