Have you read Stephen Kings 11.22.63? It's the only thing I can think of off hand right now. It's about a guy traveling back in time to stop the Kennedy Assassination.If you had a historian going through the story I'm sure he'd find a lot of faults in the story but I really enjoyed it. It's well written, the characters are interesting & he describes the period how I at least always imagined it to be. If you've read other books from King you'll also notice how it ties in nicely with a lot of other stories in his wider universe.

Edit: Just remembered. Turtledoves /Guns of the South/ also fits the bill, haven't read it myself, but what I've read of Turtledove so far was quite good.
