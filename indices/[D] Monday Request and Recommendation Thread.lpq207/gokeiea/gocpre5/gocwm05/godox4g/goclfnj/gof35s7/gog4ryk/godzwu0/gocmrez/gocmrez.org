Some recommendations for web novels I've enjoyed recently:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-3-the-dungeon-anarchists][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] seems at first glance like standard run-of-the-mill LitRPG, but continues to surprise me. There's always some clever twist, the characters have more depth than you'd first think, and the pacing is /just so right/ to the point where I couldn't help but keep reading until I ran out of chapters.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched][Shade Touched]] is fantasy starring a non-human MC, which gives it some refreshing angles; it's not about seeking power and all that. Plus it's simply cute.
