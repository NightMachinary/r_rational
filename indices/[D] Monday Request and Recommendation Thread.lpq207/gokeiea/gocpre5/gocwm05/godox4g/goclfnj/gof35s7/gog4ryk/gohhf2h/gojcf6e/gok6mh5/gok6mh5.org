I read that on a whim and got up to like chapter 24 or something, then a giant pissed off ghost appeared and half the readers in the thread talked about the story jumping the shark. I ended up getting distracted and reading other things, is it still fine past that point?

I read Worm a while back. Its hard to say whether I enjoyed the story, even if many aspects of the world and characters were great. The fact that every arc felt like you could describe it with the phrase "and then everything got worse" across the entire story was persistently depressing and made it a slog to read at times. Not dissing the author or the story as an absolute, just meaning that I personally had an issue with reading through that. I did finish it though, even if I had to stop a few times, but I don't know if I'll really bother with any of Wildbows other work, given I've heard a lot of mixed feelings on Ward and I tried reading Pale but couldn't get into it. I might just end up scrolling through the wikis for his works sometime out of curiosity instead, since I can't fault Wildbow's creativity.

Yeah I was looking into doing builds like that this PoE league, spent way too long in PoB seeing what I could do. Actually ended up playing a build with CwC Cyclone + Summon Skeles + Heartbound Loops, wearing a Fleshcrafter to instantly kill my Skeles, and a full CwDT Blade Blast + utility Blade skills set up with dualwielding Razor of the Seventh Sun as an Ignite Chieftain. It was surprisingly effective (especially compared to some of the things I play) and you had to keep paying attention, since Cycloning an empty screen would have you quickly kill yourself. I ended up quitting the league early, since I moved house basically the same time the league launched, and it took me over a month to actually start sleeping a passable amount again, so I quickly got too tired for my brain to handle PoE through the fog in my head.
