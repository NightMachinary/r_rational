I just finished chapter two, it's kind of annoying that the story begins with an already grown and educated Jen, the story doesn't seem to attempt to be rational/ist, and at least at the beginning he seems way less experienced as an author, but he made some interesting changes to how magic works compared to canon and the grammar is fine so I'll continue reading it, I think I'll edit this comment every time I finish one of the books(there's four).

Update B1Ch7: up until this point, it's a mixed bag of interesting subversion of fanon tropes, brief looks at what seems like an interesting magic system, somewhat reasonable bashing of details of the canon novels, and characters occasionally holding the idiot ball during social interactions. and the mc seems slightly op.

Update B1C13: more of the same, maybe a bit less of the social idiot ball. though, I'm getting tired of Jen's magic being different just because. 6/10 until now, it's readable.

Update B1C21: still readable and fun, certainly less idiot ball but not rational, Mc very op. Sorry, writing on phone.

Last Update of book 1: I'm on chapter 29/35 but I don't expect my opinion on the subject to change anymore, everything I said before stands up until now. Jen is op by the standards of her age group, it seems like she would be a match for a powerful Auror or pro-duelist, but it's implied that people like dumbledore match her in power and surpass her in experience. it's a popcorn read, it just manages to cross from decent/readable to good (by my standards, and I'll read almost anything if I'm bored), the author was clearly less experienced at this point because Spells in Silence seems to be better written in almost all aspects to the point that I would change my original rating from 7/10 to 7.5/10. coming back to Princess, I would give it a 6.5/10.

my plans now are to finish reading the whole Princess series and then read the Pureblood Pretense. I doubt I'll finish reading the rest of the series before the next weekly thread so I doubt I'll update this comment anymore.
