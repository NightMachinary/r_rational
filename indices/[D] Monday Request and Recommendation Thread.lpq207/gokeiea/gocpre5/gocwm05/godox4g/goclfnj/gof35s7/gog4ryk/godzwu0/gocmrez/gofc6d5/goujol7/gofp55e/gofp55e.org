I really do love Dungeon Crawler Carl, it does some fantastic things. There's a lot of really clever munchkinning with the various loot and Carl is smart and competent with his plans and actions, and I love how he abuses all the mechanics such as infinite storage to its very limits. And on top of that, I really enjoy the humor and setting, all mixed together in a frankly horrifying situation where humanity is effectively dead and made a mockery of by the rest of the universe. I don't typically enjoy it when novels have over the top humor or revolve entirely around it, but I absolutely adore how DCC does it and how it plays into the messed up setting. Carl blowing up a Goblin boss and his boss room full of babies, Donut's crappy lookalike toy that also has influences of Garfield, but instead of normal Garfield, it's all I'mSorryJon material, Mantaurs and all the other whacky monsters, and so on. DCC is a surprisingly good novel that makes the most of it's setting, style, and humor.

I don't know if you'll enjoy this as it's quite divisive apparently, but perhaps you'll enjoy the Japanese Light Novel series "So I'm a Spider, So What?"

It follows a female MC isekai'd into a spider monster, the weakest class of monster, in the largest labyrinth in the world. The litrpg is surprisingly well-done for the medium, even if it isn't anything spectacular like Delve, but is is incredibly tight and without plotholes and even plays into the overarching plot. I will warn that there's quite a large genre shift in the series, but many tend to agree that's where the story becomes even better. It's pretty similar to both DCC and Shade Touched in that the System and world is pretty messed up and that the MC is a non-human MC that just wants to live. The MC's personality is energetic and hilarious, similar to Shadow, if a lot less...wholesome, and a lot more violent.

It's an interesting take on the litrpg and isekai genres that very few other series pull off, at least to me personally. The volumes can be a tad expensive at around 8 dollars a volume if you obtain them through legitimate sources, so price can be a concern for jumping into an unknown series.
