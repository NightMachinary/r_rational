Can anyone recommend /anything/ with a gay male protagonist? I'd love it to be rationalist, but I'll settle for rational too.

Also, I watched the first three seasons of Arrested Development a while ago and the stupidity of everyone in that series was physically hurting me. It's kinda my own fault for not dropping it sooner and the name of the show gives it away, but now I need something to wash ithat horrible taste down, so hit me with your favourite sitcoms and comedies. I've literally only seen Community and HIMYM, so rec classics to your heart's content.
