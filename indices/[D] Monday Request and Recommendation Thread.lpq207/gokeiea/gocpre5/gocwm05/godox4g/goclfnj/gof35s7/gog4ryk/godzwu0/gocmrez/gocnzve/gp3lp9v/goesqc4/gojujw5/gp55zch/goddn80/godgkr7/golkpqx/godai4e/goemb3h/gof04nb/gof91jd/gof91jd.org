All movies, though 'Stand By Me' is adapted from a classic short story and 'It' is a novel, both Steven King, and 'Neverending Story' is a series of novels originally in german, iirc. The first 'It' movie has probably the best child actor performances I've seen in a long time, particularly Sophia Lillis, which goes on to do the netflix show *'I Am Not Okay With This'*(highly recommended).
