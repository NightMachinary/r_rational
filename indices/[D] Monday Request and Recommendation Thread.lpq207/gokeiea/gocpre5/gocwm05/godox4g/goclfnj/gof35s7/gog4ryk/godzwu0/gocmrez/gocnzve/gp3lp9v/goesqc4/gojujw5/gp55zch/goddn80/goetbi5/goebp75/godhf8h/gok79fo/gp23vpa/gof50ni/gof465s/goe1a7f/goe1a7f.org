You can try those BL visual novels. Haven't played many (yes, I read for the story), and I wouldn't call them rational, but:

There's [[https://web.archive.org/web/20070120052330/http://www.grrlgamer.com/review.php?g=animamundi][Animamundi: Dark Alchemist]] though the protagonist is bisexual (or just doesn't care much?). Georik, a country doctor, makes a deal with Mephistopheles to preserve the life in his sister's decapitated head after she was branded a witch and murdered. I only finished one route but frankly the purple-haired guy's ending was sublime. Strongly recommend using a guide, the system is incomprehensible.

Or /Togainu no Chi/ (translates to /Blood of the Reprimanded Dog/). Akira, street fighter, is offered freedom from his prison sentence to take part in a slightly bizarre lawless combat game inside a city ruled entirely by a druglord. I never finished reading this one (also, I can't recommend the anime, it loses the thread early), but what I did read was surprisingly good. Motomi was an especially interesting character. Fair warning, its made by a Nitroplus BL division, which means excessive gore. Edit: and explicit sex, if that wasn't obvious.

Also, he wasn't the protagonist (though he might as well have been, he's practically the main character), but I think that Kogami in /Psycho-Pass/ was hinted to be a homosexual. (As an irrelevant aside, Nitroplus founder Urobuchi Gen was highly invovled in this show.)
