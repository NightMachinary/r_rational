I made another post in this thread with a bunch of BNHA fic. I think all the ones I listed, if they go into relationships or attraction at all, have a gay mc. I think Daymare is the most detailed, with some stuff in the second fic from For Want of a Nail happening, and But You Gotta Get Up At Least Once More has some stuff (even if its a lot more messy emotional stuff than anything healthy iirc, its been a while). There was another one I'm trying to remember too

Edit: Ah yeah it was the Deku Sees Dead People one. Actual kinda functional relationship, although both the characters aren't super keen on the type of traditional romantic relationship, its more about compassion from shared experiences and viewpoints and being physically close for comfort and support instead of like dating and all that other stuff, so not super heavy on "attraction" (in the physical sense it most often gets used) and everything that comes along with that.
