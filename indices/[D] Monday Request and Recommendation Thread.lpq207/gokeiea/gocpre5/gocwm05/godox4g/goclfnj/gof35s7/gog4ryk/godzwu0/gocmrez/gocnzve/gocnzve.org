I am looking for a story I remember reading at some point. The story is basically an AI box experiment turned on it's head.

Humanity discover that reality is a simulation and that it is possible to interact with the outside world somehow. Only they find out that the outside world is *slow*. Humanity spends many generations analyzing every tiny bit of data that slowly drips in from the outside world, including the aliens that operate the computer simulating reality. I think it ends with humanity managing to break out of the box.

Does anybody remember where to find it or what it's called?
