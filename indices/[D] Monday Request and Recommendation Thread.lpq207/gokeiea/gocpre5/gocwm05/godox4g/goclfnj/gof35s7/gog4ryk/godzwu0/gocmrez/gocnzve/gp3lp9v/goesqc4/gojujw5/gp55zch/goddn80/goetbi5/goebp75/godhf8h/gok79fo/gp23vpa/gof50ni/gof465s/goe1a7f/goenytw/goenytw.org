I've read a few BL VNs (and BL anime/manga) over the years, but most of what falls under that category has failed to impress me. Almost all BL seems to suffer from the same tired genre trappings. Not surprising since AFAIK the whole reason the genre exists in the first place is catering to fujoshi, but it's frustrating nonetheless, there's really no reason for something as encompassing as same-sex male romance to be a genre in the first place. Then again the old internet collorary states that 90% of everything is trash, so eh, what can you do. Well, that turned out a bit ranty.

I guess I'll check those titles out. The nyaa seeds are there.
