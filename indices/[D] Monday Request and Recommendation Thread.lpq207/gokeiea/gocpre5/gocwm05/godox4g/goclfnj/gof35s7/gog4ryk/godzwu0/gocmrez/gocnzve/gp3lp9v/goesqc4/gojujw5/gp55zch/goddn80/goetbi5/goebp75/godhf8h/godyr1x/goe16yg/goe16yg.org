Oh, I agree. It's very creative, and a clear inspiration for Community; I remember watching Arrested Development for the first time, and during one specific episode, thought of a very unlikely plot direction that I remember thinking, "If this were a show on Community's level, that's what would happen" - and it did.

I'm talking about Gob and Tony Wonder both wearing masks of the other while planning to sleep with Ann, and ending up sleeping with each other.

I didn't like any of the characters in the slightest though, so I couldn't put it higher.
