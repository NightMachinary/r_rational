Maybe The Daily Grind? Protagonist is bisexual, ish. The first real relationship is with his guy best friend who he lives with.

Ar'Kendrythist. Again, bisexual mc but the most development has been with the male characters instead of female. Not particularly rational.

As for comedies I've been having fun with Letterkenny. All the characters are different shades of stupid but still somewhat smart?

Also Patriot the tv show. It's a tragic comedy, but the situations are so horrible and funny I just can't help but laugh.
