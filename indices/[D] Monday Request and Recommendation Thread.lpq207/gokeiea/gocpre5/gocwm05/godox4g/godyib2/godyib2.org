[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue][Epilogue]] has a party of people who were sent to a fantasy world returning home and adjusting to life on Earth after being gone. It isn't a LitRPG. It also isn't good escapism fiction (sort of the exact opposite or a subversion) since the plot doesn't have much action and is more focused on the mental effects on the characters returning.
