I mean, realistically speaking, what somebody from a more advanced world would actually try to do, if in their previous world they'd neglected to memorize any great technological recipes, is more like publish basic rationality techniques that were common knowledge there, maybe rip off some fictional tropes that this world hadn't invented yet, while trying to get this world geared up for AGI. It doesn't make for a very exciting story.
