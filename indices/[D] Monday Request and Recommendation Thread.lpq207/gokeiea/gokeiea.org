There has been one fic that I literally couldn't put down because of how entertaining and

cool it was. It's like a comedic /Metropolitan Man./ It was so realistic and rational that I could actually see it taking place in real life.

/December, 1940. Bodies are disappearing from morgues. A couple lies murdered in the street. To solve the mystery, Batman must seek the help of the most frustrating thief he's ever crossed. But the conspiracy behind it may still be too powerful. Chased on the coldest night of the year, has the Dark Knight found a foe so above the law even he cannot deliver the offender to justice?/

This novel is like a professional level story and explores how Batman could use his tools in real life. Here we see Batman solve puzzles and problems from logical deductions that the reader could figure out.

/August, 1941. In Gotham City they say the Four Families are untouchable, and no one is more dangerous than Batman. Both these myths are shattered in one night. The first by the Dark Knight himself. The second by a myth far older than Gotham's little tales, a myth that's fearsome and unrelenting and wondrous./

The sequel ups the ante on everything. The introduction of magic, wonder woman, nazis, the mafia and so on. Just creates this detective noir fiction that almost acts like it takes place in the same setting as Metropolitan Man. I would also rate this novel at a professional novel.

The fourth book in this series that is ongoing as of right now.

Can Batman help both ladies without playing the rope in their personal tug-of-war? Stay tuned./

This author isn't getting enough love for how much effort he's put in to his works and all the details and characterizations the characters have in the story. Even Gotham gets a characterization. Just make sure to not have anything important to do because the story is hard to put down. Thanks for reading!

P.S. Does anyone know of any Justice League Fics in the same vein or that are decent to read? I don't really mind if they're rational or not.
