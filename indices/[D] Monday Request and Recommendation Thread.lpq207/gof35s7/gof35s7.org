People here might like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-N0kaRIWo4][Solar Opposites]](<-episode 1 link) by the other creator of Rick and Morty, i.e. not Dan Harmon, of Community fame. You might have heard of him as the one who made such hilariously tasteless and stupid parodies of Back to the Future(fixing time paradoxes via ball licking) and Bill Cosby(undescribable, just [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUBnrIaphQ][watch it yourself]]).

Anyway, the main premise is scifi-y take on a typical sitcom nuclear family, only instead of a husband and wife and it's two genderless-but-male-affecting aliens and their 2 younger clones(literal clones), one affecting as male the other as female, and they escaped their homeworld just as it was destroyed or something and crashlanded on earth.

If I had to describe the show after the first 2 episodes, I'd say it's like Rick and Morty, but 50% more adult swim-y(in a bad way). What do I mean by that? There's a scene in episode 2 where the two kid aliens, minor spoilers: cut open a teenage girl's cranium and pour soda on her exposed brain so they wouldn't get in trouble at school. Yes, 2 kids lobotimize a 3rd.

I almost dropped it at that point, but I'm glad I didn't because [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LakRwuCafEg][episode 3]] is exactly when the show stops pretending to be a procedural scifi riff on your typical nuclear family sitcom and starts to become the sort of weird, off the wall shit that I wish all animated shows aspired to. The kind of thing that would be impossible to do in a live action show, on network television(or even cable), and/or if they didn't already have a guaranteed 2nd season.
