Futurama and BoJack (and Community) are favourites of mine. Futurama doesn't have particularly intelligent characters, but I felt the same hatred toward the characters in Arrested Development, and loved this. BoJack's weird - I don't know if I can even classify it under comedy, but it's very intelligent, self-aware, and hilarious.

Other recommendations (I don't love them as much as the above three, but I'd still strongly recommend them):

What We Do in the Shadows

Parks and Recreation

Fleabag

Toast of London

Rick and Morty
