Shooting a rec for: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40051/isekai-mother]]

Its a fairly rational rationalist isekai. The start gives a bit of a "this magic system makes the MC op because she is genius but I handwave how exactly cos CBF fleshing it out" but later chapters are worth it and are very satisfying.

Also for those who care about diversity the MC is Muslim. For those who don't it doesn't really have any bearing on the plot other than backstory anyway.
