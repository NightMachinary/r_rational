For cases like this, I'd like to write a script that generates different versions of the same story, but with the blanks filled in with different DIE groups. That way, if your social commissar says you need to read more stories about black women, you can pick that in the script and it'll insert the appropriate paragraph in the first chapter, along with filling in the name, and occasional references to clothing and skin tone.
