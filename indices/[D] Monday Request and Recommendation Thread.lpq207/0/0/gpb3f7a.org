  P.S. Does anyone know of any Justice League Fics in the same vein or that are decent to read? I don't really mind if they're rational or not.

Not a fic, but I'm having a ridiculous blast these days with the new Harley Quinn animated show. The Justice League features occasionally, of course, though the main focus is villains. It's a pretty adult and dark humour-esque take on the DC universe, with Harley Quinn breaking free from the Joker and deciding to try and make it big on her own. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aogsZ71ECb0][Here is the clip that single handedly sold me on the show]]. It's like someone went to DC and asked for money to animate their parody crackfic and the execs shrugged and went "sure, why not?".
