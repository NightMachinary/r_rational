30 Rock is great, though it's showing its age a bit.

Parks and Recreation is also pretty good, though in a different way, less laughs-per-minute and more of a parasocial, hanging out kinda vibe. The generally accepted advice is to start with the second season as the first is rough.

If you like Rick and Morty (or even if you don't) you might like Solar opposites, recommended in-depth [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lpq207/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gof35s7/][here]] by yours truly.

I'll second the rec for Bojack Horseman. It's probably the best character study ever done in a half hour comedy. Lots of laughs, lots of feels.

Another show in the same vein as Bojack(laugs+feels) is Louie. This one was a critical darling until Louis CK's fall from grace, whereupon both it and it's creator completely dropped off the radar. Definitely worth a look.
