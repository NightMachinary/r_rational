So, there's an anime called Horimiya airing this season. It's slice-of-life/feel-good romcom, and looks much the way all the rest of that genre looks at first glance. I would not be mentioning it, except...

...the characters, though not necessarily particularly rational, /actually communicate/. It's not lampshaded or even particularly in your face - the show is something of a slow burner - but it brings into sharp relief how few such stories there are in this genre, in this medium. Over and over I keep expecting the cliched thing to happen, and... it doesn't.

I wasn't going to mention it even so, except that last week a particular character's communication issues were revealed and became a plot point... and are on track to be dealt with, following actually sensible reactions instead of the denseness we have all come to expect. I may yet be proven wrong on this matter - we'll find out this week - but at this point I'm betting on the show to resolve this somewhat maturely. I was all ready to declare Wonder Egg Priorty show of the season, but this might, in its understated manner, quietly pip it. Will update if I turn out to be wrong, watch this space :)
