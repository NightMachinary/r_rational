I would add to this that there is another anime this season called Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki-kun which has probably turned off a lot of people with its cringe-sounding premise but actually is a lot smarter and more interesting than that.

The premise is that Tomozaki-kun, an introvert with social anxiety problems but extremely skilled at gaming (specifically, at the in-universe off brand version of Smash Bros) meets up with a long time rival who, he finds out, is a girl from his class - and is absolutely /not impressed/ with him being such a slob. He explains that he refuses to try any harder than this in life because he feels like it's random, unfair and inconsistent - like a bad game - but she replies that it's just sour grapes, and proposes to teach him about "the game of life".

What follows is actually an interesting examination of group and communication dynamics and how social interaction /works/ - as Tomozaki basically trains in the art of not being a total loner. There's a lot more to it as his training skirts the boundary between fair and manipulative, sometimes, and this is subtly acknowledged and dealt with, as well as the motives and mindset of his teacher, Aoi, being themselves perhaps not entirely healthy either. But yeah, in general, it's a pretty unusual take on the idea that social interaction isn't just about "being yourself" if you are the kind of person to whom such things don't come natural, and also an examination of the various sorts of roles and issues that people who are apparently sociable might actually experience when part of a group.
