Just kill Bob? Or at least fire him and kick him out of the company building asap, because an idiot that connects every device to the internet is a walking security hazard. Your corporate enemies could reverse hack those connections and control all the devices in your company. And while your computer systems may have protections, the other devices like coffee machines won't have any. Your enemies could do horrible things like overheat machines to cause fires and turn off the fire alarms and sprinklers so no one notices until it is too late.

On the other hand, if your goal isn't to defend your computer systems but to attack other people's, then Bob is your most valuable employee. Just send him everywhere to connect random devices to the internet, and hire a team of hackers to exploit those unprotected connections.
