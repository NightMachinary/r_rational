How does the power decide whether my part in a casual chain should be obscured? If the computer displaying the live feed has its facial recognition heuristic say there's a person there, is that also censored? If I would increase the number of faces from 3 to 4, does she see a 3 or a blind spot? If I tell it to fake-report every 4 as a 3, does what would have been a blind spot turn out as a 3 because it would have been that both ways?

Write a script that, if it's a 3, tries hack #253 on some internet machine, and displays "success" if that got me control of the machine, and use whether she sees the fake-3 to know whether that hack would have failed, without the machine ever actually hearing from me.

One second is a lot in computer time :)
