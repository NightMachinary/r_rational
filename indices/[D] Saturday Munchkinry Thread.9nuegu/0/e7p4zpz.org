Crack munchkin idea: What if you have telekinesis, but can only control dairy products?

​

So, a few days ago, my friend and I were chatting about lame super powers to get stuck with, and my friend suggested this one. I agreed with him, because it's disappointing that you can only use it if you're making chocolate milk, or trying to get frozen ice cream out of the container.

But then I /really/ thought about it.

There's a lot of dairy products out there. Cheese, condensed milk cans, frozen ice cream, spray cheese, not to mention all the products with milk as an ingredient. So, depending on how powerful the telekinesis is, you could probably use it to move a lot of things. For example, you could line your clothing with dried milk (or liquid, depending on the parameters) and then levitate yourself. A lot of things could be levitated/stolen if you could find a way to put milk inside or around them. You could fly a small drone without using any energy except your mind. No one would ever suspect you're lifting milk, and even if they did, how they would they find you? “We're looking for a suspect who bought a lot of milk products...oh, that's everyone.”

The perfect crime.

You'd even have an excuse to come up with the dumbest supervillan names. Like..."Cheese Whiz" or "Queen Frostine." Or you could go with simple weirdness like "Moist Milk" to creep everyone out.

Anyone else got any weird superpowers they'd think it would be fun to have? :)

^{(Also, sorry if this post doesn't entirely fit the parameters of this thread, I've just been thinking about it for like a week and decided why not, lol.})
