Just for clarification, this power only changes things which you imagine being changed, right? The rest of your body keeps working naturally.

In that case, given that I am physically immortal due to keeping my mental image healthy, I would make incredibly slow changes over very long periods. Adding small amounts of new neural tissue is obviously a must, though it might wind up taking the form of extra ganglia relaying more detailed sensory information rather than making my head bigger. Extra redundancy is a must as well. There are some evolutionary errors which could be fixed, like fixing that nerve whose name I forget which goes all the way up and down the neck to reach the larynx from the brain.

All of that pales in comparison to my primary goal, however: R&D. Since I'm physically immortal, accruing wealth and power is easy, and I would sink a lot of that into biomedical reasearch to find new ways of changing my body to be better. Discovering a way to make nanotubes, graphene, and other exotic materials would allow me to incorporate them into my body for strength, heat resistance, electrical shielding, etc. I could experiment with creating silicon wafers in my own nervous system to improve processing speeds, though connecting them up would obviously be difficult. Extra glands under my conscious control for directly controlling things about my body are an obvious improvement. If an experiment fails, I could locally turn off pain and accelerate reabsorption of materials to fix the problem. There's tons of options here.

My other primary project would be fostering peace. I can only die if someone kills me or I'm really stupid, and removing stupidity is the goal of the first project. Therefore, preventing potentially dqngerous wars and social strife is a must. I don't want to be the benevolent overlord, as those will be targets no matter how benevolent, so I would defer rule to normals and act in an advisory role. I could prevent the mistakes of the past by remembering history perfectly and relaying it to civilian leadership. I think my ideal position would be on something like the modern House of Lords, which is filled with experts in various fields who act as resources for the MPs. This would keep me out of the spotlight and close enough to the centers of power to still maintain peace and prosperity.
