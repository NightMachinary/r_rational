I don't get it. "connect to the internet" as in, (1) spawn an invisible router that hooked to my company's intranet? or (2) spawn an invisible modem separately from my company's network?

(1) that's not much of a problem, just configure your network to deny all foreign MAC, or stop allocating new IP.

(2) that's not much of a problem, even if someone hacked that coffee machine (i don't even know how they can target it), there's no processing power in a coffee machine, it can't execute any program, can't host any virus.
