Slow shapeshifting:

Bloodline: You have a mental self-image, which is extremely detailed (to the limits of your medical understanding. If you are a lay person, this is skin deep. Double phd in biochemistry and surgery, it includes a whole lot of the underlying systems. Historically, this was a really fast way of testing if a medical theory reflected reality, since a member of the blood who believed something wrong about how the body worked would get really sick and potentially die. For some reason, not a whole lot of Blood doctors before the modern era. ) This image is stable unless consciously edited. You can change it via a meditative trance, and one you have done so, over the next several months, your body will change to match the new image. For major changes, this incurs quite a high metabolic cost - you eat enough for three people, sleep 12 hours a day.

Downsides: Major alterations to your long bones will fuck with your coordination - you can add or remove ten centimeters to your height, but you will be as clumsy as a teen who just had an equivalent growth spurt. It is, technically, possible to give yourself an entirely inhuman bodyplan, but you have to learn to use the new body the hard way. The power does not let you cheat. Being a centaur? Sure, but you are going to have to learn how to gallop with no instinct for it.

Alterations also have to be viable at all intermediate stages, since you will be spending weeks at all the transitional stages.

They also have to be biomechanically viable - you cannot make your bones superhumanly strong unless you can visualize in detail exactly where that strength is coming from, and a biochemical pathway for producing the relevant materials. And you have the relevant materials in your diet.

You can kill yourself getting this wrong.

Now, two questions : This bloodline is old. It does not breed true very often, but on the other hand, people who have it only ever die by violence, misadventure and doing something spectacularly stupid with the power.

1: What would you do with this power?

2: What would be some of the well-established techniques, given that people have been playing with it since, well, the invention of fire.
