Lol. On the flip side, you'd also make a great magician. Just set up at an ice cream parlor, declare yourself the "strongest person alive" and then lift heavy people using only your finger. But then, select one five year old who you "can't lift" no matter how hard you try, and then he lifts /you/.

...This plan fits into my supervillain scheme somehow, I'm sure...
