Actually, this is an interesting question, because it would depend on how the telekinesis worked. If it's a force inside someone's stomach pushing up against their stomach walls, then yeah that would be uncomfortable. But, it's possible telekinesis applies force differently. Have you ever seen those shows where telekinetics float things with their mind, almost as if gravity stopped working? Well, it's possible that telekinesis could make someone "floatable," and make it easier to lift someone. (Then again, not sure how much dairy you would need to levitate someone from inside their digestive tract, lol.)

But honestly, if the telekinesis is raised to the level of performance art, then you probably won't rely on what's in people's stomachs, anyway. There's no way to tell how much is in there, or how fast it's being digested (besides, there are some weirdos who eat /sorbet/). So, you'd need to find other sources of dairy to use in the trick. You could place dairy in an item of clothing, for example, such as along your arms or in your gloves. Or you could have a stool or cushion that contains solidified dairy products, and then raise them once they sit on it. That way, you know exactly how much dairy you have, and can easily estimate how much force you need to apply to lift them. Also, the upward force will feel like it's coming from you, and not from their stomachs. :)
