Really the question here is what's the limits on the amount of force that can be exerted, how precisely can it be exerted, what's the limit on mass controlled and what's you're range limit (if any). Also you need to know whether the person gets tactile feedback from their telekinesis and whether they can have their telekinesis act automatically without deliberate conscious control. This is important because for instance if you telekinesis can be "programmed" to act automatically then you can shoot people by making plastic out of casein then applying very raid force, or automatically have milk form forcefields to stop bullets just held together by the telekinesis.

Depending on the parameters above I can easily imagine this power being anywhere from extremely formidable to something that could easily allow world domination even in a setting with other superpowers (provided nobody has any divination style powers that would let them trace distant applications of your powers back to you).
