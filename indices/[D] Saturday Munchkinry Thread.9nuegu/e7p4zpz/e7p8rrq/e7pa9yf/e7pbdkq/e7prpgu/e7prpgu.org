I would like to note that you're going to need to make this power both magical and non-hereditary, because if such an ability existed and it was /at all/ hereditary then it would have spread over the entire population pretty quickly from a evolutionary standpoint.\\
After all everyone with this power is probably going to be maximally attractive and strong enough to easily defeat any normal (prehistoric) human in combat using some basic body modifications copied from animals. So very quickly (on evolutionary timescales) people with these powers would end up the leaders of every tribe of humans and would very rapidly spread their genes into the whole population, until any children without the abilities ended up basically being viewed as deformed (and rarely ever breeding).
