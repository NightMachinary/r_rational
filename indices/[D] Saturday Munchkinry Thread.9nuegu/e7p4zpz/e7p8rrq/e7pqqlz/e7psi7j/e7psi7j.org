You are about to be imprisoned at Guant√°namo Bay. You possess a small device capable of storing items far larger than it, without the increase in mass being especially noticeable. This device can be mostly concealed in a closed fist. Assume that, while such devices that /can/ store (read: capture) humans like Pokemon exist, the one in your possession explicitly lacks this ability.

Assuming that you want to hold on to this device, so as to smuggle something useful into the facility, how could one go about doing this without it being discovered? I'm assuming that the initial intake will involve a cavity search.

Does the answer differ if the prison staff have knowledge of this type of device?
