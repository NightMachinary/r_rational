browsing the [[/r/slatestarcodex]] subreddit recently I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9is0vo/my_secret_power_is_being_invisible_to_women/][this thread]] and wondered as to its munchkinry potential. Let's say you have the ability to activate and deactivate selective invisibility to those who sincerely identify as female, as well as those "assigned female at birth" if they lack the cognitive ability for such self-identification (e.g. nonhuman female animals). This invisibility extends to the entire human sensorium up to the threshold of pain (e.g. women will not hear you or sounds directly produced by your actions unless you scream loudly in their ears). It otherwise also extends to anything you're wearing or carrying. The mechanism of action for this power is psychological, rather than physical -- you still affect the world around you as you normally would, it's just female perception that gets edited after the fact. So there's no physics-breaking taking place or anything. Causal chains initiated while your power is active lose their invisibility when no longer connected to yourself over a second's time, so if you roll a ball down a hill, the ball becomes visible shortly upon leaving your hands. Likewise, your invisibility applies to real-time image capture (e.g. a security camera) but not if there's a delay of a few seconds between capture and viewing. If driving a car with this power active, you are invisible but the car is not, so the car appears to be driving itself (unless you are physically carrying the car through non-technological means).

Is there anything special that could be accomplished with this power? Beyond just being intrinsically or scientifically interesting, I figure it could serve as a useful litmus test for those "uncertain" of their transgender status, which could be useful for those deciding whether to transition (esp. children on the cusp of puberty? if they've developed a sufficiently strong gender identity by then? I hear certain procedures are more effective if you catch them early and apply e.g. puberty blockers). You could also serve as a spy or thief in very particular settings populated exclusively by women? Maybe as a security guard for heads of state at women's only summits? Acting casually, you could also pass security checkpoints in female-gated environments, where nobody else has reason to look at you closely -- e.g. get on a bus driven by a woman and forego paying fare. Probably the best way to leverage this power is through publicity, though, rather than secrecy -- it should be enough to e.g. catapult your stardom, starting with the talk-show circuit and ending with your own celebrity? There might be interest in conducting (consensual) prank interviews with female celebrities where you turn your power on and off and they must adapt to the challenge, and the public at large would probably want to expose themselves to your power for its novelty? Assuming the effect is not perceived to be too invasive. You could also minimize risk in the context of training female zoo animals or something?

What would change in its application if this superpower applied exclusively to men, rather than women?
