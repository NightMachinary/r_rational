It's possible "superhero" isn't a thing that resonates with this sub. Of everything I've published here, Induction was consistently the least popular, and there's very little superhero fic submitted -- it's unusual that there's a Superman one on the page right now. The only other that I can think of offhand was Metropolitan Man, which was (A) a great story and (B) by alexanderwales, so it had the necessary social proof for people to give it a chance.
