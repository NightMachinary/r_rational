No problem, and thanks for the feedback--particularly on the elements you weren't as personally interested in. I aim to keep a balance between a wide variety of scenes, both for dynamic contrast and to keep up the tension on whats coming next.

I don't think Flicker would be nearly as effective a character if I didn't show the ends of the spectrum--both quiet social struggles and tearing apart the sky over Bonneville salt flats.
