I'd like to chime in thanking you for posting this - I don't usually post talking about stories I'm reading unless there's some sort of discussion prompting me, but I heavily use this sub as a way to track when new stuff comes out.

And from your list of elements mentioned, Black Swan and Flicker cutting loose are definitely at the top of my list, but even the stuff that's slightly less interesting to me (Stella/romance-y bits) still is written well enough and is informed by reality enough that I don't think I've ever actively /disliked/ reading it, I just got more excited when the other stuff showed up again.

So, thanks, again!
