The "how not to get killed by the monster" video was great. Especially "if it looks like you want to have sex with it, you don't" and "broke rule 7".

For something as high-quality as this series has been, you get a lot less love around here than I think you should. The Black Swan arc is not really to my tastes, but it's well written enough to enjoy anyway. The rest of it is excellent.
