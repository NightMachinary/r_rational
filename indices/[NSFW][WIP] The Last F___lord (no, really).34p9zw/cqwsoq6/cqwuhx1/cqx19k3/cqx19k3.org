I'm a couple hours in. Game-wise it's competent but ultimately just an RPG-maker rpg; good balance of skills and such, paced well so far. Very, /veeeery/ railroaded straight with no really solid sidequesting or anything so far. Monsters are finite, so presumably it's set to not require grinding. Don't know whether that will change or not.

Erotica-wise, it's /decent/ I suppose. It's all text (and a little sprite art that I don't really count) so far, and easy enough to skip if you don't like it. The couple of introductory sex scenes are almost funny they're so bad, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's being done on purpose, and it gets better soon enough.

/Writing and story-wise/? It's actually telling a really interesting take on classic rpg/heroism (and a few porn/erotica) tropes! What really stands out is the main character; he is pretty much pragmatism personified, but at the same time he does have a personality, and the conflict he has to face is solidly done so far (if a little angsty at first, but understandably so, and not unbearable) A fair deal of actually funny jokes thrown in to boot.
