If you'd asked "absolutely" I'd have paused, but I can say I'm reasonably confident without hesitation. I did seven updates without requiring a restart, but this time I chose to upgrade a number of things on the back end to expand the amount of content I could include. I think the game will be better for it, but it's been a lot of work for me and not of the kind I enjoy. I have every intention of keeping saves valid from v0.8.0 through the end of the game.
