I just tried it out, and to my surprise I'm still playing an hour later. So to offer a counterpoint to the intro blurb above, the very introduction/beginning of the game was very misleading (and distasteful, really, IMO) but it quickly does a very unexpected and somewhat clever 180. I was just about to quit when that happened, too.

The combat itself is... fairly well done, if basic. It actually brings back a lot of old memories from playing similar RPGs on GBA back in the day (Golden Sun comes to mind as the primary example).

The plot is beginning to look a little more interesting and innovative where I'm at, after the initial plot setup is over (I suspect), but besides all the funny meta RPG genre jokes and the decent writing, I'm not sure exactly where the rational part comes in, to be honest. If you can't at least tolerate very explicit (and sometimes /weird/) sex scenes enough to scroll past them, then this isn't for you.

I'm not sure whether I'll continue it, but I /might./ It's been surprisingly not-bad so far. Without the whole sex angle, I'd definitely recommend it just for the interesting story angle (if perhaps not here, though I reserve my judgement on that point for later, if I continue).

On an aside note, [[#s][weak spoilers]]
