OK I've only just started, but from the games introductory infodump:

#+begin_quote
  the incubus king came from across the ocean and assaulted the world with his hordes of horny ogres and succubi nymphomaniacs. Armies that attempted to oppose him quickly fell prey to their own lusts and joined his ranks of mindless sex-addicts.

  When the great powers of the world combined their forces, they succeeded only in fighting the Incubus King to a standoff. For decades, the world attained a kind of peace. Many nations grew complacent, failing to realize that the Incubus King was only gathering his powers to take control of the world once and for all. And then fuck it in the ass - definitely metaphorically, possibly literally.

  You are a young man born in this era of tenuous peace and granted a momentous destiny. You have been chosen by the goddess Ivala, granted special powers to fight the Incubus King and his evil.

  But power has a way of corrupting, and only time will tell if your power will be used for good or evil...
