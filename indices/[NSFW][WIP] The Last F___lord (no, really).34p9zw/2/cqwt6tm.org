Ah, this game. I also recommend it, and have been playing it every time it updates. It's quite good, explaining lore around the Demon King and why he behaves such as he does, as well as lots of other neat things. Like mercantile skill and poking fun at common RPG traits like rat-slaying or pail-collecting.
