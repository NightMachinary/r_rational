Bah, don't worry about it, I was just overreacting because I was silly enough not to read the update notes before downloading, so the cliffhanger was a complete surprise.

You really have made a game worth getting antsy over, in any case! I especially love the parts about rationally assembling resources and political allies to get an army. And all the worldbuilding you put into it pretty much tells everyone that you really do care about this setting (Though the library was maybe a bit too huge of a chunk of it all at once, but I enjoy reading anyway :P)
