Hey guys! This is Sierra, really glad to see some of you are enjoying my game! I'm new to Reddit, but I figured I'd pop in and answer some questions.

First up, FYI: if you are playing or thinking of playing, the next version of the game is going to release very soon. This will be the first and hopefully only time old save files are invalid between versions - this version of the game is an upgrade in a number of ways. So holding off would be in your best interest unless you want to replay.

Pleasure to featured on this subreddit. I consider rationality a worthwhile ideal and some of that comes out in what I create, but I don't know how many of your criteria the game meets. The items under "rational fiction" strike me as good guidelines for anything, but this game will only meet one or two of the "rationalist fiction" criteria.

Let me be perfectly honest and say they're fairly minor aspects of the story overall, however. I was more interested in deconstructing the adult game genre, as some have noted. People here might enjoy the game, but it'd probably be better suited to some kind of pragmatism subreddit... if they're into NSFW content there. If you guys have suggestions, I'd welcome them.
