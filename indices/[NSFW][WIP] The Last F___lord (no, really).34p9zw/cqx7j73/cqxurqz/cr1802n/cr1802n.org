FYI, I'm attempting to make the game friendly to people who don't like power leveling. Enemies will always be finite, making grinding effectively impossible. And I always test the game balance with a minimum level party and tweak until there's a strategy to make it through.

It's still an old school RPG, so you know what you're getting, but I don't think grinding has to be part of that experience.
