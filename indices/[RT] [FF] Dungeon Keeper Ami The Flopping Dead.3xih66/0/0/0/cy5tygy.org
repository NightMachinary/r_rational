It has been shown that for creating a Master-Minion connection the DM has to give a symbolic unit of currency that's recognised as real (gold, gems) by their Heart (a minted coin usually). There have been no indications so far that any kind of fake currency designed for a virtual economy would trigger such connection.

The author could make this approach useless of course by his [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod][word of god]] (like how he made “torturing zombies” possible without Ami even doubting for a second whether it will work), but logically if Hearts were rigged to react to any exchange between a DM and a captive, all her civilians would've already been converted into her minions, since she's been providing them with both services (housing) and products (food, clothing) for quite some time by now (and the fake currency will basically be representing the same goods and services).
