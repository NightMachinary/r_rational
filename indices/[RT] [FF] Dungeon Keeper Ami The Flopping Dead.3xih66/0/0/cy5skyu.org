  Civilians as workers: Ami limits the basic food, leisure and comfort choices that all civilians have access to and also creates a fake currency for them. From that point on, if a civilian wants to buy extra privileges (e.g. have something more delicious to eat, better living conditions, etc) then they'll have to do some type of work for Ami's base. Since it doesn't matter who uses it to buy such privileges, it can also be used as a currency in a trade between civilians. This will also not trigger a minion link activation because Ami's not giving a currency (gold, gems, etc) that the game mechanics treats as “real”.

Isn't the keeper bond more insidious than that? The dark seems to have munchkined it to the point that that doing any service for a keeper for any compensation triggers employment.
