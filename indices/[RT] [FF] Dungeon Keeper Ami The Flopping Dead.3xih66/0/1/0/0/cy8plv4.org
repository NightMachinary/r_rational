1) Sure I can. People sell gems for gold, people story gems as gold, /gems are perceived as a currency in parts of the world/, especially in a time predating paper money. The Keeper bond is /conceptual/: if you trade a /service/ for a /good/, you're a minion, and the limits there are /English/. (For that matter, remember that Camilla was made a minion by trading for a magic carpet, which certainly isn't currency. I suppose you can argue that the carpet has intrinsic value - but gold has no intrinsic value beyond looking shiny, though in some universes it's particularly amenable to enchantments.)

3) I would expect those to start producing minion bonds irregularly as they begin to be traded.

4) Minion bonds can't be severed that easily, or Camille would've severed hers already. In fact they can't be severed at all without extremely good immediate reasons.

Aaaand now you're getting into practices that not only take a long time (unless you want to actively use child soldiers), but will also totally destroy all of her "good Keeper" cred with the Light.

Only in the sense that Ami already does, through the rats. They can't replace a dwarf or something. And they still have the problem of being weak to light magic, without Ami's ability to leave quickly and defend herself.

... what, /mass petrification/? Shyeah I'd put limits on that, the world wouldn't look the way it did if that was possible. Ami brings /modern technology/ and /creativity/, but not actual magical knowledge* - I would not expect her to be out-thinking thousands of years of wizards on a spell as obvious as "do this, but to more people."

--------------

Still time she has to spend /thinking/ about it.
