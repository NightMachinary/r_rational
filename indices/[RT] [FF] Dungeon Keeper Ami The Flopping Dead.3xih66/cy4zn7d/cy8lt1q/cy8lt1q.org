I'd be worried about 1). It's not just a matter of the dungeon heart - remember that this world works on Sailor Moon-style conceptual magic, emotions and authorities and whatnot are irreducible here.

In /particular/, note that Ami is an Empress, with that title being granted by the Dark Gods themselves. As such, she has the right to issue currency. I'd be very surprised if, say, giving someone the a bank note or statement of debt from the Shining Concord Empire didn't trigger a minion bond.

2) has the problem of sabotage - Keepers are /hated/, to a degree that there will be a lot of medium-intelligence people willing to give up their lives for a chance to ruin a Keeper's life. Or even make it moderately more annoying.

3) a) This is purely a magic solution, and this world doesn't fulfill the criteria of Sanderson's Laws. It'd feel like a Deus Ex Machina narratively if it was pulled off. b) What spies? Remember that this world has had centuries to perfect anti-Keeper measures, and that the vast majority of Ami's minions are averse to holy light. She's better off doing the tricks she /is/ doing - possessing rats to use as remote cameras - than trying to get someone to go undercover. Unless you're considering turning dwarves, which ... see above about hatred of Keepers - she would be very, very lucky to get even a single defector without torture. c) This one is valid, though she's been a bit busy.
