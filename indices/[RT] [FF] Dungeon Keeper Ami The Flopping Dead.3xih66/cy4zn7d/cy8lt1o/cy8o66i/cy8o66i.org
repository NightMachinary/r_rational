/Regarding currency bonding issue:/

1) The title of Empress was granted by the Light, not Dark. 2)

  I'd be very surprised if, say, giving someone the a bank note or statement of debt from the Shining Concord Empire didn't trigger a minion bond.

You can't have it both ways. Either Ami's [magic→physical crystals→more magic] conversion works because the logic of Dungeon Keeper's game recognises /ordinary/ crystals as power-relevant, or it recognises as such the /supernatural/ currency units (currency empowered by her title, for instance) and not ordinary crystals. Giving Amy the power to use both worlds to power her magic would feel even more broken that what you're trying to rise as an argument.

3) As I've said, everything that the new fake currency represents is already being provided to the civilians. Imagine, for instance, that instead of the fake banknotes some of Ami's minions just kept notes on who needs to be given the extra privileges and who --- not. Should /that/ be triggering a bond as well? Civilians have been receiving food and shelter both for free and for work-in-exchange (the cook), so this isn't even an issue to be arguing about.

4) Even if this option ended up not working, it would still be worth trying out, since the price of failure would be a single civilian who has to force himself to sever the bond (as the orcs have done previously).

Many of the newly-acquired civilians are not only children, but also orphans. Some of them have even been shown to start voicing their unsure positive opinions about Ami. Training them into a prestigious fighting unit, one that isn't afraid of this particular keeper (and is even loyal to her because she's shown nothing but kindness to them), should not be a problem. Any further problems of sabotage are easily dealt with via prophylactic mind-reading of those civilians who agreed to take a position of power.

  What spies?

She has at least two demons from Earth that have shown themselves to be highly qualified for spying.

  3) a)

Are you referring to the petrification spell? All the premises are already there for this to work --- it was mentioned that creatures can be petrified and then brought back to normal again. If it feels too powerful, you'll have to put restrictions on it to cripple its use as the game's DM. But from the in-universe perspective that argument is very weak.

  This one is valid, though she's been a bit busy.

Time's not that much of an issue because she can teleport and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf][BodySurf]] at the speed of light. The only time she'd be needing would be for physically scanning the area through some deep-sea dweller's eyes.
