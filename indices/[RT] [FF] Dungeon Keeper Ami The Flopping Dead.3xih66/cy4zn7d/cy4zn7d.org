Since it is not uncommon for all the comments to accidentally get destroyed on the hosting website, I suggest opening a discussion here: If you were to continue Ami's game from the point when she'd just planted her newest Heart near (inside) the Dwarven territory, how would you proceed, and what tactics\ideas would you use to improve your situation?

I'll quote some of mine from another post:

  - Civilians as workers: Ami limits the basic food, leisure and comfort choices that all civilians have access to and also creates a fake currency for them. From that point on, if a civilian wants to buy extra privileges (e.g. have something more delicious to eat, better living conditions, etc) then they'll have to do some type of work for Ami's base. Since it doesn't matter who uses it to buy such privileges, it can also be used as a currency in a trade between civilians. This will also not trigger a minion link activation because Ami's not giving a currency (gold, gems, etc) that the game mechanics treats as “real”.

  - Civilians as a think tank: Ami asks her friends from her original dimension to let her copy some I.Q. tests and then uses the above mentioned currency system to motivate civilians to take them. Those that prove to be clever enough or original enough in their solutions get selected to become a new type of military operators. They are told to design their own Reaper bots (a junction project with warlocks) and eventually start operating them in battle (this plot arc can have some minor similarities to Ender's game). This insures that the powerful technology on which reaper bots are running will not be wasted on low-intelligence goblins or slow and clumsy Mark I reaper bots.

  - When Ami relocates her base to the dwarf territory, she considers that it is likely that her new location will be found out pretty quickly, considering how much ruckus they have made when transporting troops and resources through underworld roads. Since being found out will most likely mean an almost immediate attack from dwarves, Ami calls for an advisor meeting as soon as she wakes up and is updated on current situation. Several projects are being initiated during this meeting, and several decisions made at the spot.

    - She asks Torian to research on how a large group of people (around 8k, to be more precise) can be put into some kind of cryogenic sleep, and whether a petrification spell, similar to the one Monteraine used on her vampires can be used as a solution.
    - She asks her spies to infiltrate the nearest Dwarven settlement and gather information on their political system, culture, taboos, previous encounters with Keepers, battle strategies against keepers, and potential points of weakness while prioritizing speed over amount of gathered data. She also tells her warlocks to see if there's an easy solution to reading a dwarf's memory unnoticed and erasing such a memory without a chance of it being recovered later (e.g. in a Light temple), so that her spies will stay unnoticed and unharmed.
    - She also goes Horcrux-hunting at the coordinates where the Temple to the Crowned Death had been destroyed, looking for any artefacts that were magically potent enough to survive such intense temperatures.
