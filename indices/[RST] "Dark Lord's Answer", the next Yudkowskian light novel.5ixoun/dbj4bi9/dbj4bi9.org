I can't help thinking that Elaine's backstory is that of humanity being destroyed by an ai who sent each member of the race to a separate world sort of similar to Failed Utopia 4-2 only more drastic. Each was sent to the world where they would be able to achieve the most and/or receive the most satisfaction of their fantasies by an almost, but not quite, friendly ai.

Overall I feel that I would have preferred the story without the BDSM elements. They didn't seem linked with the rest of the plot. Of course I love economics and could cope with a story entirely devoted to it. Some might disagree.
