Hrm. [[#s][Spoiler]]

[[#s][Spoiler]] Though that may not have been your intention but instead caused by me reading things into the story due to my own bias.

Other feedback would be that there was little in the form of suspense or interesting world building or really intriguing ideas and that the ending was a bit anticlimactic. Then again, an anticlimactic ending is pretty realistic in this situation.

All in all, I've read better short stories from you for free. But the fact that I greatly enjoyed those better short stories /and/ that this one was still decent even if not great mean that you definitely deserve what I happily paid.
