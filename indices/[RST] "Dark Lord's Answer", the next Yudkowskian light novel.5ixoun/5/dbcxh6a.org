(Spoilers below.)

So, this was an interesting piece. I've been thinking a lot about "message fiction" lately, fiction that has a pretty clear message or idea or position or whatever that is trying to be communicated through the extended analogy or application or example that is the story. A lot of my favourite pieces of fiction are those that are convincing in conveying perhaps otherwise unintuitive concepts, or just those that aren't popularly held. It's satisfying to walk through concepts and their implications like that.

So the fact that this was an admitted failure at what was initially at least in part an attempt at producing a message fic of that kind makes it interesting. It isn't a complete failure - it still communicates a lot of ideas and I still found it a fun read, but I find myself getting a lot out of analyzing it, thinking about what the story was trying to do, what worked and what didn't, where it went to do so.

In terms of economics, it didn't seem to get that far with monetary policy except to point out that deflation was bad, and increasing the money supply could be a good way to combat it. I guess on the way there it did lay some groundwork on economic equilibria and unintended consequences through the kinda clunky analogical lecture midway through the story. Eliezer even got in a basic income plug in the welfare bit.

I think the story seemed to end up saying more about ethics and image though. Like, it made sure to touch base with consequentialism very quickly, which makes sense since it's the basis of ethical judgement for the duration of the story. But there are so many things that ended up being part of the story, the sexual masochism, the isekai visitor, hiding true identities, virtue signalling, being sane or having insight in an unopimized or insane world, what image to project in accordance with what you plan on doing and the importance of perception, all those pieces the story worked with and put together to make points about subjects often rather removed from one another. It was fun, but it was messy, and things weren't often all that interrelated. Repeatedly weirding out the prude mc with BDSM in your illustrative econ story is an interesting choice, and much of the story was like that.

I'm really glad it was made and released, anyhow. It's cool to get to see examples of early attempts at specific ideas, case studies of things that didn't work out exactly as intended, and it's fun to place it and what it does in context with the rest of Eliezer's output. Happy to have read it.
