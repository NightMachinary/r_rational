EY is advocating an economic school of thought called 'Market Monetarism' which is not agreed upon by all economists.

I'm not an expert and I don't know which is right, but some other schools of thought include 'Neo-Keynesianism' and 'Neo-Fisherism'.

It seems like the most likely 'Q' in EY's post would be the European Central Bank since in February they experienced deflation?

In my personal opinion I don't see much difference between 1% and 2% inflation, but when the prospect of deflation rises, that is the time to use all available tools (including ridiculing central bankers) to prevent deflation.
