In what file format(s) is the Gumroad version provided? I can find this information on neither [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/dark-lords-answer/][the linked page]] nor [[https://gumroad.com/l/DarkLordsAnswer][the purchase page]], though [[http://blog.gumroad.com/post/115402625338/tools-for-ebook-formatting][this help page]] recommends "exporting your book as a PDF, EPUB, and MOBI, and then uploading all three formats to your product".
