Reading Chapter 6 again, Weiss says

#+begin_quote
  "it wasn't the main goal" - Weiss

  "What was the main goal, then?" - Ruby

  "I can't say. Class 1 restricted information." - Weiss
#+end_quote

If Weiss can't tell Ruby the main reason, then it seems a bit weird to point it out so much, even if Ruby was sure it existed.

Theory time!

The assimilation and then "The exclusivity of exceptionality" (what a mouthful) right next to each other. Hmm

By making everyone identical in most regards, the people with differences stood out stronger (Weiss says so herself about her family's semblance), so this could be a drive to make hunters stronger by focusing "specialness" onto chosen hunters.

If this is the case, then Weiss must've been doing this intentionally. Instead of telling Ruby the secret, she gives her all the information she needs to figure it out herself (and the audience). Potential plot relevance? Maybe we can infer things about Weiss' motives and Atlas' culture. Weiss wants to share things with her teammate. She is restricted by Atlas' law/culture/her responsibility. She is willing to circumvent that restriction. Even though Atlas' social norms dictate that citizens can handle anything they are told, they still keep information secret -> Maybe their culture + structure only work if dangerous facts aren't known about at all by the public.
