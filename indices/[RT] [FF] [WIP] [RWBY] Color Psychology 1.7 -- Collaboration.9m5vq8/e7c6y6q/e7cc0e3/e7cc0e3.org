man what a SUPER awkward conversation

I like Jaune's technically-true statements about his aura. From the last chapter, "never better", and from this chapter "It won't. Unless I run out of aura the normal way, of course." I do wonder why he isn't able to talk about his problem.

I also like how Ruby is embarrassed about her "don't propose solutions or analyses yet" problem-solving method. Too real... I've never had much luck getting my coworkers to try it.

Also what's up with Pyrrha's power? In canon she just controls magnetism, right? ("wow, you can control poles") I dunno how to square that with what she does to Ruby's power, or how she figures out what Jaune's problem is, or how she heals him, or why she's perfectly exact at putting her weapon away. Is her power different in this story? Some clever use of magnetism that I haven't thought of? (Electromagnetism /is/ one of the four fundamental forces.) Some special interaction between magnetism and aura?
