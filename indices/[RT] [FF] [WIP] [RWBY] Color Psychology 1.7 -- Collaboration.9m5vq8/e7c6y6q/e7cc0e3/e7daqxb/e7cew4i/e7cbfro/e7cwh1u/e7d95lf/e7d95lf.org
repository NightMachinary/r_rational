I'd say they're very mercenary and effective in Weiss' case, but is it a better attitude than vale or mistral?

  In Atlas ... you should never become upset, no matter what topic is broached, or in what matter. Citizens are considered responsible for their own mental state.

The usual weakness of this attitude is a barrier to communication out of fear of being seen as weak. This is not true in Weiss' case, but it's questionable whether the entire population is capable of talking clearly. I also don't know how much of Atlas is able to control their emotions as effectively as Weiss.

There is a question on the mental stress of controlling their emotions, which I have absolutely no idea about. Does it take effort to suppress their emotions or does it become negligible after enough practise? Does it impact fun?

Caring only about their own mental state decreases cooperation on managing them, but depending on above, this could be irrelevant. Does this promote an individualist mindset in general life?
