Weiss is pretty great at the whole communication thing, and I really like how you're handling the character in general thus far. She plays off Ruby's technical mindset very well; I can see their differing strengths leading to realistic character growth.

Also, your portrayal of Pyrrha does more than just pay lip service to the whole "never had friends/childhood and was socially stunted" thing, which the show was guilty of IIRC. This chapter had her acting like a junior politician (or just a really bad, unelectable one) in that she smiled a lot and was polite, but apparently wasn't well-trained enough in the whole "crowd interaction persona" to smoothly transition over to dealing with smaller, more intimate groups.

As a result there was so much politeness that what she was ultimately communicating basically never matched her tone, which made her seem either really passive aggressive or simply not able to assertively get her thoughts across. Also, her nonstop smiling just came across as creepy: she was smiling so much that anyone in a convo with her would soon start to distrust that her smiles actually meant anything, which isnt conducive to forming relationships (or even interacting casually, really).

Really enjoying this story!
