The impression I got was less that he wasn't /able/ to talk about his problems and more that he couldn't explain himself without revealing that he was a fraud (like in canon). But there are a number of things that do seem to be non-canon about his situation: Ozpin seems to think that there are "powers beyond semblances" involved, and I find it unlikely that his situation is like it is in canon where his (non-aura) self-image is defined by wanting to be a hero so much that he lies in order to become one. Of course, playing with Jaune's backstory and how much various people know about it is basically a fully-formed genre of RWBY fanfiction at this point, so there's really no telling which minute variation this story is going for.
