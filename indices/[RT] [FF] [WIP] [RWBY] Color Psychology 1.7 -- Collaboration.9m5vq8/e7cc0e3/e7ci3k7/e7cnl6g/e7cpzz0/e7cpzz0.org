The fact that "Jaune" happened to be mispelled into a different (but still recognizably nominative) form is hilarious. Looking at my keyboard, it seems you missed J for K and U for I. As for whether aura will change things for him, I don't know. I don't feel like anyone knew Jaune well enough to know about it, and anything else could be attributed to character growth.
