Speaking of Jaune, self-image, and aura...your post's inclusion of this topic brought a big question to my mind: how is Kaine going to deal with the fact that aura apparently is some sort of bounded reality warping field?

Aren't people going to start asking questions when his image starts to change drastically in the coming weeks/months? Because (unless I misunderstood how aura works in this fix) his current image is probably in major conflict and not matched at all with his internal idealized image of self, which is what aura works off.

Is he going to have to explain why he suddenly has clean cut hair, a chiseled jaw, and a generally more heroic seeming? Or is it going to go the opposite route, in the event his aura plays off his self doubts?

Or is this interaction going to be one of the big mysteries of the fic, in that he happens to be one of those rare individuals who is bad at lying to themselves and whise self image maps well into reality? I.e., his "knight armor on top of blue jeans" half and half look matches how his ample but acknowledged self doubt doesn't get in the way of his desire to do good (or play hero, if we're being uncharitable).

I'm looking forward to finding out if this'll be a plot point going forward.
