Good analysis...

And now that you've raised that whole topic, I'm kind of getting "Daily Grind" vibes re: the "Secret" creature, and how it exists/is powered by not just closely-held secrets, but by those not in the loop knowing that those secrets exist in the first place.

Maybe a person (i.e. the Schnee collective) is a lot more special when lots of people know about it and can't figure out what they do to achieve said specialness?
