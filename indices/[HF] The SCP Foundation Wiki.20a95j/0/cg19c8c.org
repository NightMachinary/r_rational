  fubarobfusco: Folks should be cautioned that SCP entries may be more upsetting or triggering than typical horror-sf.

  There's a lot of body horror, some disturbing images (although they tend to avoid animated "shockers"), plenty of violence, occasional mindfuckery, and at least one pretty damn disturbing implied rape/torture scenario.
