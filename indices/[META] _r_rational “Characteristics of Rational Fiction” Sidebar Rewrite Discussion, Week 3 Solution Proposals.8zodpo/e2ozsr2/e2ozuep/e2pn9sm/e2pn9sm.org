I like this definition, but I think

#+begin_quote
  May be too long and wordy
#+end_quote

is definitely a problem. I think a few lines of text can be cut without losing too much of the intended message:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction is fiction which [cut] strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by explicitly showing that events are realistic given the setting [cut], rather than like standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently).
#+end_quote

The first cut specifies the somewhat nonstandard way we use the word rationality here. While this can be helpful, I think it clogs up the definition. I would include it separately or provide a link. The second cut is just redundant text.

#+begin_quote
  Displaying both competence and consistency in this respect is a sufficient condition for a work to be rational. Works which strongly possess one of these qualities, or which explore themes of rationality in other ways, may qualify as rational fiction, if the heart of the payoff is in the right place.
#+end_quote

I would cut this entire section. The idea does add to the definition, but I don't think it's worth the word count. If you really foresee problems with people arguing that a setting with competent characters, but no consistent world can never be rational I would change the line: /"Rational works almost always possess the following attributes:"/ to something like /"Rational works posses at least one, but preferably both, of the following attributes:"/

#+begin_quote
  Rational-adjacent fiction is fiction that acknowledges the ideals and tropes of rational fiction, but bends them for its own purposes.
#+end_quote

This line can also be cut. The term rational-adjacent is a useful one, but whenever it's used the meaning is probably self evident from context and if not it can be clarified in a sentence or two when someone asks.
