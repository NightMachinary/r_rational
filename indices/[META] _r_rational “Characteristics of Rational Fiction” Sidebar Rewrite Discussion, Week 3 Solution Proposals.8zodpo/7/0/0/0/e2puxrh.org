Thanks for the critiques! I've made some of the cuts you have suggested, and I also moved the rest of the trope bullet points to the wiki page section.

#+begin_quote
  The first cut specifies the somewhat nonstandard way we use the word rationality here. While this can be helpful, I think it clogs up the definition.
#+end_quote

I think it's a key part of this particular definition. Without it, my entry is very similar to several others. I want to convey the specific intent of rational fiction in terms of the ideals that it explores using competent characters and consistent settings.

Even with the cuts, this may still be too long for a sidebar. Hopefully the first paragraph conveys 90% of the message.
