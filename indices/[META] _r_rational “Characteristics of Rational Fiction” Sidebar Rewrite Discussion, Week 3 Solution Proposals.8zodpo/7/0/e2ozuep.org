** Strengths of this definition
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: strengths-of-this-definition
   :END:

- Directly addresses the word "rational" in "rational fiction"

- Primarily characterizes rational fiction by its ideals rather than by the specific content of stories

- Conveys the extra rigor and conviction of rational fiction in contrast to other fiction while remaining flexible as to which stories may qualify

- Supplementary bullet points show negative examples as well as positive, allowing readers to form a better classifier in their heads

** Weaknesses

- May be too long and wordy [Has since been edited to be a bit less so]

- The final write-up should also include positive and negative examples of works satisfying each major item in the definition, and an explanation of why each work does or doesn't fit the item. Examples should preferably be close to the decision boundary to give finer intuition.

This definition draws on ideas in the previous thread from [[/u/derefr]], [[/u/causalchain]], [[/u/1337_w0n]], [[/u/Noumero]], [[/u/haiku_fornification]], [[/u/0Gitaxian0]], and also shamelessly appropriates ideas from other people's supplementary bullet points.
