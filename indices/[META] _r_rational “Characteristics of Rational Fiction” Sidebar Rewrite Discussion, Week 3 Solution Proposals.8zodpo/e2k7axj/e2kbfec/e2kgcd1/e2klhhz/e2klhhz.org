The rewording is better, yes.

  However, I do think rational fiction is just fiction-which-must-be-good-in-certain-ways, not really a "genre"
#+end_quote

I think of it more as a nebulous genre whose defining features correlate strongly with some good writing advice.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, all perfectly-good fiction would be rational
#+end_quote

I disagree. Different genres aspire to different things. For example, a perfectly good comedy is not likely to be rational in any sense.

#+begin_quote
  It could qualify as rational fiction, however, since the ship is a creation of alien background characters
#+end_quote

This seems like a huge stretch of your definition.

#+begin_quote
  There's two types of debatably-rational works which my definition excludes... I don't think it's a major problem
#+end_quote

It's not a /major/ problem, at least right now, but personally I would allow room in the definition for other kinds of works. I think it's up to the community to vote on this. (I will post my own write-up eventually).
