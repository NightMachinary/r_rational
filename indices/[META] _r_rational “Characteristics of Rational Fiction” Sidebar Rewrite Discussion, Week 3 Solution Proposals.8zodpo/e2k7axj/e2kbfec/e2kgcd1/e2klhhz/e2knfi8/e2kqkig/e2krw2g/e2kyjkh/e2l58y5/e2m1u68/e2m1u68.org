I agreed that it's hard to think of rational fiction that isn't also in another genre. I think it might be possible to write some, but the result may not be very enjoyable to read.

  So, you think that change solved the issue with Rama's background aliens?

    Whether they're protagonists or background people, character agency is put above all other aspects of the narrative.

Not really, to be honest. "Background people" is an awkward phrase, and it just makes me think of minor human characters in the background. The aliens in Rendesvous with Rama are not properly characters (if I remember correctly; it's been a while since I read it). They are in the background, yes, but my mind still doesn't automatically group them in with the rewording. I think what you had before that second rewording was better. You can add the "background characters" concept to a second submission, like ketura said.
