One pretty time-consuming idea is to vote on necessary elements first, then craft a definition to fit.

To elaborate, we have different "pieces" of the definition, which many people agree should be included into the final definition, whatever it will be. E. g., framing it as "what the work /does/, not what it /is/", my "tropes", "definition + bullet points" construction, and so on.
