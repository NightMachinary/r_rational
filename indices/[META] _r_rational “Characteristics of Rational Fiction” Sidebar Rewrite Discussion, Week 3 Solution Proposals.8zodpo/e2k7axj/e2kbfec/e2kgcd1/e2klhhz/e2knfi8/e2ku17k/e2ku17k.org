  So, a perfectly-good comedy could have inconsistent characterization?

That sounds like a non-sequitur. You don't treat "consistent characterization" as your sole defining characteristic of rational fiction, so why do you think that when someone talks about a non-rational story, they mean one with inconsistent characterization?

What would a 'rational' version of a surreal comedy like 'Airplane!' look like? Or of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? Do you think those would be improved by making them fit more into the rational genre?
