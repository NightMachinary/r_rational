  You don't treat "consistent characterization" as your sole defining characteristic of rational fiction, so why do you think that when someone talks about a non-rational story, they mean one with inconsistent characterization?

Well, the statement I was responding to said that a good comedy is "not likely to be rational in /any/ sense". I just picked a rationality-adjacent quality at random and considered whether a good comedy could lack it. At which point I realized that yes, it could, and conceded the point about all perfectly-good fiction being rational.

I may not have made that clear in the actual post, I suppose.
