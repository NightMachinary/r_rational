  I can just imagine writers unfamiliar with the rationalist community seeing this definition and saying to themselves, "Well, yes, I should hope that my characters are thoughtful and goal-driven! That's just good writing advice."

  "Always" and "never" are strong words... I'm sure exceptions could be cooked up easily.

Good points. Reworded that section. Better now?

(However, I /do/ think rational fiction is just fiction-which-must-be-good-in-certain-ways, not really a "genre". Yes, all perfectly-good fiction would be rational. It doesn't mean that /all/ commonly-accepted good fiction is rational, or that all rational fiction is good. It means rational fiction is always good in one particular way.)

  This definition also makes rational characters a core feature of the genre, excluding works that might explore consistent worlds in other ways besides having such characters

Well, sort of. As a possible counter-example, consider Arthur Clark's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama][/Rendezvous with Rama/]]. It's about a crew of astronauts exploring an alien starship. It doesn't, as far as I remember, focus on their thinking process and reasoning; however, the starship is explored in-depth. It could qualify as rational fiction, however, since the ship is a creation of alien background characters. If their engineering decisions were sensible â†’ the worldbuilding is consistent, then that part of the work is rational.

There's two types of debatably-rational works which my definition excludes: about irrational characters living in a natural, consistently-written world, and textbooks about fictional natural worlds with no characters at all. I don't think it's a major problem, but my mind could be changed.
