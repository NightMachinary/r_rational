I like the listing of bullet points and tropes after the main definition. This helps clarify the definition, and I think it should be part of whichever solution is chosen. However, I think the main definition is still too general here.

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction is written with intent to explore thoughtful, goal-driven behaviour of people in reaction to their world
#+end_quote

I can just imagine writers unfamiliar with the rationalist community seeing this definition and saying to themselves, "Well, yes, I should hope that my characters are thoughtful and goal-driven! That's just good writing advice." I'm not sure that this definition alone adequately conveys the idea that rationalist fiction specifically goes beyond other kinds of fiction in its focus on this aspect of the story.

#+begin_quote
  Rational characters always strive .... their decision-making is never warped ....
#+end_quote

"Always" and "never" are strong words... I'm sure exceptions could be cooked up easily.

This definition also makes rational characters a core feature of the genre, excluding works that might explore consistent worlds in other ways besides having such characters. That's not /necessarily/ bad; the community needs to decide whether it wants rational characters to be a necessary condition for the genre, or just a common sufficient condition.
