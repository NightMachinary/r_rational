  The first paragraph feels clumsy to me. Can it be made more concise or reworded?

Yes, I know. It's because I revised it several times based on my discussion with [[/u/LieGroupE8][u/LieGroupE8]].

Attempted to optimise it. Is that better?:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction is written with intent to explore thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as its consequences on the fictional world or the story's plot. In rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes and all other aspects of the narrative.

Should take care of your second point as well. I'm still not entirely satisfied with it.
