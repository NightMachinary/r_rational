Nice summary! I think those bullet points cover it. However, your explanation above is far too complex and far too long. Nobody will read it. I would leave out the entire explanation and just keep the bullet points.

([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JcpzFpPBSmzuksmWM/the-5-second-level][This is a super common problem with smart people who try to explain things:]] They always talk in the abstract rather than allowing newcomers to infer the meta-level logic from the object-level rules themselves. This is especially weird given that said smart people almost always learned the rules themselves using the latter method.)

You could also probably leave out bullet point 4, since it's mostly covered by the other points. That leaves us with this:

--------------

A rationalist story commonly has the following elements.:

- Careful Worldbuilding: The "rules" a setting runs on remain consistent, and their consequences are taken seriously. In pre-existing settings (e.g. fanfiction), the author may seek to remove or justify incongruities, or to explore their implications.
- Fair-Play Whodunnit: A story's mysteries or problems could, in theory, be solved by attentive readers ahead of time, and the reader should be able to see at least in retrospect how the characters came up with their ideas.
- Munchkinry: Characters strive to exploit their world's rules and solve their problems by leveraging their available resources in creative ways.
- Aspiring Rationalism: The story focuses on revealing characters' thinking, motives, decision-making, and/or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is often a particular feature of the rationalist fiction subgenre of rational fiction, particularly if the reader is meant to be able to take practical lessons from the work.
