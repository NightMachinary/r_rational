That's not wrong rethorically, but I think our shared public-facing definition needs to be held to a higher standard than that. Referring to a concept that's pseudoscientific - or at least oversimplified to the point where it carries similar connotations - might be taken seriously by a portion of readers, which doesn't look good for us.
