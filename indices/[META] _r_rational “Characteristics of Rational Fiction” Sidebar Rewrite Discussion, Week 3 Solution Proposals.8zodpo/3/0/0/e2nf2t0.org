#+begin_quote
  Any work that someone would call rational fiction, this definition applies to
#+end_quote

That doesn't necessarily make it a good definition -- it could be too general. In my view, it applies to too much fiction, not all of which will be liked by [[/r/rational]]. It seems more like a property of good writing, which is the problem with the current definition. I can't think of a fic I've read that this definition /doesn't/ apply to.
