  Any definition more specific than that would exclude a lot of works that a lot of people agree are examples of rational fiction

For example? What kinds of works would they exclude?

#+begin_quote
  name me ONE well-written example of something that fits the above definition which this community wouldn't like or wouldn't consider rational fic
#+end_quote

I'll name an entire swathe of literature: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/588dwl/d_literary_fiction_cant_be_this_depressing/][Literary fiction.]] It's set in our world, so you know it's consistent, and it has realistic characters, they're just boring and/or deplorable and/or reactive.

  #+begin_quote
    competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques
  #+end_quote

  is merely a consequence of depicting intelligence and sanity realistically. Depictions of intelligence and sanity having to be realistic is implied by my definition, and saying that my definition doesn't select for them *at all* is simply untrue.
#+end_quote

Realistic depiction of intelligence and rationality do not imply that main characters must be intelligent or rational. They could be realistically portrayed fools, and it would fit.

In-depth exploration of the world and "solvability" of the story have nothing to do with psychosocial internal consistency. They're properties of the /narrative/, of the way authors choose to tell their story, not properties of the fictional world.
