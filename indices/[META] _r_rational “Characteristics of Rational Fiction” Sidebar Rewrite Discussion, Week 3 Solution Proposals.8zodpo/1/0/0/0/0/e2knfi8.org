  a perfectly good comedy is not likely to be rational in any sense
#+end_quote

So, a perfectly-good comedy could have inconsistent characterization?.. Hm, alright, granted. There's no objective standard for "good fiction", let alone "perfectly good fiction". My point was that all short summaries of what rational fiction is /would/ sound like good writing advice, because rational fiction is built around treating certain pieces of good writing advice as core concepts.

  This seems like a huge stretch of your definition.

I don't think so. Brief digression: In practice, when reading rational fiction discussions, I frequently saw questions along the lines of "Why didn't character X do Y?", "Why didn't population F take over the world, if they could A, B, and C?", or "Why was M set up this way?". A Perfectly Rational Story, according to the intent behind my definition, would be such that answers to all of these questions about it exist and are followable. Questions about aliens' engineering decisions definitely fall under this as well.

However, what's important is that it /does/ seem like a stretch to you. It's not supposed to; the aforementioned idea should be made clear. Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve this?

  I think of it more as a nebulous genre whose defining features correlate strongly with some good writing advice.

That's an interesting point, actually. I found [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e2h3ntn/][this comment]] by [[/u/Silver_Swift][u/Silver_Swift]] particularly insightful:

  I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own. You can write rational fiction in just about every genre you feel like, but you can't write just rational fiction. Rational Fantasy and Rational Sci-Fi are the most common combinations and I can easily imagine rational westerns, rational animes, rational horror, rational mysteries and even rational romance stories, but I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.
