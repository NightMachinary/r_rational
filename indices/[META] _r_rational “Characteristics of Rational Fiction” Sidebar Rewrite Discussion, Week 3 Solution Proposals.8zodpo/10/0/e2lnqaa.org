I've deliberately avoided using words like “intelligent” or “consistent” so that an individual's perception of those values doesn't influence whether a work is rational. (Of course those can still be used to argue a work is /bad/ rational fiction.)

To give some examples:

Worm fulfills the first criteria with most powers and how powers function having clearly defined rules, but understanding those rules isn't important to anyone's arc. It's adjacent to, but not, rational fiction.

Worth the Candle hasn't a clear set of rules and understanding them is part of the main character's arc. It is rational fiction.

HPMOR has multiple clear sets of rules, understanding them plays into characters' arcs, and rationality is the core theme of the entire story. It is rationalist fiction.
