I think it runs into the very same problem that our current definition has, namely that it's too general. "Self-consistent world" just seems like a property of good fiction, and I don't think modifying it to mean "self-consistent psychosocial aspect of the world" restricts it sufficiently well. Using this definition, it would be quite hard to distinguish sufficiently well-written non-rational fiction from sufficiently well-written rational fiction.

Additionally, even if it's a sound definition of "rational fiction" in abstract, it doesn't capture our interests as a community. For example, we enjoy competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques, but this definition doesn't select for them at all.

I think it's /too/ simple.
