I disagree. Any definition more specific than that would exclude a lot of works that a lot of people agree are examples of rational fiction. Also, judging by how much people here liked Unsong and Worm, I don't think that the community agrees with you about it not cappturing their interests. Case in point, name me ONE well-written example of something that fits the above definition which this community wouldn't like or wouldn't consider rational fic.Also, this:

> competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques

is merely a consequence of depicting intelligence and sanity realistically. Depictions of intelligence and sanity having to be realistic is implied by my definition, and saying that my definition doesn't select for them *at all* is simply untrue.\\
Also there are plenty of well-written works that aren't rational fiction which don't fit this definition, such as Homestuck.
