When reading HPMOR, HJPEV is in the story itself acknowledged as not a normal 11-year old -- this is /eventually/ explained, but until it was so explained, would you have denied HPMOR's membership in the rational genre?

This definition feels to me to be missing the qualities that most of us are seeking in stories of this type. Consider "The Promised Neverland". Are the kids there acting 'realistically'? Frankly I have no way of knowing. If I had to guess, I'd guess not.

To the extent that that story is posted here is not because the kids are realistic, but because they're intelligent and go out of their way to prepare in order to overcome their challenges, and the story appreciates intelligence and preparation: e.g it "The Promised Neverland" goes to the trouble of showing in a montagee page of the kids training to slide using tied-up sheets, seeing that the knots were causing a problem in the sliding, then figuring out a solution (sewing the sheet together rather than tying them).
