Commentary:

No need to invent overly complicated lists of criteria. All rational fiction has one common denominator, one characteristic that every single work that has ever been referred to as rational fiction has: Psychological and social realism given the rules of the setting. In other words, characters think and act the way they would think and act if they and the world they reside in actually existed.

Notice this is not the same thing as being 100% realistic. You can have as many fantastical elements as you like as long as individual characters, organizations and societies think and act in ways that are plausible given the setting. For instance, in HPMOR, Harry's magical dark side isn't psychologically realistic in a real life setting, but it is psychologically realistic in a world where HPMOR-style level-1 horcruxes exist.

Any work that someone would call rational fiction, this definition applies to. Even Unsong falls under this definition (How would people and society really think and act if Hebrew scripture was actually true). Same thing with Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (how would individuals and societies in the Harry Potter universe really think and act in response to a first contact scenario with an alien "human" from a Universe that runs on rules as written Dungeons and Dragons).

Notice that psychological realism also applies to intelligent characters, so intelligence would have to be portrayed realistically.

I am quite confident in this definition. It is the only definition that includes every work that has ever been referred to as rational fiction, and if everyone votes for something else, then everyone else is wrong.
