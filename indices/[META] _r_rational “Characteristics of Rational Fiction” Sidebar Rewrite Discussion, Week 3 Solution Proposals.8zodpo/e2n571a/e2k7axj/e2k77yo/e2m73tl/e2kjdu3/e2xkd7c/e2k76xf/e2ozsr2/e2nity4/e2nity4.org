I said having Level 2 Intelligent (main) Characters was enough, [[/u/Noumero]] said "widespread employment" of Level 1 Intelligent Characters was enough. I think I've figured out a way to turn that into a functional solution.

*Characteristics of Rational Fiction:*

- All characters are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent]] or higher, meaning their thought-processes and behavioral patterns are consistent and realistic (i.e., they act and react /rationally/ - as if they were actual persons with agency - rather than simply acting to facilitate the plot).

  - If this were the only criterion, well-written works from every genre would qualify as rational fiction. Therefore, a work must also have a non world-building related rationalist-adjacent trope as its main thematic focus in order to qualify as rational fiction.

*Characteristics of Rationalist Fiction:*

- The main viewpoint character is [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Level 3 Intelligent]].

- The thought-processes of the main viewpoint character are written in such a way that readers can absorb some of the character's techniques of good thinking (aka "Rationality").

  - This is the defining trait of rationalist fiction; showcasing a character's intelligence and thoughts and actions isn't the goal, it's a tool in service of the goal - to subtly teach the reader how to think and act more intelligently.

- The antagonist and most of the main supporting cast are often [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][Level 2 Intelligent]] or higher.

- All characters are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent]] or higher.

*Rationalist-Adjacent Tropes:*

- Achieving goals and resolving conflicts by applying techniques of good thinking (aka "Rationality")

- Self-awarness / genre-savviness

- Opposing positions pass the Ideological Turing Test

- Realistic villains who see themselves as the hero of their own story

- Consistent world-building

- Munchkinism

- Deconstruction

- Transhumanism

- Real-world application of the scientific method

- Grey and gray morality

- Blue and orange morality

Works not meeting the standard of either rational or rationalist fiction but which have extensive focus on two or more rationalist-adjacent tropes are classified as "rational-adjacent."
