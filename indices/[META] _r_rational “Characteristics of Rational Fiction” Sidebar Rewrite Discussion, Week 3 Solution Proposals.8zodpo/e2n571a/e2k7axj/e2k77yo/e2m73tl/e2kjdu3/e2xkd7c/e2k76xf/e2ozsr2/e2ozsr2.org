*Rational fiction* is fiction which specifically emphasizes themes related to *rationality*, where "rationality" loosely refers to a set of ideals such as reason, science, thoughtfulness, learning, excellence, self-improvement, goal-directed behavior, optimal strategy, understanding how things work, and similar ideas. A defining feature of rational fiction is that it strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by proceeding /realistically/ given the setting, rather than according to standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently). Rational works should possess at least one, and preferably both, of the following attributes:

*Competent* characters: Characters possess at least [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 intelligence]]; that is, they act as intelligent agents optimizing to the best of their ability towards their goals. Characters do not ignore obvious opportunities and weaknesses for the sake of the plot.

*Consistent* settings: Settings obey rigorously applied rules. Every aspect of the plot and setting is a plausible consequence of the underlying rules and the initial setup, and conversely, logical consequences of the rules are not ignored for the sake of the plot.

These qualities apply to many works of fiction to some degree, but rational fiction respects them with an extra /thoroughness/. Other genres may relax the rules in order to establish a certain payoff: action that sacrifices physics for fun, thrillers that ignore probability for the sake of twists, literary fiction whose oddities are designed to be metaphorical rather than literal. In rational fiction, competence, consistency, and rationality are /themselves/ part of the payoff, and are not sacrificed for other considerations.

*Rationalist* fiction is a subgenre of rational fiction in which reasoning techniques are shown in a way that is realistic and /emulatable/ by the reader. Such works explicitly demonstrate techniques from science, logic, probability, game theory, decision theory, or other fields. The story is often structured like a puzzle that the reader can solve by applying such techniques.

Rational fiction has developed a set of common tropes which convey its aesthetics and ideals, including Munchkinry, Genre-savviness, Deconstruction, Worldbuilding, and others.

Although not strictly necessary, works are likely to qualify as rational fiction if they contain some of the following:

- Intelligent characters: characters are demonstrably intelligent by /real-world/ standards

- Curious characters: characters are curious about their world, and make every effort to resolve their curiosity

- Genre-savviness: characters are familiar with standard literary tropes and can subvert them

- Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit the rules of their world in any way possible

- Deconstruction: tropes, magic systems, technologies, societies, and other things are reverse-engineered to see what makes them tick

- Worldbuilding: settings are crafted in meticulous detail, and non-obvious consequences are considered

- Solvability: Twists and problem solutions are theoretically predictable in advance by the reader with clever enough reasoning

- Transhumanism: Themes of immortality, self-modification, and existential risk are addressed in depth

Features commonly seen in stories exhibiting *competence* as applies to rational fiction:

- The thought processes of characters are described in detail, and these thought processes can be emulated by the reader

- Characters have a strong respect for knowledge and intellect

- Characters use every available technique to improve themselves

- Characters drive the plot, and often try to "munchkin" or exploit their setting to accomplish their goals, or just for fun

- Characters are curious about why things are the way they are, and try to discover the specific principles behind phenemona

- Characters are well-read and familiar with standard literary tropes

Features common in stories that do *NOT* exhibit competence:

- Character thought processes are not shown, or are shown very little

- The writing informs us that a character is intelligent without showing it

- Intelligent characters make deductions like Sherlock Holmes (that is, their deductions are implausible and unlikely to work in real life)

- Intelligent characters talk like Spock (that is, they think that being smart means ignoring emotions, using the word "logical" a lot, and giving way too many digits of significance in their calculations)

- Characters do not have much causal agency in the plot; they are just along for the ride

- Character actions are primarily driven by their emotions, without reflection on whether the actions are intelligent

- Characters are not curious about their world and do not make an effort to understand phenomena

Features commonly seen in stories exhibiting *consistency* as applies to rational fiction:

- The setting is based on precise, coherent, and discoverable rules, and all events in the story conform to these rules

- The plot proceeds like a simulation of what might actually happen given the established rules; real science is imported as much as possible

- Secrets and plot twists are hinted at beforehand, usually in a way that allows the reader to potentially think of them in advance

- Phenomena seen in the story have precise mechanisms which are explained in detail

- Phenomena, objects, characters, and actions are all entangled together and bound by the rules of the story and their logical consequences

- If there is any obvious technology or strategy that the background civilization is failing to exploit, a plausible explanation is provided as to why

Features common in stories *NOT* exhibiting consistency:

- Little or no effort is made to demonstrate the ground rules of the setting

- Little or no effort is made to show how and why events happen or how things work

- Characters encounter many new technologies, wonders, phenomena, etc. that have no relation to anything that comes before or afterward in the story

- There are implausible coincidences and Deus-Ex-Machinas

- The writing provides explanations for things that happen, but these explanations are vague, implausible, or full of buzzwords with no moving parts

- Characters consistently succeed at things despite having plans that are too complicated or kung-fu skills that are implausibly effective; the success of plans or fights is primarily plot-driven rather than a realistic consequence of the setting.

Features commonly seen in *rationalist* stories:

- Characters have a deep desire to think and act optimally in all things, and this desire for absolute excellence factors strongly into their character arcs

- The plot is fundamentally about reasoning, science, optimization, discovery, decision theory, etc., and is driven by them

- Competence and Consistency pervade the story fractally, apparent throughout at every level of narrative

- The story has core themes relating to transhumanism, immortality, ethics, Good vs. Good conflicts

Features common in stories *non-rationalist* stories:

- Reasoning techniques are not shown explicitly, or are not emulatable by the reader

- The plot can't be predicted in advance by the reader, even in principle

- Lack of strong plot focus on themes of reasoning, science, optimization, excellence, etc.

- Lack of strong plot focus on humanist or transhumanist philosophy

- Antagonists who are viciously or comically evil without any explanation
