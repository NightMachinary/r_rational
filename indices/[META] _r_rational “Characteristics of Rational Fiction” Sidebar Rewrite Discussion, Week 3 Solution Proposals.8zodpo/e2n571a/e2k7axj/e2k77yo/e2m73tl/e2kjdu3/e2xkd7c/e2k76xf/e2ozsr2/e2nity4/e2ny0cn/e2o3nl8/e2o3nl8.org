  Imagine a person stumbling upon [[/r/rational]]. They now have to read a Tumblr post by Yudkowsky and comprehend a new concept in order to understand which content is appropriate here. I don't think that's desirable.
#+end_quote

I don't see why it wouldn't be desirable. Not every concept can be distilled into a single word or short phrase which is immediately comprehensible. Sometimes accuracy is better than brevity. And you don't want to set the bar for entry too low, people should know what they're getting into if they happen to stumble upon this sub. "Reading" and "comprehending new concepts" are kinda supposed to come with the territory here, right?

  Why include the other points [if you're going to claim that one of the points is the "defining trait"]?
#+end_quote

I personally have many characteristics. I have brown hair. I'm not dumb, sometimes. I have four cats. I do a better-than-average job of typing lots of words in a short amount of time. I wear glasses. I'm generally ridiculous. I have a blood type, probably. But I'd say my "defining trait" is that I'm generally ridiculous. I wouldn't be "me" if I didn't have four cats or wear glasses (I'm being factious, please mentally substitute characteristics that a reasonable person would present in support of the argument I'm making), but the thing that people recognize immediately as "me" is the "generally ridiculous" part.

  Why not include level-n intelligence under the list of related tropes?
#+end_quote

1) Because it wouldn't be "rationalist" or "rational" if it didn't have level-n intelligence, but the thing that people recognize immediately as "rationalist" or "rational" is the "showcasing rational thought" part.

2) I think "rationalist fiction" could theoretically be written with a thematic focus entirely unrelated to any of the typical "rationalist-adjacent tropes" and still be recognizable as distinctly "rationalist fiction" if it's written right.

EDIT:

3) I really don't think you can showcase/"teach" Level 3 Intelligent thought-processes ("good thinking" or "rationality") if your main viewpoint character isn't Level 3 Intelligent.
