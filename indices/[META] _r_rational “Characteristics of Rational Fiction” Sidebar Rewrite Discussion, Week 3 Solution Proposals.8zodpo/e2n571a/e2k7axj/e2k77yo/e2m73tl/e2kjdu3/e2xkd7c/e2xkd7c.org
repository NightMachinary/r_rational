*Rationalist Fiction* attempts to make the reader more rational. Here, "more rational" means more like a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent][rational agent]]", a being that acts to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem][/maximize/ a coherent set of /preferences/]] according to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference][/logically/ consistent, /empirically/ sound, /parsimonious/ worldview]].

Generally, rational fiction encourages us to try to come up with logical explanations for things, and to seek evidence for our beliefs, encouraging the reader towards a scientific, reductionist worldview. It also encourages us to view "simpler" hypotheses about the universe as more plausible - with a notion of "simplicity" that loosely alludes to more mathematically rigorous notions of simplicity in that it not include things that are merely "simple" for humans to think about, such as magical and supernatural explanations.

Additionally, it encourages us to build more coherent frameworks concerning our preferences, values, and what we want for the universe. Humanist and transhumanist frameworks are common, and the rejection of death and the notion that acceptance of death as good and natural represents a cognitive bias is a staple of this genre.

Finally, it encourages us to be more effective in pursuit of those goals. Explicit discussion of cognitive biases and techniques for identifying and reducing them are discussed, as well as useful heuristics for improving practical behavior.

*Rational fiction* generally invokes the same worldview as described above, but does not necessarily attempt to teach the reader in as explicit a manner. The criteria for rational fiction are loose and there is no single necessary nor sufficient criteria.

-the use of "common sense" to subvert common narrative tropes is a frequent theme, especially in fanfiction where the original characters did not do so. Sometimes, one character is at an advantage over other characters because they alone are able to use this common sense. Other times, all characters make good use of common sense. This can lead to the characters behaving very differently from what readers generally expect from fictional characters in the genre.

-Often, characters seek instrumental knowledge or power, or exploits a unique situation that they find themselves in to pursue an ambitious goal. This sometimes involves humanist or transhumanist themes, or plays with consequentialist/utilitarian takes on morality.

-Particularly in magical fantasy settings, rational and rationalist fiction often gives the sense that someone, whether the author, the narrator, or a character, cares about attempting to come up with logically consistent explanations of the world as presented...even when the world seems to resist such logical explanations. For instance, if magic exists, the characters may note that this means that the universe seems to have special rules which respect human minds, and furthermore they may note that this strange and resists reductionist explanations.

-It's common for an interplay of conflict and cooperation to revolve around different characters which each have unique set of coherent goals that they are trying to maximize. Some characters may even have completely alien goals, orthogonal to any human values, which they nevertheless pursue rationally. Concepts from game theory are sometimes implicitly or explicitly invoked.

-Sometimes, none of the characters are especially rational, but it is clear that the underlying world has been constructed by the author with an eye to logical consistency and a careful thinking through of implications.

-Sometimes the story itself explores some tangentially relevant philosophical or practical question.

...and so on. Generally, "you know it when you see it" applies.
