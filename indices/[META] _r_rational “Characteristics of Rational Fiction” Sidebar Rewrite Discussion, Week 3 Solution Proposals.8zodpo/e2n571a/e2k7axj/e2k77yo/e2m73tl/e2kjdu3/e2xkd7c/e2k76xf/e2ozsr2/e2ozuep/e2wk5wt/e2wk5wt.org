In approximately 20 hours from the timestamp of this comment, I will be creating the voting thread using the content of your submission at that time. Please make sure that any last minute edits are completed well before then; submission entries will not be edited after the voting thread has been made.

Thank you for helping us make the subreddit better!

(in this particular case I'm going to only put the sidebar proposal and insert a link to this post for the wiki part. If you want to make a comment that has nothing but the wiki bit for me to link to instead, that will make your submission a bit tighter.)
