I guess I can't grok â€˜respecting intelligence' being more important, in some explicit way, than taking the world and characters seriously, since it's entailed by the latter. If an author really thinks through how the world should look and how characters should act, the story will emerge in a way that respects competence, deliberation etc. because characters who leverage them will be more successful.
