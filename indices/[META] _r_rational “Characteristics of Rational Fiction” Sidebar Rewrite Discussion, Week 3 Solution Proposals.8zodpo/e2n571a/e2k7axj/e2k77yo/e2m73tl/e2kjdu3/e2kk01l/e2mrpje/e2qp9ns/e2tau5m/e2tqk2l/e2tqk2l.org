  If an author really thinks through how the world should look and how characters should act, the story will emerge in a way that respects competence, deliberation etc. because characters who leverage them will be more successful.

I feel that's like saying "If everyone thought things through, they would be an atheist" and then using that argument to define atheism as someone who "thinks things through".

That may indeed be a consequence of thinking things through, but it doesn't get to the central point that should be the definition of the word.

Game of Thrones does think things through, and we can see success and respect for intelligence when a thinker like Tyrion is involved. Littlefinger and Varys also tend to be competent and successful.

Would you characterize 'Game of Thrones' as rational fiction though? It doesn't feel as if the primary element displayed when taking the work as a whole (rather than just the Tyrion chapters) would be a respect for intelligence and preparation.

Or taking one of my own stories - in "Names and Forms" ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3114287]]), written almost 20 years ago, I did a retelling of the Minos & Pasiphae story, except set in the Gargoyles universe. If there's a rationalist character anywhere there, it's probably the only-appearing-in-two-brief-scenes tertiary character of Daedalus.

I wouldn't call the story part of the 'rational genre' at all, and not just because it has some badly written implausible elements (though it does), but rather because the value of intelligence, planning, preparation wasn't really anywhere displayed or more importantly nor was it /intended/ to be displayed in the story. Neither Minos nor Pasiphae nor most other secondary characters, are very good thinkers, /nor do they have to be/ for the purposes of the story.

Nor did I bother making them fail because of lack of intelligence. Minos wins against a somewhat better thinker - and then loses against worse thinkers, both cases because of, well... divine power, so to speak, which is perfectly plausible within the setting of the story, since he /is/ the offspring of a god, and gods meddle all the time -- but nonetheless the whole storyline fails to display the respect for intelligence I'd seek in the rational genre.
