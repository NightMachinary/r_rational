  I feel that's like saying "If everyone thought things through, they would be an atheist" and then using that argument to define atheism as someone who "thinks things through".

  That may indeed be a consequence of thinking things through, but it doesn't get to the central point that should be the definition of the word.

Hm, okay, I think I grasp a little better what you're shooting for. Thinking through the premises of a setting and its characters will have lots of consequences, and some of them are disproportionately important from the POV of asking 'what matters in rational fiction'; of those, 'demonstrating respect for intelligence' is one of the big ones. Does that feel roughly correct to you?

  Would you characterize 'Game of Thrones' as rational fiction though? It doesn't feel as if the primary element displayed when taking the work as a whole (rather than just the Tyrion chapters) would be a respect for intelligence and preparation.

I'd characterize it as /more rational/ than a lot of other fiction, which is a useful distinction that is enabled by talking about rationality as a spectrum rather than a binary.
