In regards to rational*/ist/* fiction, I don't think we need three additional bullets. I think the explicit inclusion of teachable rationalist techniques suffices -- because that's the criterion used when EY pretty much defined the genre back in [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q79vYjHAE9KHcAjSs/rationalist-fiction]] with the example of "The World of Null-A" by A.E. Van Vogt.
