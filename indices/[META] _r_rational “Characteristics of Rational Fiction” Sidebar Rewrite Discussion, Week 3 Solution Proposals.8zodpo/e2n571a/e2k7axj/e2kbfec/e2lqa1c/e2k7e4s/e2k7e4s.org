I think wording needs some work, especially with regards to descriptions of tropes. I aim for conciseness and understandability. Also, need a link for munchkinry.

[[/u/haiku_fornification][u/haiku_fornification]], I liked [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e254z4e/][your point]] and attempted to incorporate it into my definition. Feedback?

[[/u/ArisKatsaris][u/ArisKatsaris]], [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e299xvf/][your point]] is somewhat similar to [[/u/haiku_fornification][u/haiku_fornification]]'s. Suggestions how to better reflect it?

[[/u/causalchain][u/causalchain]], reworking of the definition in response to two points above allowed me to include [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e270c9k/][your point]] on a more high level. Thoughts?

[[/u/1337_w0n][u/1337_w0n]], I liked [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e26dscc/][your approach]], but I'm not sure how best to combine it with my definition. I'm sure it could be done. Help?
