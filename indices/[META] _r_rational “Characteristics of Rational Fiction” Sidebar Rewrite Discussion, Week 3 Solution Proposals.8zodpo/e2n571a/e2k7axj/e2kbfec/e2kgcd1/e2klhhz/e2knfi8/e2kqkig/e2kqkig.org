  So, a perfectly-good comedy could have inconsistent characterization?

What I meant was that it would have irrational / non-agenty characters and weird, improbable plots.

  what's important is that it does seem like a stretch to you
#+end_quote

It seems like a stretch to me because your definition says that a rational work should focus on thoughtful characters with agency. I don't automatically consider the aliens in Rendezvous with Rama to be "characters"; they are part of the setting, at least the way my brain parses these categories. That's why I would suggest having some mention of consistent settings in the definition.

    I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.

Hmmm, I suppose I do too. "Rational" is a genre-modifier like italics are a text-modifier.
