#+begin_quote
  It seems like a stretch to me because your definition says that a rational work should focus on thoughtful characters with agency
#+end_quote

Reworded again, explicitly stated that it applies to protagonists as well as background people.

Downside: I think it's getting a bit convoluted up there. Three sentences, four references to "characters" or "people". I'll need to simplify it somehow.

  Hmmm, I suppose I do too. "Rational" is a genre-modifier like italics are a text-modifier.
#+end_quote

Well. Great.

I'll write up a second proposal based on that sometime this week, it seems different enough that changing my own wouldn't be a good idea. [[/u/ketura][u/ketura]], can I do that?
