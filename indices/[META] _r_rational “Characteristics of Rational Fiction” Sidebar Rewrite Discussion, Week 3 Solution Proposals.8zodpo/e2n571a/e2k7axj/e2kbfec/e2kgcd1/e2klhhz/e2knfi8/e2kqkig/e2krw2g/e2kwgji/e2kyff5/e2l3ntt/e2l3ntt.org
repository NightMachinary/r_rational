Such a thing isn't impossible but definitely stands as a time and effort sink (I haven't had to do terribly much for these discussions, and that would change my role from one of OP to actually needing to curate the content). My current plan (unless convinced otherwise) is to just let the kitchen sink vote run its course, and if there's multiple entries at the top end that are super close, then do a second round with just those entries.
