  irrational characters living in a natural, consistently-written world

I would tend to consider that as still counting as rational. HPMOR of course uses Rational!Harry as its main plot device to expose all the tropey-ness of the canon, but in any work that's not fanfiction, I don't see why such a character would be strictly needed. It'd be pretty boring if all rational fiction was "a hyperintelligent hyperrational protagonist and everyone dances to their tune" - however fun it is the first few times. For example, I was reading /Fargo/, a PMMM fanfiction which I think is classified as rational (read about it here) and none of its characters is especially rational. They're what Eliezer calls first level intelligent: they make decisions that make sense for them, and show the appearance of possessing a consistent self, but that self isn't necessarily rational.
