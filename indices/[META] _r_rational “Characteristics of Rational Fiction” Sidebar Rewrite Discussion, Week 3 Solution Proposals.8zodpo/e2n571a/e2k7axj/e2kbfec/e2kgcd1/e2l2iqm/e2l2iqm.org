  I can just imagine writers unfamiliar with the rationalist community seeing this definition and saying to themselves, "Well, yes, I should hope that my characters are thoughtful and goal-driven! That's just good writing advice."

I don't know; I think many characters are NOT thoughtful or goal-driven, and that it is often intentional. It's not uncommon to have a character who is impulsive, lazy, etc. while having that be what the author is going for.
