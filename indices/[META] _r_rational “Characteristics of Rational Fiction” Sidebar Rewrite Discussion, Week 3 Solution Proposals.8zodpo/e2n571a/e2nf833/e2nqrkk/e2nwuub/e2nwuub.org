It requires way too much working memory to process.

#+begin_quote
  A fictional work's level of â€˜rationality' describes the extent to which that work focuses on exploring what happens when consistently-modeled characters pursue their goals in settings whose premises, however fantastical, are rigorously and consistently applied.
#+end_quote

Here's a suggestion for a re-write:

#+begin_quote
  A fictional work's 'rationality' can be measured on a scale; fiction on the 'rational' end of this scale explores what happens when characters with consistent motivations pursue their goals in settings with consistent premises. These settings may or may not be fantastical in nature, as long as the underlying rules are internally consistent.
#+end_quote

I think it's (nearly) semantically equivalent while easier (for me) to understand.
