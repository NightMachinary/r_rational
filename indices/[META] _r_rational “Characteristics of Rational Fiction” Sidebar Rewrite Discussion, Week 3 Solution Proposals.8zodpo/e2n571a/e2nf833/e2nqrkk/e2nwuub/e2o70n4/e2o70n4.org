#+begin_quote
  A work of fictional â€˜rational' to the extent that it focuses on exploring what happens when characters with consistent motivations proactively pursue their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously and consistently applied. These settings may or may not be fantastical in nature, as long as the underlying rules and their implications are taken seriously. As a result, characters in rational fiction often follow courses of action which violate genre conventions and which frequently require deliberation, preparation, and the application of resources or knowledge in creative and clever ways.
