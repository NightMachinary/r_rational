Difficult. System-2 would be much better. Still, it is very technical and not very evocative. Usually, I would be inclined to call it 'rational', but obviously that does not work here. Just removing the class title breaks the aesthetic, we can do better. The word Intellectualism fits somewhat, but has negative connotations and is thus equally unsuitable. So, I do not have a good drop-in replacement handy.

Have you considered restructuring the line? I think something like 'Respecting Intelligence: The story acknowledges the value of advance planning, deductive reasoning and logical thinking.' would circumvent the problem.
