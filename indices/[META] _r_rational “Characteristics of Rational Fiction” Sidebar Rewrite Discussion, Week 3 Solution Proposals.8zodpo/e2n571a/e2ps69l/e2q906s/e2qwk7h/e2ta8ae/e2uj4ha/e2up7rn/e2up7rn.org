Not to worry - double-pinging me got the job done where your first reply alone likely wouldn't have.

"Respecting intelligence" is probably better, though not perfect. It /might/ sound pretentious to the average redditor, but I'm not qualified to judge whether that's a statistically significant problem.

One phrasing I did come to think of is "Enlightentment [values|ideals|spirit]". It is, as pointers-in-conceptspace go, somewhat inexact - the immediate connotations for The Enlightenment seem to be philosophical and social, while that-which-is-pointed-at by the paragraph feels more immediate and practical, much like referring to science when you were actually trying to describe engineering. Nevertheless, it is related, and harmless-sounding enough that I'm putting it up for consideration.
