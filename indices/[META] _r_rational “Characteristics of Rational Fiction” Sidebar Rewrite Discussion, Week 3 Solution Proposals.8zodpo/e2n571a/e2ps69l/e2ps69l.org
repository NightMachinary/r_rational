  Left-Brained Values: A respect for themes such as intelligence, reason, and forethought.
#+end_quote

I strongly dislike the use of 'Left-Brained' in this statement. It implies an overly simplistic model of the brain, which is scientifically inaccurate (see e.g. [[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071275][here]]) and thus unnecessarily detracts from the very point the definition is making.

Additionally, for some people (me, for example) it does not carry meaning by itself, as I would not have been able to tell you the difference between 'left-brained' and 'right-brained' values had you asked me an hour ago.
