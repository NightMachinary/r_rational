As another data point, I personally think that line adds nothing good to the overall strength of the definition. /Obviously/ the people who subscribe to a given subreddit are after the content posted to that subreddit; spelling this out is a bit redundant.

I would remove that paragraph and work the sentiment into the first. Something like adding a line like: "This focus on rigor is orthogonal to the quality of the work itself, but produces a unique and desirable flavor all its own."
