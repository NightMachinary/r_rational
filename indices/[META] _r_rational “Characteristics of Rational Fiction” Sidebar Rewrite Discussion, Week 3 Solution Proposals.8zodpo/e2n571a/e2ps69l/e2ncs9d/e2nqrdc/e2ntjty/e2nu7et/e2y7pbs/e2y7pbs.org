#+begin_quote
  I'm certainly open to incorporating the definition more explicitly - have any thoughts on how that might be done in an elegant way?
#+end_quote

I adapted my definition to reflect the "rationality-is-a-quality" point better, and this is how I did it:

#+begin_quote
  "Rationality" is a specific quality of fictional works, applicable to all of them regardless of genres and settings.
#+end_quote

What do you think? (I also took major inspiration from your definition; I hope you don't mind.)
