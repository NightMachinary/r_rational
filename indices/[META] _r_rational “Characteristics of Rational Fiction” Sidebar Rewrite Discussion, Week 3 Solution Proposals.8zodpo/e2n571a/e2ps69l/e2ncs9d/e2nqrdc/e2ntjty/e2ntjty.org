Yes, that seems better. By the way, what do you think about [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e2h3ntn/][this point]] by [[/u/Silver_Swift][u/Silver_Swift]]?:

  I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own. You can write rational fiction in just about every genre you feel like, but you can't write just rational fiction. Rational Fantasy and Rational Sci-Fi are the most common combinations and I can easily imagine rational westerns, rational animes, rational horror, rational mysteries and even rational romance stories, but I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.

The way you framed your definition seems most compatible with this point, out of all proposals so far. What do you think about explicitly incorporating it?

^{+/Actually, you should go back to write the next update of Marked for Death. I need more data to plot our party's awesome doom./+}
