--------------

‘Rationality' is a specific quality of fictional works - it does not simply mean ‘good', nor is all good writing necessarily rational.

A work of fiction is rational to the extent that it focuses on competent characters with consistent motivations proactively pursuing their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously thought-out and consistently applied.

In particular, characters in rational fiction often follow unorthodox or genre-defying courses of action which require clever planning, careful analysis, and the creative application of resources or knowledge.

Settings in rational fiction may or may not include fantastical elements, so long as the consequences of their underlying rules are carefully considered and taken seriously in crafting the story's world.

*Common Elements*

Though the presence of any particular feature below is not a requirement, the following characteristics and tropes appear often enough in rational fiction to help point to the cluster.

- Careful Worldbuilding: The "rules" a setting runs on remain consistent, as do their effects and implications. In preexisting settings (e.g. fanfiction), the author may seek to remove or justify incongruities, or to explore their implications.
- Fair-Play Whodunnit: A story's mysteries or problems could, in theory, be solved by attentive readers ahead of time, and the reader should be able to see at least in retrospect how the characters came up with their ideas.
- Munchkinry: Characters strive to exploit their world's rules and solve their problems by leveraging their available resources in creative ways.
- Cerebral Values: The story demonstrates the usefulness of deliberation, preparation, deduction, etc.
- Aspiring Rationalism: The story focuses on revealing characters' thinking, motives, decision-making, and/or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is often a particular feature of the rationalist fiction subgenre of rational fiction, particularly if the reader is meant to be able to take practical lessons from the work.
