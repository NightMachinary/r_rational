Very good, I like it. Minor suggestions/nitpicks:

- The first sentence is pretty complex/long, if apt. Could it be divided in two, perhaps?

- The term "agent" from the first sentence could be misunderstood by unenlightened people. Could it be substituted?

- Reformatting. I don't think the definition itself should be written in large letters, or formatted as a quote. (Also, a nitpick among nitpicks: the template calls for the header and the definition itself to be divided by a line.)

- Rewording. I think it looks better if all entries on a list follow a common pattern. The first two entries on your list read a bit differently from the rest. Something like [Name]:[Description] would be ideal.
