Thanks for the heads up - just a small thing. Personally I like the idea of mentioning the concept of a story "needing" or not rationality, as I did in my original post in the previous thread. Even if worded differently, the main concept that I think would be important to express is that rational =/= good, and most importantly, non rational =/= bad. I know most people get this anyway, but I've seen criticism of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] that makes me inclined to think perhaps some people on first glance misunderstand this. Do you think this could be worked in? Any other opinion on this?
