Ah, this story. Does it ever get any better? I read up to where a bunch of people get on the abandoned ship, and by that point I was bored out of my mind. You wouldn't think you /could/ be that bored when the story is about a giant intelligent spaceship waging war across space and time, but it somehow manages to be an incredible slog to get through.

A much better, more enjoyable story is Chrysalis: [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/][[Reddit Link]]] [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0MRQBkXgY3_OTlEWFJGUkM1MDg/view][[EPUB File]]]
