Space is big. Finding an uninhabited planet isn't that big of a stretch. The thing is, I've seen no mention of restrictions on the ship A.I. Why doesn't it copy itself onto a bunch of future disks and place them everywhere? It just doesn't look like it's trying to actually fulfill its utility function. You could refute my individual points quite easily, just ... look at the big picture. It's kind of odd, isn't it? Confusing, maybe?
