Fantastic!

  since it never branched out or even harvested resources
#+end_quote

It did, actually, that's literally what the current plot is about. Also the insurgency (the Red Hand) it shadow-funded over the last ~50 years. All of this starts to show up as you get past what's basically the intro, while they're repairing Red without knowing what she it.

  the pacing is all out of whack, it's way too slow
#+end_quote

Chalk it up to style differences. I liked it. I generally found that everything went somewhere, although it could take awhile.

#+begin_quote
  huge amount of pointless detail toward every aspect of the story
#+end_quote

That is definitely one of the things I like about it that I don't like about Chrysalis; I find that those details flesh out a world and a story; I find them critical to "showing" in "show don't tell".

#+begin_quote
  any crawling through corridors says volumes about how nonsensical the worldbuilding is
#+end_quote

Ehhhh I don't think this is legit. The part you were reading through is a damaged Red pretending to be a hulk to trick some meat into doing repairs for her. It goes a lot of places from there, and generally, there's ended up being a reason behind every aspect of that world that had me wondering.

#+begin_quote
  often brute force instead of anything clever
#+end_quote

Wow, no. Once you get to to the ship fights and strategic ploys it's a lot of clever.

#+begin_quote
  seems more to do with the writing style
#+end_quote

Absolutely. I don't enjoy reading the writing style that Chrysalis starts out with; normally I'd just skip to later chapters but I haven't seen how to do that on Reddit.

#+begin_quote
  compare the amount of telling between the two stories
#+end_quote

In writing, what do you see as telling and what do you see as showing? I get the sense we might have a big difference of opinion here.
