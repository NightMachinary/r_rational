Well yeah, the Terran is an actual human-level intelligent AI with all the capabilities being a computer entails. It's going to be able to do a ground sweep really quickly if it uses its abilities to its full extent. Also, doing a ground sweep of everything isn't the same as doing a sweep of population centers. Or former population centers.

You skimmed the section that described why that's not a thing. Don't skim this story, it tells a lot in a few words.

As to the warp tunnels, gravity, I think. Been a while since I read this. Jumping out a few AU father away won't work, not with their detection capabilities.

Doomsday comet might work. Not sure. Do be aware that Terran isn't entirely sane, and that gets a whole lot worse. It's a conglomeration of many different people, and then it loses the personality that's the most stable.

I don't actually think the combat in Chrysalis is that clever. It's standard space warfare. However, it at least is internally consistent, unlike in The Last Angel.

This is entirely for the purpose of telling a story, though there are well thought out reasons. If you had read it, anyway.

Not that Chrysalis doesn't have flaws. Of course it does. The difference between the two stories is that the writer of Chrysalis is competent, where the writer of The Last Angel is not.
