I'm hearing some of what you're saying. I definitely recognize that some things might not make sense when skimmed like I do.

I think it's usually a problem that Chrysalis tells a lot in a few words; that's usually a good thing, but you have to celebrate those words, and I don't think Chrysalis does that. The words are there. That's it.

I don't think CHY had enough to establish consistency or inconsistency. I find that LA has about as much as most military SF. What's something you feel is internally inconsistent in LA?

That may be why I don't like it as much; scifi is about consequences, fantasy is about narrative. If you warp things so that you can tell the scene you want, I see that as lazy writing: Go back and edit the starting conditions and players so that the scene you want occurs, don't kludge it in. Or, if you do, embrace the fantasy-ness of it.

I would absolutely disagree about CHY and LA. I don't think the writer of CHY is as good as LA; although I think that's mostly one of experience. Prox's writing style feels much more developed, BraverFur feels like they're still a new writer.

I would call neither one of them incompetent, and I think you should look into yourself to see where that haterade is coming from.
