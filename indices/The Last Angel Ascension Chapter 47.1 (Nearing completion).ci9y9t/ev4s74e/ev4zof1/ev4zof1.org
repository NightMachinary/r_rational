It's hard to recommend or not recommend when your criticism lacks, well, criticism. "I was bored" is your reaction, and it's kinda like saying "Thor did it" in terms of predictive power.

Ah, I recognize Chrysalis. Failed to grab me. Did a lot of telling, not so much showing, and the narrative voice lacks... Presence? It tells me about what happened to it, not what it /is/ happening; gives me a somewhat descriptive blow-by-blow but doesn't really convey the experience the entity is having. It tells me /that/ I should care, but kinda fails to actually deliver on pulling those heart strings.

Red One's hatred is palpable, and although it's not as pronounced as in other works, I do feel like each character's sections have a distinct feel to them.

The story has progressed substantially from where you got to; that abandoned ship /is/ the main character, so if that's as far as you got you didn't really get past the intro. That said, I don't really feel like the story has changed much in feel, although there's a lot less crawling through corridors and a lot more ship-to-ship combat. Check out some of the Red Hand side stories if you want a better idea as to how it reads later on.
