It could be that I'm just hating on The Last Angel for reasons I don't understand. I don't think that's the case though. I'm a writer, but first and foremost a reader, so I'll often see things through that lens. And something I can say that is the objective truth is that when reading The Last Angel, I feel bored. That's a subjective experience that can't be argued with. Now, what can be argued with is whether that feeling is /right/. For example, we could take a bunch of popular literary masterpieces and see if I enjoy them at the expected level to see if my taste in books is oddly calibrated. Or I could just write down what flaws I see. Both The Last Angel and Chrysalis have their flaws. Chrysalis sometimes doesn't focus on the plot as well as it should, there are a few plots holes in it, and while the ending was a good one, in my opinion it wasn't a satisfying one. The Last Angle's virtue is content. By which I mean, it has a lot of it. It also has an interesting premise, but everything else is, charitably put, deeply flawed.
