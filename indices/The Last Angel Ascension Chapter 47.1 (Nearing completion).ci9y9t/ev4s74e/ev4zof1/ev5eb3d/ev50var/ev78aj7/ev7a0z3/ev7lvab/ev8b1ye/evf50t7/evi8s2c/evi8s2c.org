  I can say that is the objective truth is that when reading The Last Angel, I feel bored

TBH, that sounds like the definition of a subjective truth. Why are you kludging into a sentence using "objective truth"?

  popular literary masterpieces
#+end_quote

Eh. As a friend said, "they're classics because they're first, not because they're best". YMWV, and all that; such a measurement would tell me how you're calibrated, and there's no way I know of to know how to judge any such calibration as "odd" or not.

It feels to me like you're trying really hard to avoid having a subjective experience here.
