Okay, trying the epub, as the line breaks on the Reddit formatting feel like stabbing my eyes.

I think this has lost me what after firebombing the /planet/, the Terran does a ground sweep in... hours? Of the entire thing? And then /walks/ the two other survivors to the spaceport? The levels of destruction seem wildly out of proportion.

Also, drive wakes, or did I just skim a section that described why they're not a thing? Because moving ships comparable in size to one that's 27KM - that's a lot of reaction mass, or even just raw energy.

Also also, if you've got that kind of acceleration (demonstrated when ramming), why pop into an orbit when you could pop into a fast injection trajectory; what's the detection range of the warp tunnel*, why not jump a few AU out in a stealthier way, and I mean, for that matter...

Why would you not just get near the system and spend a year making a doomsday comet? Is there something preventing that kind of stealth? Your review of Last Angel implies to me that you think the combat in Chrysalis is clever, but so far (first real battle, nuking the colony) I don't see it at all.

And, if you can jump into orbit around a planet with a warp drive, doesn't that imply you can arrive with (relative) velocity of your choice? Again, just jump in with a lot of high-speed mass, either with completely disposable ships, or just big engines that can detach from the mass and save themselves. The entire tactical approach here seems like it for the purposes of telling a particular story, rather than having well-thought plans by the characters.

- I like that warp tunnels are detectable long before they arrive.

I definitely like the ambassador characters tho, that was a nice section.
