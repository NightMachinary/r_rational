Sure. I think part of what's going on is that it was originally written as a form of creepy pasta - just the horror show that is "wait, this ship is alive is wants to kill us", and then grows from there.

The cleverness shows up in ship battles a bit, but more so the strategic maneuvering, which is usually Red doing feints-in-feints... although yeah, at the end there's always a brute force punch. It's not so much that it's clever about how it fights, but about which fights it fights.

So, the simplest answer to "why now, why never before?" is "scale", battles with bodies to battles with ships to battles with fleets, etc.

Re: show/tell, I'd agree except for the need to advance the plot. Character development and establishment is also very important. I find that Chrysalis does almost no showing (more near the end) and generally sticks to telling; I hear you that LA does a lot of showing that doesn't advance the action, but I like that.
