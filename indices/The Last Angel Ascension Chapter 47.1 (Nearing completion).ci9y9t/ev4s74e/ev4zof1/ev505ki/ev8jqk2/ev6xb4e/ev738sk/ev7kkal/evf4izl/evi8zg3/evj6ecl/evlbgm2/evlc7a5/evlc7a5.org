My criticism is an objective representation of how I experienced the story. I will present my opinion as I see it unless I am presented with some information that will change my mind, and I really don't see that happening. You see, I'm a writer. I've trained myself to see the flaws in my own work, and that skill transfers over to whatever I read. It raises the bar, and The Last Angel is very much below it. If you don't like that I present The Last Angel as a subpar work based on years of experience and actual creative writing classes, then maybe just accept that it's not a very good story, and you can still enjoy it anyway because who cares how good a thing is as long as you appreciate it?
