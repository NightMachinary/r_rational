I think you're taking whatever criticizing I'm pointing at The Last Angel and just turning it around and saying the same thing about Chrysalis without any actual evidence. It seems as if there is some motivation for doing this. Perhaps you enjoyed LA and don't like me saying negative things about it, so are trying to get me to drop my criticism by saying "but this is bad too!" I don't know, of course, but it sure does seem that way.
