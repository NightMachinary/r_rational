Remember, I haven't read to the current plot. I did read that it had been drifting around for hundreds of years at a time, and never once harvested resources while that was going on, which is what I was referring to.

And sure, details are well and good, but the way they're introduced here don't actually progress the story most of the time. The text is clearly aware that the readers don't have the details of the situation of the universe, and painstakingly tells us, directly, everything that's even tangentially relevant, even hammering these points home over and over again. Humans are low on the totem pole around these parts, it says, and then says again, and again, and again, each time more explicitly.

And sure, it might get clever later. Again, I read only a fraction of the story. The problem is what the narrative has shown is the norm. If strategic ploys suddenly happen where before it was brute force against force, worldbuilding crumbles, because the question has to be asked: why now? Why never before?

Telling is directly providing exposition to the reader within narrative or dialogue. Showing is generally description, action, or dialogue that may have exposition in it, but always serves to advance the plot.
