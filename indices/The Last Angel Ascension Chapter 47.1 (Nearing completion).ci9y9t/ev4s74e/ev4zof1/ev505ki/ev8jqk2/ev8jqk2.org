I can't speak to a lot of your criticism, but it's revealed that basically the entire galaxy (both the Compact /and/ the Compact's enemies) really fucking fear and hate AIs, so it's not like it can find a friendly star nation and ally with them. Additionally, it does try to branch out, but it's pretty much always on the backfoot. It's a single ship fighting against a star nation that spans hundreds of solar systems -- its logistically outclassed by several orders of magnitude, and while using AI builders helps some, it still needs a manufacturing chain that it just doesn't have. Also, it has to spend decades or even centuries recovering from battles with the Compact; that's what it was doing before the Compact discovered it at the start of the story.
