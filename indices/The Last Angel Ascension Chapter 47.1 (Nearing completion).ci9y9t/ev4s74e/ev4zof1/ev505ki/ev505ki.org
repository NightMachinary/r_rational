Okay, well, here is some more detailed criticism then. The ship AI is handed an idiot ball the size of the moon, since it never branched out or even harvested resources from planets after many hundreds of years, the pacing is all out of whack, it's way too slow and adds a huge amount of pointless detail toward every aspect of the story, the fact that there even needs to be any crawling through corridors says volumes about how nonsensical the worldbuilding is, and what I've seen of the problems faced tells me the solution is often brute force instead of anything clever. Whereas your experience with Chrysalis seems more to do with the writing style, The Last Angel's problems stem from the fact that the writer had no idea what they were doing and made a subpar story---seriously, compare the amount of telling between the two stories, The Last Angel is practically /drowning/ in it and most of it's not even needed for the plot.
