I'm sitting here with the popcorn waiting for proximal to show up and refute all the points brought up.

Last angel and the sequel have their flaws, but not one of the reasons brought up here have any substance, asides from the slower pace.

The first book starts as a type of horror and branches into something more, the second focuses on political and social matters, while on a grand scale everything is coming together.

Edit.

Just some copy pastes of random snips from proximal in response to questions on spacebattles.com

Why not just make a full copy of herself instead of trying to create new ones? Since she's quite sane and functioning "properly" (bar possible damage induced issues, like what we've seen not so long ago) a full copy-paste into an empty hardware should result in creating another AI. If she's still hardcoded into not doing it, she could just ask the saner sister to do it for her.

Why reinvent the wheel when you can just copy a "perfectly" fine one.

  Red has tried to import portions of her own framework onto child AIs. It hasn't gone any better, as we can see from the Violet series...

The thing is- Wouldn't now be the WORST time to delay/defer retaliation, even if it temporally compromises the Hand's position?

  There's never a good time to ignore an attack on your people, but not every incident like this leads to a full-scale clan war. The threat of something like it keeps syndicates from up and killing each other all the time, but there are lots of instances where they might or must let something slide - as long as it doesn't embolden rivals.

  Think of it like gangs or mafia syndicates today. They hate each other and will kill a member of a rival gang on principle, for being on their turf or other seemingly minor reasons but gang wars themselves are relatively rare as it takes something particularly egregious to really start the bullets flying. This doesn't mean they'll let the murder of one of their own slide, but they can't go to war every time they get slapped in the face. Normally, retribution will be more low-key. In this instance, it's a mid-level underboss that is starting shit. Someone the Blotted Suns can't easily write off and who is high profile enough that they can't let a retributive killing pass - else the rest of the middle management may start causing problems (i.e. 'what are we paying tribute to you for if you won't protect/avenge us?') So the Blotted Suns would have to answer that, just like the Red Hand would have to respond in some way else the same "minnows" may start thinking they can start poking the bear. It's a situation that could spiral out of control very quickly and at a terrible time. The Blotted Suns don't want to get into a clan war, especially not against a faction that they saw dismember one of their peers. The Red Hand doesn't want to get into a clan war and squander its resources. But the traditions and mores of the fringe may demand it.

  It would be a very delicate, very chaotic situation that could completely fuck everything up for everybody.

  Let's watch.

I thiiink that'd essentially be what Ankh-morpork's night watch would once have called “suicide”, Much like asking for short fries in a Dwarven bar, or asking a hung-over troll if he has rocks in his head...

A relatively un-cordinated mass migration event is, according to the word of the Flame, an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to the compact- as in a physical threat, not something capable of undermining their doctrine, potentially capable of Destroying the compact as a polity completely.

I...shudder to think how much of a threat they'd be if they were treating a conflict a an actual war, not simply a hunting trip...

There are no stars.

Well, perhaps not that, but the deadtone getting uppity would probably trigger quite the void on them.

  Let me put it this way: Red will go Chariot-hunting as a matter of course, but even she doesn't want to go up against a Naiad monarch.

  As it stands, the Compact is in the ballpark of Naiad capabilities (but it's a very big park). The Naiads are scattered across the galaxy in small hunting packs, or larger assemblages a few hundred strong. They currently have no inclination or overriding interest to band together. If they were to notice that some of the 'insects' were about to/had become a threat to them as a species, that would be very bad. For everyone. As we've seen, the Naiads don't discriminate. Deadtone are deadtone. Prey and toys. You really don't want them to be thinking of insects as competitors, enemies or - even worse - potential predators.

  If the Compact decided to try and invade Naiad territories and attack them directly, they'd probably have a string of successes, bought at great cost. Then, word would spread amongst the Naiad packs about a dangerous nest of insects. One that needs to be destroyed.

  And if one hive can become dangerous, then what about all the other squeaking, deadtone insects sprinkled across the galaxy...?
