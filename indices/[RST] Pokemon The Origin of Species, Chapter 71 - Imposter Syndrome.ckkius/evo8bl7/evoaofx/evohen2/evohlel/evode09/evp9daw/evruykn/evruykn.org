I mean, yeah; trivially, those Pok√©mon based on ranch animals take the role of ranch animals even in the source material. And after iterating the setting into fanfic, e.g. Miltank retains a lot of Cow traits beyond its general appearance, which suit it to the role even outside that real-world context, in much the same way it's not really a "coincidence" that Gyarados is an apex predator.
