  "Does three days seem like a reasonable amount of time to meet again and see how we've progressed along each of our experiments?"

  "I would request longer," Satori says, which takes Red by surprise. [...] She looks at Jason. "Unless three is enough?"

Is this the best mind-reader Satori allowing for the possibility that Jason could merge with Pokemon faster than her... or the best mind-reader Satori detecting his panic at the deadline and requesting more time on his behalf?

Maybe I'm looking too much into it, but when you are surprised /something/ about your model is wrong. Red thinks she is more interested in his idea than expected, but it's possible she is more considerate than expected.
