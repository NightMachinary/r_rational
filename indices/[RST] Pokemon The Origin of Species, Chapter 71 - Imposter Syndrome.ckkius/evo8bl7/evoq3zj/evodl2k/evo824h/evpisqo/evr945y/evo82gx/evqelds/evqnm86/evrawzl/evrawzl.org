Sort of, psychics can detect partitions in others, but not what's on the other side. More importantly though, if you actually forget the truth yourself, you would have to forget a lot of connected things so that a sense of having forgotten something doesn't come up too. Even then, you can't lie /strategically,/ and you can't really mislead people nearly as effectively, if you totally blank that part of your mind, even assuming that level of self-editing wouldn't result in super obvious changes.
