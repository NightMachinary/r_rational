I wonder how much of it is from some inherent bit of Pokemon brain/capabilities in comparison to human ones. Like they upfront say in the chapter that there are inherent differences in both mentality and in psychic abilities. I mean they even go so far as to reference the inkay line which is psychic/dark.

Maybe it's even something like a distributed nervous system is enough to "ping" back in a way that is different enough from the human perspective to not be seen the same.

Or I guess in more psychological terms maybe there was enough difference between the subconscious mind and the more surface level thoughts to be good enough to lie, but again be able to be read as lying by Giovanni.
