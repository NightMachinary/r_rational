We do have Mewtwo's POV on his mental shield:

#+begin_quote
  It is a hard thing to keep my mind *partitioned*. To let the false-hope, the harmless-hope, show on the surface for Sabrina to read, while inside the desperate, anguished, starving hope rends at me. I sense her concern as my mask leaks briefly, and some of my true feelings go through.

  ...Again I struggle to keep my mental mask in place, remind myself of all the false hope I've been fed before.

  ...She sends humor, concern, trepidation. I carefully add resolution and eagerness to my mask. Yes! Thank you for telling me, Sabrina.

So it's partition based, and the main unique thing is Mewtwo's maintaining two separate partitions/thought patterns at once and hiding one of them. Though he's putting in conscious effort and having emotions leak between them, which is sort of weird if he needs to explicitly add emotion to his "model" mind.

Also interesting that Mewtwo talks about "surfaces" and "masks" in the sense of entry rather than depth, which hasn't really been a concept in these psychic rules I think? The only kinda similar power is Red's unique ability to notice intrusion attempts that only hit his "surface", which'd explain why no one's explored this area yet. Guess it's possible Mewtwo's learned HPMOR-style +legilimency+ occlumency and is using "partition" loosely (not like he has access to psychic literature to know the proper terminology).

Huh.
