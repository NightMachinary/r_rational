Aww, Red, was it really that long ago? I'm having a bit of trouble picturing what Blue and the rest were doing other than the change of arena in the footage. But I suspect the second will be right in Blue coming there soon.

I'm liking the exploration of the psychic phenomenon, and I'm glad we have a concrete tie between Red and Mewtwo storyline now, possibly with Leaf and his mum coming into it from their angles too.

Seeing as though the project is almost certainly about Mewtwo, it could be a mixture of Red and Rei's theories realistically, or even Rowans, it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.
