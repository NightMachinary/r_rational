Reuseable pokeballs for storage at home, take them to the store and buy perishable product out of larger storage systems. Even if the product is out in the air for a few seconds while transferring between systems, it's not like the perishable product is going to rot or go bad while stored. Although maybe smaller storage pokeballs just isn't cost effective.
