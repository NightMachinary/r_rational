  I continue to think that it is just partitions. Like, Past Red will truthfully answer questsions about depression, so will Present Red. The psychic will read both as sincere, but they will not be the same answer.

Does Past Red have memory of everything Present Red sees? What happens if Present Red deletes a memory, does Past Red also lose that memory?

This question is for anyone reading.
