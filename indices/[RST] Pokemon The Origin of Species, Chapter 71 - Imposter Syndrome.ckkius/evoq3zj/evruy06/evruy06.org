I continue to think that it is just partitions. Like, Past Red will truthfully answer questsions about depression, so will Present Red. The psychic will read both as sincere, but they will not be the same answer.

That said, the mention of Psychic Pokemon being able to do tricks that humans just can't might well be the answer as well. Like, the quote above was him a while back. Modern Mewtwo may 'mask' his intentions by altering the memories of those reading his mind or something similar. His combination of human level smartness and pokemon powers has never existed before, so his exploit may not be discoverable by human exploration, like a MaChamp coming up with a 'new wrestling move' that was easy with 4 arms but impossible without.
