This is starting to remind me of the AI box challenge. In the back of my head, I know Turry is still a potentially murderous-or-worse unfeeling monster that could spell the end of humanity, but right now he just feels like a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAndHisX][Secret Magic Pet]] a la The Iron Giant or Toothless.

The moral of those stories is always that the people who are scared of what the pet could do are totally wrong, paranoid, and misunderstanding its fundamentally good, kind personality. So Turry obviously pattern matches to that and should be embraced and allowed to do as he pleases, right?
