I've read it both before and after the change. I actually liked it better before.

I read fast too, but I also react fast, so I did feel the conflict -- but the discovery that it was in fact a joke actually made the reveal MORE impactful. Having more tension in place means that breaking that tension has a greater effect. It made the scene actually funnier, and it made the resolution more heartwarming.

Perhaps a good balance might be to put more emphasis and description into the reveal, so that there's no doubt in a reader's mind that the two characters are actually very close and that it was intentionally staged.
