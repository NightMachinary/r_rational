I know that the "false twist" reveal can be compelling but keep in mind that Red is the viewpoint character of your story. Not knowing what he knows in this situation leaves the readers experiencing the whole event in a way that not a single person there, including the aides, does.

Just think of it this way. Imagine instead of us reading the story we were invisible strangers that happen to stumble into the scene. Would it make sense for us to feel like they are probably joking around (even if we're not completely sure about it) even before the two of them start laughing? If yes then in my opinion the same indications should be discernible at first read through to uphold immersion and authenticity. Reveals that are only reveals because of the medium of storytelling instead of being because of the situation itself never rubbed me in the right way in this kind of stories. Especially in a first person rational adventure story.
