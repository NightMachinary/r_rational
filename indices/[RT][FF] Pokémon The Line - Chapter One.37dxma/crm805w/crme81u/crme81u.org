I misread the opening at first too - thought he was genuinely pissed off and being a /gigantic/ asshole. Then they were just kidding around... took a second read with the addition of context to 'get it'.

That said, once I was armed with that context it was all really rather good, definite success in the "picturing the scene" stakes. Added to my reading list.
