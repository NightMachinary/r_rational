Since you asked for constructive criticism: the beginning feels a bit choppy and exaggerated. It's obvious later that the Professor is being purposefully extravagant, but it still felt offputting to me. Maybe smooth the narration out a bit, with more scene setting so it's not quite so sharp.

Other than that, seems like an interesting start :) Definitely going to keep an eye out for more.
