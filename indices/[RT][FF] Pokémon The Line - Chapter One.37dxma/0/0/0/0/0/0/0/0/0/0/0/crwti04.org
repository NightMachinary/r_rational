I've edited the introduction a few times now, and I'm at the point where I'm willing to just let it sit. I'll come back to it in a few weeks or so, when it's left my mind and I can look at it with clear eyes.

I've saved your comment, though, so I can look through it when that time comes. I agree with your feelings about tricksy reveals like that - they're actually a pet irritation of mine as well. But I'm not going to take this one on again for a while, as any changes it receives would probably be of the major-overhaul variety, rather than the subtle-alteration sort, and I'm just too close to it right now to do that properly.

Thanks for the feedback, mate!
