  Can she harvest Night like the Drow do? They claimed they could pull it from other living beings, and she's got two Revenants to harvest.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/chapter-53-gloom/][Ivah didn't even say as much]], it just got too terrified to answer Cat's questions. Eight silvers says the claiming ritual requires time/concerted effort/huge-ass ritual pyramid, and the breathing room for that is far enough away that she didn't expect to try before she goes north.

  Can creatures other than Drow worship the goddesses and gain the gifts of Night?

Why, though? The only nation that could theoretically be even remotely receptive to the "gain power in strife and forfeit everything gained to your future murderer in exchange" kind of deal is Levant, and every Levantine present (and the vast majority of potential recipients, for that matter) are Good enough to sign up for a crusade. Not to mention the narrative dead end of "the dark priestess offers the temptation of power" that would result from any kind of initiative on Catherine's part.

Worship in the Guideverse is a matter of genuine faith - the kind that Cat offered Sve Noc together with her crown. Nobody else had enough exposure to them for us to tell how common that's gonna be (and no, Hakram weebing out doesn't count). What form the general worship of the sisters will or will not take is a matter that will only barely start taking shape depending on how Cat's alliance shakes out, though it would be fun to see them having to cooperate with Augur.

  If she can take all the Night away from a Drow, can she give it to someone (or something) else?

You're overly focusing on the EXP gain system, which, aside from being Below-granted (and therefore compromised as far as Above's symmetrical response and its own reliability goes), was a half-sorcerous feature of the old Night. Aside from [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/chapter-33-concord/][speculating how it could change]], Cat's using the new, fully divine version, the effectiveness of which ([[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/chapter-15-bravura/][like pretty much every miracle so far]]) seems to at least partially depend on the intent behind it.

Look again at the fight in this chapter. Cat mostly casts debuffs, goes for the takedowns when she's sure she can make them work, but the one time she tries to shield Saint from the revenant's purification Aspect, she fails. She doesn't even try to touch Saint, but if I had to guess, any kind of buff would be similarly unstable. The credo goes "you are what you take", not "you are what you give freely".
