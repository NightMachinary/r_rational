I love Practical Guide, but Cat really needs to have a sit-down with Crow-mena and An-crow-nike and talk about religion.

It's good seeing our main character go from Rogue to Cleric and her usual on-the-spot improvisation, but she's the child of Black and really needs to figure out how some of this works.

Can *she* harvest Night like the Drow do? They claimed they could pull it from other living beings, and she's got two Revenants to harvest.

Can creatures /other/ than Drow worship the goddesses and gain the gifts of Night? She's a Human High Priestess, so it seems rather odd they'd exclude other beings who wish to worship them, but maybe even if they do they can't use the abilities.

If she can take all the Night away from a Drow, can she give it to someone (or something) else? Can she pick and choose abilities, memories, and skills? There's bound to be a lot of overlap in abilities, and plenty of abilities that can't be used (like that stonemason's skills, for instance), that can be 'moved' away from combat minions and given to utility minions to use. I'm sure the Drow wouldn't mind giving up some otherwise pointless-to-them skills like glassblowing or leatherworking that were passed down from their ancestors to non-Drow instead, and she could take the skills of veteran non-Drow soldiers who are too old or too wounded to fight and graft them onto a more bloodthirsty-but-inexperience Drow warrior to use.
