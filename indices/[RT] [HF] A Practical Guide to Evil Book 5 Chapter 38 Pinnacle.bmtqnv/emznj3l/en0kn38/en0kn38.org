It seems like the Dead King is intentionally using the Revenants that were encountered before. The comments on the story page made it sound like he was basically throwing them away on a side venture so that they don't come back to narratively bite him later. But I bet he wouldn't have been put out if they won, either, since they may retain enough of their Role's weight to be able to establish patterns of three, etc. that he can manipulate, regardless of outcome (since of course, if you're stuck in a pattern with a Revenant you can't be in one with Neshamah at the same time).
