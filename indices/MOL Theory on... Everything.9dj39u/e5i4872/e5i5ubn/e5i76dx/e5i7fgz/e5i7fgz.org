  You sure about that? I'm too lazy to look it up, but I remember it differently. I think he at least didn't like him pre loop.

Pretty sure, I read it all in the last week, I remember Zach saying he was pretty ignorant of everything until the loop. He didn't like his guardian but didn't know he robbed them. He thought staff were laid off to save money, ect. Didnt know he didnt have a lot of money until he tried to withdraw a lot.
