#+begin_quote
  Why would they mark Zach if they wanted to retain info from the loop?
#+end_quote

They wouldn't... They would need to get an item from Zach's home and he stumbled into them... And two get marked... (red robes and zach)

Or Zach is evil. (Maybe the mindwipe changed that or he is still secretly evil.) Okay unlikely.

#+begin_quote
  Primordial beast obviously wants to get out but he didnt start the loop, hes just taking advantage of it. The mentioned how the Gate construct security has degraded allowing it access, but therse no way he could have marked a pre loop Zach
#+end_quote

Wouldn't need to mark Zach. He starts the loop and primordial offers the temporarly marked red robe a deal.

#+begin_quote
  Zach didn't know his guardian was swindling him until he entered the loop.
#+end_quote

You sure about that? I'm too lazy to look it up, but I remember it differently. I think he at least didn't like him pre loop.

#+begin_quote
  Thats totally inconsistent with everything that he's done, this would be the equivalent of the "And it was all a dream" twist ending
#+end_quote

Well, true, but you know my favourite fan theory? Red Robe could be a Simulacrum of Zach.

Still, he could have fighted with the lich just for the crown. And then just pretended. Still unlikely he is evil.
