Actually we don't know that Red Robe was a bad mind mage. in fact, we know he was pretty decent at it because he could use mind blank when soul killing the spiders, which is a very advanced spell. He also taught all of the invaders mind magic protection, which was giving the spiders a very hard time.

The reason that zorian Pwned him so hard at mind magic was because one, it was unexpected for how long he'd been looping, and two, Red Robe was only using only unstructured mind magic so that it doesn't mess with the markers.

Some things we know about unstructured mind magic: Ch 42

  "Can you also use telepathy and mind reading in an unstructured manner, too?" he asked Xvim, acting on a hunch. "Me, personally? No. I've never had an interest in anything other than defending myself," Xvim said. "But if you're asking whether it's possible, the answer is yes... with caveats. It requires great dedication for rudimentary results -- such an aspirant would never be able to duplicate the attack you just casually did, for instance, even after a lifetime of honing their skills."

Zorian made a similar conclusion in ch 63

#+begin_quote
  As for how Red Robe bypassed its protection to mess with Zach's mind, Zorian wasn't quite sure... ...but he had a suspicion it was related to Red Robe's use of non-structured mind magic. He distinctly remembered that Red Robe had been using non-structured mind magic on both him and Zach, despite being fairly bad at it. Which was kind of foolish of him at the face of it, since structured mind magic would have probably served a non-psychic like him a lot better in most regards. However, if the marker's contingency was aimed primarily at countering structured magic, and non-structured magic bypassed it to some extent, his choice of attack mode made perfect sense.

In my opinion, the marker was left over from zach's ancestors. No one uses the gate anymore because it's breaking, and the invasion fails to open the gate when red robe isn't helping. *I* think that the primordial is the one that triggered it. he's trying to up his chances of getting out.
