The biggest flaw in the theory is that aside from the ring and (maybe, unlikely) the knife, all other imperial artifacts were beyond angels' ability to retrieve for Zach. There is no smart way of getting the crown, you have to fight the lich the hard way.

If Zach is able to defeat the lich then it's not easy to betray him and wipe his memories. That would suggest that RR is stronger than QI, but that is clearly not the case.
