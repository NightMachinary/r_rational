  What if the release of the primordial was the goal of the loop? We know a large operation that tries to free it. So why not make sure they get it in the first try.
#+end_quote

Why would they mark Zach if they wanted to retain info from the loop?

#+begin_quote
  Or if not the goal why Zach went into the loop, than the goal of the primordial beast, after it became aware of the loop and let RR out?
#+end_quote

Primordial beast obviously wants to get out but he didnt start the loop, hes just taking advantage of it. The mentioned how the Gate construct security has degraded allowing it access, but therse no way he could have marked a pre loop Zach

#+begin_quote
  The reason for Zach to go into the loop could have been to get stronger and proof his guardian is a thief. And his family had some way to enter the Sovereign Gate. Maybe he didn't even know it would be a loop.
#+end_quote

Zach didn't know his guardian was swindling him until he entered the loop.

#+begin_quote
  Also Zach could be evil. Did he ever let someone in his mind?
#+end_quote

Thats totally inconsistent with everything that he's done, this would be the equivalent of the "And it was all a dream" twist ending
