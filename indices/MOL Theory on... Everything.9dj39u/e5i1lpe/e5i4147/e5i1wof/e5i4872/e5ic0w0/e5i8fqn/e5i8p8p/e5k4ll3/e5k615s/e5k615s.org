I think the royal vault is much easier to get into that Z&Z know. The dagger must be the first item he gets, and there could be other items in there that would help him achieve the problems you pointed out.

RR seemed to have gotten the dagger in a method that did not raise any alarms. The loop in which the Aranea were removed from the loop, there was no mention of an uproar over a missing item from the vault. This implies that there was a method to get this dagger without raising the alarm, which I believe RR learned from Zach, who learned it from the Angel.

I dont have any solid ideas on how they could have gotten the far ones, my leading idea is theres some artifact in the vault he could use to activate the gates, but that's just speculation. The core of my theory is that Zach was given detailed instructions on what to do in the loop and forgot them do to RR, which I think there is some level of story evidence for. The far items are a stretch, I agree, but its very consistent with the story for the guys to go about something the hardest way possible to find out there was a easy option only after they dont need it.
