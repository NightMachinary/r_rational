  The temporary markers put on from the crown only last 6 restarts. Pretty sure there are more than 6 restarts between Zorian getting a marker (which would be the point Zach lost his memory), and RR leaving the loop.
#+end_quote

They are told they only last 6, but they talk about how they are pretty sure thats an arbitrary limitation that they could bypass if they had all the keys.

  Also it's been strongly hinted early on that Zach's huge mana pool without significant loss of manipulation is a bloodline ability.
#+end_quote

Its not strongly hinted, there's just one internal monologue paragraph about it. Zorian theorizes that it might be a bloodline ability, but seems pretty unsure about that and then they kind of drop it.
