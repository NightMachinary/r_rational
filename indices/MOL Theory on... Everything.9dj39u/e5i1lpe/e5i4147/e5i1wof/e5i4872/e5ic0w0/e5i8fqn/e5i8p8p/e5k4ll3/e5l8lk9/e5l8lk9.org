I agree with most things, except I think that Veyers as RR is a red herring. I think it makes narrative sense that it's someone that has been active in the story, so anyone but Veyers.

If I had to, I would put money on Damien being red robe. Zach went to him find the scepter, gave him a temp marker, and Damien learned to use his freaky mentalist powers. He was extremely unscrupulous with its use and managed to hack the marker, and eventually betrayed Zach. Why would the author make Damien a native mentalist if he was going to leave that chekov's gun unfired?

The reason that Zach irrationally distrusts Zorian to check his mental integrity is not just due an implanted compulsion, but also partly due to Zach's sub-conscious noting Zorian's similarity to Damien.

The final showdown would have much more gravitas if it was between an RR Damien/Silverlake and Zach/Zorian. Possibly also with a mindjacked Zach on team evil, at first.
