Its possible the angel prepared the way in some other method for the other items.

I'm just speculating, but really its not impossible for there to be easier ways to gain them. if nobody103 wanted there to be back doors, they could be introduced and not feel forced and out of place in the world he created. There is a definite theme in the story of Zach and Zorian walking up 10 flights of stairs only to see there was an elevator when they got to the top. Everytime they worked hard to get something they keep finding that there was an easier way and this would fit. Zorian trains to get memory packaging abilities, the orb grants that, Zorian literally kills himself to get soul perception, the ring grants that. They develop new methods to open gates to teleport across the world, the staff does that.

Also I just realized something, when they hand QI the divine dagger, he shows off by stabbing it into himself. The dagger has the abillity to damage spiritual being (in addition to its Time loop ability) I bet if they sat down with QI and offered the dagger to him, he would stab it into himself, and force himself out of his own body (without invoking the time loop ability)

They never asked for the dagger, its possible they could have somehow talked it out of the royal vaults. Or there could be some secret entrance visible to divine magic or something. Maybe the royal line has some divine mandate from the gods or something the angel knows Zach could invoke.

For the crown,there could be some item in the vault that can be used to shut down QI. Heck, QI is super reasonable apparently, if they needed it they could have probably worked out a deal to borrow it under supervision to mark someone.

There could have been an item the dragon was willing to trade the staff for, possibly even in the royal vault.

These are all pure speculation, and I dont think its any of these are how it will play out but its easy to just make up a possibility so it wouldn't be hard for the author to fit one in the story if this is what he intended. Everyone in my OP was more supported by story points.
