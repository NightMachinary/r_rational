My theory is contingent on RR making him forget all the early resets where he knew what he was doing. If he did 2 years of resets with prepared knowledge, if RR placed a compulsion on him to make him not able to remember the instructions he'd also have to make him forget the first resets. So the following reset he'd not remember any of the following and would think reset number X was reset number 1
