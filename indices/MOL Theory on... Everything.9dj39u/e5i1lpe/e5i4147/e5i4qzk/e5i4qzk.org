We know some things:

- RR was not a very good mind mage. Zorian was much better than him when they first met and at that time Zorian was unable to probe memories, let alone edit them to the extent Zach is missing his.

- Modifying memories is very difficult, Zorian is probably only just now able to do it to the extent Zach is missing memories

- Zorian has never examined Zach's mind, he wont let him

- Zach has at least 1 compulsion/geas on him, to ignore/forget/dismiss about mentions of Veyer

Looking at all these these I think it is likely that RR did not actually erase any of Zach memories, he wasn't good enough to do that. Instead he placed compulsions on Zach so that he couldn't 'remember' them. Basically the memories are still there but Zach can't access them.

I think when Zach finally lets Zorian examine him he will find all the memories there and allow Zach to access them again.
