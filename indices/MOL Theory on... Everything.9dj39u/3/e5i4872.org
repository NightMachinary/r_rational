What if the release of the primordial was the goal of the loop? We know a large operation that tries to free it. So why not make sure they get it in the first try.

Or if not the goal why Zach went into the loop, than the goal of the primordial beast, after it became aware of the loop and let RR out?

The reason for Zach to go into the loop could have been to get stronger and proof his guardian is a thief. And his family had some way to enter the Sovereign Gate. Maybe he didn't even know it would be a loop.

We wouldn't need some unknown information about an angel for that theory. (And the unknown laws angel have to obey.)

Also Zach could be evil. Did he ever let someone in his mind?
