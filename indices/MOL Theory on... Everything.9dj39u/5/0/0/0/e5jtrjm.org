He has the shaping skills of someone with Magnitude 25. Which is at the very top end of what you can naturally have. As a comparison, Zorian is Magnitude 8, and normal is about 11-12. So, yes, his shaping skills are significantly impacted, but he's simply got enough practice in to compensate for a lot of it (although he literally /can't/ achieve the same level of shaping that Zorian can). Before the loop, though, he was having a lot of trouble in school because shaping was just so much harder for him than anyone else.

However, his mana reserves are Magnitude 50. Which is both ridiculously, inhumanly high, and /way/ out of proportion to its effect on his shaping skills. Which is why they're so interested in QI's divine blessing.
