You have the power create a Black Box. You get the feeling that this power has the potential to grow and change with how it's used.

A Black Box is always a parallelepiped whose longest diagonal can be no larger than your arm span. The surface of a Black Box is always totally impermeable, no information or energy can move from inside to outside or vice versa. For all purposes, all energy inside a Black Box always appears to be spread evenly across its volume from an outside perspective, and vice versa. A Black Box is never permanent. A Black Box can never contain yourself.

By default, you can only create one Black Box at a time, and it only persists for as long as you focus.

How would you munchkin this?
