Ah, so you can make a 100% efficient heater? Solve the attention span problem and make multiple boxes with hot things in for Green energy. I'm sure someone other than me could work out how to contain fusion reactions in it. Sadly the size stops you being able to contain a sun to defeat heat death of the universe, and you're not immortal (yet) anyway...
