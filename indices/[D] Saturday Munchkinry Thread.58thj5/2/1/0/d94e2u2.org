Things that are default, or not mentioned in the 'always, never' paragraph can be changed with practice.

Note, in the 'always, never' paragraph, a Black Box is never permanent.

Also, the Black Box's nearness to a black hole is irrelevant, as long as it isn't inside the event horizon. From inside, the mass of the outside appears to be evenly spread across the outside volume, and Space is Big.

You can definitely form a Black Box around something. What the black box forms around determines its initial conditions.
