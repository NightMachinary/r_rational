The case of losing an arm does not change the size of the box. Your arm span at the time of gaining the power is remembered and not changed.

The smallest box you can create is the smallest box your unaided eyes can resolve at the time of gaining your power. This value is also remembered.

The placement of the box is always always within arm's reach, as per the remembered value of arm span.

Then the object is scrambled in a random configuration of particles that is legal and which conserves energy, quantum numbers, and so on.
