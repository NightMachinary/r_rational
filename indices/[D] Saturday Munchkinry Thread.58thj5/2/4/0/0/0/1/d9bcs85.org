Oh, additional questions:

#+begin_quote
  A Black Box is always a parallelepiped whose longest diagonal can be no larger than your arm span. Whatever was inside, after whatever evolution happens inside, as long as it was in a state that is legal in the outside universe, reappears.

- Suppose I have my arm cut off and replaced with a permanently-attached prosthetic. Does this change the size of the Box I can create?
- What is the smallest box I can create?
- How precisely can I control the location of the box when it appears?
- What if the object achieves a state that is /not/ legal in the outside universe?\\
