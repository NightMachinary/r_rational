  In the case of a video camera and flashlight, I think that all the camera would record is the light beam refracting off of whatever air was inside the box along with the camera, before hitting blackness at the inner faces of the box.

So time passes inside the box. Good to know. That does mean that I can extract data, though -- put two things inside, one of which is a camera. When they reappear I will have seen the effects on the other object.
