You said information can't enter the box, which means there's no way to put anything in it other than to have the box appear around the object. Now, someone down below mentioned that objects inside the box cannot experience acceleration.

- Can the box be moved while there is something inside it?\\
- Suppose I create a box around a falling object, bring the box to a halt, then allow the box to disappear. The object reappears. What is its velocity?
- Suppose I make the box appear around a battery-powered video camera+flashlight combination. I move the box around, then let it disappear. The camera+flashlight reappear. What is on the camera?

Edit: What is the perceived mass of the box? Presumably it does not vary depending on what I created it around. This sounds like a great way to launch dense materials into orbit.
