From this and the OP I can't tell: is the box a perfect heat sink? If I point a laser at it, does it heat up?

Actually, you said that the inside of the box was pure black and the box itself is a horizon. That implies that photons that hit the box disappear. If so, that makes it a perfect heat sink.
