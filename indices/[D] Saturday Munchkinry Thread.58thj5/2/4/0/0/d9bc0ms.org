Can I control the thickness of the walls?

Presumably when I portal fut something with the box it cuts enough space for the box to fit, which means the outer dimensions of the box. Unless the walls are infinitely thin there will be a certain amount of mass that is overlapping the walls. What happens to that mass?

Edit: how precise is the cut? ie, how smooth are the edges of the box / the edges of the cut?
