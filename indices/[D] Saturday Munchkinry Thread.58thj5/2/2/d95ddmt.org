This seems like it would be very useful for a bomb disposal expert. Put the Black Box around the bomb just before it explodes. Since no information can leave the Box, the explosion inside the Box will have no effect. When you remove the Box, you get a cloud of smoke, which is a whole lot better than the original explosion.

Do you have to be present to create the Box? If you can do so over long range, i.e. via a TV broadcast, then it becomes even more powerful.

Since it's totally impermeable, it also makes a great shield. Hmmm... and since information cannot leave the Box, you can use it to sneak metallic objects past a metal detector (look, my box doesn't make your detector beep).
