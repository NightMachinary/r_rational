The problem is that if the two realms are completely identical then whatever happens on one side will also be the same thing that happens on the other. For example if you say "Hello" or try to have conversation your counterpart will say the exact same things as you at the exact same time. If you throw a ball into the portal it will bounce off its counterpart in the middle of the portal.
