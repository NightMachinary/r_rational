There is a parallel universe exactly identical to our own in every way. One day, you gain the ability to make a door-sized portal to that universe. From there, the two identical universes start to diverge from one another.

- You can keep this portal open as long as you like.
- You can collapse the portal at will.
- You can create a new portal at will.
- The only other person with this power is your alternate universe counterpart.

You have no other special powers or abilities beyond those you already possess. How do you make the world a better place?
