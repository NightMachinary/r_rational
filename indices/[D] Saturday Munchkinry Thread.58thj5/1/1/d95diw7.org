Step one: Attempt to force divergence in some way.

It's probably fairly straightforward to get myself and my alternate to diverge somewhat, especially if we /try/ to diverge. Then we can attempt to leverage divergence in others, by interacting with them in different ways.

Now, normal trading between the two worlds won't help much. Both worlds have the same resources, the same needs. Of course, that doesn't mean that trade is /impossible/. It just means that what we trade needs to be /information/.

So, step two: Force profitable divergences.

Talk to people whose currency is /ideas/. Physicists, open-source programmers, scientists in general. Provide means for them to collaborate with their alternates (I can easily run a network cable through the portal, though I might need to talk to an ISP about a high-capacity line once this picks up enough). They can either work together, or agree with their alternates to each pursue a different strategy.

Research (both in general and into multiple universes in particular) gets a massive boost.

Also, by creating a portal and collapsing it at will, I can pretty much cut anything, though that seems less useful at first glance.
