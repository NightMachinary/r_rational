The mass of the box does depend on what is inside it initially. That doesn't count as information moving through the surface, since the surface formed around the contents.

The box can be moved, though as described before its behavior is odd.

If you form the box around a fast moving object, the halt the box's movement, then allow it to disappear, the object will also be halted, and depending on the exact initial velocity may also be noticeably hotter.

In the case of a video camera and flashlight, I think that all the camera would record is the light beam refracting off of whatever air was inside the box along with the camera, before hitting blackness at the inner faces of the box.
