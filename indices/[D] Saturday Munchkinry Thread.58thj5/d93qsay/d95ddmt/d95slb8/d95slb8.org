Bomb disposal does seem like it would be an effective use.

You cannot create a box outside of arm's reach by default, but you can increase your maximum range with practice.

Shock waves still travel through the box, even if they don't change its shape, so its use as a shield against very large calliber ballistic projectiles is limited. Also, while it certainly can sneak things through a metal detector, it is overall not very difficult to sneak things through a metal detector.
