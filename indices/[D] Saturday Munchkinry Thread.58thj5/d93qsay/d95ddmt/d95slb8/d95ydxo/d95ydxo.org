...something just struck me. Information cannot enter the box, right?

Therefore, the inside of the box cannot experience acceleration. (Because if the inside of the box can experience acceleration, then it gains the information of the direction that said acceleration is happening in).

/Therefore/, the inside of the box cannot experience /gravity/. The environment inside the box must perforce be weightless.

*Therefore*, if the box has any appreciable height, I can use it to generate free energy.

I have an apparatus consisting of a wooden pole holding up a magnet, and a heavy iron weight - too heavy for the magnet to hold up. I enclose them in a black box. Free of the Earth's gravitational field, the magnet pulls the weight up... and then I dismiss the box, and the weight comes crashing down again. (With the right setup, I'm sure I can extract energy from this - alright, so it's a trickle...)
