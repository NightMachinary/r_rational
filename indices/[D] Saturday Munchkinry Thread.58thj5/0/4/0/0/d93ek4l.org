Him and he both refer to our "opponent".

By FAI I mean an artifical value-aligned superintelligence, which humanity may bring about in the future.

An easier way to put this is to say that instead of bringing about an FAI, his job is to spend however many loops it takes to bring back future technology and feed it back to humanity until we're advanced enough to bring me back.

Does stopping my heart count as killing me? We can make this even easier by letting him kill me the tenth time by stopping my heart with a defibrillator in a hospital, then restart it after he is declared the winner.
