#+begin_quote
  Do they come to know where I am at 7:00, or just where I live?
#+end_quote

They learn where you are at exactly 7:00 PM, and vice versa. This information does not update.

#+begin_quote
  Do they have to kill me, or is it enough if I die?
#+end_quote

They have to be directly or indirectly responsible for your death. Also, you can't simply kill yourself, as that would count as them being indirectly responsible.

#+begin_quote
  What do I get if they fail?
#+end_quote

Well, you get to live out the rest of your natural life. If that's not enough of an incentive, then say you get a non-blackboxed version of their powers once their soul is devoured.
