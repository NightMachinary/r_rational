Alright, you know what? That's straight up pragmatism right there. Now the question is, can you /actually/ get your hands on a bunch of explosives in 8 hours?

Also, neither of you will learn the location or identity of the other until 7:00 AM, because otherwise you'd just be able to assassinate them before they gained their powers, which is too easy.
