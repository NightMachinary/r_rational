Yeah, we're pretty much putting him in a Grey Boy loop. The real plan (assuming you know where the guy is and he doesn't know anything yet) is:

1. Break into his house right before the loop begins.

2. Brandish gun, tie him down. Ideally he doesn't have a family. If he does, tie them down.

3. The moment the loop begins, shoot him in the back of the head. Escape country, ditch your name and every identifying feature of your life, live out rest of life in exile.
