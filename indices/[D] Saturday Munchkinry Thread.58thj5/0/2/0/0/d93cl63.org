If that's the case, this is really easy. Just figure out a way to get a huge amount of explosives and plant them around his house. Then, set them to explode exactly 1 second after the time loop starts. Looper spends 100 subjective years being blown apart every second.

Edit: I just realized I suggested going full Grey Boy on him. Ouch.

Also, explosives aren't the best method. If you know exactly when the time loop starts, you just need to break into the guy's house and shoot/decapitate him the moment it starts.
