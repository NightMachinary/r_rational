I live in Universe A. My parallel lives in Universe B. Therefore, since both universes are identical, me and my parallel must be identical.

What this means is that every time I use my power to create a portal in a given location in my universe, my parallel will create a perfectly identical copy of my portal at the exact same time, at the corresponding location in his universe. If I then walk into my portal to come out of his portal in his universe, he will also simultaneously walk through his portal to come out of my portal in my universe. All this really does is allow me and my parallel to switch locations, and since we are, for all intents and purposes, identical, this has no effect on the universes.

In other words, it is impossible for the universes to diverge, assuming that they are deterministic. The portals are essentially magic hoops that do nothing.

You could fix this by making it so that me and my parallel are explicitly divergent for some nebulous reason, despite the rest of the universe being identical. If that was the case, then the universes would begin to diverge almost immediately. Although, if this is the case, I have to ask, what is my parallel's personality like? Are they an evil doppelganger archetype with a total blue-orange morality, or something more like an identical twin?
