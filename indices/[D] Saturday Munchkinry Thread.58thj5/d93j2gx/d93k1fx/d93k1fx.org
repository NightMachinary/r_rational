Acquire funds using a series of short term binary investment strategies. After N iterations one universe will have a rich you. From then on accelerate research by trying high risk/high reward experiments, testing two ways every time. No matter what happens on one universe, share the results with the other before closing/opening a new door, this way both universes pay for a single experiment but learn the results of two, each universe will progressively become better.

The initial universes where the investments didn't pay off may play the game again, so we keep a bounced amount of "losing" universes while the rest proceed faster towards a better world.

Alternately, try to acquire complete control over Brockton Bay.
