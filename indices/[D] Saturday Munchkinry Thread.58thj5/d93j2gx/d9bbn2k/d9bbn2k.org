When I open the portal, does it always go to the corresponding point?

Can I have more than one portal at a time?

The portal is "door sized". What door? Can I change its orientation?

One thing that comes to mind is purpose-built train cars. Build them to fit and you could significantly increase the capacity of a train yard.
