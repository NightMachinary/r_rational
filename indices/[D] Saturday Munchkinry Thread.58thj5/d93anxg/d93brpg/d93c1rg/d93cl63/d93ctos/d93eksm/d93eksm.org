All right, now it gets more interesting.

I'm going to take chaos theory as true for the purposes of this solution. My basic plan is to drive as far as I can in 8 hours, then about two hours after the loops start use Random.org to choose a random direction to go. Their random numbers are chosen based on fluctuations in radio waves, which are sufficiently chaotic that different actions by the looper should result in different directions for me to go.

Now he can't find me. I erase all traces of myself online, ditch this phone, and start somewhere else. The primary advantage of this strategy is forcing him to find me somewhere new in each loop.
