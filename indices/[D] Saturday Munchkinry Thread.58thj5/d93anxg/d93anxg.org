Reverse munchkin:

It is currently 11:00PM. Suppose that you are told that tomorrow, at 7:00 AM, someone will gain the ability to go back in time, Groundhog's Day style, every time they die, and that this ability cannot only be activated by dying. This time looping power will send them back to their "checkpoint", the moment they first gained the power.(ie. 7:00 AM tomorrow.) They will also be fully aware of their power and how to use it. Their goal is to kill you at least 10 times out of 100 years of subjective loop time, or else the god that granted them their power will devour their soul. If they succeed, then the moment of your death will become their new "checkpoint", and they will be able to use their power forever without any restrictions. Basically, they're on a time limit, ironically enough.

You, of course, will not be able to remember any of their previous time loops if they use their power. Your only advantages are:

1: You know how their power works, and when they will get it. This information was given to you by a separate god. The only other advantage this god has or will give you is 10 hours' worth of rest concentrated into a single moment, which instantly refreshes your mind so that you can prepare properly.

2: They start the loops unaware that you know this information. This means that they will start the loops unaware that you are aware of their ability and their desire to kill you. This means that they will likely underestimate you in earlier loops, but less so in later loops.(assuming, of course, that they haven't tortured the info out of you in a previous loop yet, which is always a possibility. Keep in mind that the more experienced they seem, the more loops they have likely lived through, and the more likely it is that this has already happened.)

Your goal is to, of course, convince them to rebel against their god, and/or survive for 100 years worth of time looping. You have 8 hours to cook up as many anti-timelooper protocols of engagement, plans, contingencies, and preparations for yourself before they gain their power.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that you always start every loop unaware of how many previous loops have occurred, what happened in those loops, etc. Only your opponent is aware of this info, and that if you want to find out, you must come up with a plan to get them to truthfully tell you the information while simultaneously accounting for the possibility of them already knowing about your plan due to you executing it in a previous loop. This basically applies to any and all plans you come up with. Also keep in mind that they're limited by the amount of total time they spend looping,(100 years) not the number of times that they loop, so there's no advantage to them living out each loop to the maximum possible duration.
