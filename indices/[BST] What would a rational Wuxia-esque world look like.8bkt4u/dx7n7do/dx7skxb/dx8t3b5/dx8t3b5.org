  The entire arc of a rational protagonist could be finding the one skill with the potential to carry someone to godhood that doesn't already have a god enforcing a limit on it, and then racing to be the first one to ascend with it.

The plot of RMJI is exactly this. The protagonist finds an exploit and spends most of the story trying to conceal it and build up as fast as possible while avoiding attention.
