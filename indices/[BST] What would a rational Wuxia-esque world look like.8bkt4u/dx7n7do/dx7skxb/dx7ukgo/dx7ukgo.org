  The entire arc of a rational protagonist could be finding the one skill with the potential to carry someone to godhood that doesn't already have a god enforcing a limit on it, and then racing to be the first one to ascend with it.

The story could be a modern-day Xianxia where the civilization incorporates technology into a cultivation society (kinda like magitech) and the protagonist is striving to be the first to develop a skill relating to some newly developed technology such as computers.
