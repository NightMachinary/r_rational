Thanks! To be honest I threw this post together from vague recollections of martial arts films I watched growing up and a few musings on shonen anime, so I was just kind of hoping 'wuxia' was the right term to use. I'm definitely going to check out some Xianxia, because there's probably somebody whose already had my ideas and written a movie about them :)

Also that story was wonderful, and full of plenty of ideas to think about; if there were Arts like that in a Xianxia world, that could put Nations centuries behind their counterparts, with almost no hope of catching up quick enough to actually compete. The international state of affairs would be to rush to find something you can do better than anybody else and specialize, because it would be impossibel to ever beat another nation at their own game.

Rubber-banding would add a similar limit to self-cultivation as well; the limit of power would be the human life span, and as such those who best cultivated longetivity would have the best chance of being strongest (unless cultivating longevity is so time-consuming it detracts exponentially from your ability to cultivate other traits, like strength or speed).

I especially like the idea of Gods just being especially powerful cultivators. It really hints at the whole 'no-limits' thing that I love about the idea of infinite perfectibility.

It could even fit the idea of many polytheistic religions; that there are different gods for different things, because different cultivators brought different skills to divine levels and then closed the door behind them. Hermes became the fastest man alive and then made sure nobody could follow in his footsteps. Hercules became incredibly, ridiculously strong, and so ascended to godhood as well. Becoming a god could be all about speed grinding a specialty until you break some divine limit that lets you properly develop other godly attributes (e.g becoming so strong and tough that even time can't wear your body down, allowing you to exceed the lifespan limit and keep cultivating).

The entire arc of a rational protagonist could be finding the one skill with the potential to carry someone to godhood that doesn't already have a god enforcing a limit on it, and then racing to be the first one to ascend with it.
