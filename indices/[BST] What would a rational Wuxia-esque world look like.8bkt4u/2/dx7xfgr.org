I think that your question is phrased wrong... or there is some problems with it. Wuxia is not a fantasy world... it exists in a parallel world where people from our world, who have regular jobs and everything, also have this extraordinary side.

Wuxia is, by definition, over-the-top melodramatic. It is always about characters who are laughably, unrealistically perfectionistic and prideful... unless they are very Buddhist and gain power from their enlightenment. Without that unrealistic melodrama... it's not wuxia. The act of rationalizing this removes the key element of the drama.

Wuxia usually revolves around clan rivalries in which the clans are more concerned about honor than anything else. Frequently the genre takes on other undertone meanings; resistance against the Jin/Yuan(Mongols)/Qing(Manchu); conflict between Orthodox sects (ie Buddhist / Daoist Han people) and Heterodox cults (ie. not Han people, Zorastrian / Animist religions). You make this rational, you just have racism, ethnic cleansing, etc.

As for fighting techniques... most pre-modern settings of wuxia depend on knowledge of the flow of Qi, which can be learned from a book or activated by accident. Fighting technique means nothing if Qi is not sufficient. You make this rational... you just have wushu (kung fu)

Much of modern day wuxia is based off the serialized works of Louis Cha in the 1960s. He borrowed some fantastic elements (the Qi force, fantastic jumps, etc) from Chinese martial arts fantasy from previous eras. But most of what he wrote was heavilly influenced by Alexander Dumas. Reading his books is a lot like reading Three Musketeers, with a Chinese fantasy sheen over it. If you go back to the Three Mustketeers and make that rational... you just have a grim dark historical novel. Which could be very cool. But has nothing to do with the swashbuckling adventure genre of the original books.
