Once you have special techniques and early training, than cultures, civilizations, towns, and families would be driven to specialize. Young children would be pushed to show special potential at a young age. The question of training them if they don't fit the local specialty is important. Do you train them despite skill, get them trained despite knowing they will not keep up, or send them off to someone/somewhere that can fulfill their potential?

Then you have the conflicts between the kingdom of swords, the kingdom of bows, and the kingdom of scribes? Balance of direct vs. indirect power.

In any case, very unstable as power shifts as an elite few act, learn, or get old/ill/defeated.
