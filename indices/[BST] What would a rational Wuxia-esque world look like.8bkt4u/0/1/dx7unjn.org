Wouldn't the meta-logic of the prisoner's dillemna still exist though? You would give mercy to others and so others would give mercy to you, otherwise be crushed entirely.

Perhaps at the highest levels, those people wouldn't want to destroy the surrounding area, and so wouldn't go all out unless forced. They'd also already have the cultural conditioning from when they were younger to at least not be super terrible. People of all ages might really want to avoid destroying stuff, because people need stuff to live (land, shelter, food, friends, etc).

It depends on the power curve, but I can see most monsters being ganged up on. I can also see that in some cultures, Noblesse Oblige might become a pretty big thing as well.

Essentially, I don't think it would necessarily be an 100% hellscape. There are social factors that people live under to prevent complete societal collapse.
