I would say that power levels are more firmly capped in Wuxia; "no limits" is more of a Xianxia thing? In describing such a world, I would definitely draw from Xianxia.

The world is a hellscape of war between all men and against all men, because the logic of the prisoner's dilemma applies in every single interaction; no-one wants to be the one caught with their pants down when someone more powerful comes along and steps on you, which means that everyone is trying "cultivate" and self-improve to become the strongest... and leaving your weaker enemies alive tends to leave them the opportunity to train up and become stronger than you down the line, so there's an incentive to step on the weak.

The reason this world doesn't become a singleton ruled by one of the first cultivators (acting with first-mover advantage) is probably some mixture of:

- Cultivation/training not being applied easily or perfectly to longevity, so that even the most powerful beings eventually die. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/][You can get an asymptotic power curve out of this, where people have to work together across generations to approach immortality, and still struggle to reach it.]]
- Some "rubber-banding" effect, making it easier for the weak to become stronger than it is for the strong to become stronger. This is a major feature of Xianxia, where the stronger you are, the longer and harder you have to "cultivate" for further benefits.
- Alternately, the world /is/ a singleton already, ruled by someone apathetic enough that they only intervene in the world in order to strike down those who get strong enough to be a threat. This is also a Xianxia thing; Gods (who may themselves be powerful cultivators) often impose divine restrictions on how powerful cultivators can become.
