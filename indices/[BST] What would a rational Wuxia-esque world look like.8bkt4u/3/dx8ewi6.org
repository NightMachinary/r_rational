Either a big brother scenario or destroyed. It really depends on the choices of the oldest (and hence strongest) people. If they decide to take over the world, no one can stop them, and they can simply forbid anyone from training and use their super senses to catch anyone that tries. That way you have a bunch of super powerful old people ruling over the rest of humanity and keeping them at human-level power.

If they don't do so, the outcome is actually worse. Countless people with unlimited growth in power? Eventually some omnicidal nut will use his strength to punch the planet, breaking it apart and killing everyone. Except for the few ridiculously old people who have gotten so powerful they don't need air/food/water and can survive the horrible vacuum of space and the extreme temperatures resulting from flying into or away from the sun.
