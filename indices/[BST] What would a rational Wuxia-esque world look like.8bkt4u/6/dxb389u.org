.... Much less conflict prone than most vuxia settings? A high level cultivator is a formidable combatant, but also an insane investment of time and resources, and conflicts between cultivators would be just throwing that away, so on a society level, the nation that manages to have the most people cultivating effectively and the least internal strife wins.

I.. would kind of expect the end states to be really, really strange. I mean, for example, why would a society of immortal cultivators have children at all? Either they do not, or there is some expansionist quasi-pyramid scheme going on..
