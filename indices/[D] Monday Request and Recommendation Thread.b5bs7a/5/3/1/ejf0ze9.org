Second it. It's a very rare beast called "a good mind games anime." I can think of maybe two other shows that are even remotely close to /Yakusoku no Neverland/ in terms of writing believable clever characters and unique challenges for them.

Also, yes, one should go into it as blind as possible.

NB: Anime cuts off /all/ of the inner monologue which is omnipresent in the manga. While this decision is good from the "show, don't tell" standpoint, it has its disadvantages. I highly recommend reading manga after finishing the anime (when it finishes airing, that is).
