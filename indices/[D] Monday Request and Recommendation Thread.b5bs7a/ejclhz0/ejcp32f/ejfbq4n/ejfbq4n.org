You're missing a key point that the whole thing is stilted by Mob's perception of values and goals. The whole point of ESP not making you a better person could be substituted with any exceedingly high natural talent. You could be a literal math prodigy or a body building monster, it's not what gives you your worth. It's your ability to communicate how you feel and reach out to others that makes you feel less lonely and brings you real happiness.

The espers are never satisfied with what they have because there wasn't really all that much work put into achieving it. They don't get the satisfaction of having hard work paying off, which creates this dissonance in them. They hyper focus on one thing and that makes them incapable of empathizing with others. Mob's whole journey is to be able to relate to others despite his overwhelming talent which could naturally isolate him from everyone around him. But he pushes past that to focus on bettering himself in areas he is bad at. He WANTS to be better at things like socializing and even though he is initially terrible at it he doesn't shy away from his failures like the other espers do. THAT is the whole focus of the show, around which everything else is predicated. The minute you ignore that is the minute you lose track of why things are happening and nothing makes sense anymore.

The whole point of the show is a kid with social anxiety pushing himself to succeed despite the fact that he's terrified of other people making fun of him for failing. The point of the Body Improvement Club is to show others that you can be humble and magnamimous in your success and there are people out there that WILL be genuinely invested in you bettering yourself. ONE took inspiration from real life gym friends and experiences to create the Body Improvement Club.

Edit: I feel like I didn't address your point specifically enough. The difference between the BIC and the other espers is that they don't let their success in one aspect which they are naturally gifted stifle them elsewhere in life. This isn't covered as much in the show but in the manga they all have fulfilling goals they want to achieve in high school and are all working hard to meet those goals head on. They don't rest on their laurels, they use them for further motivation to succeed.

The whole point of the show is to show Mob that he CAN use his powers to benefit himself and others in a way that isnt self destructive or narcissistic. There's no need for a positive psychic role model because he already has Reigen advising him.

Furthermore many of the enemies Mob has faced have turned their lives around and became decent people using their powers for good.
