I kind of hope this sort of pairing happens more often. You take two people, each of which has one really good talent, but each lacking another component. Individually, they could each create decent works, but those works would have flaws due to the talents they lack. Together they can combine their talents and make something amazing that has great art and writing.

I hope that people hear of their story and pair up with people to overcome their flaws like this more often, but it requires a degree of humility to recognize what their own flaws are, and enough income to pay for both people to work on a single project, and enough raw talent in each individual person to convince other people that pairing up with them is worthwhile.
