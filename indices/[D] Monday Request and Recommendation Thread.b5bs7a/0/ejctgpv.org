I've been reading random stuff on [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]].

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q6K5WuZVMlAYdohcz19dt0fwOMzabuAzjZLAb1v6yxs/edit#gid=0][They Are Smol]] (link goes to master catalog, They are Smol is the complete first book, Invasion of earth is ongoing prequel, of the rest I highly recommend reading the official oneshots and The Smol Detective, which the orinigal author canonized.) is a really fun universe that's gained a cult following on HFY, and has attracted quite a few fanfics. The general story is, humanity made first contact. The other three races have huge empires with trillions of citizens, thousands of worlds, and to top it off, they're all much larger than humans. After accidentally invading Atlanta (long story), they've been doing their best to keep humanity from collapsing, and getting humanity integrated into their society. Also, all the alien species find humanity adorable. The series is hilarious, and definitely worth trying out.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7oulr8/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_1/][HEL jumper]]'s a decent WAFFy story about a guy stranded on alien planet getting a catgirl waifu, but there's a huge amount of worldbuilding and sidecharacter arcs to make it good. It's really, really slow though in terms of pacing, so it's not for people who don't have the patience for a lot of character growth arcs.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/][This Has Not Gone Well]] is a fun story loosely based on things from the GURPS game system. It's heavily inspired by HPMOR's general idea of using cleverness and the power of science to make magic better. I'm not completely sold on the second book since it feels like a setting reset to keep the MC out of the political arena, but the first one was absolutely golden and up there along Mother of Learning and Schooled in Magic.

*Books*

Last month I caught up on the book series [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/161822-earthcent-ambassador][Earthcent Ambassador aka Union Station]]. It's a great series of light adventures set on a space station. Each adventure is fairly well contained, but over the course of the 20 novels the main character gets married, has two kids, and matures into the role of an experience ambassador, and there's a satisfying cast spread with quite a few side character arcs. There's also a strong amount of creative worldbuilding that's always around, but never drowns out the action.

I've been on a kick of Urban Fantasy novels with a mundane protagonist, purely out of coincidence. [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/230305][Guild Codex: Spellbound]] has a mundane woman end up as a bartender for a magical guild, and ends up making friends and gets involved in the magical world far more than is legal or wise. It's light hearted and not really dark at all even with the informed ruthlessness of some characters. There's a minor bit of romance, but it's not a driving factor in the stories.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/44055][Ester Diamond]] feels a lot like the Doctor Who and mundane companion in an urban fantasy setup, with the main character being the mundane companion like with Sherlock Holmes. This series is more rigidly a murder mystery series, so is darker in places. There's some romance drama in the main plot, but it's not a constant thing.

I just finished the first book in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/227285-magebreakers][Magebreakers]], The Flaw in All Magic, and it's probably the closest thing I've seen to a rational protagonist in published fantasy. Tane was a magical genius who was expelled by the university of magical technology after it came out that he didn't actually have any magical ability of his own. He made up for this by learning the spells anyway, and basically cheating the system with artifacts. Just because he can't cast spells doesn't mean he could design them, or take advantage of The Flaw In All Magic, that it was all written by mages, and mages aren't perfect. The first book was an awesome read, a bit magical heist, a bit magical mystery with a white hat hacker protagonist, and I'm hype for book two and three.

*shows*

Finished up Reincarnated as a slime. It's got a dumb title and the Main Character is stupidly OP, but it was a fun ride and I'm excited for season two, simply because it's got a powerful heart. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsJ4aguEcNk][This guy]] did a great coverage of how it's a rare gem in the isekai genre, and that's the video that convinced me to give it a try.

Love, Death, and Robots was great for the most part. It had a few episodes that felt like mostly pointless demo reels, but I enjoyed most of the episodes.
