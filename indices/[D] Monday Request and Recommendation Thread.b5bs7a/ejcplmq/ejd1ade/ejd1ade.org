It's interesting for the mindfuck potential, but I think the idea fails from a literary perspective. We as the reader /know/ the world we live in right now is real - the main character just /happening/ to hallucinate the exact reality we live in, to a degree good enough to convince us in the first place, is too much of a coincidence to believe. It's the advanced version of some alternate history Earth happening to evolve English, independent of the original - only in the case of dream-skewering, it's been uplifted from "plot convenience" to "a huge, integral part of the story".
