Oh, but it doesn't /have/ to be a pure coincidence. In a world with complex magic, it shouldn't be too SoD-breaking to introduce, let's say, a Cursed Crystal Ball of Alternate Possible Worlds which uses dark magic divination (or whatever) to rewrite people's minds with fake memories.

And, if we broaden our requirements a little, even the Earth /itself/ doesn't really need to be fake, just the protagonist's memories of it. That also could make for a couple of convincing scenarios.
