I mean it has been several chapters and she has only released the bees on one person. Seems like she actually toned it down, possibly due to lack of opportunity and a shortage of bees. I would agree she has a different tone than in canon and is more overtly threatening/manipulative but pretty sure she was already as ruthless as it gets. It is low on chapters, but it is being updated very quickly.
