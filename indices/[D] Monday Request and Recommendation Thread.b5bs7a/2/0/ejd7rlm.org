[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/manmagnificent.359488/][ManMagnificent]] recently started a fic called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/][Aspect]], which crosses over HP, Worm, Pact, and Twig. The whole point of him writing the fic is to get the voices and personalities of the characters right.

#+begin_quote
  Elevator Pitch: Protagonists from the HP, Worm, Pact and Twig are flung back into child bodies a few months before their first year at Hogwarts. There's more going on, other facets (this might have been a good title, but I'm already sold on aspects), but those are better explored in story.

When he says other facets, he means how some elements from each of Wildbow's fics got half fused into this AU. Yet, it still feels like Harry Potter, but also like Worm, and Pact, and Twig.

I mention it because it's an active HP/Worm cross, but I feel like Taylor's character is very accurate. More so than A Wand for Skitter, anyway (though I do really like that fic too).

I'd also recommend all of ManMagnificent's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/member?user_id=359488&content=thread][other fics]], especially [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/reprieve-mcu-worm.646409/][Reprieve]] (MCU/Worm), and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cycle-eternal-naruto-worm.660329/][Cycle Eternal]] (Naruto/Worm).

Edit: Fixed "other fics" link.
