Having read A Wand For Skitter, and another one of ShayneT's older stories, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] I can tell you that his style gets predictable very fast.

Redeeming qualities:

1. He doesn't seem as ardent about bashing as most people are, nor as beholden to fanon.
2. His "gritty" take on the setting makes the antagonists properly threatening.
3. He only has the occasional spelling/grammar error.

Cons:

1. Despite being /more/ even handed than usual, he still doesn't really give Dumbledore or Ron a fair shake.
2. He has a habit of making the world gritty, but he forgets to make any other adults or students smarter to compensate.
3. His habit of sorting people into Slytherin is about as endearing as Slytherin itself, and it was a stale plot idea long before he got to it.
4. Reading twenty straight chapters where Harry spends the /avoids/ making friends because of paranoia isn't very fun.
5. On a similar note, he doesn't understand how to write relaxing scenes, or scenes where anything funnier than a minor gag happens.

He's a decent fanfiction author. Not decent enough to have had an idea I would consider original, but decent enough that I don't feel slimy reading his story. The most remarkable thing about his writing is how he managed to sort Harry into Slytherin, but avoid most of the things that make Dark!Harry fucking intolerable, like when the author bashes characters, or when they are so busy trashing on the heroes of the original story they forget about Voldemort. Still, when you sort Harry into Slytherin and take away the edginess, what you get is a boring, humorless mess - in a setting that was designed for satire, comedy, and adventure.

So far, A Wand For Skitter seems like more of the same. I read post-Gold Morning /Worm/ fanfiction for the sake of watching a character that I like heal and grow into a better person. If I wanted to read Taylor going into a downward spiral through some violent and unpredictable scenario, I would read canon, or one of the many crossovers with which a gritty attitude makes the setting more interesting. (A setting needs to be designed, or at least redesigned, for the purpose it is used for. Shayne doesn't do this enough, and neither do most HP authors.) Taylor's self-serving attitude is at odds with her characterization in literally all of the original Worm. When she was ruthless, she was either doing it out of a misguided sense of altruism, or for the sake of her friends. The "what does this spell do" followed by "can I weaponize it" thought process is not only trite, it's also a complete mischaracterization. Taylor is the queen of Mundane Utility - she uses her bugs to flip light switches and kill mosquitoes.
