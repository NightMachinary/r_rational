It's definitely true that Taylor weaponizes everything, but she doesn't literally think "can I weaponize this" as she does. She also wouldn't feel the need to announce the fact that she can weaponize something to a potential enemy, both because she doesn't think of herself that way and because it would put her at a strategic disadvantage.
