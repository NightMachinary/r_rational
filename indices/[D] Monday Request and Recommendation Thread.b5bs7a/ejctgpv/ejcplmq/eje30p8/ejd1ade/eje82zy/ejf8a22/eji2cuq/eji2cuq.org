The backstory of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22547/accidental-dungeon][Accidental dungeon]] has aspects of this, although the Earth memories aren't depicted as fictional. The main character began life as a normal native of a fantasy world, but slowly recovered memories of a past life as a consequence of ascending to the Immortal tier of the world's cultivation magic system. He just happened to be a reborn scientist from earth, so his memories included a lot of exploitable knowledge.
