  Where is she being ruthless to be ruthless here?

It's the little things. Threatening Snape with a knife well after he established that he was non-hostile. The constant skepticism about stations of canon, like the Hogwarts Express and Sorting Hat, up to and including /inventing/ reasons for her skepticism to be right all along. (The trace being applied on the Hogwarts Express is fanon. Monitoring magic doesn't need to be cast on a person in order to monitor them, see: Voldemort making his name Taboo.) And yes, inventing ways to hurt people with common spells. I get that fanon has a tendency to make Taylor look perfect in retrospect, but that's not what I'm saying. Canon Taylor was creative with the resources she had /universally/. She wouldn't /just/ use her bugs for combat, or to hurt people. She'd find ways to blind, disable, eavesdrop and mislead. Or she'd use them to communicate. In this story, she considers escalating to lethal force several times in her internal monologue, when in canon it was always an exceptional circumstance that forced her into that sort of thing.

  Yet if I was a criminal mastermind, I wouldn't trust anyone who wouldn't let me read their mind. I'd insist on it, even if I had to force them at weapon point.

  Or I'd just kill them.

That's the kind of thought I wouldn't expect Taylor to have in a million years - she /was/ a criminal mastermind, yet the only ground rules she gave her minions was to not be dickwads. Even the minions that violated those rules and held her at gunpoint only got chased off.
