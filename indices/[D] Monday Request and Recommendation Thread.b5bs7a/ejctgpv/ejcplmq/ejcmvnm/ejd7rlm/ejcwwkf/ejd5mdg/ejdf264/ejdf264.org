Authors can definitely have a habit or be better at writing some things than others. Still maybe let them write the new story before judging it on a past story? None of your criticisms seem to apply to the current story except the sorting which is a style choice and was the latest chapter so nothing has happened with it yet. Its been a year since they wrote the last fic and it has a different main character. Having read only the new one I thought it was pretty good so far. In this story she was being ruthless either to defend herself from people literally hunting her down or for protection of the other students who would be attacked. Where is she being ruthless to be ruthless here?

Also if I could sum up Taylor's combat strategy "Can I weaponize it" is a perfect fit. I could name 100 examples of her weaponizing absolutely everything. Meanwhile I don't want to start an argument in this thread about whether fanon whitewashes Taylor but in canon she was a terrifying person who did some terrible things. The right things for all the wrong reasons. She seems justified and always has no choice but to do them because the point of view we see is hers.
