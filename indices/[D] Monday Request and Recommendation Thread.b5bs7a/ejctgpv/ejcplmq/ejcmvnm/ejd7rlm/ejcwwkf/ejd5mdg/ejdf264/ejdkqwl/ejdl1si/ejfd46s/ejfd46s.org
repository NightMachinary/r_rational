This Taylor went straight from being shot by Contessa (and the alienation from humanity she was experiencing at that moment) to the alley. The removal of QA from her brain might be the only reason she's even appreciably human right now, and she's way more traumatized now than she ever was in canon, even if she doesn't realize it. I think even more paranoia than usual makes some sense.
