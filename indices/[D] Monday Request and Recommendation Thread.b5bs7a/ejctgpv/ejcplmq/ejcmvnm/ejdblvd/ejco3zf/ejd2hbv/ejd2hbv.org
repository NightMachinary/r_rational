I'm currently writing a Worm fanfic where the main character suffers from pretty severe depression and anxiety, it's called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/donjon-worm-oc-seattle.734914/][Donjon]]. She gets the power to reshape her environment and has to learn to survive as a hero in Seattle.
