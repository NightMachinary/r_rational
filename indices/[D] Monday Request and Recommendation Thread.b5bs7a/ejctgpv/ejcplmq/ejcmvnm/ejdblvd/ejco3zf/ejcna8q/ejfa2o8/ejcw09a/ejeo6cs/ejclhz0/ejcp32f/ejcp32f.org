I love Mob Psycho for its amazing animations, charismatic characters, and the whole playing around with the usual tropes.

I'm kinda on the fence about the central theme of the story, though. The whole 'supernatural ability doesn't make you superior to other people' is a good moral lesson, sure, but it's taken to an unhealthy extreme in the show, with people acting as if being a talented ESPer /literally/ doesn't matter and psychic powers shouldn't be used for your own gain even if they don't hurt anyone. Which is even more confusing when they directly compare supernatural abilities to mudane abilities, like athletic predisposition, and then applaud the Body Improvement Club for it or Mob for training his body, while criticising other characters for being proud of their psychic abilities and/or focusing on them.

Still, this whole contradiction is subtle enough that it might be just a quirk of translation, the author unintentionally being a little careless with writing, or just me reading too deep into things.

(I did see similar sentiments on 4chan during the Mogami Arc, though.)
