  To be honest, I have generally very little respect for Japanese writing

Kind of a shallow thing to say imo. Most of the popular japanese media that get translated into english are for young adult audience, or are otherwise based more on popularity than critical acclaim. I wouldn't judge the whole of american cinema based on superhero movies, or writing based on whatever YA novel of the day is popular.
