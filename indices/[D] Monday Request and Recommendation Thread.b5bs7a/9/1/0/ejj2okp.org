You're right, I should have written specifically 'TV anime, manga and light novels'.

Thinking a bit about it, my impression is that it's mostly the fault of the of the manga/light novel industry. Because the market is so saturated and the margins are so small, most mangakas are great artists (they need to be, to get a shot) who have to write their own stories, which they are almost invariably bad at. They then have to resort to all the tired, overdone, but popular tropes. Basically all mangas tend to be high concept premises, which are then either extremely mass or extremely niche appeal. Since most anime is adapted from manga the bad writing is also reflected there.

ONE, who created One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100, is a shitty artist and an excellent writer whose works are both clever subversions of the most cliche'd anime tropes. From what I can see this dynamic of great writer/shitty artist is non-existent otherwise. Even mediocre artist/great writer is very rare. The only reason he was able to stand out enough to get his works adapted is because he has a very popular webcomic, which caught the attention of an amazing artist, Yusuke Murata, who translated his scribblings to "proper manga quality".
