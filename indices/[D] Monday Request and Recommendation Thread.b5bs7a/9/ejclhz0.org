Second season of 'Mob Psycho 100' is almost done. This is the first anime since maybe Full Metal Alchemist where I fully appreciate the characterization and the storytelling. To be honest, I have generally very little respect for +Japanese+ anime/manga/light novel writing, but this series is fantastic in every way. No fan service or cliches, lots of kickass, movie quality art and action sequences, and the whole thing is a very clever subversion of the typical shounen anime, while still being itself a good rendition of a shounen.

I wouldn't say it's a rational world, but the characters and story are somewhat rational.
