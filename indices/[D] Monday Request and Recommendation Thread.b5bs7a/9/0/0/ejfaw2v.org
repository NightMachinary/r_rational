I don't feel the same way about this. Mob's progression in the story seems to be in large part about him realizing that it's OK not to be scared of his powers, and that there are ways to use them to help people that he's uniquely capable of doing. The complete lack of munchkinism is more down to the allegorical nature of psychic powers.
