Try [[https://www.crunchyroll.com/log-horizon][Log Horizon]]. Easily my favorite isekai because it's not just one ultra special person or a small group of special people getting transported to another dimension. Rather, thousands of people across every continent get dropped into their video game avatars. So the story focuses not just on the conflicts endemic to characters in an MMO world, but also inter-player politicking.

It's also fairly rational for an isekai anime.
