Hunter x Hunter is a great shounen with the MCs getting stronger over time and lots of action.

Mob Psycho 100 is similar to One Punch Man, with an extremely powerful protagonist who's a bit odd. Made by the same author. It's a bit more serious though and has school life B plots.

Code Geass is a great anime about a world where America(called Brittania for some reason) has a monarchy and used mechas to conquer the world. The story's about an exiled heir secretly leading a rebellion in Japan.
