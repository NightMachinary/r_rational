Yep, that is, as posted already, The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures, by Siren Tycho (and pet), you can find it at sadehall dot tumblr dot com.

More insider stuff: Yeah, it started as a slow burn rational-fic, but got banned from [[/r/rational]] for having too much sex and not enough plot. The author went on to explore a whole bunch of their own personal stuff while still staying geeky about it.

There are rules, but it was pretty hard to figure out if you weren't following the thread on questionablequesting.
