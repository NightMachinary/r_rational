A bit ago I was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41jwrv/bstrthf_name_for_the_new_novel/][asking for help coming up with a name]] for my new project. Well, the blue ribbon goes to [[/u/JackStargazer]] for his suggestion, "The Tinker's Daughter".

I waffled between "Daughter" and "Children", and I'm still not 100% sure; it might change when it goes for publication. For now, however, I hope you enjoy the story!
