Great questions; thank you for proposing them.

  Hmm. The source of mana is intriguing, but leaves open large questions and huge ramifications.

  For example, the main character's entire future has been cut down. Who, mechanically, would reap that? Or, would it go unclaimed?

There's a time horizon on mana income. The farther in the future the big changes are, the less you get from them. There was a worldline where Peter survived and therefore Jess grew up to become a Great Mage who touched the lines of millions of people. Cutting that line off doesn't yield much, because those changes were so far in the future.

The immediate answer, though, is "the person who set the fire."

  It also seems a way to probe the future. Gambling with picked numbers, for example - if I win, I have a great many more world-lines. Does that mean that I can determine which numbers to pick by seeing which world-lines have the most mana to give up?

There's no way to directly see the amount of mana that a worldline would yield. For that matter, you don't know what the worldlines in front of you are -- there are only a handful of people in the world who can directly perceive worldlines, and they're all crazy. Combine this lack of knowledge with the time delay on receiving the mana and the time-horizon discounting and divination by mana received isn't really doable.

  There's also an interesting thing that happens when a mage is paid marks, as it would seem like it also pays them mana. Harvesting mana itself would seem to open new world-lines, although that can be explained easily by the mechanics of mana, magic, and the harvesting process.

True, getting paid money increases your worldlines by a marginal amount, but it's purely nominal unless the amount of money represents an orders-of-magnitude change in your circumstances.
