Hmm. The source of mana is intriguing, but leaves open large questions and huge ramifications.

For example, the main character's entire future has been cut down. Who, mechanically, would reap that? Or, would it go unclaimed? Or do you do a different kind of ritual that sacrifices the possible futures? Seems like there's a clear set of operations that do cut off world-lines (mixing things together, death), but another set that narratively cover that but would not do so physically - making enemies out of friends, for instance.

It also seems a way to probe the future. Gambling with picked numbers, for example - if I win, I have a great many more world-lines. Does that mean that I can determine which numbers to pick by seeing which world-lines have the most mana to give up?

There's also an interesting thing that happens when a mage is paid marks, as it would seem like it also pays them mana. Harvesting mana itself would seem to open new world-lines, although that can be explained easily by the mechanics of mana, magic, and the harvesting process.
