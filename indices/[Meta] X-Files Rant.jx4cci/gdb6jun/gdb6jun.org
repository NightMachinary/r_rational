There's always a lot assumptions about the culture of aliens in these kinds of posts. Why are we assuming literally anything about their culture? We can't make any assumptions about their goals or methodological biases/preferences. Perhaps their goal with abductions of other beings is to test new genetic modifications that will permit them to adjust their own species less dangerously. Perhaps there are only dozens of them alive after a catastrophe and they need to figure out how to breed with other species. Perhaps they want to use the genetic sequencing of human subjects to run through a machine to produce a unique scent or light show for their entertainment. Perhaps they have a taboo against direct, provable violence but idealize subtle intrigues. Perhaps they want to create a sustainable human centipede. Perhaps they are a hive mind and don't understand the idea of a drone having individual value, dismissing their abductions as mere rudeness. Perhaps they televise the galaxy games, where abductees from across the galaxy are forced to compete for their amusement. Perhaps they believe their perceptions are a simulation, and don't take things seriously because they don't matter. Perhaps there are vast interstellar empires, and their activities have to be kept secret to avoid reprisals from other species.

Any one of these options explains their behavior to some extent. You're making the large assumption that they are conquerors when their activities are contrary to that assumption.
