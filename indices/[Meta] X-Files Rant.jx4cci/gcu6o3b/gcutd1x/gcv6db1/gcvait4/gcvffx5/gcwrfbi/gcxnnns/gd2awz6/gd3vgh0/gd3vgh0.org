  So there's several issues here. First of all, "solving" the three body problem isn't useful for a chaotic system, which is what's described. Second of all, a chaotic orbit ends in a sun, no questions asked, because the position of their planet is essentially random and in only a few orbits it'll either be ejected at escape velocity or it'll crash. Even with the massive three body system of the sun, Jupiter and Saturn there's nothing (big) playing solar system tourist between them, everything''s settled into nice stable resonant orbits. But whatever, the aliens live in a harsh environment and they're too fascist to transition to a nicer place and solve their problems. My issue is that the main character is supposedly super smart and not in a cult, but when told about the three body problem he's completely unaware of how pointless trying to solve it is because of the problems fundamental properties. Chaotic systems can't be solved and it's incredibly easy to solve the problem well enough. The cult is pointless and the aliens can't be reasoned with. As soon as "three body problem" was said and he checked Wikipedia half the book of him being stupid and confused could have been cut out, and we could focus on the authors strong points of prose, narrative, character, commentary, and emotion. ! <
