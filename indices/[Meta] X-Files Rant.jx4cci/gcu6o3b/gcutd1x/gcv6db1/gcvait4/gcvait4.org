  Did you read the whole trilogy because it's hard for me to see how you could not understand why people like it.

I DNFed half-way through the first book. So maybe it gets better. My main problem is that it is hard-sf in the sense that it does not have engaging characters/character arcs ("space opera"). If those were good I probably wouldn't look so much for plot holes...

As for the plot holes (only w.r.t. topic):

- The aliens are able to send a super-computer that can somehow project a virtual reality game/hallucinations into peoples brains. Those are already there.
- The aliens/super-computers are (already) able to disrupt physics experiments (which makes scientists kill themselves because they get random results ?!?).
- As OP mentioned a generation ship is a already huge accomplishment, not to mention surviving the extreme system (but in reality Alpha Centauri is just a binary predicatable star system so even the title is a plot hole)
