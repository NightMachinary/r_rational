I used to hate this /so much/ when I was younger, and it was one of the big reasons I preferred anime over American TV. But now that I am older and know more about the constraints TV writers operate under, I understand why they did it that way and realize that there are some advantages to episodic storytelling over serialized story arcs.

One is that, as you said, it wasn't possible to catch up on missing episodes until re-runs circled back around to the same spot. Streaming didn't exist, neither did DVD season sets, and VHS was highly impractical for TV shows as opposed to movies (a 1-hour drama could fit 2 episodes per tape, so you would need a bookshelf to hold something like the complete /Star Trek: The Next Generation/, which [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Trek-Next-Generation-VHS-Bundle-Complete-Set-89-Cassettes-/224217650673][weighted in at *89* tapes]], not to mention how expensive all those tapes would be). The way anime dealt with this (tons of flashbacks and the occasional recap episode) left much to be desired.

But there were other reasons, too. A big one is that American TV writers, as a rule, never knew if they are going to get another season or not. /Babylon 5/ fell prey to this; the original plan called for five seasons, then it looked like the fourth season would be their last so they had to cram two seasons' worth of content into one, and /then/ it turned out that they would get a fifth season after all and they had to make something up even though they had already finished the story. This made long-term planning difficult, to say the least. Not to mention wasteful... why bother writing out plans for a season that might never exist? So TV writers' incentive is to pour all their effort into the current season and to worry about the next season only if and when it is confirmed they will get one. This led to shows like /The X-Files/ and /Lost/ where the writers were just making shit up as they went along with no grand plan, which in turn made an unsatisfying conclusion all but guaranteed.

And speaking of unsatisfying conclusions, one of the big advantages of episodic storytelling is that a bad ending doesn't mar the rest of the series the way it does with serialized storytelling. Think about /Game of Thrones/, which is legendary for how horrible its final season was. There is no way to start watching /Game of Thrones/ from the beginning and have it end in anything but disaster; either you stop halfway through and get an incomplete story, or you keep going and get to see the greatest show in TV history go down in flames. By contrast, consider /Star Trek: The Original Series/. The third season, derisively known as the "turd season" by fans, is widely considered to be inferior to the other two. But that's OK! You can just pretend that the third season never happened. There are no cliffhangers or unresolved character arcs. It even works on a smaller scale; in an episodic series, you can just ignore any bad episodes, /period/, and it doesn't affect the overall story, because there /is/ no overall story! That's a pretty big advantage.

But, on the other hand, I feel like some of this could have been avoided if American TV makers could just understand the concept of ending a show /before/ it goes downhill. Both [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime][the Japanese]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity][the British]] had no trouble with this notion. Americans, by contrast, had a model where a TV show should be squeezed for as long as possible, getting renewed for endless seasons until it inevitably jumped the shark and only cancelling it when the ratings got low enough. An American TV show was considered successful in direct proportion to how many seasons it lasted before the executives pulled the plug. That's... not a good way to make art.
