Maybe the scariest plotline in the '90s space combat game /Star Control II/ is the one you pick up as soon as you leave the Sol system and encounter a Slylandro Probe.

The Slylandro are balloon creatures that live in a gas giant. They can't leave their planet since pressure differences would kill them. When they were visited by interstellar traders, they bought a self-replicating, automated, interstellar probe ship; which they sent out to discover other life in the galaxy. The probes malfunctioned; now they attack any sentient life they encounter, eat the debris, and produce more probes ... while periodically emitting, "We come in peace."
