That's the kind of problem with "UFOs visiting us" in general.

I had a [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24754333][bit of a rant]] about that a month ago on Hacker News. A lot of people still "want to believe" that secret alien visitations are possible, apparently.

Any kind of interstellar travel technology (fictional FTL or not) also implies a level of technology that obviates the need to be subtle about an alien invasion. If we're on the non-fictional physics area of possible scenarios, a small self-replicating probe still implies a tech level that would brush aside any resistance our current human civilization could put up. If the aliens are capable of bringing over more mass to our solar system (via fictional FTL or whatever), then the situation tilts further to their favor.

*Edit*: grammar.
