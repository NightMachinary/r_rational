I guess a counterpoint to your criticism is that we don't know what Alien laws and regulations look like (and cultural hangups/taboos and religious obligations, the idea of any society with FTL also being completely united may end up being too idealistic). The aliens involved in the conspiracy could be the equivalent of an Alien-CIA that has to retain some degree of plausible deniability and "hands-off" actions in order to avoid punishment from whatever government is above them. I don't know how that'd mesh up with specific actions in the show, but if I had to do a ratfic of X-files that's the approach I'd take (also because I'm down for taking a shot at the history of the CIA fucking with the politics of foreign nations by having an Alien-CIA doing the same to America).

(Disclaimer, my X-files knowledge comes from several years back when I was multitasking between playing Hearthstone and watching about half the seasons of the show simultaneously so it's pretty mish-mash and outdated. Also kinda on-topic to say I ended up enjoying the show because I was using literally only half my attention lol)
