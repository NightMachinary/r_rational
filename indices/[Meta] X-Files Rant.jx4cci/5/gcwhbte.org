Animorphs has a good solution to this:

1. The invaders are parasites who want physical intact and well-developed human bodies, so a silent invasion is more useful.

2. Spaceships are not that large, and propelling even a single asteroid would take a long-term coordinated effort. A species with hundreds of ships manages to nudge an asteroid's path only once in the series, wiping out the dinosaurs

3. The invaders stole from and were given their technology by the heroic aliens, so their technology outside of FTL is not far beyond human tech.

4. Humans have a higher population than the invaders or any other species by thousands. Between that and #3, an open invasion could well fail. In an alternate timeline it probably does fail.

5. Because of the invaders' internal politics, the silent invasion is considered more successful, and the leader pushing for open war is disregarded, until he uses a show trial to charge the pro-silent invasion leader with treason and have her executed.
