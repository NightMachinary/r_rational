The X-files have a special place in my heart. I sneaked up in the late evening to watch a very few episodes as a kid, but more often I had to lie in bed and just listen to the famous intro music because my parents were watching and didn't let me join. I /really/ liked and still like the early stuff. Vague, mysterious conspiracies and Mulder trying desperately to unearth the truth.

The problem is, that's kinda what the writers were going for. It's not like Breaking Bad, built with clear arcs in mind. The X-files were written a few episodes or at most a season at a time. They had no end game in mind, just added to the lore a little here and a little there. Sometimes different writers wrote things that didn't quite fit together into one coherent plot. That's why toward the end, when they are trying to wrap things up, the different plot lines don't quite line up and you get baddies that seem to have been working against their own stated interests, especially with the different alien factions.

Now. All that said. If you watch the final episode, you will have INCONTROVERTIBLE proof that cancer man is Gandalf. So let that one simmer for a moment. We were actually in Middle Earth all along.
