  The X-files were written a few episodes or at most a season at a time.

Except for /Babylon 5/, pretty much all TV series were this way at the time. The story-arc thing didn't catch on until later; after DVRs, streaming, and piracy made it possible for viewers to catch up on plotlines after missing an episode or two. In the TV/VCR era, the only way to catch up on missed episodes (unless & until they came out in reruns or on tape) was if you or a friend had taped them.
