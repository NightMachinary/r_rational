The "Three body problem" book has kind of the same problem. It gets recommended quite often (including here) and it's one of those things where I do not understand how it can be popular.

X-Files, I can understand, however. I have never seen it, but I guess they wanted a police procedural with a twist and reverse engineered the world building from there? I've learned to never watch those even if the permise seems interesting (such as e.g. "Almost human").
