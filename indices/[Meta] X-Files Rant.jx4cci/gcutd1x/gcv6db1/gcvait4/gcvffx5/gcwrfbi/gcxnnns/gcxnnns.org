Yes, maybe that's the problem. I took courses on how to approximately solve differential equations in university. So I immediately jumped to "it's differential equations without closed form solution (that's what it means with unsolvable, right?). But they can approximate it starting off with Euler's method... once they have computers and good starting boundaries they can probably predict centuries in the future and modify the system using gravity assist etc. to improve livability."

A good writer trick would be to sprinkle in some magic (e.g. quantum fluctuations), but it didn't. That said, all that would be forgivable had it good writing and/or characters. As is, it throws a cool concepts at you which turn out to be hollow once you think about them a bit. And once the cool concepts are hollow, I had nothing left to justify continuing to read it.

The non-developed characters are sometimes justified as "Big problems are solved at the society level. This is how Chinese solve big problems and tell stories (more relevant with COVID-19 now, I guess?). Recommended for the new cultural experience". Except, they took his other story (Wandering earth) and added in unnecessary viewpoint characters when they translated it for the general audience for the big screen.
