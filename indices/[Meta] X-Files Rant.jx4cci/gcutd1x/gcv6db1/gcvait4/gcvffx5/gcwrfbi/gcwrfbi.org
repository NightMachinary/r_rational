Personally speaking I hated the first book and slogged through it in case it addressed some issues, which it almost did.

My issue was that it /completely/ misunderstood the three body problem. Like yes, it's unsolvable, but it can be approximated! You can project the next couple of years! That's all they needed!

This completely ignores the fact that the system as described is physically impossible. Sure, you can arrange a system with those problems, but it's either going to need a period or you're going to crash into the sun or get ejected. Those are your three options. You're not going to get anything else on a geological timescale.

I would be mildly less critical of the story if it didn't make the main character A FUCKING MATHEMATICIAN. Even if he was completely unaware of the three body problem beforehand a simple wikipedia page would have been enough to get him up to speed on how tractable the problem is.

Honestly I kinda get how it got so popular, it's got a great story with real emotional weight and creativity behind it, and it's even smart enough to address some of the issues in it's premise! But the central question of the first book is a mathematical non-issue, and so much fucking narrative weight is placed on a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means in a way that the supposedly intelligent main character should see right through.
