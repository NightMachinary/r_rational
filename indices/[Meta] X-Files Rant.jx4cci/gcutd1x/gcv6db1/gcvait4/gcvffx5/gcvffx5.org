Well if you don't like it you don't like it but it's one of my favourite sci-fi series ever, the second (third?) book especially is one of the best presentations of the fermi paradox and the filters I've ever read. Up there with Culture series.

And I love finding plot holes/contrivances as much as the next rational subscriber, but... you're complaining on one hand about the premises and on the other about motivations that are explained later.

"As OP mentioned a generation ship is a already huge accomplishment, not to mention surviving the extreme system (but in reality Alpha Centauri is just a binary predicatable star system so even the title is a plot hole)"\\
Yes, in our universe Centauri is a binary system but the whole premise of the book is about a trisolar system. Like, if that's a complaint, it's not like you think Liu Cixin didn't know that. There's obviously not going to be any example of this math problem nearby, and to make it far away would certainly undermine the development. Why don't you complain about how unlikely it is for a civilization to develop on the very next system and also be at an almost identical (geologically speaking) age?

  Sophons stuff

I thought it was covered in the first book but maybe the cultural stuff was in the second, but you got mad that the aliens didn't do what you expected to and you never even read the cultural and evolutionary justification for their actions. You're right that the Sophons could obviously have done more after all they destroy the entire human fleet in 2 seconds that humans spent 2 centuries building but I don't recall feeling the explanation to be at all lacking. You gave up and you never read about their reasons?
