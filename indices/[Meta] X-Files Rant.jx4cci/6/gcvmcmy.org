What you wrote is perfectly correct, except we do not know for sure if the aliens operate as the classic UFO-hopping green little men. X-files aliens seem more like the Fair Folk: they simply appear, mess stuff up, and disappear, without any human-understandable logic to it.

Maybe they DO have time-travel atop everything else, and hence why their plan looks so self-contradictory and convoluted. Maybe its the only way they will be are have had conquered the Earth without killing their own Grandfathers in the process.
