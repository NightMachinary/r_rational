I remember right all they did was send a generation ship which we could do anyway and by the time it arrived humanity had advanced beyond them which is perfectly reasonable if you assume a rate of technological development like OTL.

If they sent the spaceship in their tech level of 2050 when we were 2000 (so they are 50 years ahead of us) by the time it got here we'd be at 2200 even with their sabotage.

I'm not sure I remember right but wasn't there also cultural reasons?

Did you read the whole trilogy because it's hard for me to see how you could not understand why people like it.
