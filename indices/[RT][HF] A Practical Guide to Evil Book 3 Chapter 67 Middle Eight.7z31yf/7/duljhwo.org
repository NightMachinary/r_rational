I just realized we missed another opportunity for Cat to break out: Black hasn't used Destroy yet. As I understand it, it's a power that is meant specifically to suppress other people's Aspects, so he can either bait Akua into whatever its range is (I would guess that it's touch-based, but I thought the same about Take, and then Battle of Four Armies and One happened) or, in case they have to sacrifice something and catch Akua off guard, have Catherine Take it.
