Correct me if I'm wrong but it feels like Masego would have warned Catherine of this outcome had he known she intended to use Arcadia as a battlefield? It didn't feel like a Diabolist being suited to Arcadia was intended to be some particularly big secret.

I do hope the answer is not that Catherine didn't run her plan by Masego because if you're preparing to fight a Named mage he would be one of the first people you would run your plans by.
