This doesn't appear relevant though as to whether fighting in Arcadia is a good idea. Catherine though fighting in Arcadia would be to her advantage yet as it turns out Diabolists are suited to such environs and Catherine seemed completely unaware of this even though, presumably, this is knowledge Masego could have given her had they gone over her strategy together, which they should have. This holds regardless of aspect knowledge or usage.
