We all knew that Akua would bind Catherine to her will. Like we all know that Catherine will kill Black. One can hope otherwise but it's not that kind of story.

Now, Akua will reforge Catherine to her liking. Give her purity of purpose, make her a villain in full. And in doing so, create the blade that will kill her, like every villain before her. My only question is: what Name will Catherine get, once she realizes that the only way to end up where she wants to isn't to rise as Malicia or Akua's second but to become Empress herself? Black Knight doesn't suit her at all, it's so last millenium.
