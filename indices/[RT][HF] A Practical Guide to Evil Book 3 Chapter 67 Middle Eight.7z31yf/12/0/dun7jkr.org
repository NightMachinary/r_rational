Killing black is the exact type of story cat repeatedly subverts throughout the story so far.

I'm willing to bet that black is not gone at the end of this fight. Cat kills and raises him, or kills herself in his place and transitions, or thief/robber/warlock/hierophant intervenes, or something else. But black dying now is too heavily foreshadowed to believe. It would be like Chekhov firing his gun.
