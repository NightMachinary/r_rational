I mean, I don't see that as entirely impossible.

Like, Procer has a lot of narrative weight. We are gonna fight them.

But Cat herself muses that while she can go anywhere she wants through Arcadia the fight will be a walkover. There is no way Evil vs. Good comes down to teleportation and burning Good's homeland. So Cat has to lose that fey power before the fight with Procer.

I feel like, in order to escape Diabolist, Cat has to lose or massively curtail her Fey nature, thus becoming a human and not BIND-able. Maybe Black can accomplish that, but it might take Malicia.
