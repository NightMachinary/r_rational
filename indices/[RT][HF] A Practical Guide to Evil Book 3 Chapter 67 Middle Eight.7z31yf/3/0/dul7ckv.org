  I think the question that needs to be asked is; how is Black going to break the shape of the narrative Akua is writing here?

I feel like the narrative is already on Cat's side. Akua even explained why - Squire is half Good and half Bad. It's true that in a villainous Role Cat would be boned right now but is she a Villain at the moment? She's fighting against her nemesis in their evil lair, her mentor captured and her army and all of her Kingdom at risk. It's even shown in the dialogue: Akua is doing the evil monologuing and Cat is talking about love.

The whole thing stinks of a Hero's most desperate moment before divine intervention or some such.
