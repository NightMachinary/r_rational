Interesting. It may be a culture thing, but in my country's folklore it is a thing and an archetype. [[http://www.secret-zagreb.com/zagrebblog//2011/09/black-queen.html][Here]] is a write-up about a legend from the city in which I live.

When this whole "Black Queen" started I thought it was a generaly accepted trope, but after googling a bit I realize it is not a thing in the West.
