Yeah, that's about right. I don't know about squires and knights, but we have seen apprentice (traditionally the potential next Warlock) transition to Hierophant and Heiress (traditionally the potential next Dread Empress) transition to Diabolist. So I think the lines aren't as clear cut as has been implied.

That's my interpretation anyway.
