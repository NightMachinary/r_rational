  how is Black going to break the shape of the narrative Akua is writing here?
#+end_quote

Cat kills him. Cat transitions into the Name of Black Knight. Since her nature as the Duchess of Moonless Nights is tied to her Name, she'll lose her fae powers when she transitions. This also means that she'll no longer be bound by Diabolist.

It would also serve as her defeating the Diabolist's Monster (herself) and the Pivot simultaneously.
