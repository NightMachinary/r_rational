[[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/7z3207/chapter_67_middle_eight/][The discussion in /r/PracticalGuideToEvil has gone very differently.]]

There's been people pointing out that the 'middle eight', in our list of musically themed chapter titles, is the midpoint where things change. It's the breakdown, the bridge, the point where the music goes to a different space for a while in order to create contrast when the familiar section kicks back in.

And others stating that Akua vs. Cat looks like a straight up Villian vs. Hero fight at this point, with Cat as the hero... and there's no way that narrative ends with Akua winning.

I see this as how the 'apprentice kills the master' trope associated with the Black Knight happens. Black treated Cat so well that it would never happen normally, therefore we get mind control bullshit. And that in turn would cause Cat to transition into a new name. Akua already mentioned that a Black Knight with the power of the last of Winter would be significantly harder to deal with.
