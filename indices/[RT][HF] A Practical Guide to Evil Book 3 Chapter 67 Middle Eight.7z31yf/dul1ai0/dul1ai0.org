I think the question that needs to be asked is; how is Black going to break the shape of the narrative Akua is writing here? It would rob too much weight from Catherine's own story for Black to kill Akua himself, and pretty clearly he isn't going to kill Cat. But he's also not really the kind of mentor who'd let his apprentice strike him down in some act of self sacrifice.

I think... Black might need to find some way to have Akua kill him with her own hands. That moment of high emotion could lead to Cat breaking free of Akua's grasp and transitioning, or transitioning and gaining an Aspect that then allows her to escape. It sidesteps the issue of the Calamites, and subverts the usual clich√© of the villain being killed by their own intended replacement.
