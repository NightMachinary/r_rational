Black Queen's probably not an actual Name; it'd be a nickname of someone's actual Name, which would probably have to be something like Queen of Callow - but since her formal title is /vice/-queen of Callow, she can't transition into that Name unless she revokes the "vice" part of "vice-queen", and declares independence from Praes.
