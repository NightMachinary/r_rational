It's got nothing to do with classic anything. I'm arguing that "Black Queen" has about as much flair as a floating turd, by the standard of names.

"Exiled Prince" is stylish. "Tyrant of Helike" has style, as does Dread Empress of Praes or Tyrant of Praes or whatever Malicia's actual name is. Black and White Knight has style, as well as buckets upon buckets of precedence. Adjuntant is also a stylish name.

Black Queen is no such thing, and therefore it is not going to be her name. It doesn't roll off the tongue and invoke a clear archetype the way literally all the other names do.
