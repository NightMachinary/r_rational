Hot damn, 3/4 of a book of Cat having a massive power boost has just paid off for Diabolist.

I like how for all of her plots, Diabolist's backup plan was simply to wait for Cat to use Break and then Claim her freely. Simple but effective.

Plus I guess all of her talk of Cat's morality and the like helped her in Creation's eyes. Slowly attacking Cat at her foundations is probably the shit that the Gods eat up.
