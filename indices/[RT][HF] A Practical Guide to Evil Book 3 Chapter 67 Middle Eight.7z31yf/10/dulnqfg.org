This one seemed rather rushed compared to the previous.

There wasn't much complexity in the fighting and it was fairly straightforward.

If it wasn't for that "Rule of Three" stuff supposedly no longer applying, I'd say Cat was just trying to get this portion over quickly as a 'loss' so she could get to the third and final conflict faster.
