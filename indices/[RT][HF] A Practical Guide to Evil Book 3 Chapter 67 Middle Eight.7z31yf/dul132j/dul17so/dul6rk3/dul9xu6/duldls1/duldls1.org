I'd say Take is more powerful. Fall is a powerboost, but it's a pretty straight powerboost. If opponent had an idea for how to deal with Cat's winter powers Fall doesn't really bring anything qualitatively different to the table-it's just same winter powers, but /more/ of them. Take, on the other hand, gives Cat a new power (great) while permanently taking a power away from the enemy (double great) and thus qualitatively changing the structure of the fight. It's effectively two aspects in one in terms of power.
