So what do people reckon would be the most effective applications -- by the yardstick of saving and improving lives -- of Superman's various powersets (e.g. Golden Age, Silver Age, New 52, etc.) in our world? I wrote a quick FB comment with some thoughts when 80,000 hours posted a [[https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/][career guide thing recently]], which I then tossed into a [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/superman-effective-power-application/][blog post]] for posterity. Earning to give as a celebrity and athlete seemed the best for a relatively weaker Superman (depending on regulations), and stuff involving space (asteroid mining, satellite launching, moon/mars colonization) broadly struck me as best for his middle showings, disregarding his occasional as-the-plot-demands supergenius. His upper levels don't bear much discussion, since they're way too OP. What do y'all think?
