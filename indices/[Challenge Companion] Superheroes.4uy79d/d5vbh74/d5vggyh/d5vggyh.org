I agree on pretty much everything involving space; it's one of those things that only rarely gets touched on in the comics, but represents a huge amount of time and money saved for everyone involved. Last I heard, Elon Musk was targeting $1,000 per pound to put things into orbit. Superman's specific powers vary widely, since he's more of a mythological figure than bound to any one strict continuity, but most of the mid-tier incarnations can carry an oil tanker with some effort. If we figure that he can put 10,000 long tons (DWT of a small tanker) into orbit in a single trip, then that's twenty billion dollars for a single trip that he could probably finish during a coffee break.

There are logistical, engineering, regulatory, and market reasons for this being more complicated than that, but most of those problems can be solved by a team of people skimming 1/10,000 of the money off to deal with them, requiring no need for Superman to do anything but the heavy lifting. There are strong arguments to be made about Superman destroying an industry and stifling innovation in rocketry, but on balance I think it would be better to depend on him. Note that this does not take time away from defending the earth against existential threats, nor does it take appreciable time away from his valuable personal life as Clark Kent.
