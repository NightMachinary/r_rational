There actually is a precedent for this in the comics with his work with Star Labs. I can also see him helping out with engineering projects, including space travel, but he might decline if it meant he wouldn't be able to leave in an emergency. If he was okay with setting aside time for this, he still wouldn't want the space program to become dependent upon him on the off chance he died or lost his powers and left people stranded in space.
