I was thinking something along those lines. Instead of ferrying people to and from orbit, Superman could offer to put stations in orbit that people would travel to and from normally. It would cut down costs on big expensive projects that would increase demand for smaller ones so innovation still proceeds.

Anyone with Superman's level of power would probably be subject to regulations that determine how much and what kind of impact they can have on the economy. The market wants both growth and stability, so that means assuring investors that superpowers can be exploited for profit with little risk.
