Yah, I love reading about clever applications in mundane utility and logistics and stuff, but I dunno that many others would (e.g.s [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TheseLookLikeJobsForTheSuperman][here]], though I feel it's missing a lot in creativity). It's always seemed like the first step for Superman (and most any superhero) should be to hire a crack team of advisers with expertise in economics, health, civil engineering, politics, materials science, etc., that they might provide recommendations on how he'd best to apply his powers (or talent scouts to assemble that team). Though I suppose doing that realistically would require the author to have some expertise in all of those... still, some humility and admission of decision-making fallibility on Superman's part (before he screws everything up with Good Intentions) would be appreciated.

I hadn't really considered negative implications of the collapse of rocketry (or conventional mining, etc.). But I think action on Superman's part it would create far more jobs than it would destroy, and if he's really concerned he could fund his own rocket engineering firm (and hell, it might spurn innovation, given much cheaper access to test conditions or advances in zero-g, vacuum chamber manufacturing. If the limiting factor/sticking point in your rocket science is performance under gravity assist, or communication at long distances, or w/e, Superman can vastly cheapen the process of getting there in the first place). And in any case, I think I'd just write that off as the cost of progress -- windows and light-bulbs put candlemakers out of business but the world was not poorer for it. You wouldn't wan tall out eggs to be in Superman's basket, though, so developing space-faring technologies in parallel to Superman Rocketry Incorporated could well be motivated by that alone.
