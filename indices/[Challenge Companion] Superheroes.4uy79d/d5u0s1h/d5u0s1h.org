I posted this in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4riwlf/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d51iuw8][General Rationality three weeks ago]], but I think it bears repeating for authors who don't understand what superheroes are really about and why it appeals to people.

  The superhero genre is about as irrational as they come. The nearly universal premise is a person discovers they have abilities beyond what a normal person does, so they put on a mask to fight crime and help people as they choose while still living a normal life. In reality, this is not an efficient use of their abilities, nor is it particularly effective at fulfilling their goals on a macro scale.

  However, one thing rational fiction authors need to understand about these genre conventions before they play with them is why they exist. When people see someone notice injustice and use the power they have to fight it, it inspires the audience to do the same. Superheroes are fundamentally just good samaritans, and therein lies the basic reason people get emotionally invested in superhero stories.

  Seemingly a good way to compromise would be for the hero's job to to be helping others, such as a police officer, firefighter, or paramedic. However, this risks denying the central conceit of a heroic protagonist: autonomy. People recognize heroism when the protagonist chooses to help when they don't have to. When you institutionalize heroism, it risks taking the inspiration away.

  I'm not critiquing any story or setting in particular, The Metropolitan Man was most certainly not a superhero story and I thought Worm actually stuck too closely to superhero conventions given the setting. I just think it's important to understand why people like irrational stories before you write rational fiction.

  Note: I have not yet read Strong Female Protagonist.
