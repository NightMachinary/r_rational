I didn't say it was a rational feeling, it might be a bias but I can't know for sure because it's just taste in fiction that I think is popular. I mentioned it because I think it's important for an author to know their audience. I heard comic book fans complain that DC heroes in the New 52 were less interesting because they worked for someone instead of on their own. I know that paramedics are heroic, but I'd rather read about superheroes.
