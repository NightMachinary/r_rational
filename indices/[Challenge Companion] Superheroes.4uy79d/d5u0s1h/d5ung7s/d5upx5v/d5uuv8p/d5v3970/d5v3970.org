My statement about institutions was more about noticing a trend in superhero stories, particularly the ones I enjoy, and theorizing what the cause of it was. It might just be my culture's obsession with individualism, but I tend to not identify characters as moral paragons when they have some obligation to do good. They usually either act on their own or are the leader of an institution.

I brought it up in the original post because I've read stores that fell flat because the author didn't seem to know the difference between writing a story about superheroes and supersoldiers. In the novel Wearing the Cape the heroes are basically just cops who get orders from Dispatch, so whenever they acted like normal superheroes I thought they were bad at their jobs for not following procedure and not being prepared.
