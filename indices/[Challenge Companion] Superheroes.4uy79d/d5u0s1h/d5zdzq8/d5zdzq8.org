  The nearly universal premise is a person discovers they have abilities beyond what a normal person does, so they put on a mask to fight crime and help people as they choose while still living a normal life. In reality, this is not an efficient use of their abilities, nor is it particularly effective at fulfilling their goals on a macro scale.

I disagree though: you forgot about the other half of supersociety, which is villains, who go around using their powers for profit or power. Which is quite understandable.

Heroes' main purpose is not to fight crime per se, but to stop supervillains, who are mostly unique and quite powerful, and are generally unstoppable by conventional, unpowered, standartized and procedure-bound police force.
