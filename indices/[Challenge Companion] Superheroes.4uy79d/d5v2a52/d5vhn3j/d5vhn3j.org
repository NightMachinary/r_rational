Those series operate in a vacuum. The series defines the world and setting, or occurs microcosmically. High school, fantasy world, underground society or subculture, etc. Superhero stories are set on worlds with societal structures or concerns very much like our own and/or take place in integrated mainstream cultural settings. Gotham, Valhalla, the Milky Way, etc.
