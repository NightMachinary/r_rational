  This sounds testable. Tracking the popularity of superhero media and altruism, maybe?

You don't need to test superhero works in particular. In John Haidt's /Happiness Hypothesis/ he makes a similar claim about a phenomenon called "elevation", where people react well to and want to do good after seeing moral paragons do good in a way that's distinct from watching simply very competent people do something nonmoral with skill.
