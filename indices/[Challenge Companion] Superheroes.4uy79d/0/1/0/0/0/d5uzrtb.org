  But are moral paragons necessarily people who are not involved with institutions?

I don't think Haidt really made a distinction, or even focused on fiction. I was speaking generally on the whole "elevation" thing.

I personally don't buy the idea that the effect is diluted by people being in institutions, I also disagreed with the OP on it elsewhere.

I think the lack of institutions in superhero fiction is partly just the weird American individualism shining through; writers almost seem hostile to competent and involved institutions at times since it means there's an alternative to the hero riding solo.
