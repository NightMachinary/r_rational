Just a note that the original fiction work Superpowereds involves a competent superhero institution. Mostly seen through the eyes of the embedded superhero-training academy, but overall it seems to be logically maintained.

I can't think of any others but now I really want a rational PRT or story from the POV of administrator for a similar organization.
