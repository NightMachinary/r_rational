But are moral paragons necessarily people who are not involved with institutions? I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that moral paragons in fiction have a real-world effect on behavior, but the claim being made here seems to be that either we don't consider people moral paragons for joining institutions built around otherwise moral behavior, or not all moral paragons inspire people.
