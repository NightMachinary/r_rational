Many of the most popular Japanese animation series are about people who have unique superpowers, wearing brightly colored distinctive costumes, beating each other up. Yet as superhero stories they're borderline. They're created under the same constraints as superheroes (visual medium, good versus evil, characters have autonomy), but somehow they've managed to all do so in ways that are different from superheroes, whether they technically fit under the definition or not.
