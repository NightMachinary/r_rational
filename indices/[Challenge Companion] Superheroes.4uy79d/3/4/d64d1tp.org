  It's harder to make a story where a teleporter runs a shipping company or stays (mostly) out of the "hero" scene and have it be interesting.

The Jumpers series of novels has this premise to a large extent and is pretty good. Especially the latest which is about using and abusing teleportation powers for space industry and payload launch.
