  It's harder to make a story where a teleporter runs a shipping company

I've been assembling some ideas around something similar for a while (the invention of fixed point-to-point portals as a global monopoly). The conflict basically comes down to there being an awful lot of money invested in the status quo of an awful lot of industries around the world which, in one way or another, rely on charging customers money because some things are far away from other things. Global shipping of all kinds. Travel. Tourism. Commuting. Pipelines. Road and rail. Airlines. Duplication of things (like company outlets, or management hubs) in several locations because "you can't be in two places at once". Support industries, including such players as every oil/fuel company ever. Politicians and governments with histories of using us-them-over-there rhetoric.

That kind of money, influence, and power doesn't tend to like having the rug yanked out from underneath it by someone who won't even explain how they're doing it, and whose technology is proving frustratingly impossible to reverse-engineer, or even make sense of.

A lot of very, very wealthy people are about to become very, very unhappy...
