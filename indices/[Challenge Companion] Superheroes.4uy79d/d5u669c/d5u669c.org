  Having people with special abilities go off to do their own thing unrelated to superheroing seems much more attractive, from my perspective.

I can't think of the last work that actually did something with metahumans that didn't involve other metahumans.

I mean, 'superheroing' is probably justifiable for any short tale, it's the universe around it that's weird, with the masquerade and all. But no one truly escapes the metahuman conflict. Barring oneshots, what was the last fic that actually dealt with someone just running away from all of the crime and doing something interesting?

It's seems that, once you have to actually write without dealing with cognitively easy things like an enemy that can turn you into dust with their eyes the difficulty of actually writing something becomes much harder. It's harder to make a story where a teleporter runs a shipping company or stays (mostly) out of the "hero" scene and have it be interesting.
