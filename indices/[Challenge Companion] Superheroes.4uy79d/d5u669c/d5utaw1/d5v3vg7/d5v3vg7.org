I don't think Chronicle is what he's looking for. A lot of the film is just the characters goofing off with their powers, but the climax is a hero-villain fight straight out of a comic book. I got the impression from the ending that the main character had decided to become a superhero, essentially making this film his origin story, and the director's original plans for a sequel seemed to corroborate that.
