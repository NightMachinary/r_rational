I think the reason it hasn't been written is because not many people want to read it. You're not telling a superhero story, you're telling a story that just happens to include characters with superpowers. If you were going to tell a story about someone just doing their job, then why bother giving them powers? It might make things more visually interesting, but how else would superpowers change the story?
