[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wMvv924Gks][The Specials]] has an inversion of this trope - in that world /successful/ people with superpowers stay out of superheroing (a superspeedster literally does run a shipping company, and comes back to try to persuade The Strobe to give up his delusions and use his laser powers in industrial manufacturing).

However you're absolutely right, running the shipping company is /not interesting/, and that's basically why the offer is rejected. Superheroes are people who want to live /interesting/ lives, regardless of optimality. I think they share that characteristic with almost all of humanity in that regard. Most folks could live /far/ more optimally than they actually do.
