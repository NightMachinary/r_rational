Okay, there's a short story I've been meaning to write in the world of [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories][Fall of Doc Future]], and this looks like a good incentive. It's called "The Old Man", and it's about The Volunteer. I should have it done within the week.

Edit: It's now up on my site, and linked under the main contest thread.
