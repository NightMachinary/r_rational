I still maintain that, if Hollywood weren't so conservative with regards to safe box office bets, Metropolitan Man would be ideal for a fairly faithful film adaptation. It's a perfect Superman story, told very well, and could be made more cinematic than I think most imagine. It also happens to feature the sort of stuff this sub loves. If there were a Metropolitan Man movie, then it would easily be my favorite live action superhero film of all time.

I also think Worm would make a great animated series, with the caveat that animation is often associated with being marketed to children, which Worm decidedly is not and should not be.
