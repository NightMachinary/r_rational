I disagree wholeheartedly. Not that I think a Metropolitan Man film couldn't be good, but there's no way average Superman fans would like it. Man of Steel split audiences down the middle with its take on the hero, and MM is even darker. From what I've learned, most people seem to like Superman specifically because the stories are so happy and idealistic.

Even if by some miracle fans don't get as pissed off about Supes murdering a mob boss as they did when he killed Zod in defense of innocent people, there's still no way they'd tolerate the story ending with Luthor winning. The only way I could see Metropolitan Man as a successful film is if you changed all the character's names like with Fifty Shades of Grey.
