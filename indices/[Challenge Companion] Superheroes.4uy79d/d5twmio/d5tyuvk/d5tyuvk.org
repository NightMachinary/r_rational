The problem a lot of people have with Worm is that it's attempting to add patches onto the superhero genre so that the world can keep on spinning as it normally does, but with people running around in spandex and fighting each other. The mechanisms by which it attempts to accomplish this:

- [[#s][]]

To me, there's a distinction between /justifying/ something and /rationalizing/ something. If there's a problem in /Star Trek/ that can clearly be solved via teleporter and someone says "We can't get a lock because of the transphase inducers!" that's a justification that helps to suspend disbelief ... but it's just a handwave to get that issue out of the way. To me, Worm felt like it had a lot of justifications without that much rationality; there seemed to be lots of cases where the answer to why someone didn't do X was implicitly or explicitly one of those things spoilered above, which just served to sweep the issue of doing the rational thing under the rug so it could be ignored in favor of a story that was trying to be about people in capes fighting each other.

I mostly enjoyed Worm, and I think the characterization in particular is stellar, but for my own personal definition of rational fiction, it's on the other side of the line.
