This is why, once again, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies/][I hate prophecy so goddamn much.]]

HPMOR at least had the excuse that prophecies exist in canon, though I wouldn't have minded subverting that somehow. But in Worm, I would have been perfectly fine with the removal of Dinah and Contessa, or at least a huge nerfing of their powers. I think the story actually would have been better without Dinah in particular: it would have given characters more organic reasons to act as they did, instead of "The prophecy said so."
