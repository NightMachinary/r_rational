  Firstly, most of the heroes don't seem to be interested in helping people, so why would they decide to become superheroes?

Most of the story is from the perspective of villains...

  None of them seemed to have been forced into crimefighting and it seemed like many of them had operated independently before joining the Protectorate yet so few of them care about doing heroic things
#+end_quote

People like Assault were forced and a lot of the Case 53s took the job cause the PRT was the best place for them.

Besides, multiple people talk about and do heroic things. Miss Militia is considered a hero, the Vegas capes lament that they can't save Vegas completely. They are obligated by law to go to every S-Class event (the Protectorate that is) and helped catch people like Bakuda and a bunch of Wards volunteered to fight the S9 and others when they didn't have to. They also patrolled when the city was wrecked by Leviathan but obviously that stuff is hard to paper over.

As I said it's from the POV of the villain and the PRT is kinda put upon, they are probably more like cops than the uplifting image of Superman. You hear about cops when they do something /particularly/ amazing but, in a crime ridden city how often do you spend time thinking about cops as "heroic"?

  but I fail to see why trauma victims would be more likely to commit crimes, let alone make a career out of it.
#+end_quote

I imagine the logic is like "someone who is more likely to receive the requisite trauma is more likely to be in the segment of the population that actually is most at risk for crime anyway" and/or "the trigger cause problems both immediately and in the sort of reckless use powers can cause".
