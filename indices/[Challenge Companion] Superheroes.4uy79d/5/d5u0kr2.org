While Worm did analyze and explain a lot of superhero tropes, there were three aspects of its setting that didn't make sense to me. I only read the first half since it started feeling more like survival horror than superheroes when the Slaughterhouse 9 showed up, so some of these might've been explained but they still nagged at me while I was reading. If you want to write a superhero story, I would like these to be avoided or addressed.

Firstly, most of the heroes don't seem to be interested in helping people, so why would they decide to become superheroes? None of them seemed to have been forced into crimefighting and it seemed like many of them had operated independently before joining the Protectorate, yet so few of them care about doing heroic things. Watchmen explained why people became "costumed adventurers" for selfish reasons, but Worm didn't and the setting is so different that I don't see how the same idea would apply.

Second, it strikes me as bizarre that superhero tropes are the norm when the Endbringers are a thing. Humanity is under siege by essentially unstoppable kaiju, yet fighting them is considered a side gig to the cops and robbers culture of heroes and villains. Additionally, I would've expected the Protectorate to be far more militarized to deal with those threats instead of relying on good samaritans to volunteer. I assume the Endbringer attacks are supposed to be similar to Crisis Crossovers in comic books, but they're so much more common and deadly that I don't understand how a normal superhero culture can exist.

Finally, I don't buy the explanation for why supervillains are more common than superheroes. Supposedly it's because powers are induced by experiencing trauma, but I fail to see why trauma victims would be more likely to commit crimes, let alone make a career out of it. The motivations of each character makes sense, since most villains appear to be gang members, domestic terrorists, and psychopaths; but I don't buy that they are more common due to the nature of superpowers.
