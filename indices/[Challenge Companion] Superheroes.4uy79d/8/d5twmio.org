On pain of causing a spat in our peaceful community, I will say this:

/Of course/ Worm /is rational. It's obvious. It's as rational-fiction-ish as you can possibly get if you haven't heard of rational fiction beforehand. How do you deny it. If you intentionally planned to create the perfect superhero story, incorporating all of the tropes and all of the outcomes of those tropes and harmoniously unify them, then you would get/ Worm.
