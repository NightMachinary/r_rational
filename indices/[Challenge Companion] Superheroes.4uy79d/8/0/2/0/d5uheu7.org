Baconreader parses subreddit CSS the first time you enter a subreddit with the app. Spoilers are done via CSS, so it's probable that Baconreader failed in some way on initially entering the sub. Alternatively, Baconreader might just be failing to render the spoilers for some other reason. [[/r/rational]] uses standard spoiler code.
