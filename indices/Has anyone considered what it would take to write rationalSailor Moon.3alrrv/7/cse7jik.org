I'm wondering if the order of the timeline should be changed a bit. Make it so that it takes place in the distant future, after a time when it would be more realistic for humanity to have colonized the solar system and then got wiped out except for the population on Earth. Or I could just make it so that only the Earth has human sailor senshi, and then there are other non-human senshi on other planets. After all, it doesn't really make sense to only have ONE guardian per planet. Also, I don't think Tuxedo Mask should be the pseudo-senshi of Earth. Either make him a real senshi with actual senshi powers and a transformation, or just make him an ordinary person who helps behind the scenes, like Naru should have been.

I don't like how Sailor Moon treats Naru. Usagi basically abandons her best friend to go fight evil in the moonlight with all her superpowered friends of DESTINY. The least she could do is spend some time with Naru and not avoid or worry her so much. Naru was introduced as Usagi's best friend in the beginning, and yet she played almost no role at all in the story whatsoever. I know that in the anime at least, Naru liked to gossip. That could have been played up a bit, making Naru a good source of information for the heroes.
