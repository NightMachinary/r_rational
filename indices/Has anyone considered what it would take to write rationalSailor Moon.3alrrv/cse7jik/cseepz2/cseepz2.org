  when it would be more realistic for humanity to have colonized the solar system and then got wiped out except for the population on Earth.

  After all, it doesn't really make sense to only have ONE guardian per planet.

When reimagining fiction, it's always my preference to build and expand on the world to make canon more coherent, instead of just changing something in canon to become coherent.

Obviously Sailor Moon is a world filled with magic and souls. Teenaged girls are given massive elemental powers, provocatively dressed demons suck spirit energy from random civilians to revive an evil queen, and everything interesting in an interstellar story is localized to one small region of Japan.

So how does a solar system-wide civilization that got wiped out while sparing Earth make sense? Rather than supertech, my preferred answer would be magitech. Soul engines and advanced spellcrafting. And why did all this vanish? Well, canon does provide us with an all-devouring superdemon that exterminated everything. And now we just make it actually eat magic itself.

Why is there only one guardian per planet? Well, obviously planets aren't just big chunks of space rock in Sailor Moon. They're important metaphysical concepts that resonate with certain elements. While they're dead, drained husks of rock when the story begins, they can be assumed to have been very different in ancient times. And due to (asspulled) magical law, only one individual can become a planet's guardian by embodying its element.

Although, of course, all of the above is pretty much just pulled out of my ass. First draft ideas.
