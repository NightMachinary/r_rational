Reincarnation is clearly a thing in SM-verse. We know that it exists, it has to exist to make the story work. So the question is, why wouldn't the Moon Queen have reincarnated everyone?

Maybe she put a magic shield around the Senshi's souls when sending them forward. It might be actually normal to reincarnate, with more magic increasing how much you remember from your past lives. Metallia ate all the magic around, so most of the Moon Kingdom got reincarnated badly. After M gets defeated, people suddenly start recalling bizarre memories of lives they never lived...

Uniforms are clearly some sort of weird alien artifact. It turns out that sailor suits are the optimal form for magical defense, according to Moon Kingdom wizards. Still uncomfortable with them? You have a genius on your team, make better ones! (Or, more likely, fail to make better ones, because magic is complex and you're a 16-year old just starting to remember your goddess-wizard life.)

Maybe women are better at conducting magical energy, across species? WoG says every Senshi in the galaxy is female. Maybe something to do with how to be able to carry children needs the ability to hold the child's magic, meaning that women have to be better magically, which ties it into Tuxedo Kamen not being a Senshi.

Or maybe the Moon Kingdom was just a matriarchy, although that doesn't explain why they all reincarnated as girls. Make some of them magically trans, going from FtM reincarnating or trying to get back to female? Although it might be difficult to handle that well.

Since magic exists, there's no reason for elements not to. Given that the main characters are all Elemental, Elements are probably important. Maybe the metaphysics of the universe mean that the more powerful you are, the more you need to use a particular defined concept. Concepts have to be defined clearly, to make it so that no no-name punk can just summon Evil out of nowhere. Interesting idea: nobody's actually managed to make mages tied to Good or Evil; things that come close end up fucked up in a very strong AI-ish way.

Pluto could have been an experiment with timeline manipulation, but ended up so powerful she could only change time as much as she did in canon.

Divine right to rule is completely reasonable when you can revive everyone on a planet and are apparently the life-support system for the entire government. If that's uncomfortable, you can make it so that the Moon Kingdom refined the idea of Good or Law or Love&Justice or something similarly impressive, that Neo-Queen Serenity is literally powered by Goodness, so of course she's ruler.

A PJ cross would be interesting, since we hear that the Greeks are mainly active in the West.
