Always a tough one. You can go for some sort of dualism, with some people having souls strong enough to survive a body's death, seek out another body, and slowly manipulate it to make it more similar to its previous incarnations. You can do the same but technologically -- Usagi has an implant in her head that is altering her personality slowly over time.

Probably the least squicky involves finding and taking over a moribund fetus, altering it so that it will survive and at the same time replacing the nerve cluster that would have become its brain.

  Explaining how or why all of the sailor senshi are female.

I don't recall /Inviolate/ spending even one line pondering why so many capes were male. Just roll with it.

  explaining how all of them are human, including the ones from very VERY far away (like all the way across the galaxy)

Your version of them doesn't even have to look vaguely human. It does make some sense to try to blend in with the locals if you intend to work with them a lot, though.
