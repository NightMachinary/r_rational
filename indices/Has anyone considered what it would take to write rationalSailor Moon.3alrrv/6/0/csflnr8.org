I always interpreted the Serenity line as a series of avatar-bodies for a Friendly AI distributed-system (which exists within its present avatar, the Silver Crystal, and the Silver Millenium city, and may bootstrap back into existence from the loss of any two of the three.)

The human being is still /there/, with its own personality (Usagi), but the exoself/overmind is someone entirely else, much longer-lived. Kind of like a Trill symbiont.

So, it's not really that the Serenity line has a divine right to rule passed maternally or anything like that. It's just one continuous being (Serenity the FAI) possessing a sequence of people who happen to be descendants of one-another. Presumably, if the genetic lineage were terminated, Serenity could bootstrap-reincarnate its avatar with completely different genetics. (Though there might be a fair bit of dedicated gene-code for the latent powers of the avatar that Serenity "plugs into", so any arbitrary successor avatar might have a strong phenotypic resemblance to the current avatar, even starting from a separate base.)
