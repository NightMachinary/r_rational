This idea seems to have promise, but then what about the relationship between princess serenity and prince endymion, and the relationship between usagi and mamoru? Is mamoru also part of an FAI? Are all the sailor senshi part of an FAI?

And why would the FAI choose to use Sailor Senshi in the first place, rather than some other means of protecting civilizaiton?
