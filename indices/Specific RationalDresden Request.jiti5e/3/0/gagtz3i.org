  official canon from the author that breaking any of the Seven Laws actually does do permanent damage to the user's psyche and has lasting consequences

Ah, okay. I actually don't pay attention to authors much, and focus on the works alone. But, I'll certainly accept that as canon, I just wasn't aware of it.

With that /new knowledge/, I'm actually less interested in my proposed alternative... Not that defeating death wouldn't be worth a volunteered sanity, but with the fall the the dark side / madness guaranteed, it's less interesting than exploring the parts of death magic that can be safely used.

As far as "dark", I actually think the canon is a "golden path" through the universe. There's a lot of times Dresden makes a choice and "does the right thing" and it just so happens that any other choice means Apocalypse of various stripes, or /at least/ Harry's death.

I'm not sure what /exactly/ goes wrong if necro!Harry exists, but yeah things would be dark. (So many things changes though, it would be hard to predict without writing it.)
