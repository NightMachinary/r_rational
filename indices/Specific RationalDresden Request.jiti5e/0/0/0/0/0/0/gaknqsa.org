That's a possibility, though I think Lashiel and Harry's Id are actually more likely suspects. I think there was some unconscious recovery after being kidnapped, that occurred between Bob's (mistaken) approval of the device and Harry's use of it in the Finding for Molly.

I guess Leananshe wasn't available (IIRC, she was currently a sidhe-sickle), but Mab /might/ have been able to enter the lab from the Nether-nether to fix the problem. She had her own claim on Dresden, as well as acting in Lea's stead as guide/protector, and the fae do get to bypass thresholds when they mean no harm. Mab does later fiddle with Harry's devices at least partially for his benefit (taking his rod and the memories of it so he doesn't attract Summer by using it), so it wouldn't be entirely out of character for here.

Also, I don't think Time Traveling Harry will be willing to travel so far back. If violating that law of magic really does no mental damage.
