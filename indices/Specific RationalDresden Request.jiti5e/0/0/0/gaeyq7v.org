I beg to differ. Dresden gives himself a hard time and calls himself a brute regularly and I think it's easy to buy into that view. Especially since when it comes to delicate control of fine magicks in a combat situation, he is regularly outclassed by others with more experience. But when it comes to his artificing work, there is solid evidence that he is top of the class. The gear that he creates is regularly on par with devices made by wizards double or even triple his age, nd even Bob was impressed with Little Chicago. I doubt even most of the High Council could pull off that one.
