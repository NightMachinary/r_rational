  he has access to a lot of evidence indicating that even minor compromises with Dark Magic can cause serious psychological problems and that every attempt to use Dark Magic in pursuit of some noble goal has invariably ended horrible.

Well, this is before he was a warden, so his personal experiences with the negative effects of Dark Magic are not too many. Of course, he has been exposed to be White Council's propaganda, but he has personal experience that breaking the laws doesn't mean you are irredeemable.

That said, it's also before he's used necromancy successfully (?) in pursuit of a noble goal, too.

  A more "rational" take on Dresden would probably involve him finding a career other than detective and building on his strengths as an artificer.

I can understand "career other than detective", but his primary skills aren't in artificing. Sure, he's had to re-make his staff, rod, rings, and bracelet multiple times, but they are far from the coolest devices in the series, and mostly just let Harry do more of what he's good at -- redirecting energy.

I can recommend the "Arcane Ascension" series for a magical protag that /is/ a powerful, specialized artificer. It's an even more fantastical world than even the Dresden Files, though.

As a bit of a magical "brute", I think Dresden's career makes /some/ sense. I'm sure there's plenty of "failure to multiply" in how small and personal his cases are, but his "brutish"ness is a fit for combat magic. Immediately after becoming a member of the council, he's not going to be accepted among the wardens, and he certainly can't use magic in the rigid procedure of police work, or the rigid discipline of military service, so he becomes a "private cop" and does the PI work.

It's not /entirely/ clear, but it does seem like magic in the Dresden Files universe can violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, so I'm sure a purely rational actor would just do that at industrial scale, and optimize energy production. Heck, while there's certainly claims in the text that the 1st law of thermodynamics is followed / energy is conserved, there's plenty of Dresden spells that feel like they are breaking that one, and that means free energy!
