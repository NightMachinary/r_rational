  Hmmmm. . . I think you are missing the fact that the Dresdenverse very explicitly has afterlives and souls; challenging death might not make sense.

Eh, sort of. I mean Dresden /later/ has some fairly direct evidence after "Ghost Story", but until then there's not lot of evidence that's any stronger than what we experience. Even Mort makes it clear that ghosts aren't actually souls and doubts that Dresden is actually present during most of "Ghost Story".

It does seem unlikely that Uriel would exist without at least some people experiencing an afterlife, but even Sonya admits that the angelic beings may or may not correspond to the White god's afterlife.

  Furthermore the Dakhallow a worse moral tradeoff than a horcrux costing hundreds or higher exponents of lives to make a immortal (god) but it's a world where there is continuity of personhood after death.

Oh, absolutely, I'm not saying Dresden would not stop the Darkhallow. Kimori and Cowl both state that it would be better for it not to happen at all, Cowl just doesn't think that's very likely and seeing himself performing the Darkhollow as the least bad option. If Dresden and Kimori (and Cowl?) team up, it would mean they'd work together to stop the Darkhallow. If Kimori or Cowl can't modify their goals that much, Dresden will still go it alone.

With Cowl and Kimori on defense instead of smacking him over the head, it's theoretically possible that The Erlking could have been imprisoned until dawn! (Unlikely, eventually Gravain and/pr Corpse Taker would try to break the Erlking out, and if both of them and their dummers came by "Team Dresden" would be outnumbered on the wizard count.)

  given people actually do go somewhere else arbitrated by powers does fighting to defeat death, in the dresdenverse, make sense?

I think it does. Optional mortality is basically always an improvement. Even if the afterlife is always very much better than life, it's not /strictly/ better because you lose the ability to interact with the living in significant ways. Optional mortality would let you decide when the afterlife experience is worth the things you'll have to give up, if there is an afterlife.

At the very least, Dresden's experiences in "Dead Beat" /should/ have had him collaborating with Mort more, so that he wasn't so inexperienced during "Ghost Story", even if he never drew from necromantic energy after ceasing to animate Sue.
