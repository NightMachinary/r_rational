Things we know about Dresdenverse afterlives:

1. Deities can form their own. We see this with Hades and the Greek Underworld.

2. There was somewhere for the Angel of Death from Dead Beat to shepherd Father Forthill to.

3. Murphy's dad exists in some kind of between-place, ostensibly at Uriel's behest.

4. There is a Southbound Train. We have no idea what's at the terminal station. Uriel won't say, and won't say why he won't say.

5. It's not possible to do much to a soul without its express consent. It doesn't need to be informed consent, but outright refusals seem fairly ironclad.

6. There is something fueling Hellfire. We have no evidence that it's tormented souls. It could well be some kind of corrupted angelic power, given that Uriel has the capacity to unmake galaxies. The difference between Hellfire and angelic power appears to be that angels can only act to counter supernatural intervention and with the consent of those being acted upon, while Hellfire requires only the consent of the one using it.

7. The White God, also known as the Abrahamic deity, does not appear to be the malevolent bastard depicted in its holy books. None of the agents it empowers are bad people, its artifacts straight-up disintegrate in the hands of people who would misuse them, and the only time it flexes its power is when mortal free will is at risk of being curbed through supernatural intervention.

8. Satan is not mentioned. Fallen Angels exist, but their ultimate goal appears to be fighting Nemesis, in much the same way that Winter's goal is manning the Outer Gates.
