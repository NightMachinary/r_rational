[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33916060-blackwing][Raven's Mark]] series has mages of low skill / talent being coerced by the government into doing work that amounts to power generation. There are excuses, humans are at war with cthulhu gods, so it's not quite slavery but conscription. More specifically immortal human mages with so much power they are worshiped as gods warring against cthulhu gods and their empires of mindcontrolled monsters.
