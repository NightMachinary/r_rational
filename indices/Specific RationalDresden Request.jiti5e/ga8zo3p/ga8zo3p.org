I am not sure if we can consider Dresden rejecting Kimori to be irrational given that he has access to a lot of evidence indicating that even minor compromises with Dark Magic can cause serious psychological problems and that every attempt to use Dark Magic in pursuit of some noble goal has invariably ended horribly. It seems perfectly rational for Dresden to assume that Kimori (someone openly serving some ridiculously evil people) is simply trying to find a way of justifying her horrific actions and plans.

A more "rational" take on Dresden would probably involve him finding a career other than detective and building on his strengths as an artificer. This seems like it could actually lead to a very interesting story that provides worldbuilding on the life of Wizards who are not Wardens or actively involved in the highest levels of White Council politics. This is something that is pretty much entirely neglected in Canon.
