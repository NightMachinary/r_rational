Hmmmm. . . I think you are missing the fact that the Dresdenverse very explicitly has afterlives and souls; challenging death might not make sense.

Furthermore the Dakhallow a worse moral tradeoff than a horcrux costing hundreds or higher exponents of lives to make a immortal (god) but it's a world where there is continuity of personhood after death. We only explicitly see non dismissible continuity, instead of ghosts or dreams, for presumably normal-ish cases after "Dead Beat" (I'm thinking of any allies relative in Ghost Story and someone's daughter in Skin Game), but given people actually do go somewhere else arbitrated by /powers/ does fighting to defeat death, in the dresdenverse, make sense?
