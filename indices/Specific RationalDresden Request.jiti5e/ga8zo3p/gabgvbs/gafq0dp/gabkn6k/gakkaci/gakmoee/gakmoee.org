Nah, Mort was already coming back into his powers at the beginning of "Death Masks". He's never going to want to jump into the thick of things, but he could have already started schooling Dresden in the finer details of ectomancy.

Though, truthfully, he might not have been too keen on Dresden -- Mort knows that thinks are likely to blow up around Harry, even if that's only once or twice a year, it's enough that the cowardly ectomancer might not have wanted Harry apprenticing anywhere near himself.

Especially since Ground Zero and Square One tend to resemble one another around Dresden.

It's possible that Mort could be convinced that teaching Dresden would have him working fewer spells (like the necromancy Finding) on behalf of Dresden.
