The fact that there is an afterlife doesn't mean that it's a good one for everybody or even a significant amount of people.

Given that the Christian God is a pretty big deal in the Dresdenverse, it's entirely possible that the majority of people actually go to hell to suffer forever, in which case immortality would be even /more/ important then if there was no afterlife at all.
