I don't think we have seen the end of the Kumori/necromancy plot lines yet, so I think there's going to be more happening from there. That being said, it is official canon from the author that breaking any of the Seven Laws actually does do permanent damage to the user's psyche and has lasting consequences. It's also a WoJ that Dresden is going to break all seven of them before the end of the series, so I guess that wouldn't mean that an alt!Harry couldn't go down that path of following Kumori but I would expect it to be a very dark path indeed.
