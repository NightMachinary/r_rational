This seems pretty good so far, I must say!

The whole 'chakra brain' thing did seem a bit odd at first, but thinking about it the 'verse /does/ have sentient shadowclones, which are made of chakra...

Also, if Time Braid (Sakura, Sasuke, Naruto and Hinata are in a time loop) isn't already one of your influences [[#s][spoilers]], I'd recommend you read it. Heck, add these to the previous statement:

- Waves Arisen: smart/bookworm Naruto, rebalanced shadow/earth/water clones, /chakra numbers/, rampant dojutsu swapping, Naruto/Sasuke/Hinata are Team Kakashi
- Team Anko: rebalanced shadowclones, characters are actually not stupid, Orochimaru isn't just a power-hungry jerk, Naruto/Hinata/Shino are Team Anko

I encourage you to keep writing, if only because I enjoy a good munchkin story.
