I thought I'd share a story I've started writing. It's an attempt to stick a rational character with (some) foreknowledge into Naruto to see what happens. There's a saying that villains act and heroes react, I've always hated that saying. It's young yet, but I'm hoping to have the characters start driving their own confrontations at some point instead of waiting to have them plonked on their laps in the form of missions.

I've got a fair plan of what's to come and I fully expect to make things hard for my character. I'm also of the opinion that no-one takes a fight scene seriously until you kill off a few characters in the middle of one. Otherwise known as the Game of Thrones effect.
