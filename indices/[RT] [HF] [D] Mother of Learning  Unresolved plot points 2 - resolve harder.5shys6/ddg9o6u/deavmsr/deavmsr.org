  Temporary markers
#+end_quote

You know, Zorian and Kael discussed a while back (chapter 39) how Red Robe could be looping, and Zorian dismissed the idea that he could be implanting memory packets in Zach, since he's active at the start of the loop, without any apparent intervention from Zach.

Temporary markers offer a potential explanation for this. What if RR was compelling Zach to place a temporary marker on him as soon as the old one broke down?

It's not entirely clear whether the temporary marker means you get a total of 5 resets/six months, or six resets/7 months, but either way, on his final iteration, the temporary marker has presumably dissolved, so there's theoretically no reason he couldn't be marked again. Being a soul mage and all, he might even be able to hurry it up and wipe a marker that was about to expire, ready for a fresh one. He could thus achieve continuity between one temporary marker and the next.

This could explain his bathroom assault on Zach. The events of chapter 26 made Zach aware of him, and aware that he's an enemy, so RR wasn't able to surreptitiously approach him to get his marker updated any more. Probably he was running out of iterations, and made a final attempt to regain control of Zach, but the boy got away, so he escaped before his marker broke down.

This theory doesn't explain why the Guardian would think he had a Controller marker and let him out. On the other hand, the Guardian gave a bit of a non-answer when asked about whether RR had a Controller marker, as if it was restating an expectation rather than an observation - a bit like when Zorian asked it how many people were in the control room, and it replied that "Only the Controller can reach this place." I wouldn't be surprised if there was some way it could be fooled.
