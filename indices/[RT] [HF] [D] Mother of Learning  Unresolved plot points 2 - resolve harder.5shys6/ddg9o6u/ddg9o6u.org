Others include:

- Temporary markers. Possible connection to Red Robe gaining loop access?
- Zach's amnesia + compulsion(s).
- Zenomir Olgai the polyglot. Why did speaking with him get Zorian assassinated? Is he a cultist (and how much does he know), or did he pass the info on to the wrong person (and presumably get himself killed too)?
- Zorian's unresolved hurt re Taiven, which almost put a lasting wedge in their friendship.
- Curing Imaya. Or perhaps she will adopt one of the shifter children whose parents couldn't be saved?
- The Immortal Eleven. Their existence was confirmed on the blog - they made themselves a potion of endless youth - but details restricted for plot reasons.
- Did Zach have deeper reasons for killing a dragon, not just "because I can"? He doesn't seem to have discussed the details of his victory with Zorian, which would seem odd if he did it for bragging rights.
- Plus, of course, major plot points like, How can both of them get out despite the fact that Zorian's original body already contains a soul? Is Red Robe really Veyers? How can they stop the real invasion, which will add a horde of summoned demons to everything else?
