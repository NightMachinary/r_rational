I have a theory on RR=Veyers that didn't seem to have a good place to post and this seems like a good place!

In the first few loops Zach is missing, not just missing but no one can find him including his caretaker and a meagerly skilled Zorion. Then much later we find out that when interacting with the sovereign gate (SG) that the avatar can pull souls into the SG for safe keeping. Thus I think what happened to Zach was that the SG was keeping his soul with the gate while it self-repaired the damage dealt by the lich. Then it didn't bother to create Zach's body since he isn't a copy and it would just die without Zach's soul to inhabit it.

This applies to Veyers because I think when Veyers convinced the SG to let him leave it no longer had a reason to create Veyers's body for the same reason it never bothered to create Zach's.
