Right but my point is that the SG in its confusion acts more like how it handled Zach recovering from soul damage (if his body was just a lifeless husk then it should have been big news and discovered by his caretaker) as opposed to how the Aranea were deleted from the template.

I also imagine that divination spells could locate Veyers if his body was still around.
