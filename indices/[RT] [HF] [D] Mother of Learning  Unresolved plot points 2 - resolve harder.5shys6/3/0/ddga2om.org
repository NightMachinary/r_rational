I'm pretty sure that excluding an unnecessary body is /more/ effort than just faithfully reproducing the template. Because the aranea bodies still get created.

If Veyers is RR, then I'd say that either his body is now a soulless husk in some out-of-the-way location (wherever he was when the loop started, which no-one seems to know), or he specifically altered the template to exclude it. Which both he and the Guardian had no reason to do, both expecting the loop to collapse upon the Controller's exit.

If Veyers is not RR, his body might still be a hidden husk, or he might be alive and held by the cult or something.
