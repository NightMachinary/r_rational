I've just reread most of mother of learning, and it's been mentioned that the school dance was basically an excuse for an important meeting between different nations, but we never really found out exactly what is was.

The planar alignment doesn't seem to be it. I wonder if the old alliance of Eldemar was tentatively being slightly reinstated, which is part of why the Ibasans attacked early?

As for the identity of Red Robe, the Simulacrum idea has merits, but also issues.

Problems:

1) Red Robe made a simulacrum of himself when he killed the Aranea, which seems like it might not be possible for a simulacrum to do.

2) He was explicitly "bloodied" by a group of students, and simulacrums don't have blood. It /could/ just be a figure of speech though.

Merits:

1) Zach, the man so desperate for company that he tried to convince hundreds of people in Cyoria he was a time traveler, /supposedly/ thought little of the Simulacrum spell. This really doesn't make sense to me--it feels like his memories and inclinations have been edited.

2) A simulacrum theoretically wouldn't need a marker to be pulled back through the time loop. It should already be connected to Zach. The author has been very careful to not really have Zorian experiment with long-lived simulacrums, or whether they get looped with him.

3) We've been shown that Simulacrums can diverge from their creator pretty early, and told they may go crazy and try to murder/replace them.

  Zorian's father has never appeared in the narrative, but was described, same as Damien

He sort of does, after Zorian was attacked by the Sword Divers web, he was bedridded for three days. His father apparently sneeringly called him his "Fainting son", but it wasn't directly shown.

I also have a theory about Zach's reserves. We don't necessarily know he had them before the loop--his memory is edited and spotty, and he could have just had marginally better reserves than average, and been lazy like Benisek.

The time loop can copy souls, apparently. Why not copy the soul of the original looper 6-10 times or so, and merge them all together? This would expand their mana reserves dramatically without crippling their shaping ability, and additionally fulfill the purpose of making the looper stronger.

I can't think of anything else that explains his ludicrous reserves that have no attendant loss in shaping skills.

Zorian might theoretically be able to double his reserves by merging with his original self's soul once he escapes the loop.
