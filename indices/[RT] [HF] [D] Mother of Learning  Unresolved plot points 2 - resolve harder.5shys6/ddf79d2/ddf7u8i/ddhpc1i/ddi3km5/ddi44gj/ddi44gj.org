Good point. Unless we see him start exploiting the time loop a lot more, I don't think he'll try pulling a Matriarch and plot to escape the time loop on his own.

Any chance we're in recursive time loops?

*edit:*

Expanding on the time loop within a time loop theory:

- We've already seen both black rooms and pocket dimensions working normally inside the looped world (a.k.a. a giant pocket dimension black room).
- Mana-generation seems unaffected inside the loop, so I don't think there are any concerns with finite energy.
- This theory would neatly explain why the loop starts one month before the optimal loop-start time. Each loop would have it's entire month to gather enough energy to start another loop.
- The inner time loop could be powered by any crystallized mana or mana batteries that exist at the beginning of the outer time loop, or, more plot-relevant, it could be powered by the invasion-powered soul battery.
- If the Key is some sort of magical root access to the Sovereign Gate, I expect it's required to not only send folks out but also to start the inner loop.
- Assuming we're in a single layer of time loop right now, this might be how Zorian and co. will find more time.
- What's the limit on temporary markers? Six cycles? That means if they use the six loops before they leave outer loop, Team Zorian can give themselves plus six more people the full benefits of an inner time loop!
- Someone (Xvim!) steals the key, starts his own inner loop, emerges a god, returns to original world, becomes the final boss. /nailed it/
- Scrapping the inner time loop idea, perhaps Zorian, Inc. will return to original world, get trounced by RR/Primordial, and will have to start a second time loop on the actual planetary alignment to get more time to try again.
- Big stretch here - The true "outer time loop" corresponds to the disappearance of the gods. The Zorian train ain't stoppin' until he's battling Gods, Demons, and Primordials over the fate of the Material Plane.

I just think the frame world has to have more going on than described thus far. The best way this story enters mindfuck territory is if the whole thing takes place effectively /in media res/.

*2nd edit:*

Clearly, Damien is behind it all.

Beware: Random conjecture follows

- Damien is RR.
- Damien has the original marker, not Zach. /unlikely, included for completeness/
- Damien is just a cool dude who plotted everything before throwing Zach into the loop.
- Damien is a prodigy because he's actually the looper from an outer loop.
- Zach's Sovereign Gate might be the original tech, but Damien copied it, removed the one month restriction, and used Gate 2.0 to run the outer loop where he uses Gate 1.0 for the inner loop.
- Gate 2.0 is running an outer loop, but Gate 1.0 wasn't supposed to be turned on and this is all an accident.
- *Drama:* Zach, Zorian, et. al. use the Key to leave the inner loop just to find themselves in yet another race to be the first to leave the outer loop... against RR and Damien. And, of course, the Key won't work on outer loop/Gate 2.0.
