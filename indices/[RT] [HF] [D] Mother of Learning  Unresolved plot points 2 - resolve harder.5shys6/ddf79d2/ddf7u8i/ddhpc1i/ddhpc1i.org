We've been given hints as to how useful healing magic will be. Plus, Zach was prodding Zorian to learn healing magic the traditional (structured) way. I expect Zorian will eventually master healing magic as a sub-function of learning blood magic and learning how to perceive and manipulate life force.

What's really exciting is Zorian possibly enhancing himself with Grey Hunter essence. I think it'll be the hunter because, unlike the alien-mind of the Eye Ooze, the hunter has been much more fully developed as a character. Zorian will be more effective at pretty much everything once he has full-blown mana-sensing. And, to top it all off, magic resistance/immunity is a classic broken-power trope.

I'm sure this has been mentioned before, but what are the odds on Xvim being behind everything in the end?
