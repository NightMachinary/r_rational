A minor note, but will we ever see a three-eyed wolf? In Ch. 5 Zorian mentions that his dreams are often full of weirdness like talking birds, floating pyramids, and three-eyed wolves. Empaths are supposed to have the occasional prophetic dream, and we've already seen a talking bird and a floating pyramid (of glass marbles, under Xvim's tutelage).

Edit: we've seen the talking bird, not the 3-eyed wolf. My bad.
