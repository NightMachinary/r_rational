Let me throw out another possibility: Damean is also psychic. It could explain his seemingly unusual prodigy if he kept it secret and was willing to use it to cheat by reading minds. Zorian learns that being psychic is usualy a bloodline thing and while he checks if Kirelle is psychic, he hasn't seen Damean ever since becoming capable in his abilities.
