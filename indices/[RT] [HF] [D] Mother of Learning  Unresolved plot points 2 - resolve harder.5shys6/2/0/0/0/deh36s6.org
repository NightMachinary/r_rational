Red Robe doesn't necessarily have to plant a complex compulsion in Zach. He could just plant a suggestion that he is "perfectly normal, nothing to see here," so that he can approach Zach every six months and dominate him. Domination doesn't make any lasting changes, so the marker might well ignore it, especially if it's unstructured. And Zach appears to have some weak compulsion on him, to dismiss the topic of Veyers, so we know RR can do that.

That would also explain why it broke down: a mere suggestion wasn't enough to overcome Zach's suspicion once he knew about the existence of RR, and particularly once they fought. If RR could have wiped his memories, things could have stabilized, but the threat of the aranea meant he didn't hang around for that, and then Zach started protecting himself from divination. RR still ambushed him in the places he knew Zach might go, but both attacks failed, and then, I suspect, time was up. So he got out while the getting was good.

Veyers does fit the theory well in general. If you want someone to completely ignore you, then making them completely forget you is a good start. It would especially make sense for Veyers, being Zach's enemy. But I don't think soul bonds will let you loop. They're just not that rigid a connection IMO.
