So then for loops 2-7 do you think that RR had to allow Zach to awaken to refresh the temporary marker? That's about the time limit for a temp marker.

I don't think that a soul bond itself would let RR loop either. I just think the only beings with knowledge about the Gate and capability to insert themselves into the loop would be from at least several hundred years ago and more powerful than Veyers himself. I think the makeshift ritual to awaken his bloodline exposed him to such a being, possibly in the form of a soul bond. Just plain Veyers shouldn't have been competent enough to become RR.
