Zorian thinks that with RR being a non-empath, RR's unstructured mind magic was very limited in what it could do to Zach. Searching for information (such as about the aranea), erasing Zach's memory of Veyers, and placing a compulsion to dismiss mentions of Veyers should be his very limit. RR shouldn't have the capability of compelling Zach to do something as complex as give him a temporary marker. (Something Zach himself doesn't know how to do, that very likely involves a degree of soul sense, which Zach had apparently never developed.)

So, I've got a newish Red Robe that isn't total garbage. I mean, it still has a lot of bad points, but that's kind of unavoidable. Felt like putting it down somewhere before the new chapter comes out in case I'm right about anything.

So I think RR cheated or gained his marker some other way, but it still must have been different from Zach and Zorian's, since he never used the locator ritual spell to find Zorian. I still don't have a good theory on the how for this, but I think it required knowledge of the loop/marker/Sovereign's Gate that no modern mage had.

So it might sound dumb that my current RR theory (Is this my 3rd or 4th now?) is that RR is Veyers. Or rather, partially Veyers?

The whole "experimental ritual to awaken his bloodline" thing probably either directly exposed him/his soul to takeover/fusion by another, more ancient being, or just made him very vulnerable to such an attack. Maybe it was something like a Soul Bond with a powerful ancient Fire Elemental?

What other reason does RR have to prioritize the erasure of Veyers from Zach's memory above all else?

Could part of the reason the 1st Arc spend a few chapters on Soul Bonds because it would be relevant later? Perhaps Veyers' unstable behavior in the past years was because of a foreign influence upon him that grew stronger as time passed. This could also explain how a Veyers!RR would have the skills and knowledge necessary from the beginning of the loops.

It also explains why Veyers got thrown out of school and seemingly disappeared without a trace conveniently just before the loop began. Not!Veyers somehow triggered the early activation of the Gate and ensured his own marker's existence. He couldn't simply kill Zach, because Zach was still the true Controller, and necessary for the function of loop.

And something that always bothered me was Zach's disappearance in Zorian's loops 2-7, and recently how similar it was to Veyer's own disappearance, which makes sense if RR kidnapped an unconscious Zach at the beginning of each of the loops and used some sort of trick to keep him unconscious for the remainder, but was unwilling to that on his own in every loop because the risk of causing an early restart was too high.
