  Mystery not resolved: why do certain Ironbeaks hate invaders? This one could be an important clue.
#+end_quote

There was some info on that somewhere around assault on the zombie mansion. I remember Sudomir holds their hatchlings hostage and uses some domination spells on the alphas, so I inferred that if Zorian mind controls said alpha it resets Sudomir's control and their true intentions are revealed. However most of the ironbeaks are not in the know and don't hold a grudge against invaders.
