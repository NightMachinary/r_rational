Not quite. The iron beaks are smart enough to understand a hostage situation, so they all hate the invaders, but they're not smart enough to realize that their leaders are subverted, so they generally play along.

There just happen to be a few individuals that are independent-minded and/or bloodthirsty enough that when Zorian suggests actually attacking the invaders, they run with it.
