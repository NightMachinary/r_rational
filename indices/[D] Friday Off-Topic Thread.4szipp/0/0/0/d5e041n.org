I am really interested in studying AI/DL, but I don't have a lot of experience yet. I have generated this text by following [[https://medium.com/deep-writing/how-to-write-with-artificial-intelligence-45747ed073c#.tbgeeyfye][this]] tutorial, it's very simple, and I did not write the actual code or do any research.

If you're interested in Deep Learning and Tensor Flow, I highly recommend [[https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-with-python/][this]] book. I'm reading it right now and it's awesome. It doesn't go deeply into difficult math and does not have a long list of prerequisites, instead it describes an easy way to get started with DL, explains how to quickly start building stuff and learn everything else on practice. It's helping me a lot.

Also there's a free course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, it's a great introduction into general ML, it was very useful to me as well.
