Inclusionists have been complaining about Wikipedia's deletionists policies for more than a decade. It's not going away.

Many sites were made to try to replace Wikipedia outright, but none found success. What ended up happening is that wikipedia was +replaced+ complemented by a million smaller online encyclopedias, each focusing on one aspect of the world that Wikipedia thinks is not notable. The sites you mention only exist because the deletionists won and people moved that content from Wikipedia to sites like wikia and TVTropes.

I'm not sure what this means for the potential successor sites to TVTropes. Maybe replacing TVTropes outright is hopeless but separate sites for the discussion and storage of encyclopedic knowledge about all the different fandoms that were rejected by TVTropes will start to emerge.
