Oh, and as for Re:Zero 15, it's probably hyperbolic to call it the best anime episode you've ever seen, but some people have in fact been calling it that.

The rationality of the series hasn't really increased yet (Though the MC growing the fuck up does seem imminent), but if anyone has dropped the series, I suggest picking it back up if only to get to this episode.
