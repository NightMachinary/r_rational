Wait, Zouken does have the sorts of goals a [[/r/rational]] user would find somewhat reasonable. His excecution is arguably off, but his goal is basically just utopia... and then immortality. Did you mean fate/zero caster? That seems a bit more in line with the other listed villains...

Anyway complete monster type villains are my favorite. I've been on record saying I'm pro xenofiction, pro alien goals. The culmination of that in a villain, is someone that isn't trying to make utopia, they aren't doing it for the evuls, they kill your family because the suffering you feel by seeing them dead is identical to the suffering they feel by seeing them alive. A perfect inversion of the human moral compass, that is my ideal villain.

Honestly I don't think I've ever seen anything quite to that extreme in fiction, which is a shame.
