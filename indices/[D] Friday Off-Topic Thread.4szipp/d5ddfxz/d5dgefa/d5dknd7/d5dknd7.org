Mostly I interpreted it as sir_pirriplin suggested, Zouken [[#s][Fate/Heaven's Feel]].

Zero/Caster is a better exponent though, thanks for the reminder. I always forget about him due to how little he appeared in the anime.

So you think it'd be possible to have a villain like that and still count the work as rational? It made me wonder because otherwise we would be severely limited on the type of villains we can get.
