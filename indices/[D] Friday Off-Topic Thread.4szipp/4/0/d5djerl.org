Whatever you do, write with a backlog, preferably one at least three chapters long. (large?)

I can't tell you how many times being able to go back and change something in an unpublished chapter written a few weeks ago has saved my ass writing Horizon Breach. Just yesterday, I changed the order of two chapters and moved around some sections because I noticed an error in the timeline.
