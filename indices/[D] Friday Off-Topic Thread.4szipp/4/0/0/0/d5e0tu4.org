  I also have my doubt about my ability to maintain a backlog.

It's not difficult-- if you have the discipline to write your chapters on time, all you have to do is start writing a few weeks before beginning to post, and delaying chapters so you update at the same rate, but are working on your periodic update x chapters ahead.

  The story is already fleshed out, so I don't need a backlog.
#+end_quote

Backlogs aren't intended to solve story-level plot holes. What they do is keep things consistent from chapter to chapter. At the pace most serial writers write (that is, less than a chapter a week) it can be enough time to forget things between chapters and unintentionally cause minor, but SOD breaking snarls.

In addition, if you look back and notice your pacing seems wonky, you can change things around a bit.

Real* authors have the advantage of being able to go back and edit everything into coherency, but serial writings don't have that benefit. A backlog lets you fake it.

(*that is, traditional authors.)
