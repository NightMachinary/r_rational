/It's not difficult-- if you have the discipline to write your chapters on time/

I don't write chapters according to a fixed schedule, though I do write everyday for about forty minutes or so, the other twenty minutes or so go to support programming for my writings. I can write 400 words on a good day, but it's usually less than that, say 250. If we consider a chapter to be about three thousand words, then it will take me almost two weeks to finish a chapter.

That is not considering the editing process. I don't have a beta-reader to help out either.

There's no way I am going to have a webserial that run a chapter a week, while I continue to write ahead. I will run out of backlog really fast. I am that slow.
