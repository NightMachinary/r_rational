  There's no way I am going to have a webserial that run a chapter a week, while I continue to write ahead. I will run out of backlog really fast. I am that slow.

That... might be a problem. From what I've seen, by far the most important part of getting something popular on the internet is /consistency./ Having a kickass premise and excellent writing is great and all, but you, above all, need to keep people invested in your story. Look at Spacebattle's creative writing section-- even lesser known fandoms have threads that balloon out into the hundreds of pages with consistent updates, but there are plenty of good wormfics that people just lose interest in because they stop getting updated for a while.

That's especially true for an original work. While I'm not necessarily representative of the general population, I keep up with web serials by bookmarking the latest chapter and checking back every two weeks. If it's not updated for a while (my hard cutoff is six months, but I've dropped more recent stories pretty often) I remove it from my bookmarks and forget about it. Other people might do different things, but it's hard to care about a story if you've been away from it long enough to forget about the last chapter.

If you write chapters that slowly you almost certainty need some for of backlog, at least for the initial part of the story to get people invested. I'd also recommend dropping your chapter sizes to two thousand, or even one thousand words if it gets you updating weekly or, if necessary, once every two weeks. If you absolutely have to, update monthly. A consistent update schedule is key, and from there it's not too difficult to make a backlog.

Though there is some hope-- the more you write, the faster you get. Look at how much you type for reddit comments. The problem isn't sheer speed, it's being able to think of how events should follow one another to get to what you want.

  I don't have a beta-reader to help out either.

Incidentally, I don't currently have anything to edit, which makes me open to doing it. Mind giving me a basic story summary (over pm if necessary)? I can't guarantee that I'd do it, but I'm at least willing to try.
