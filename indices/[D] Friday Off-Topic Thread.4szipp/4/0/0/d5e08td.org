The story is already fleshed out, so I don't need a backlog. I also have my doubt about my ability to maintain a backlog.

I just need to make sure that the story is logical and consistent.

It's more the supporting elements I am working and worrying about. Trans-d travel, apparent coincidence, immortal rulers...That's kind of stuff.
