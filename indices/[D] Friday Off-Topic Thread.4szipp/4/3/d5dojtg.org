I separate worldbuilding in two aspects, hard and soft:

- hard worldbuilding is stuff that may break the setting and plot apart if/when revised, e.g. how does the physics of the world work?, large and powerful secrets (e.g. conspiracies)?, moral outlook of main characters, story goals (e.g. hpmor was intended to be a rationalist story, you can't figure this out as you go).
- soft worldbuilding is stuff that can be modified without breaking things apart, e.g.: protagonist' background/goals, names, geography, politics.

I try to nail every hard aspect before writing the first chapters, but I may write a few scenes to flesh out some ideas, and try to have an idea about every soft aspect, sometimes written down.
