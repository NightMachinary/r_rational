For me I start with an idea or concept and try and flesh it out adding details over time. While doing this I try to think of the implications of whatever rules, events and situations are occurring how do they affect the world?

Over time I try and add to these adjusting things removing bits and even splitting a fictional world idea into multiple world scenarios independent from each other. The vast majority of these will go no where but there are always gems of ideas that I hope to finally make into stories.

Take any concept and try thinking about the implications that would have on society if it were to suddenly happen. This is the mind set I use for doing world building. When establishing your "present" time frame for your story you also need to develop the history of the world as that affects how the inhabitants will interact. Not every event will happen in the most predictable way take a look at real world history for that reference. More over the accepted history is not necessarily the real history yet both can have trickle down effects that need to be accounted for.

For me this comes easy however creating a story out of this is a lot harder for me as the personal level details come a lot harder to me than the big picture (It is just the way my brain works). Thus I usually go back to world building after hitting a wall when trying to write a story... Maybe some day I will finish a chapter?

I don't know if my thought process will be helpful to you especially as it is flawed in that I get stuck on the world building phase adding more and more details.\\
I can't do character interactions on a personal level or come up with even simple names. I start from the mindset of a scientist and historian. I know how the events in my worlds will generally play out how the large scale society will react economically socially and politically but I fail at translating that to the individual level.
