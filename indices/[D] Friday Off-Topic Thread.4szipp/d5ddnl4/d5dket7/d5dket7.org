I do as much as feasible with the understanding that some things are going to have to change when it comes to the actual writing. I usually start writing once I've answered all of what I'd consider to be the interesting questions of worldbuilding. I also usually sketch out a very rough map of whatever area I intend to cover.

I've done it the other way (the "just write" method) but that's left me with a lot of projects that I put thousands of words into and then don't want to complete because I'm going to have to go back and change too much.
