Writing process:

How much worldbuilding and prep work people tried to do beforehand before...say writing a new web serial.

It turned out that worldbuilding is very hard for me to do. I tend to worldbuild as I write. Then I run into the obvious problem of writing on the fly with no idea as to the direction I am aiming for.

Then again, I think you would have the same problem if you try to worldbuild rather than jump into writing stories.
