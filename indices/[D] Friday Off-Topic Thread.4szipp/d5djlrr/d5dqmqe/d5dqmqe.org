Wow that was beautiful. I had read how TensorFlow was the future for Machine Learning algorithms but hadn't given it serious thoughts until I saw your example.

I'm very interested in knowledge representation on general AI, will check it in more depth.

Have you made research with Tensor Flow before or do you use it more as a hobby?
