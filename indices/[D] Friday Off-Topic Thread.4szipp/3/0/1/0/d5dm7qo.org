  So you think it'd be possible to have a villain like that and still count the work as rational?

In Unsong, the Archangel Uriel points out that evil can still be 'rational' if you have an unusual utility function:

  “I understand this is confusing,” Sataniel said. “I didn't get it all at once. My first thoughts were the same as yours were -- it doesn't make sense, it doesn't glorify God, we'd have to smite ourselves -- I thought all of these things at first, trust me. But the more Thamiel explained to me, the more it started to come together. You've got to believe me, there's a sort of mental distance here, but there's a self-consistent position on the other side. Like, for example, if we were to defy God, we could smite those who didn't defy God.”

  “But I still maintain that that wouldn't increase the glory of God very well!” said Haniel.

  “Right!” said Michael, “and how would we sing songs of praise? If we smote those who didn't defy God, we'd have to smite ourselves every time we sung a song of praise! There are some serious loopholes here.”

  “Sataniel's position is self-consistent,” said Uriel, without looking up from the parchment he was writing his proof on. “It's like representing our desires in a utility function, then multiplying by negative one.”
