  Like, once a villain is ok with double-crossing the hero right after the hero spares him you have to start to wonder whether any human could possibly develop a utility function where that's sensible.

Not sure why that's so farfetched. From a rational perspective, as the villain, there could be a dozen reasons to off the hero after he spares you. Of course, they all assume you have the actual means to do it. Villains who try to double cross the hero but are woefully outclassed (a la Frieza vs Goku) are plain stupid. But, in a world where knives kill people, killing someone that spares you could easily fit into a conventional utility function.
