Sure. Firstly, not everyone needs to be rational for the work to be.

Secondly, Serial killers do exist in real life. Sometimes they even hold an idiot ball in real life, leaving clues and such, just because that's part of what's bringing them enjoyment. Strictly speaking, that's always a bad idea, but I would still call it rational if the utility of the thrill they get outpaces the chance of getting caught multiplied by the potential cost. They only really stop being rational when they start underestimating that chance.

Being rational just means legitimately doing your best to optimize utility within the context of your own utility function. You can't call a particular utility function itself irrational.

That said rational fiction also has to have reasons for things. Serial killers are a real phenomenon. So a few of them here and there seems plausible without much further explanation. But there's still a limit to how evil you can go before you start needing some special reason in your story as to how a villain got to be so mindbogglingly inhumanly evil. Like, once a villain is ok with double-crossing the hero right after the hero spares him you have to start to wonder whether any human could possibly develop a utility function where that's sensible.
