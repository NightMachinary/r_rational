  Zouken does have the sorts of goals a [[/r/rational]] user would find somewhat reasonable
#+end_quote

Zouken is more of a tragic villain. He was a good guy who couldn't find a way to stop senility until he was just crazy enough to be evil but not crazy enough to be harmless.

  A perfect inversion of the human moral compass, that is my ideal villain.
#+end_quote

Unsong has a villain like that. Not a very rational piece of fiction, but it sounds like you would enjoy it.
