So I'm curious, what were your thoughts on the last Re:Zero episode?

Personally I loved the balance of animation (the battles were short but interesting), voice acting (which IMO was on point) and music. Particularly [[https://youtu.be/Hi2Xhg5qpo0][the piece that played]] through the episode and how they kept intensifying the sound until reaching the crescendo and rolling credits. It felt like something out of a Western drama.

An interesting point I saw on the direction of the anime is that they [[#s][Re:Zero Web Novel]]. I think besides time constraints it also speaks about the need for scenes to make a point and show some aspect of character development, lest it degrade from the impact and turn into torture porn. I think that links nicely with how another member here complained about how unnecesary are sex scenes in adult literature and movies and I think needless violence must also be moderated and exist to advance the story rather than letting the story drag for the sake of mindless torture. Even in hardcore smut a good story and cohesive plot can make a work go from simply shock factor to something truly memorable.

I think the web novel failed in that aspect and taking from the closest rational work we have, Mother of Learning, it'd be like taking Zorian and making him fail over and over through several chapters without him attempting to at least escape, try to solve the problem or show aspects of his changing psychology. I think that's bound to bore readers and make the scenes lose their impact, leading to readers rage quitting out of frustration.

Now the villain was a curious mix of creepy and comical. I have mixed feelings about him as while I initially found him very creepy in how he takes glee on suffering, after rewatch the impact is a bit lost and he feels more jarring and even a bit silly. I think in part it serves to lessen the darkness of the scenes he appears in with his silly antics and that has been my justification so far but I'm curious on what you think about him.

I'm mainly curious on this community's thoughts on that kind of villain given that they are so far from rational ideals. I know that rational literature aims for villains that are on the more gray end of the scales and have a clear purpose and rational approach to problem solving (ex. Luthor from Metropolitan Man) so has anyone ever attempted to tackle a villain like The Joker, [[#s][Fate/Heaven's Feel]] or [[#s][Re:Zero]]?

Would you attempt to give them a reason to behave that way and a method to their madness or are okay with Complete Monster type of villains? I think not all villains have to be likable or redeemable as long as there're consequences to their actions or they act like bully types/grunts to more manipulative and calculating villains but I'm curious on what the community thinks of them.

About the relationship, I like how they have been developing Rem and Subaru's relationship and it seems as if their interactions were leading to this episode. I think they still fall for some clich√©s with the more jarring being that they show happy moments with the character or the character smiling before they brutally kill them. I suppose the aim is to increase the attachment to the character and make it feel more strongly but I think for seasoned viewers it would have the opposite effect as the moment those scenes appear you know the character is a goner and can emotionally prepare for it.

I've read some complains about how much they have neglected Ram and Emilia but I'm more interested in Rem right now and I like what they've been doing with her so far.

I like how they showed Rem's [[#s][Re:Zero]].

Also Subaru finally got forced to face the consequences of what inaction can do and seems to finally have decided to stop avoiding his problems. Whether he will do the right thing or not is also to be seen.

Personally I've been wishing they also delved a bit more into the politics of the setting as they seem particularly convoluted and interesting but I suppose we're stuck with Subaru for the time being.

Despite that the guy [[#s][Re:Zero 15]] was my favorite and one of the best I've seen in anime so far in emotional depth, can't argue for rational congruence.

It seems the story points towards a villain origin story and have to say it has been interesting so far even if Subaru still is the weakest link IMO given how little we know about him and how he seems to jump into situations without thinking.

On another note that's related, how long do you spend writing a fic before submitting it? And how much do you re-read it to detect wheter there's any irrational element? Do you get help from betas?

I've always been too impatient so usually wrote my previous fics in a few hours and then hit submit without proof checking because I fear losing patience/inspiration or going into a depression period and forgetting about it.

It has caused pretty glaring flaws and for the stories to flip flop between dark comedy/drama from one chapter to another.

Also I tend to take extremes without thinking, for example if I enjoyed how some comedy turned out, then the next chapter ends up having even more comedy even if it was originally meant to be a serious story. Or if some references were well received then I assume it'd be great to have even more references and it ends up cluttering the story. I'm trying to find a way to purge those flaws from my writing.

After learning of rational literature I've been wanting to adjust to this new style although so far it has been limited to consuming it and trying to find common trends I aim to adapt to my writing style but I'm dying to write again.

Besides that continuing language learning, about to finish the Kanji now I must figure how to craft sentences with them.

And finally got to start The Foundation series by Asimov, excited about the beginning of it.
