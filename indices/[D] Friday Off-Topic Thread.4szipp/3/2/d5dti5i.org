  On another note that's related, how long do you spend writing a fic before submitting it? And how much do you re-read it to detect whether there's any irrational element? Do you get help from betas?

It really depends on what it is. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction][/Instruments of Destruction/]] was written very quickly over the course of two hours, got a single editing pass, then went up that same day without too much thought. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie][/Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie/]] is roughly the same length, but I spent three times as much effort reworking it until I'd gotten everything more or less "right".
