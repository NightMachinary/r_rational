So, anyone remember me [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ngpow/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d43tbd0][complaining about my hate of soccer and wanting to do something productive out of it?]]

Well... my country won the Euro cup and everything exploded, the soccer nationalism lever was pushed to the max and this pretty much shutdown any possibility of integrating criticism of it into society through the next years. This annoys me more than anything else, but it certainly does not help with my previous problem.

Just in case anyone had a revelation, any ideas on where to productively go from here?
