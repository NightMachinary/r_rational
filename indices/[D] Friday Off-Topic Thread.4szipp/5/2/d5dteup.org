I think that this might be the first time Chris-chan has been mentioned on this sub. Which is interesting, because CWCville has some (but not all) of the features of an NRX society: most importantly, an absolute czar, and what seems like a strongly reduced presence of "the Cathedral" (however, this is probably because CWCville itself exists only in his mind).
