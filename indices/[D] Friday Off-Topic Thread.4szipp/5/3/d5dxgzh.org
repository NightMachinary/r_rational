My problem with criticism of the TVtropes moderation is that I remember the really bad old days.

I remember the first time I saw an online post commenting about the toxic elements of TVtropes and having a flashback to some days before when I was binging on it and I stumbled upon what was in retrospect a very pedophiliac comment. Suddenly it became easy to see a very dark side of TVtropes in its comments and interpretations, and that soured the site for me for a long time.

So I don't really see it as an inherent problem that they remove certain pages when those kind of problems pop up once more, I expect that they might be a bit overzealous but I highly prefer that to see the site burn from the inside once again.
