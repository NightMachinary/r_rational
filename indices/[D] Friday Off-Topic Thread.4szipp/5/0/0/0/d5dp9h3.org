When Star Wars fans got mad at Wikipedia for deleting non-notable Star Wars stuff, they didn't make a new Wikipedia dedicated specifically to non-notable stuff. That would be silly. Instead, they made a wiki about specifically Star Wars.

Likewise if Time Braid fans are upset that TVTropes deleted that entry because of NSFW content, it's probably a bad idea to make a TVTropes for NSFW works. It's better to make something like a FanficTropes or even NarutoFanficTropes website.
