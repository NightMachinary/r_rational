Problem is that then you get a bunch of unrelated wikias in many places. One of the things I like of Tv Tropes is that I can search for a specific theme and find all the works that follow that trope.

Its very useful to find new stories or interpretations of a given theme without having to read all the work beforehand and facilitates deciding whether something is worth reading or not.
