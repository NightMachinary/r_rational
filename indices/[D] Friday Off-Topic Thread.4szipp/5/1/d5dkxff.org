  I still don't particularly like Wikia, but I haven't seen any especially-irksome ads on it in a while--and, in the course of writing this comment, I discovered that there's a second All the Tropes Wiki

Probably. In a way it reminds me of an event that happened here when the [[/r/news]] sub started censoring information about a shooting and there was a progressive backlash towards other subs that allowed those threads.

Reddit addressed that complaint and slowly have been trying to turn opinion back but Tv Tropes doesn't seem to be attempting to listen to the community.

My only problem with the All The Tropes Wikia is that they still lack information on a lot of sources but it seems to be doing well and probably may replace TvTropes if those issues of censorship continue.

I agree that its annoying, particularly because these are fictional works.
