Generation of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_neighborhood_graph][relative-neighborhood graph]] on the surface of a cube (or on the surface of a sphere and [[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjPoly/projPoly2.html][projected onto a cube]], if you prefer): [[http://i.imgur.com/NnmWIZJ.png][100 points]], [[http://i.imgur.com/br1JJ54.png][300 points]], [[http://i.imgur.com/vlxtzW6.png][1000 points]]

I was at first stymied by the problem of drawing segments that crossed discontinuities--but then I remembered that I could just draw the faces individually and stitch them together later in [[http://www.gimp.org][The GIMP]]! I find this initial oversight rather hilarious in hindsight.

It's kind of interesting to consider what's necessary to push you away from a website.

Some months (years?) ago, I noticed that TV Tropes had removed its [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBraid][article]] on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/--due, of course, to its portrayals of intercourse between minors. (On [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/remarks.php?trope=FanficRecs.NarutoPeggySueFics][this page]] can be found a discussion of how this removal is unfair when the page for /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/, which contains several similar scenes, is still up.) This annoyed me, but I definitely didn't care enough to declare (to myself...) an official boycott of the site--especially when I wasn't aware of any alternatives, and when I hardly used TV Tropes anyway.

Some months (years?) later (and ago), I somehow (through checking whether /Time Braid/'s page on TV Tropes had been reinstated, maybe?) became aware of [[http://allthetropes.wikia.com][the All the Tropes Wiki]], which [[http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/All_The_Tropes:Why_Fork_TV_Tropes][apparently]] had been founded in response to the TV Tropes crackdown on NSFW pages (most infamously, IIRC, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyTentacles][Naughty Tentacles]], which, IIRC, used to have a warning reading something like "We don't want content like this on this website" rather than a standard "deleted page" message, before the site's recent major update). Again, I didn't care too much about officially switching what little allegiance I had--since I hardly used TV Tropes in the first place, since I assumed that the new website must have significantly fewer editors and less content than the well-established version, and since I already disliked Wikia after once or twice being attacked with browser-redirecting ads on the [[http://naruto.wikia.com][Naruto]] and [[http://gundam.wikia.com][Gundam]] wikis (and also because it always seemed rather unresponsive). Still, in the past few months, I've drifted toward linking to All the Tropes rather than to TV Tropes when a link would be useful.

I still don't particularly like Wikia, but I haven't seen any especially-irksome ads on it in a while--and, in the course of writing this comment, I discovered that there's [[https://allthetropes.org][a /second/ All the Tropes Wiki]] on a non-Wikia site! Thus is completed my slow transfer of allegiance from TV Tropes to All the Tropes, I guess...

(I wonder--[[http://www.reddit.com/r/WikiInAction][will a similar process ever happen with Wikipedia?]])

Some weeks ago, I was very interested to see the esteemed [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4modgn/monthly_recommendation_thread/d42go68?context=9][mention]] that he wrote directly in "raw [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets][CSS]]". I've done a few simple things with HTML, just for fun (in addition to some school assignments in the distant past)--copying from /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps][GURPS]]/ books ([[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Dogfighting%20Combat.html][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/FGeKwUx.png][2]]), making [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Italia%20structure.html][a tree structure]] of a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings][/Crusader Kings 2/]] game, uploading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11746791/1][a chapter]] to FanFiction.net (after seeing zillions of authors whine about how their non-=<hr/>= section-break markings were constantly devoured by the site--tee-hee!), and writing a program to download chapters from FanFiction.net (with everything but the text of the story removed). It really is fascinating, to see how a bunch of complicated, repetitive actions can be moved and condensed into the header of an HTML file, or into the classes and functions of a [[https://processing.org][Processing]] program, or into the styles of a Word document...

And, on the topic of forms of address--"*The esteemed* EagleJarl"! [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4rv3as/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d54bvcd]["*Mr.* Yudkowsky"]]! It's an interesting balancing act. On the one hand, anyone who can write a long, interesting, complete story is better than I am, and deserves thanks from me for condescending to allow me to read what he writes--but, on the other hand, exactly /how entertaining/ does a writer need to be in order to receive a title when referenced in his view?

Really, of course, a large part of it is just virtue signaling, both to the subreddit and to the referenced people themselves--I've got to one-up you plebes who call the codifier of your favorite genre so familiarly by his Kira-damned /first name!/--but part of it is /actual/ admiration, too. What's the cut-off? Would ShaperV deserve such treatment, if he frequented this subreddit? Would Orson Card? Would Chris-chan? (I mean, he /is/ a better artist than I am.) It's a /vaguely/-interesting question, I guess...
