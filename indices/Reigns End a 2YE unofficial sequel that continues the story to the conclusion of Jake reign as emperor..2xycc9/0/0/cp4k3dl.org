The problem with writing a story about the end of Jake's reign is that Jake controlling things tends to change the world incomprehensibly over the span of days to months. What we've seen happen with everyone getting FLEA'd up is just after about fifty days. Who knows what might happen after a hundred?

Also, Jake would have just ennobled everyone long ago, so people don't care about nobility anymore. What are the nobles going to do about it?

Also also, at some point Jake would remember the ritual that is apparently able to summon people from other worlds, and start reaching out to those more throughly, especially Earth, because they too deserve to lose their scarcity and inequality.
