I am so flattered that you did this; thank you.

Comments:

- You captured Jake's tone well
- There are a lot of run-on sentences, and the punctuation needs some attention -- read it aloud. Everywhere you pause, use a comma. When the thought changes, use a period. There's obviously more to it, but that's a good 80/20 win.
- I'll actually be releasing a very short epilogue chapter on 2YE in the next couple days, in which Jake makes it home. It's mostly so that the people who have the story on alert will know that there is new stuff, but I did want to do a little picture of what happens after Jake returns.

I'll look forward to the rest of Reign's End!
