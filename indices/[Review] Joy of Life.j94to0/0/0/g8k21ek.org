Maybe try reading again. It's really a good novel. The characters are intelligent, not just the main character. The main character use his modern-day knowledge, and his intelligence to outwit those in greater power. I believe the story is completely rational. The world, plot, character, and political development are really good and unique too. I suggest you reread the novel, make past chapter 30 and you will start to like the novel.
