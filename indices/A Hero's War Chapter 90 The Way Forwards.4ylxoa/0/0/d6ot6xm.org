I've known people who are asexual but still capable of romance. Didn't seem very unusual to me in 2016, but maybe in Inath it'll be a little more unconventional and odd. But then again, they're an engineer from another world and a magical mad scientist, so maybe everyone else will just put it up to their usual shenanicanery.
