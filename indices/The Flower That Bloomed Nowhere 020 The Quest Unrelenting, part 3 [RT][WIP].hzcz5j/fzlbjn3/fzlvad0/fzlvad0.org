I'm really glad you liked it! It's especially good to hear that the new intro worked. I felt like there were a ton of small experiential problems created by the fact that nothing really signals that it's a time loop mystery for new readers, since the removal of the original opening - a lot of people reported having a sense of "where is this going...?" Hopefully this will address that sentiment, at least to a point.
