True. I was thinking that it'd come across as a parody of those things, since my own experience made it feel that way. I wanted them to have that comparative experience, but you're probably right - it isn't necessary.

Sometimes, my extensive reading does cause some challenges :P It's hard to make myself understand what something would look like to someone who hasn't read so many things.

I appreciate your comment.
