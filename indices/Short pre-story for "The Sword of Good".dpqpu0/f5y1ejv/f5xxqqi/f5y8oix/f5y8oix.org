That's a good point, thank you.

My concern is that I'm pretty sure very few of them have voluntarily read anything similar. Movies, I guess those examples work well enough, too.

It wouldn't have to be immediately afterwards, either - I've got them until June. I could do a simpler story now, and the The Sword of Good in April or May.

I was more hoping to find a way to introduce them to the tropes without being a spoiler. The Sword of Good comes across as a parody at first, anyway, what with the silly names and such.

I may want to just jump into The Sword of Good later on, then, after they've gotten a little better at seeing depth in stories.

Thank you.
