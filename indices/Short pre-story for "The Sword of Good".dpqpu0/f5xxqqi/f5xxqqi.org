So you want a completely forgettable isekai / epic fantasy short story for your students to read before having them read a 9k-word story that spends a good part of its length masquerading as the former?

Even if you found something that matches your criteria (unlikely to exist /and/ be remembered), that sounds like a bad idea:

- You will likely lessen the enjoyment of /The Sword of Good/ for (some of) your students, because such a juxtaposition can function as a spoiler.
- After a bland first story, your students are more likely to just skip through the second one.

It is likely your students have watched at least /Lord of the Rings/, /Harry Potter/ and some isekai anime and whatnot and are sufficiently familiar with the relevant tropes.

If you think this is not the case, you could watch /Stardust/ together in class or something. You know, something actually interesting.

/EDIT:/ /Stardust/ is actually too long (whether as a book or a movie) to consume in a lesson or two. So maybe not that.
