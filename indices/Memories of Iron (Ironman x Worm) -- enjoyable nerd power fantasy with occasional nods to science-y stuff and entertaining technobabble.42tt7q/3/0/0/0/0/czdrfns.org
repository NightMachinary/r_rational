There's also a lot of writing (in general, but also for fanfics) that falls into the category of "fairly crappy, but some parts of it are appealing to some people" in every genre. If we're going to stick to fanfiction, there are a lot truly awful of Harry Potter fanfictions that are like 400k+ words (and some over a million words) with many, many reviews and favorites on fanfiction.net
