Worm as far as I can tell has a higher standard of writing in terms of grammar and such -likely because it's centered around a forum and it can be intimidating for bad writers (who can't just dump something on FFN and not taint their account) and they have a thread specifically for snippets so people can feel out interest or let things quietly die- but in terms of the character work, story choices and fanon stuff that's unsubstantiated...they're as bad as anyone.
