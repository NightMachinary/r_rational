Yeah, doesn't seem like it improves.

The big issue is that there's too much exposition from the narrator; the tech/worldbuilding stuff is fine but characters and dialogue should be handled more subtly. Show don't tell.

I'll be honest, I think this is one of the lowest quality of Worm Fanfics I've read. Which is rather surprising, considering how good Worm Fanfics usually are; they seem to be immune to Sturgeon's Law.
