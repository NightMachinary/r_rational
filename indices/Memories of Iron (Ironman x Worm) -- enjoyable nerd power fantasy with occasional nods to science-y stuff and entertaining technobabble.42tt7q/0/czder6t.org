There's a theme I'm noticing in Worm fan-fiction that's a solid departure from the original: The main characters get time to set up.

Original-Taylor never got enough time to be /ready/, although she did get time to prepare. Partly that's her own fault - that first night out, before everything was done, but that's /almost/ the only time she actually get enough time to get ready for something.
