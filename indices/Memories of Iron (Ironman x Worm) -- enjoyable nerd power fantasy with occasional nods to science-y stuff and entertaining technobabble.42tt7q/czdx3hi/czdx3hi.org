I had thought I would enjoy this, but the writing is just so /clunky/ that I can't get into it. The things that should be handwaved away instead are ground though at a glacial pace. In chap 6/7 the author goes over one set of information twice from three different perspectives without any of them really adding anything, and it's not the only time they do it. The characters feelings or thoughts aren't hinted to, but blatantly stated. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE][In conclusion.]]

But hey, other people are enjoying it so maybe this is a thing that I care about more than other people do.
