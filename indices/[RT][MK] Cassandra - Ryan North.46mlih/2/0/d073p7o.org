She can see the future, so presumably she can do something about the future she sees. Other people won't believe anything she says about possible future events due to the curse, so she can leverage the power of the curse to change what would happen, invalidating that future she sees.

This, of course, requires the assumption that the future she sees is mutable, rather than absolute. It would be a simpler solution to the conundrum, since the future she sees happening actually occuring despite information from the future would be by far more complex than the other possibility.

It seriously hinges on the rules of her future sight, but I would say it's a possible outcome, since the curse was that nobody would believe her, not 'she couldn't change the future', and Apollo wouldn't have given her the power to see the future in the first place unless it would be a useful power to have.
