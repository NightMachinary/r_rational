  It was a curse, dude. Apollo was cursing her.

I'd say what the effect is called would be rather irrelevant to what it actually does... (There's a reason we have a trope in fiction called "Cursed With Awesome")

Regardless, in the original myth(There's a bunch of versions, but they're generally similar), she gained the power of prophecy(to see the future) by promising her body to Apollo. Depending on the version, when she breaks her promise, Apollo either applies an effect that makes people disbelieve her when she utters the truth about a future event, or makes people disbelieve anything she says, regardless of whether it's related to her future knowledge or not.

Either of these effects could be leveraged by a sufficiently savvy actor, which is what the comic is making fun of.
