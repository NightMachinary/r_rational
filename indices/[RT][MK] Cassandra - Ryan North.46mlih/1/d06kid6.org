If y'all haven't read North's "The Midas Flesh", I highly recommend it.

The premise is, Midas is real, the entire Earth is gold (because its all touching his flesh), and aliens want to weaponize the flesh.

Its pretty awesome, and fits this sub fairly well. The characters are all relatively intelligent and act in believable ways.
