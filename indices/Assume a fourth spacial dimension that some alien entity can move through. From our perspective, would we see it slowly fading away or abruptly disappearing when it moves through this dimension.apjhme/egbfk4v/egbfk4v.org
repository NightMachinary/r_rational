There's an EXCELLENT anthology for the rational mind, if you can find a copy, called Fantasia Mathematica. It's a collection of short stories, poems, etc. that all relate back to solid mathematics. The reason I bring it up in this context is that at least one of the stories involved trying to communicate with a 4th dimensional being who happened to be intersecting with our section of 3-dimensional space. Not that they realized this at first. But there is a very good analogy about a person moving through a paper-world, much like the one given by [[/u/IICVX][u/IICVX]] related to the hand. Eventually, the protagonist figures out what is going on and prods the cross-section until the equivalent of an eye or an ear or something is in our space so that they can communicate.

...I think there was also a very confusing description of a person getting lost in 4D space, but that may have been another story from the anthology.
