I like what you did with the clothes. I haven't thought of that before, but that does seem like a mostly reasonable way for them to act. However, since the gargoyle moved and then stopped, I would expect his clothes to follow through the movement until they are arrested. I think the clothes should appear shortly after the transformation finishes, only for them to instantly disappear again when their 4-momentum carries them through 3-space and out the other side. I'd also expect them to appear in bizarre disconnected ribbons, tracing the shapes of 4D wrinkles, until they are straightened.

I'd expect more bizarre disconnected ribbons throughout the entire transformation, actually. A 4-dimensional gargoyle shouldn't have blobby melted wings, it should have a 4-dimensional bone structure supporting its 3D membrane, so you'd see fingers appearing and disappearing as the overall shape shrinks, often broken up or seeming to slide around depending on how they are positioned in 4-space (moving generally away from where the wrist was), before finally the membrane splits apart leaving a cluster of spikes suspended in the air, before those too shrink in on themselves and vanish. Either that, or the wings should disappear almost as quickly as the clothes appear. The blob of hypervolume you describe sounds pretty useless, so the wings would probably just be as flat as possible. But that's boring.

If I were a gargoyle stepping through 4-space, I expect that it would be hard to keep my tail perfectly aligned to the flatlanders' plane, causing it to break apart and snake around through the air, without the rippling pattern moving with it. And since tails usually point backwards, I'd expect the pointed tip of the tail to briefly reappear before being the last of it to vanish.

For similar reasons, hair might sprout from the scalp (in flickering static patterns, because you're never actually seeing the same hairs for more than a moment), but depending on how large 4-space is, that might get lost in a halo of suspended strands that flash in and out, where the hairs from other 3D cross sections are hanging over - it might look more like the hair is precipitating out of the air than like it is growing. But if the hair is especially short, then maybe not, or maybe this would only be noticeable at the end.

Of course, all this could just be extraraneous detail that breaks the flow, and it all presupposes different 4D shapes and movements then what you've described, just because I think it would be cooler and more striking. So, y'know, do as you will. I enjoyed thinking about it.
