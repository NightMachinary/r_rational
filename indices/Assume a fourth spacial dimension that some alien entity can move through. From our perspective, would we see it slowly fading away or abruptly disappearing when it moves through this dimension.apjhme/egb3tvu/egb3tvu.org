If the extra dimension is topologic, then the alien would appear to compress into an infinitely thin vertical line.

If temporal, it'd be much weirder. You could for example see a second time-reversed clone walking around in reverse until it joined back with its original and the two would seem to "nullify" each other and disappear entirely.
