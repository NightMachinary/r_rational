Basically, the answer boils down to "what shape does the alien entity have in four dimensions?", because it'll cycle through those shapes.

Is it a simple hyper-platonic solid? Then it'll shrink down into itself before disappearing. Or, since they're not really that well defined, gradually turn into another solid (like a sphere turning into a cube or something) before disappearing.

On the other hand, a hyper-cylinder would look like a sphere (probably, I can't do 4d rotations in my head) and remain the same size and shape in 3-space until it suddenly pops out of existence. If the cylinder is all the same color you wouldn't be able to even tell that it was moving in the 4th dimension until it popped out of existence; on the other hand, if you were to apply some hyper-paint to the thing, you'd see it gradually change color. Otherwise, it'd be the same color for the duration of it's existence. This is what happens to the mysterious sphere that appears out of nowhere in Iain M. Banks' /Excession/.

Moving along from simple shapes, you could maybe have a long human-shaped 4-tube. Then as it moves in the fourth dimension it'll turn into slightly different humans. Potentially becoming smaller as it reaches the "narrow" end of itself. This is sort of the shape that one of the characters in John C. Wright's Chronicles of Chaos takes, though her 4-tube also has some non-human segments as well.

Of course, this is the simple and easy to understand end of the spectrum. On the other end, it's entirely possible for multiple things that are not connected in 3-space to be connected in 4-space.

Imagine making a claw out of your hand, and dipping it through the surface of a still pond. At the interface between air and water, there are suddenly 5 distinct bodies; any flatlanders living on the surface of the pond suddenly see five new entities. And yet, those five entities are not truly separate - they are a single entity, bound through an unintelligible dimension.

Along this axis, you could potentially have an entire "race" of beings, who are all simply projections of a single hyper-entity that's merely dipping its *fingers* into our reality. The shape those beings take would, again, depend on how the entity's 4-dimensional shape projects into 3 dimensions, but you can easily imagine such creatures "blinking" out of existence and reappearing elsewhere, without traversing the intervening 3-space. The Orz in Star Control 2 are most likely an example of this sort of shenanigans.
