Nah, we reasoned that if the clothes slowly appeared, then each cross section would have its own custom-tailored suit that forms a seamless gradient between its neighbours, which seems... impractical. Or, he'd need a 4-dimensional tailor to tailor him a 4-dimensional suit, which would be much less practical as it wouldn't be as easy to change your attire with the times.

I forget what exactly our logic was with the clothing having to come back into being with a "tug", but I think part of it is that the intertia of it being in 4D space would make it need to be helped along a bit. Maybe it'd slowly "fall" into view given time, but if you want to not be nude in front of your new friends, you should probably tug your pants into frame.

I just realised I also wrote a "transforming from human to monster" scene, which I'll include below. It's pretty rough but it has the clothing disappearing and evidence that his weight changes (perpetual motion here we come!):

--------------

And so, he begins to change. First, the top of his jeans disappears, and the legs slowly begin to vanish as his thighs and calves begin to expand. They do not appear to melt into his skin; no, they seem to simply vanish. Each part of him grows larger and minutely more beige in colour. Small hovering blobs appear behind his shoulders and near the floor, beginning to grow little tendrils, reaching towards his body. His shirt disappears, tendrils coming from his shoulders and the base of his spine and reaching towards the three sets of blobs at his back, as they get bigger, undulating ever so slightly before joining together to form a solid mass of wings and a tail.

His feet start growing bigger inside his sandals, his toenails growing almost razor sharp. As the fabric of his sandals begins to strain under the rapidly growing foot within, the entire shoe seems to disappear, as well.

Naturally, he grows heavier; the floorboards creak as the weight that is on them changes; he holds his tail and hands on the ground in an attempt to distribute his weight evenly, but there's a soft crack as one of the weaker floorboards yields to his mass.

He crouches on the floor, holding his head close to the floor so he doesn't hit himself on the roof. When standing straight, he must be fully 15 feet tall, not including the tail, which adds an additional fifteen feet to his total length. His fingers and toes are both tipped in wicked, curved claws; he doesn't have feet but a second set of dextrous â€˜hands'. He's a pale, sandy colour with some orange flourishes; the colour of sandstone. Folded at his back are a pair of batlike wings, each three times the size of his torso in area when fully stretched. His long tail snakes out from behind him.
