Here's a different answer: string theory relies on there being additional spatial dimensions that are just "too small to detect" - like how a rope might look like a 1D line from far away, even though up close you can see that it's a 2D surface with one of the dimensions rolled up into a small circle.

What if you /could/ move in these rolled-up dimensions? Well, here quantum mechanics rears its head. If the fourth dimension is curled up very small, the quantum states of definite energy will look like sine waves that fit neatly into this curled-up dimension. We're not points at some particular spot in the 4th dimension, instead we're poured into it and fill it up like water filling up a fishtank.

So an alien that's moving through the 4th dimension smoothly would look constant to us, assuming that we're in the lowest-energy state, because we're already spread out along the 4th dimension. It's just going to have some property that's impossible for us to see, and normal matter that touches it might get evaporated (unless you outlaw the normal physical forces pushing anything in the 4th direction).

But an alien that's jumping between 4D energy states discontinuously (involving huge amounts of energy, but we might suppose that this energy is /also/ coming from / going to 4D space) would be able to turn invisible to us, because different pure sine waves are what's called "orthogonal" - they overlap negatively exactly as much as they overlap positively. So all normal 3D forces would pass through them, and they'd only interact along the 4th dimension.

So again, this depends on how you decide on physical forces - if the electromagnetic force still works in the 4th dimension, then if you bumped into an alien that was in a different 4D state than you, first of all it's invisible (or at least the parts in a different 4D state are), and when you overlapped in 3D space, the atoms that touched each other might bounce off like billiard balls - your atoms gaining energy and their atoms losing energy. If they're the same momentum state as you, this means you explode and die. But if they're in a different momentum state, maybe conservation of momentum means that all the energy has to stay in the 4th dimension, and so what you see is your atoms disappearing and the aliens' atoms suddenly appearing. Since you need your atoms all together to live, this would be bad.
