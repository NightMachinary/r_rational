I enjoyed reading your really thoughtful post! I think you raise some great points and I especially love that it seems that my terrible 4D intuition was mostly OK.

RE the appearance of the clothes with 4D wrinkles: when I was conceptualising the clothing, I was imaging him having 3D clothing that he'd just bought off the rack at a store. I likened it to me purchasing a "rubber band" in Flatland for me to wear around my finger. It doesn't come close to "covering my body", but as far as a flatlander is concerned, they never see my naked flesh. That said, a 3D object moving through 4D space would probably wrinkle in a strange way, just probably to a more limited extent.

  it should have a 4-dimensional bone structure supporting its 3D membrane, so you'd see fingers appearing and disappearing as the overall shape shrinks, often broken up or seeming to slide around depending on how they are positioned in 4-space (moving generally away from where the wrist was), before finally the membrane splits apart leaving a cluster of spikes suspended in the air, before those too shrink in on themselves and vanish.

This is true, but the gargoyle is made of sandstone (OK, a sufficiently advanced^{TM} polymer that appears to be sandstone in any meaningful way), so I think I can get away with the blobs? I do have conceptions of higher dimensional "natives" who would have bone structures/etc that operate over 4 dimensions though, where this would be highly relevant.

  I expect that it would be hard to keep my tail perfectly aligned to the flatlanders' plane, causing it to break apart and snake around through the air, without the rippling pattern moving with it.

I like this and may use it as an indication he's preoccupied, distracted, or angry. That said, there's no "external" 4D world: the extra dimension is purely used as a sort of "technology" to allow transformation (and some other magic) to work. So Gargoyles are only ever interacting in the 3D plane: they don't talk to each other in 4D-land or anything. So I think, largely, they'd get it pretty right with some fuzzing at the edges.

  hair might sprout from the scalp (in flickering static patterns, because you're never actually seeing the same hairs for more than a moment)

This whole thing about the hair is badass and I'm going to have to see if I can write it in a way that makes sense both from a Doylist point of view (can I get the information across clearly enough to the reader without getting super distracting?) and a Watsonian point of view (Red, the viewpoint character, has a lot to process in this moment: how much attention is he /really/ paying to the way the hair sprouts?)

Another fun consequence of being 4D is that the gargoyle has x-ray vision, which has been fun to account for in the story. Also, he uses his "magic" to disappear a mcguffin by throwing it into 4D space. And he has a bag of holding, as he can store items in a "backpack" on one of his "slices".
