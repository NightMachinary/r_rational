I want to expand on this excellent answer with a specific example, if that's okay!

My husband's a mathematician with a particular "recreational" interest in hyper-dimensional geometry (his research interests are billiards), so of course when [[/u/ccc_037]] suggested that transformations could be done "rationally" by using a 4D shape jutting different parts of itself depending on what form it takes, I of course had to write how it'd look.

I've included background description of the creature's initial form and a little dialogue, but i've marked in bold where the transformation starts if you want to skip to it as it's quite long.

It was, at first glance, a rather unremarkable statue. William had sent and received several during this war, though this one was larger and no doubt older. It was not made of metal or marble, but instead of coarse sandstone that was the light beige of weak tea---brewed for a short time, with more milk than water. It was the hunched form of a creature that Red had never seen before; he guessed that if it were standing straight it would be about twelve feet tall. Red gently ran his hand along the creature's tail, the rough stone feeling like brushed concrete. It seemed ordinary enough, considering. He wondered if there was anything more to it.

Red walked around the statue, examining its features. It was humanoid, with a torso full of rippling muscles. Its hands and feet were the size of dishes, tipped with wicked claws. Its tail was fifteen feet long, thick, and ended with a triangular point.

Its face resembled a particularly gaunt human, sunken and wrinkled with a protruding brow and bat-like ears: smooth and pointed, with ridges lining the inside. Its eyes were studded with pale blue gems; the only colour apart from the pale beige. Coming out of its head were curved, spiraling ram horns. Huge leathery wings were folded at its back. Despite its monstrous appearance, it seemed oddly familiar.

For all the sculptor's skill in carving the creature it was posed rather plainly: crouched, all four limbs on the ground, wings folded, its tail curled around the front of it, as though it was sitting and resting. He'd expected a statue of a creature like this---especially one that was meant to be more valuable than the magic apple tree---would be standing on its hind legs and roaring. But maybe vampires thought that would make it seem like they were compensating for something?

When William entered the sitting room and saw the fifteen foot statue, he immediately sat on the settee, staring at the floor for several minutes. Red stood in the doorway, not sure what he should do. Finally, when Red was wondering if it would be rude for him to leave, William broke the silence.

“Awaken.” He ordered, the commanding tone well-suited to his voice.

The creature obliged, its eyes turning into soulful pale blue orbs. Its ears twitched, picking up unheard sounds. It bowed.

“Good evening, your majesty. Duchess Elodia wished that I present myself into your service.”

“Rise.”

It stood as straight as it could; the height of the ceiling meant that he had to hunch over.

“Have you a more convenient form?”

“I do, your majesty. Do you wish to see it?”

“Yes.”

There was a momentary pause as the creature's skin began to change its pattern minutely, as though the skin was a pond that had had stones thrown into it, ripples propagating across it as the skin itself seemed to oscillate between being slightly closer and slightly further away. It made Red's eyes hurt a little to look at, as they kept trying to make minute changes to the way they focused on this strange, vibrating skin.

The gargoyle's tail began to grow thinner, as did the hands, horns, wings, and arms as the whole creature began shrinking. Soon, the wings were connected to its body by only a thin tendril that looked like it could not possibly support them before that too disappeared into nothingness, leaving the shapeless beige blobs that once were its wings seeming to float in mid-air. The blobs began to grow smaller until they could no longer be seen. The creature stretched its body upwards, finally able to stand straight as it reached a more reasonable height. It shrunk to seven feet, and settled there. Its horns had now disappeared entirely, and its ears had migrated from the top of its head down to where one might expect them to be, changing from their previously chiropteran appearance into a more familiar human shape. Thick black hair had begun to grow out of its skull, quickly settling on a fashionable short style with a prominent side part.

Indeed, the creature was looking mostly human now, and unclothed and clearly male. Red was tempted to look away, preserve some of its dignity, but he could not avert his eyes. This was like nothing he'd ever seen.

Finally, a brown belt appeared around his waist, looped onto a piece of black cloth that was scarcely wider than the belt itself. A tie appeared around his neck, similarly attached to a shirt collar, but no shirt. A pair of brown shoes---tied with laces---appeared on his feet.

The scantily clad man grabbed at his collar, and the rest of the shirt seemed to come into being all of a sudden, rippling momentarily in an unseen breeze. The effect gave Red a slight headache. The tall man performed a similar gesture on his belt, and the pants came into view with much the same effect. Red breathed a sigh of relief; he didn't think any of his clothing would have fit such a tall man.

Hope people find that interesting. It took some thinking and discussing with my husband how the clothes would be incorporated into the transformation - if anyone thinks I got any of that wrong, let me know, I'd love to fix it.
