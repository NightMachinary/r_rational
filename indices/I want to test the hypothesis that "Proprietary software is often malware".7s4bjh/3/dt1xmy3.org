Here's one possible definition of malware:

The software contains at least one 'feature' which provides negative benefit to the user.

An example of such a feature would be DVD region coding; this prevents a user from playing certain DVDs just because. Another example would be any software that attempts to deliberately deceive the user (if it gave a positive benefit, the deception would not be necessary).
