It might not have been couched well enough, but the idea is that it put a concrete value to how confident Red was in his decision.

If there's a price he might have taken to try it, then he must think there was a chance it would succeed (if not he wouldn't collect, obviously).

Realizing there's no price he would take to try it helps make it more tangible that he really didn't think there was a chance it any thin would work.

Does that make sense? I'm open to suggestions on either making it more explicit if it's not, or to the idea that it doesn't make sense at all :P
