I'm just going to say that maybe you should be a little bit more subtle with your references, "Crobatman" was borderline, but I found the reference to Lung and "Supermon" to distract from your story.

I'm also unsure about your pacing; but I'll put my faith in you for a few more chapters at least.

Don't let this comment fool you though, on the whole I'm really enjoying the story ;)
