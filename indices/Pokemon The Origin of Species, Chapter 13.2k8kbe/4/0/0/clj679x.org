Wow, that's not how I interpreted that at all.

  From what details you have provided, I would have acted as you did. If that is not sufficient to your sense of responsibility, and you still fear that you acted out of cowardice, consider this: how much money would you have accepted on the condition that you tried? -G

  Red lies awake into the next watch change, thinking about it. He eventually responds simply with None, and when he puts his phone away, he sleeps until morning without dreams.

This makes it sound like G is asking, "If you did help, how much of a reward would you have accepted?" and like Red is answering, "I wouldn't have accepted any payment." not "What amount of money would have convinced you to try?" and "There is no amount of money for which I would have tried." I definitely think you should reword this part if you were aiming for the latter set.
