Aside from the course of the story, however, the basic idea in this case was more that the information Red has is privileged: he is not the one that discovered this secret of clefairies, Daisy was. If Daisy wanted to make use of this information to make money, it's much more acceptable, because her work is what will result in the value of the clefairy going up.

Red profiting off it seems somewhat parasitic, and definitely raises my moral hackles: I don't know that he's exactly /cheating/ people, but he's definitely taking advantage of their ignorance, which makes the transaction unfair to me. It's not that they're incapable of determining the clefairy's "true value" and thus think the deal is worthwhile, either. If they had the same information and still wanted to sell it at the same price because they don't think it's worth more or don't think the information matters, that's their error in judgement. Red purposefully seeking them out because they don't, while knowing the information would change their price, makes it predatory, to me.

I'm open to the idea that I might be wrong. It makes little difference to the story, as I'm not writing Red as an author-insert, but as the main protagonist our values are obviously going to have some overlap :)
