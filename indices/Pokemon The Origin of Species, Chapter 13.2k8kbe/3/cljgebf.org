Also, I don't think the thing with the Clefairy (are we supposed to know what she did with the clefairy?) is actually unethical. I also don't think it would constitutes insider trading under any real-life legal system, because it holds intrinsic value and is not a financial asset (an intangible asset that derives value because of a contractual claim).

Also, I think /all/ successful trades based on fluctuations in value rely on either luck, or knowing something that other people do not know (just because it's public knowledge does not mean people know it). It's actually an area of debate as to whether insider trading /should/ be illegal in the first place, and it's fairly difficult to define at what point a piece of information ceases to become "insider" information.

If you generalize Red's mother's argument of "profiting off ignorance" making it deontologically unethical to apply to all cases of profiting off other people not knowing things as quickly as you do (like gray-area information which is neither a secret nor well known) or other people making less accurate predictions using the information that is held in common, then I think you condemn /all/ speculative trading in general as either unethical or pure gambling.

(Consequentially speaking, the economic repercussions are a complex mix of good and bad. You also end up condemning cool things that the rationalist tribe likes, such as prediction markets. Blanket bans on all speculation are unenforceable, anyway.)

Edit: It's totally /believable/, of course, that Red's mom thinks it is unethical and Red agrees, so you don't have to change the story or anything. A lot of cultures (including my own) have a notion that people who make money without actually producing useful objects, services, or information are using cunning to cheat society, and while I'm not sure they are /wrong/ in that intuition, I'm not sure how to practically /apply/ that naive intuition to decisions made in the complex world of finance. I think what ends up happening is they vaguely feel that money, business, and finance in general are vaguely dirty, which I don't think is the correct conclusion unless we want to abolish ownership and revert back to hunting and gathering / we can get to a true post-scarcity situation.
