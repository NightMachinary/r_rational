Great chapter. Loved the glimpses we saw of Giovanni. Liked the little moment when Red changed his mind about calling Professor Oak even though his ego doesn't like it and really enjoyed their conversation.

Also really enjoyed the scene with the conversation around the campfire. I like the glimpse we get into the lives of these traveling youngsters and how it portrayed Red's behavior as a little socially awkward, but still very relatable.

Will reread chapter 4-5 to see what you've added sometime soon. Really love reading this!
