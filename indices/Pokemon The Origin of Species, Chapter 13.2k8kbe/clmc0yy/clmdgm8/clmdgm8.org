  I really like the broad strokes of this chapter, but some of the details hurt it, I think. Power Force Ten and League of Heroes help flesh out the culture of the world in an interesting way. But it's not three pages interesting.
#+end_quote

Huh. I haven't ever viewed my story in terms of page count, so that does seem a bit excessive now that it's framed that way. Might do some pruning.

  Power Force Ten made me think back to Blue's type chart in the first chapter, where he had sixteen types. But apparently, it is accepted in pop culture that there are seventeen types? Why the variance? This sticks out because Red is criticizing the very concept of types, but nobody is objecting to anything else about the set up.
#+end_quote

The types are a lot more fluid in different cultures, which is something I wanted to get across subtly but might have shot myself in the foot with here. I'll probably just change Blue's type chart number.

  On the other hand, it is a nice way to talk about the Fairy type in a casual, low-stakes way. That fleshes out the world a lot more than the love triangle between Crystalla, Lung, and Kagari, none of whom exist.
#+end_quote

Beyond world building, a lot of this was mostly set up for later: I want characters to be trope-savvy, which means I want characters who are aware of the same common/popular story structures. Introducing shows like Power Force Ten now should help make it easier later when someone needs to make a reference.

  First, as a minor issue, Red starts taking notes, even though when he was talking to his mom "he hasn't enough light to write by".
#+end_quote

Woops. Just noticed I forgot to mention that he's writing by the light of the pokedex, though I definitely remember thinking it. Thanks for catching that :)

  More seriously, Oak dodges the question. Red asks for theories, and Oak gives him a categorization schema. It would be like if Red asked him how life develops, and Oak tells him that there are animals and there are plants. Trying to avoid theory induced blindness doesn't excuse everything.

  Even what he does say is slightly annoying to me, in a literary sense. It's an exposition dump; lots of telling, zero showing. It felt like that's not how the story had to tell me this information... but it's fairly short, and it's between two mental exercises that work well, so it's not that big a deal.
#+end_quote

This is definitely something I struggled with, as I need Red and the audience to know these things before he starts his research on his spinarak, but have no reason for psychic, ghost, and dark pokemon to be in the story yet for "showing." The way I saw it was that someone has to be telling someone else these things, and I really want Oak to have an active role as Red's adviser. Maybe the pokedex can show some simulations that the professor preps for Red to watch. I'll have to think it over for future edits :)

#+begin_quote
  Red puts a lot of weight on that "Other" category, even after being told it's extremely noisy. I wouldn't expect him to be able to find a correlation without hundreds of data points and months of dedicated research... And even then he'd be better off ignoring "Other" and just comparing the pokemon code directly to find correlates. Perhaps that's a good long-term project. He's gong to need a lot of spinarak. Good luck, Red.
#+end_quote

One of Red's lacking skills is that he's not a programmer: he knows the basics of coding logic, but the code itself is gibberish, and he doesn't have the resources to do it himself. The idea of the biometrics in the dex is to give people like him the ability to examine things like that without being an expert in them, but unfortunately it hasn't been perfected yet, and there's still a lot of data from the pokemon's code that the pokedex can't parse and label appropriately. So it's a starting point more than anything.

  Giovanni is awesome. In just a few lines, he gives good advice... and also shows himself to be the kind of person who likes putting prices on things. He could be light or dark at this point, and he seems intelligent. I'm quite eager to see more of him, little by little.
#+end_quote

I hope everyone ends up finding Giovanni as much fun as I find writing/imagining him ^ _^
