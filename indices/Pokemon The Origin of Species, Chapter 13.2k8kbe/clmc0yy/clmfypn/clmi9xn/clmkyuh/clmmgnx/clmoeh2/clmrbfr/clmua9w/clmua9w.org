Hmm. I feel like there's room for it to be more complex than that:

1) I think profiting off others' ignorance is wrong.

This was Laura's argument. I don't think it's necessarily correct as an absolute statement, but agree with it generally.

2) I think profiting off someone else's work is wrong.

This is something I agree with much more strongly.

But the most accurate perspective that I can write is:

3) I think it's wrong to profit off your ignorance, which I do not share by dumb luck.

4) I think it's okay to profit off my hard work, the fruits of which you are ignorant of.

Does that make more sense?
