Yes, that's fair. I was mostly pointing out that 4 directly contradicts 1.

I'd also like to point out that you can vary the definition of "hard work" to come up with all kinds of sensible philosophies. Red didn't get the information by dumb luck! He had the foresight to cultivate a relationship that would predictably lead to such advantages. Or, Daisy got the information by dumb luck! She just happened to stumble across the right series of events to make an observation that /anyone/ could have made! And there you more or less have the difference between Ayn Rand and Karl Marx... So that's very much an entire discussion on its own.

Personally, I prefer to stick with just 1 and 2. It's fine with me if you buy widgets to make foobars, and you sell foobars at a profit. But it doesn't sit well with me if you buy widgets to make foobars, so you can sell widgets at a profit when everyone wants their own foobars. It just feels rude to me. I wouldn't quite call it evil, but it's something I'd mildly discourage. But honestly, I don't really like the idea of buying stuff with the sole intention of selling it later. That is always a zero sum game, and there is always a loser. Properly functioning economies are supposed to increase net wealth.
