  It just feels rude to me. I wouldn't quite call it evil, but it's something I'd mildly discourage. But honestly, I don't really like the idea of buying stuff with the sole intention of selling it later. That is always a zero sum game, and there is always a loser. Properly functioning economies are supposed to increase net wealth.
