  Here's an imprecise analogy: let's say I discovered a new use for a certain chemical that will make it much more valuable to everyone.

  Once I reveal that new use, everyone will be capable of using it for its new, valuable function. But until then, the value is reliant on my work and will: I'm the one whose effort must alter the state of nature, so to speak, and reveal this new value to others. It makes sense to me that I should profit off my own work in such a way.

Sure it makes sense, but you still lack a mutual understanding of value. The person you're buying from doesn't know as much as you do, and you know it. You are deliberately taking advantage of their ignorance. You know the buyer wouldn't take the deal if they knew what you would do with it; they'd rather profit off your work themselves, or at least sell the chemical to you at a higher price.

All of Laura's arguments still hold. Nothing she says depends on whether or not you discovered the information of which the seller is ignorant. If that makes a difference then you're not /really/ condemning the exploitation of ignorance, as far as I can tell. Exploiting ignorance is completely okay as long as it's your fault their information is suddenly outdated, so it doesn't seem like you have a problem with that part. You're only condemning leeching off others' work, which is not the argument that is presented in this chapter.
