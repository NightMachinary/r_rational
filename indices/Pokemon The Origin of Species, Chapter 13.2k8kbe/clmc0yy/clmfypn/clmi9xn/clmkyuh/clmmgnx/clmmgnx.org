  I'm a little confused, since you seem to make two arguments against his mom's position, and then said you agree with her?
#+end_quote

Hey, you asked me what counterpoints I would have made, not what I actually think! XP Being able to argue against your own position is an invaluable skill.

  If Daisy chose to invest in clefairy before unveiling her new discovery, that would be fine, since it's her discovery and work that resulted in the increased clefairy value.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if I agree on that. Yes, it is her own work, and her own cleverness, and she is actually contributing something of value... but she would still be profiting off information that she knows the other party doesn't know. If it's okay because she "deserves" it, then that can't be your true objection. As a moral argument, "You shouldn't exploit people's ignorance... unless you earn it!" is not very solid. "You shouldn't exploit dumb luck to profit off people," is a completely different argument. It might even be mutually exclusive, depending on the details.

  I draw a line between "not being rational" and "not having access to the same information."
#+end_quote

But people aren't just inherently rational or not. You have to learn how to be rational. You need access to a certain amount of information to become rational. Is that not a part of what is motivating you to write this work in the first place? I don't think there is a difference in kind, it's just that some pieces of information is more directly related to the decision than others. You have to draw a line on how closely related the information has to be before you are morally obligated to share it, and that is debatable. If I wanted to really argue against Laura, that's the point I would hammer on. But I'd be surprised if Red really wanted to disagree. I think he just found a clever way of making money easily and is being a bit petulant about it. That's more important to the story right now, I think.
