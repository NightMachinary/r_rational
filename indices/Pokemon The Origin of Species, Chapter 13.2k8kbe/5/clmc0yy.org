I really like the broad strokes of this chapter, but some of the details hurt it, I think. Power Force Ten and League of Heroes help flesh out the culture of the world in an interesting way. But it's not /three pages/ interesting. Power Force Ten made me think back to Blue's type chart in the first chapter, where he had sixteen types. But apparently, it is accepted in pop culture that there are seventeen types? Why the variance? This sticks out because Red is criticizing the very concept of types, but nobody is objecting to anything else about the set up. On the other hand, it is a nice way to talk about the Fairy type in a casual, low-stakes way. That fleshes out the world a lot more than the love triangle between Crystalla, Lung, and Kagari, none of whom exist.

I like the concept of pokemon markets, and the ethics of trading. I do hope that comes back later, since Red really isn't offering the best counterpoints. But I wouldn't expect him to. However, his mother was a lot quicker on the uptake than I was. So far, Red has shown a lot of interest in studying pokemon, and zero interest in making money. He hears a cool new thing about a rare pokemon that is about to be really expensive and he wants to buy one - I conclude that he wants to make sure he has one to study, and I'm momentarily confused when his mom isn't happy with him. I didn't catch on until several lines later, when Red finally says "But I really need the money!"

Oak's reassurances do a good job of setting up a contrast between Red's role models, while also working well on their own. And of course, Red demonstrating the learnable skill of recognizing cognitive dissonance is great.

The discussion of psychic phenomena kind of rubbed me the wrong way though. First, as a minor issue, Red starts taking notes, even though when he was talking to his mom "he hasn't enough light to write by". More seriously, Oak dodges the question. Red asks for theories, and Oak gives him a categorization schema. It would be like if Red asked him how life develops, and Oak tells him that there are animals and there are plants. Trying to avoid theory induced blindness doesn't excuse everything. Even what he does say is slightly annoying to me, in a literary sense. It's an exposition dump; lots of telling, zero showing. It felt like that's not how the story had to tell me this information... but it's fairly short, and it's between two mental exercises that work well, so it's not /that/ big a deal.

Red puts a lot of weight on that "Other" category, even after being told it's extremely noisy. I wouldn't expect him to be able to find a correlation without hundreds of data points and months of dedicated research... And even then he'd be better off ignoring "Other" and just comparing the pokemon code directly to find correlates. Perhaps that's a good long-term project. He's gong to need a /lot/ of spinarak. Good luck, Red.

Giovanni is awesome. In just a few lines, he gives good advice... and also shows himself to be the kind of person who likes putting prices on things. He could be light or dark at this point, and he seems intelligent. I'm quite eager to see more of him, little by little.
