I'm a little confused, since you seem to make two arguments against his mom's position, and then said you agree with her? But that might just be because of the unmentioned variable, which I might not have done a sufficient job explaining in the story: her main objection is that Red is taking advantage of something he had no part in to profit.

If Daisy chose to invest in clefairy before unveiling her new discovery, that would be fine, since it's her discovery and work that resulted in the increased clefairy value. Similarly, if Daisy had specifically told Red so he could do so, that would probably make it more acceptable. But since Laura was privileged enough to be told about it, and Red heard it second-hand from her, she feels like Red "doesn't deserve" the advantage in information he'd be utilizing.

  Say you tell them that there has been a new discovery about Clefairy that researchers will be interested in. They shrug and keep the price the same. Is the trade fair now?

Absolutely: both have access to the same information. Their lack of judgement that the information should value it higher is their mistake. Or, if they just don't care, that's their decision.

  If you think they're not being rational, are you obligated to give them a two week correspondence course on cognitive biases before it's fair to take advantage of their poor decisions?

I draw a line between "not being rational" and "not having access to the same information." Maybe it's an irrational line to draw, but there's sufficient barrier between what it takes to make a rational decision and an informed one that it feels real to me.

And again, the access to the information is important. If it were widely available, then it's their fault for not sufficiently researching a thing before selling it. If it's information reserved for a privileged few, the circumstances of how they know what they do matters.

  But it's not necessarily a cut and dry issue.

Yeah, and I'm definitely going to be revisiting it in the story :) What Laura objects to is Red making money, not off his own cleverness, but off of simply knowing Daisy. Off luck, basically. Which isn't a big deal if the value is being created independently, but in this case it's being trasnferred from others.
