  Hey, you asked me what counterpoints I would have made, not what I actually think! XP Being able to argue against your own position is an invaluable skill.

You're right, for some reason when you said you were following E-o_o-3's lead I thought you meant you were in agreement with him/her :) I appreciate you helping me think through the arguments, just wanted to make sure I wasn't misinterpreting yours.

#+begin_quote
  If it's okay because she "deserves" it, then that can't be your true objection. As a moral argument, "You shouldn't exploit people's ignorance... unless you earn it!" is not very solid.
#+end_quote

It's not quite "unless you earn it," as "earn" in that phrase is ambiguous. How does one "earn" other's ignorance, or the exploitation of it?

Here's an imprecise analogy: let's say I discovered a new use for a certain chemical that will make it much more valuable to everyone.

Once I reveal that use, everyone will be capable of using it for its new, valuable function. But until then, the value is reliant on my work and will: I'm the one whose effort must alter the state of nature, so to speak, and reveal this new value to others. It makes sense to me that I should profit off my own work in such a way.

Which is why this:

#+begin_quote
  "You shouldn't exploit dumb luck to profit off people," is a completely different argument. It might even be mutually exclusive, depending on the details.
#+end_quote

Is directly related, I think, since one relies on your work and the other doesn't.
