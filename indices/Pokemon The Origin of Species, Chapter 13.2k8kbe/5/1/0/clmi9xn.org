Basically, I'd follow E-o_o-3's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2k8kbe/pokemon_the_origin_of_species_chapter_13/cljgebf][lead]]. All speculative trading is based on imperfect information. How much do you have to share before it is "fair"? Say you tell them that there has been a new discovery about Clefairy that researchers will be interested in. They shrug and keep the price the same. Is the trade fair now? Or are they mostly combat pokemon traders, who just don't know that researchers are a large part of the market? Are you obligated to give them that information as well? If you think they're not being rational, are you obligated to give them a two week correspondence course on cognitive biases before it's fair to take advantage of their poor decisions? Otherwise, you'd be taking advantage of their ignorance.

On the other hand, all the traders ought to know that pokemon research is ongoing. At any time, someone may discover something that will make the price shoot up. By selling now, instead of waiting a week to see what happens, they have already decided to shoulder that risk. And, therefore, they have already decided that they are okay on missing out that potential profit - which is not the same thing as losing money! They are making what they consider to be a fair profit no matter what you do. Of course they'd prefer to make the greater profit that you expect to make - but they've already considered that and written it off.

Ultimately, I think I agree with Red's mom. Red probably already agrees with her too, so it doesn't bother me that he's trying to make it sound less evil instead of attacking the main premise of the argument. (What if I only steal from rich people?) But it's not necessarily a cut and dry issue.
