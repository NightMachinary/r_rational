Forgot to respond to this part:

  I like the concept of pokemon markets, and the ethics of trading. I do hope that comes back later, since Red really isn't offering the best counterpoints.

It will :) I'm curious to know what counterpoints you would have made: specific to his circumstances, or on the issue generally?

  However, his mother was a lot quicker on the uptake than I was. So far, Red has shown a lot of interest in studying pokemon, and zero interest in making money. He hears a cool new thing about a rare pokemon that is about to be really expensive and he wants to buy one - I conclude that he wants to make sure he has one to study, and I'm momentarily confused when his mom isn't happy with him. I didn't catch on until several lines later, when Red finally says "But I really need the money!"

I had to go back to check and make sure, but I actually did write "I really need the money" near the beginning of the conversation. Then I realized I had also written it at the end with emphasis, and now that bugs me, so I'm going to rewrite it a bit to clarify that he wants the money to buy supplies like TMs and stuff :) So thanks for pointing that out!
