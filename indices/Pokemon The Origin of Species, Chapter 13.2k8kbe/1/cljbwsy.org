150 articles... that is a lot. A non-quantifiable lot more than anything, as that's a big number even in fields with a huge number of collaborators such as High Energy Physics[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0607224][[1]]].

  Red raises a hand and ticks a finger up one at a time as he speaks. "First, to become a registered Pokemon Researcher, I need to contribute twenty new articles on pokemon from my observations and experiences with mine. I can submit them through the pokedex, but I have to wait for them to be peer reviewed to be accepted."

  "Can they be on any pokemon?"

  Red nods. "One article on twenty or twenty on one or anything in between. I just need to discover or verify something new. Second, to become a Pokemon Instructor, I need to verify ten results from other people's research with my own pokemon, retesting their conclusions for validity. That's in addition to contributing another thirty articles of my own again. Third, I can apply to become an Associate Professor to work in the lab under Professor Oak, and to qualify for that I need to submit another forty articles and retest thirty more. And finally, once I'm an Associate Professor, I can become a full Professor by disproving ten theories that have already been established, along with a final sixty articles."

And those seem like some very strict, non-flexible and weird guidelines. Specifically when considering it's straddling a line much more incommon with biology than any other hard science.

...

Okay, let me do a mental reset and think about how I would approach this to make sense in the presented world.

Assumptions(correct me if any of those are wrong from what has been setup in the world so far):

-The organized field of Pokémon research is still quite recent as indicated by Oak being one of the first generations Professor's.

-However other scientific fields are quite advanced as evidenced by the technology on display, so measurement methods and common research metodologies and evaluations like the h-index[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index][[2]]] and similar are in place.

-In a similar way, university and research conglomerates also exist and work in conjuction for large projects and data collection. The degress of graduate, masters and doctor also exist in pretty much the same sense, although we can suppose some flexibility when it comes to age compared to the other fields/real world versus the field of Pokémon research.

With that in mind:

The first publications that Red has with his name on it should always be something he helped or collaborated in. If he had an internship at the Pokémon Lab, he was either doing mundane secretarial paperwork and taking care of the Pokémon which would only be translated in monetary gain, or if he was really helping in research projects or in the writing of an article then he should have been properly credited in it. And this actually fits with what we would expect from a research position, he would have to acclimate himself with all the busywork, from statistical analysis methods and evaluation of data to even writing the article according to publication standards(be it learning how to do write in LaTeX or Word for a scientifc publication). He would also probably need some simple programming basis as we're seeing that a lot of quantification of Pokémon data is given by technology, and I'm assuming that the Pokédex probably uses some standards that were developed in computers, so there it probably are languages and API's meant for searching and retrieving data from personal or public databases for Pokémon data.

So, when Red goes on his journeys he should already have some contributions with his name on it, a positive point in his favor, but not a necessary thing to get the Associate Professor status. Now, what is probably wanted by all research institutions and Professors is data. Pokémon are biological machines and unfortunately you can't just reset them to a previous state and test another hypothesis, you can't experiment with the strength of a Charmander's ember pre and post-evolution based on his physical training with the same Charmander, only with a reasonable sized statistical sample(and as we're talking about a biology related field, even the usual rule fo thumb of >30 samples for a statistical normal distribution will probably need to be inflated here[[http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_statisticalanalysis/statisticalanalysis.html#sec2-7][[3]]]).

As such, I would assume that wannabe researchers are encouraged to submit individual analysis and logs of singular Pokémon documenting their evolutions and capabilities along their maturing period. Typical articles would be variations of "Lifetime log of #Species Specymen for #Specific Environment under a #Something Training Regiment", but they would not only prove the capability and experience of the researcher for work when it comes to organization and article-writing, but those various articles would be welcomed as presenting case studies whose anomalies can be evaluated for more advanced research.

Then, besides some 2 or 3 of those articles(or even 6, mirrowing the usual assumption of 6 Pokémon in the story's universe) it would probably be demanded one independent research article, what would probably be a Master's Thesis in our world, where Red would present an article for publication either re-evaluating some previously noticed phenomenom, or analysing something he noticed. His Spinarak is a perfect subject for this kind of thing, something about "Study of ghost-type characterized attacks from anomalous Spinarak specimen" which he would probably need to present in an open room, probably in front of a judge which is evaluating his candindacy for the rank of Researcher.

Once he gains that rank then yes, I think some milestones in terms of articles/citations are more reasonable(as this is pretty much what happens in academia), but probably by evaluating his h-index and not his number of articles only. In a similar way, he would also have to probably present one more advanced work for each of the following degrees I would think. A long-term research and not-before-seen project for his Doctorate/Pokémon Instructor rank and then various publications to associate himself with a laboratory as Assitant Professor/Professor eventually.

Now, one thing I haven't mentioned is the detail of publishing, but assuming the world you've protrayed so far I'm imagining that the publishing of articles is based less around paid articles in journals and more in an open-acess model similar to arXiv which is also what our world seems to be moving towards, this would also fit with the idea of young kids being able to publish articles, while allowing for peer-review nonetheless.

I don't know if I over-engineered this too much or not, considering the story you're telling here, but I do love that you're writting a story that's making me question those kind of things.
