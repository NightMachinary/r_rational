Disproving ten established theories seems a bit excessive.

What if all current theories are actually correct?

Will you bribe other researchers to establish /incorrect/ theories, so that you have a way to become a professor?

That seems /very much/ against the spirit of science, but I can't see an alternative.

This criteria only really makes sense if the pokemon world is absolutely saturated with incorrect theories of pokebiology, and the minister for science equivalent is desperately trying to clean academia up.
