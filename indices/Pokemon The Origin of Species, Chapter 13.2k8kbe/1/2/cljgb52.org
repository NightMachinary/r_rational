I agree. Described system feels way too much like infamous "Fetch N bear asses" quest.

I suppose, the last level could be justified if Pokemon Professor is not like university professor in our universe, but more like Academy of Sciences of USSR, where full membership was super rare (few hundred members at most for hundreds of thousands of researchers).

But for entry level (Researcher), unless publications are trivial (logs like Drexer describes), I feel like 20 articles is 20 times too many.

That is, if Red is expected to get his Researcher licence any time soon. If it is expected to take him 4-6 years (duration of higher education IRL), then 20 publications is more reasonable.
