Thanks for the feedback! I like having fun with references, and know not everyone will appreciate them. To be honest I'm just really bad at coming up with names for characters, and don't mind using homages for double value: "Lung" in particular was a last minute edit, as I wasn't satisfied with all the other names I came up with, and thought "Wait... a guy that can turn into a dragon...Yeah, that works, he can be Chinese."

Glad you're enjoying it overall though :)
