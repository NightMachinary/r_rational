Ok, now I've got time to respond!

You're right in how fluid publishing is. Anyone with a pokedex can submit data on the pokemon they're raising.

The reason for the volume is that I was envisioning the articles as pretty much everything from "On the relationship between gut bacteria and psychic powers" to "The effects of iron in sandshrew diets." In other words, pretty much anything that you can substantiate through your pokedex's data while you train them.

What sets a researcher apart is volume: most trainers catch perhaps a couple dozen pokemon at maximum, and competitive battlers catch even less, in order to focus their attention and training on a core few.

This often makes them experts on the few pokemon they're familiar with, but mostly ignorant on others.

Trainers who take the Researcher->Professor career path however are expected to know about large amounts of pokemon. A few might specialize in less, especially for newly discovered species, but by the time someone is considered a Professor, they need to be capable of heading research on dozens of species, and be moderately familiar with at least the hundred+ native to their region.

So becoming a professor is a time consuming process, but maybe the spread is a bit too wide.

I did originally want to sneak the "150" number in there for fun's sake, but perhaps it's a bit much.

The main problem might really be that there's a wide difference between a study on Red's spinarak's unusual abilities, and noting the effects of a caterpie's diet on the stickiness of its thread.

With all that in mind, I'm considering re-evaluating what the criteria for each milestone is.

Your description of what Red has learned is accurate, but the co-authoring of papers felt a bit too convenient to add: not that his name wouldn't appear on them, but I don't want him to already be considered an independently accomplished researcher.

Edit:

So let's say I shift it to an h-index approach, and weigh widely cited research far more than barely referenced ones (which makes sense). Keeping in mind that becoming a Professor is far harder than becoming a doctor in our world, and that Professors are one of the few leaders of research in an entire region, (for reference, there are roughly three in all of Kanto and Johto), how does this sound?

  To advance from a generic Pokemon Trainer to a Researcher, Red needs to submit an independent research article, and to advance from there he has to continue publishing until his h-index of publications and citations reaches 20 for Instructor and 30 for Associate Professor. After that, he has to demonstrate understanding in every native pokemon in his region, and write a dissertation overturning a previous established theory about pokemon.
