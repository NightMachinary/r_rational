Well for one thing, bribing other researchers to establish incorrect theories is pretty improbable. You would have to bribe every major scientist in every region that has pokedexes, and then bribe everyone who sets out to test your theories. Because that's how science works: there's not just one person or group of people who get to decide "what the right theory is."

Second, keep in mind that the scientific examination of pokemon is extremely new, having pretty much started two generations ago :) There are a lot of bad theories out there.

That said, maybe ten is too many: one might be sufficient, assuming it's large enough.
