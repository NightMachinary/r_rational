I have to imagine there is quite a large intersection on a Venn diagram in which we share, I see those who post here all over the place on Reddit.

Be interesting to say have a survey of where Reddit users subscribe both in subreddits and in reddits and see what the most common shared is.

Of course lots of people don't bother subscribing to subreddits and just type the URL, but interesting none-the-less.
