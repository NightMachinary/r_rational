Hello everyone, and welcome back! Longest chapter yet, but thankfully got it out ahead of schedule. Also, some fairly substantial edits to announce:

Due to some great feedback from last chapter's post, I realized that I had done a poor job of making Red's goals feel concrete enough. "Become a pokemon champion" is straightforward: collect 8 badges, beat the Elite Four, enjoy your political power and prestige.

On the other hand, the criteria to become a pokemon professor was too vague. "Catch lots of pokemon and research them" is not particularly tangible.

So along with my usual edits to previous chapters, I've added a few paragraphs here and there to clarify Red's goals. Most notably, there are some new lines near the end of chapter 1, and a few paragraphs in the middle of chapter 4. The takeaway is that to advance from a generic Pokemon Trainer to a Researcher, Instructor, Associate Professor, and finally Professor, +Red has to submit a total of 150 research articles on pokemon, retest the conclusions of 40 that have already been submitted, and disprove 10 established theories. He begins to receive payment for submissions when he gets his Researcher license.+ *Edit: Just edited the qualifications to the following thanks to [[/u/Drexer]]: To advance from a generic Pokemon Trainer to a Researcher, Red needs to submit an independent research article, and to advance from there he has to continue publishing until his h-index of publications and citations reaches 20 for Instructor and 30 for Associate Professor. After that, he has to demonstrate understanding in every native pokemon in his region, and write a dissertation overturning a previous established theory about pokemon.*

I've also added a bit to their dinner conversation in chapter five, where Leaf clarifies her interest in regional myths and legends surrounding pokemon for a book she wants to write, along with some tweaks to other chapters to make it more apparent that she's actively seeking such information.

Finally, in this chapter I've renamed some of the Plates for more consistent theming. Because seriously: "Fist Plate?" No.

Hopefully these changes improve the structure of the early story, and make milestones easier to imagine :) Thanks again to [[/u/AmeteurOpinions]] for the great feedback, and hope you all enjoy the new chapter!
