What an unusually terrible requirement. Professors will be most common around periods of sharp advance when due to no genius of their own it'll be far more obvious what other theories of pokemon are wrong. As well, Professor's doing well means there will be less Professors which hardly seems fair either, just because someone is a super genius means you can't have any other Professors?
