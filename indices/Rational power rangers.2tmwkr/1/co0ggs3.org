Hard to do, given the large number of series, the fact that the rangers powers are never truly explored, and even a semi-intelligent antagonist would simply flood a different town/state/country with monsters...

They bad guys have no motivation beyond 'EEEEEEEVIL' and no real checks on their power, which would make it a poor choice for a rational rewrite.
