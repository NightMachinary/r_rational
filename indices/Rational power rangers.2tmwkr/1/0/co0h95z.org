On top of all that, every battle could/should be solved by just summoning the megazords, combining them, and then using the finisher attack right away. I loved Power Rangers as a kid, but even at the age of 5 I was annoyed by how pointless the individual zords were, and how infrequently they fought on their own (let alone actually won a fight that way).

Now I know that the reason they did that was they were just using recycled footage from a japanese show, but a rationalist fiction would have to introduce some downside to combining and using the finisher attack, not to mention making the villains stronger/more dangerous.
