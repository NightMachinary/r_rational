I don't have a generalized response to this issue, but my current model of a Mighty Morphing Rational Rangers is as a delicate political/military situation moderated by the fact that Zordon set up base in California before the United States took over the territory. (Someone more familiar with the laws and treaties concerning Indigenous Californians might have a better idea of how this might go down in practice, since, Alien though he may be, he'd probably count as such for purposes of the law.)

So, battles tend to move progressively further from populated areas and into the deserts/mountains, because the US can bomb the moon if Rita/Zedd get out of hand. So the villains conduct "tourism" and "research" missions inside the city, carefully draw out the rangers, and hope to complete their mission before the obligatory display of force from one of the three sides.

And, of course, pulling out giant monsters or giant robots without serious cause would qualify as conducting military operations in US territory, which would quickly escalate to "And then Goldar and the Megazord both took tank missiles to the face. The end."

The mere presence of the US Military would wreck the plot formula pretty quickly, but early on, it'd be a way to have a Rational version that halfway resembles canon.

(Anyone who wants to write this probably wants to consult someone who knows a thing or two about the relevant laws. Would Rita need a passport for every one of her monsters, so that they don't provoke a military response? How long before the constant skirmishes get Power Rangers and Monsters alike banned from the city limits? Might the Command Center be on the outskirts of a Reservation, scrwing with legal matters even further? Would anyone have the audacity to point out that a glowing Aquamarine head in a tube from the Planetoid of Eltar is decidedly not a member of any federally recognized tribes? Would the exact location at which a zord battle begins make a difference as to the possible military responses?)
