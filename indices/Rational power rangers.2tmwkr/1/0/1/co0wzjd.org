  On top of all that, every battle could/should be solved by just summoning the megazords, combining them, and then using the finisher attack right away.

In canon [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juken_Sentai_Gekiranger][Gekiranger]], GekiTohja (the base megazord) is insufficient, even with the standard finishing move, to defeat some of the large versions of the Venom Fists. The rangers needed to use a specialized form of GekiTohja, such as GekiElehanTohja or GekiBatTohja, for certain enemies, and no specialization was sufficient to defeat each of the Venom Fists. So two or three of them together would likely be able to defeat GekiTohja and any variation.

Of course, what typically happens in those situations is another ranger shows up with an individually powerful GekiBeast. But if Ryu-sama and Mele joined in along with the five Venoms, that would probably suffice even so.

So why don't the rangers immediately form GekiTohja? Because it wouldn't do any good. Rinjuken Akugata is powered by people's screams, and Ryu-sama needs to collect a certain amount of them to achieve his goals. So Gecko-Fist Moriya, for instance, would stay small, climb the walls of buildings, dodge GekiTohja, and terrorize people. Or he'd distract GekiTohja while a score of faceless Akugata fighters attack people.

This would result in Ryu-sama accomplishing his goal faster. So the Gekirangers are forced to fight on the same scale as their opponents.

In some Super Sentai shows, the rangers have an ultimate weapon in addition to a megazord. In these cases, there's no reason to bother with individual combat against the main enemy of the encounter, though it may be useful to clear out the footsoldiers so they're not fighting you while you unlimber your GekiBallista. (That said, they could deploy three hundred meters away, then destroy the main bad guy, then mop up.)

Similarly, there's typically no point in fighting with individual mega beasts -- but at least here, the rangers typically go straight for the combined mode.
