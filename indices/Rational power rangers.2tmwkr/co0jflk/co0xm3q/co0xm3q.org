  runs the risk of turning into a "dissect how the magic works even though it probably isn't that important" ramblefest.

Yeah, I'd tend to take the magic as given for the most part. Perhaps the rangers have to report to a science team for experiments periodically, but that's about it. Usually, people are the interesting thing, and the laws of physics or magic aren't. Even when the laws of physics are intended to be interesting, you still need the people to be interesting.

Case in point: the Orthogonalverse series by Greg Egan. It's split roughly into social issues, alternative physics, and saving the world. The social stuff takes up the plurality of the story, and saving the world (and the involved logistics) is barely a quarter of the first book.

  Rita does not repeat her Bicycle Ride of Doom from the first episode, because people with ICBMs tell her not to

ICBMs don't even reach orbit, and her base is on the moon. It's the people with Saturn V rockets /and/ nuclear warheads /and/ some idea where on the moon her base is that she's worrying about. Of course, the US has the necessary items and is reasonably likely to identify her base, given enough cause.

But why doesn't the US immediately react to an interstellar incursion by locating and destroying her base? It's the American thing to do.
