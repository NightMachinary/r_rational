Did the glowing aquamarine head in a tube already negotiate with one (or several) of the local tribes in the past to be considered a legal member?

I'm reminded at little of the Whateley Academy universe, where the titular Super-School (for heroes, villains, neutrals, and the undecided) is deliberately located on reservation land so that they have quite a lot of legal leeway when it comes to policing their own students. A plot point is that even the supers who set up, run, and oversee the place haven't managed to get /complete/ autonomy from the US government, leading to some nasty shocks along the way.
