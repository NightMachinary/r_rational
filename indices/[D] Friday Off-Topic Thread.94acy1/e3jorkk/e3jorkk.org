I finally binged through Attack on Titan season 2 the other day, in preparation for the third season. I'm really glad I did: it's a little more rough around the edges than season one was, but makes up for it in sheer audacity and fun factor. I wouldn't call Attack on Titan as a whole "rational" - the main character is dumb as a sack of potatoes - but I do love how the Isayama writes his mysteries. Everything was written with the intention of having an answer, rather than the answers being filled in after the fact.

--------------

I've gotten better at exercising discretion over what I read. It bugs me how many hundred-thousand-word stories I drop instantly because the author did something unforgivably stupid. Like, there are scenarios where I'll stick it out - generally when there's something else interesting going on - but for the most part a lot of authors have a hard time holding my attention. In Naruto fanfiction it's usually poor characterization or overuse of cliches (Sasuke bashing, "dobe", Kakashi is an irresponsible teacher, any number of fandom specific plots, /unnecessary or indiscriminate japanese/). In Harry Potter fanfiction "independent" or "backbone" is usually the trigger phrase. Keep in mind I'm not even counting the hundreds of fics I skip based on title and summary alone. The problem isn't that the people writing these things are necessarily bad authors. In fact, in many cases, they might actually be pretty decent, or at least technically competent. It's that they weren't able to spare the additional two motes of brain power required to eliminate the most obvious flaws in their work. Half the reason I like rational fiction is because no author who executes rational fiction correctly could possibly be inattentive enough to make something that hideous. (in theory)

(Bashing is another one - if a character is so inexplicably evil that the protagonist wonders out loud how they could have come to be that way, I drop it. I once received a great piece of advice about writing from a teacher of mine, that went something like: "If your writing is so unrealistic that your characters feel the need to /voice aloud/ how unbelievable it is, you should be careful. Make sure your characters never have an opinion about your writing, let alone a correct one.")

I should save /something/ for the recommendation thread, but I haven't read/watched anything really rational in the last few days, so I might as well post them here. Everything here is not necessarily equal, but they all passed the test of not being awful enough for me to drop them. In order of when I read them, from latest to earliest:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-reach-out-f-sn-smt-p4-crossover-story-thread.245101/][Fate/Reach Out]] is a pretty dumb crossover of Fate/Stay Night and Persona 4. Pretty much submersed in Fate fanon, but it's not poorly written and gets the point of Persona. I really liked the dynamic between Shirou's typical martyrdom complex and Persona's whole "power of friendship" thing coming into conflict, and that was really the only thing I wanted from this crossover.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/man-off-the-moon-fate-extra-x-mass-effect.641011/][Man off the Moon]] is similar, except with Fate/Extra and Mass Effect. It's /alright/. Kind of boring prose-wise, and it doesn't get much of anywhere fast, but the author has a ridiculous update rate, and anything in these two fandoms that isn't shipper garbage is something to be cherished.

- Went through the first two seasons of Overlord the other day, and I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did from the outset. I think that the main character's "emotional control" thing does wonders to stop the story from becoming yet another "trapped in another world to seduce girls" thing. The focus on the extended cast rather than the Overlord himself makes the story seem much more tense, something I'm really glad for.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danmachi-percy-jackson-prytaneum.352191/][Prytaneum]], a crossover between Danmachi and Percy Jackson by Ryuugi. When it's not rehashing Danmachi canon, I'm really impressed by its dedication to worldbuilding, and by this weird ontological mystery caused purely by Percy's presence. Has the typical Ryuugi flaw of dropping the main story for a long drawn out series of mostly inconsequential fights for a while, which makes this a softer recommendation. It's not quite as hilariously drawn out as /The Games We Play/, which got fucking inane towards the middle.

I can't remember very much before that, last month. If anyone knows any medium long-fics that are either complete or still updating, along these same lines of quality, I'd love to hear your recommendations as well. This is strictly talking about non-rational fiction - you can trust that I have my eyes glued to the subreddit. Crossovers are fun, but only if they pay out in the end.
