So I finished the first book of the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars, and I think it would fit this sub's tastes even if I wouldn't necessarily call it rational. Hard sci-fi, dealing with the colonization and terraformi g of Mars, and all the ethical concerns raised by those actions. Kind of like the Foundation novels, but I can't put my finger on precisely why. Anyways, it's enjoyable, and I recommend it.

I still plan on talking about what I've learned about the art of memory, from Moonwalking with Einstein and a few other books, but I was indisposed on Monday for the general rationality thread and didn't want to post a comment that I put effort into if no one was going to see it. I also still need to out some time into practicing the techniques, but that isn't much of a priority right now.
