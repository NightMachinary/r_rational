It would be darkly funny to make a fan edit of the movie that occasionally cuts to all the death and misery caused by the protagonist saving his friends at the expense of everyone else, just to undercut that message. Whenever the protagonist makes a point about how it was right to save his team, play 10 minutes of footage of funerals and the weeping parents/children/spouses for all the people who died when everything turned out "well". Not having seen the movie, I'm guessing a number of the good guys die, even if the day is saved in the end? And that number of preventable deaths was greater than the number of people on the protagonist's team?
