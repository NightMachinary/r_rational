An overt campaign against subtext, ambiguity, and intellect? Ugh.

Contrast my favorite recent Bond, /Skyfall/ in which /every single thing/ MI:6 tries to do fails because the stakes are high and the challenges are steep and what would happen if the narrative gods weren't on their side Or, more poignantly, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Prideaux][Jim Prideaux]](spoilers!) from /Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy/, an explicit portrayal of what might become of James Bond or Ethan Hunt in a more real world.
