  Where other movies might choose to make this message implicit, MI:Fallout chooses to hammer it home a number of times through dialog, repeating the refrain that actually, having a severe case of scope insensitivity is a good quality in people who routinely have to deal with wild imbalances of scope.

  I thought it was a great movie, but the fact that they kept trying to loudly proclaim that it's virtuous to neglect scope was a little bit jarring, given both my values and to some extent, the plot of the film.

It sounds to me like you've critically misunderstood. It /is/ moral to care about the individuals as much as the aggregates. If you care more about millions of people you've never met than about the few people you can see with your own eyes, you may have a moral failing. Such "scope sensitivity" opens you up to being manipulated by hearsay and conspiracy.

Here's a puzzle for you: Would you give up your life in exchange for the lives of a million strangers you've never met? This is, presumably, the moral thing to do. The real question is what evidence would you require first?

It was sufficiently enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend spending theater money to see it.
