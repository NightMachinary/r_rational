I think that /Mission Impossible: Fallout/ was maybe the most anti-utilitarian film I've ever seen.

Mild spoilers for things that were in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb49-oV0F78][the trailer]], from what's essentially the prologue section of the film, prior to the first act. Alec Baldwin says "You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin, one life over millions, and now the world is at risk." This is followed by the CIA woman saying "If he had followed the mission, we wouldn't be having this conversation." Baldwin replies, "His team would be dead," to which the CIA woman replies, "Yes, they would, that's the job."

This is entirely sensible, if unheroic (at least in the classical sense of heroism). Most of the plot of the movie follows from Ethan choosing to save a lifelong friend rather than actually doing his job, and, as typical in a Mission Impossible movie, the world comes within a few lucky coincidences and millimeter precise moments of ... well, not necessarily /destruction/, but certainly megadeaths.

Where other movies might choose to make this message implicit, MI:Fallout chooses to hammer it home a number of times through dialog, repeating the refrain that actually, having a severe case of scope insensitivity is a /good/ quality in people who routinely have to deal with wild imbalances of scope.

I thought it was a great movie, but the fact that they kept trying to loudly proclaim that it's virtuous to neglect scope was a little bit jarring, given both my values and to some extent, the plot of the film.
