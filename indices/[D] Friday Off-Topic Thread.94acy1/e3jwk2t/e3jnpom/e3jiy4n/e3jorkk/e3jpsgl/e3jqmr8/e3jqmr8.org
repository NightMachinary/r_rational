It's not necessarily the villages or titles that I really care about, it's the inconsistency. If you are going to use "sandaime hokage" do not suddenly switch to "third hokage" whenever the hell it suits you, for instance. And with technique names, it's fine so long as the actual description of the technique is accompanied by the name, and it's consistent. It'd be weird if a story about ninjas /didn't/ have a lot of Japanese loan words. The problem is when those words don't really mean anything in Japanese either, or are irrelevant. I don't need to hear "konohagakure no sato" when you're just going to switch to Konoha in a few phrases anyway. I don't need to hear honorifics if you're going to be inconsistent about them, or you are unaware of the distinction between given and family names. Or if the author isn't educated enough to know what the Japanese they're throwing in means. I can't tell you how many stories I've dropped because they say something like "the village of the village hidden in the leaves" or something else that stupid.
