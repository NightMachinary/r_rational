Oh that bugs me a lot as well. I've mostly stopped reading new fanfiction, because I feared that my tastes were regressing, but when I was into Naruto fiction the random Japanese was just so jarring. So many of the terms they use Japanese for have perfectly good English translations. I do not need nor want to remember the Japanese names for all the elemental nations, nor the named attacks. It's not like I'm missing some cultural phrase or something by only knowing the English names; it's just confusing. It comes off as the author being an anime snob who gets really heated about subs vs. dubs debates.
