"Uplift" and "Colonialism" are basically the same thing; the one group of people (or aliens) goes to the other group of people (or aliens) and more or less tells them "This is how you should be doing things, now do it our way". This is often accompanied by an explicit or implicit "or /else/".

But I don't think that means that the /story/ is inherently flawed.
