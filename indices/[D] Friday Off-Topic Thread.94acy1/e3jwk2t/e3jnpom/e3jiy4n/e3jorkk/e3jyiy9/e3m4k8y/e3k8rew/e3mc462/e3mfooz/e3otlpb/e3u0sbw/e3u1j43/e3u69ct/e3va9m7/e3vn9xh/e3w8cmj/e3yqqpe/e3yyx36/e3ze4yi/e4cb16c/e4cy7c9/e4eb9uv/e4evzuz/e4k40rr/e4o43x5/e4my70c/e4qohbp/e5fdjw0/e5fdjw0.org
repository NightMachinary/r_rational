Yes, I meant if they /would want it, implicitly/ as well. As long as their value function is not against it, and/or they gain something more than they lose, and/or someone else gains something more than they lose^{1}, then yes, it is moral to do.

1. I say this assuming no other value is being infringed, as it's important to notice that causing harm to someone as an instrumental mean to gain benefit for others, when they have no blame-worthy contextual responsibility, is a very, very big negative value for humanity in general. Nobody wants to suffer just so that some stranger may benefit^{2} - if they didn't choose self-sacrifice independently.
2. This other value is also consequential, you could forsake it for a big enough good, like in the fat man trolley dilemma you would push the fat man if enough children were on the rails, but it's comparatively rather high.
