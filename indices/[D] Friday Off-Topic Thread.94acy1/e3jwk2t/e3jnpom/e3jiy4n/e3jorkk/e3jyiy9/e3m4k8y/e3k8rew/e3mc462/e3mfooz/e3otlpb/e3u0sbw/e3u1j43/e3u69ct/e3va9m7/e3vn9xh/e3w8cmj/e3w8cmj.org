This sounds a bit like "you don't understand how potentially important being homophobic is to homophobes, so you don't know how much suffering you'll cause."

Let's replace "homophobia" with something like "non-sexual sadism" now. I would also snap my fingers and change everyone with such violent compulsions too, if we change the hypothetical to being able to alter things on a deeper level. Would you have the same objection? That I should privilege people's potential desire to cause harm as a consideration of harm caused to them by no longer desiring it?
