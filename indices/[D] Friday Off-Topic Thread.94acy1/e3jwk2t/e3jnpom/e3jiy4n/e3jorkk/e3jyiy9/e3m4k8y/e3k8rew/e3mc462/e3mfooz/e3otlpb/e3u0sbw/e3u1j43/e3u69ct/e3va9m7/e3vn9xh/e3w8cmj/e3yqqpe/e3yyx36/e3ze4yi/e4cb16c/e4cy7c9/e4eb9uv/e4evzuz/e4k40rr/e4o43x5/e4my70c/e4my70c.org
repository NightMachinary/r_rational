  If you can't posit a situation in which people's values are changed /without/ it actually being a bad thing, then I think you may, in fact, truly, despite your repeated insistence otherwise, deep-down consider value-changing to be bad deontologically, and not consequentially
#+end_quote

Sure, I can come up with situations in which changing people's values is not a bad thing.

An example that it's not mine but that works well is from Worth the Candle. If you read it, you probably know already what I'm talking about:Amaryllis changing her feelings for Joon, via existentialism, in the HTC. If someone else did it, it would still have been good. Another one, that I've seen here in /rational, was a user that wished they could discard their interest for sexuality. I think if you snapped that value away in them, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

I think it's not impossible to change someone's values and it be a moral action. If they would do it anyway, given the chance, then it's not harm.\\
Now keep in mind that 'til now we've talked as normal human beings in our current world, where there is no tool for uncovering the true value function of someone, and we don't know how terminal, instrumental and convergent values interact in practice. So obviously we must infer what would be right or wrong from context and with limited models.

  especially when you bring up how it's so often bad = evil = harmful in fiction :P

That was for argument's sake, yo!

  I /would/ say that snapping to make everyone bisexual is another thing I would do and consider an obvious net positive
#+end_quote

As bonobos teach. That is the point, though, a /net/ positive. Some people would get the sort end of the stick.
