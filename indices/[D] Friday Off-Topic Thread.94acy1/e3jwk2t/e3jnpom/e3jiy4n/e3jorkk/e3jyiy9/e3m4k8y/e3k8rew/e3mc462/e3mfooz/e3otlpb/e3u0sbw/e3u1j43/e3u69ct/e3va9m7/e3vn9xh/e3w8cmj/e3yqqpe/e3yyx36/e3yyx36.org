  Just because homophobia is distasteful and immoral, it doesn't mean snapping it away wouldn't be a form of harm.

I think this is our crux. I don't take the transition of values in and of itself to be a form of harm, because values can and do arise without one's choice in the first place, and can change for the same reason. So the results are what matter, ultimately, when calculating if altering someone's values is moral.

If I have reason to believe raising my kids not to be homophobic is good, then I should have reason to believe other people's kids not to be homophobic is good, and then I should also believe that it would have been good if all kids going backward in time had not been raised homophobic, etc. If I can accomplish that with a finger snap instead of a time machine, it seems reasonable to do so.

Part of me wants to say that maybe the snap also makes them okay with their values changing, but I'm guessing you would actually think that worse?
