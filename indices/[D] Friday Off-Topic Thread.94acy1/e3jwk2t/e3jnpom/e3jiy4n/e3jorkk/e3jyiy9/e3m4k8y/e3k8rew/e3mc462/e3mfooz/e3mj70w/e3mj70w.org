I think there's a difference between an uplift story and a story criticizing uplift. You could call NGE a Mecha anime, but that's not really accurate. It's a psychological thriller that criticizes Mecha anime. Similarly, a story that critiques a subgenre is by nature not actually a member of that subgenre; if it were, then it could not be a critique. I find it odd for you to bring up Dr. Moreau. Although I will admit that Dr. Moreau is in many ways a symbol of the flaws that Wells saw in educating non-White people (and holy fuck is he racist about it), the story itself isn't particularly anti-colonial. The conclusion is that beasts should be domesticated, not educated. That is certainly a colonial sentiment, even if it is not the same type of colonialism expressed in some other uplift stories. I suppose I can clarify my position; I think that all stories featuring uplift that are not criticizing uplift are inherently colonialist. I think that's a more accurate statement than the more blankety statement that I made before.
