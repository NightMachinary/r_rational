So could the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(2017_film)][2017 Beauty and the Beast remake]] be considered (bad?) "rational fanfiction"? I saw [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpUx9DnQUkA][this video]] a few days ago and felt that a lot of what its author didn't like about the remake would also hold true for many of the fanfics posted on this sub (e.g. fixing plot holes and inconsistencies at the expense of the original characterization). I also didn't quite agree with a fair bit of what she'd said (e.g. the Beast letting Belle go doesn't condemn the house to death, because keeping her an unwilling prisoner isn't likely to earn her love enough to satisfy the conditions of the curse). But overall have generally found her videos entertaining and thought-provoking.

I also think some of the things the remake "fixed" that she criticizes /were/ improvements to the 1991 Disney film (from what I recall of it, having not seen it in ages), e.g. if Prince Adam's primary failing at 11 was not letting a scary stranger into his house, then a decade-long curse ending in his death seems unjustified, especially since in actuality the powerful enchantress would have been /totally/ unharmed by a bit of foul weather and was totally willing to screw the Prince over with moral entrapment -- talk about stranger danger!). I think that casts the entire plot in a rather different light, and seems less nitpicky than a lot of her criticisms of the remake, as well as less answerable by the MST3K mantra (“If you're wondering how he eats and breathes and other science facts, then repeat to yourself ‘It's just a show, I should really just relax.'”). But I can still imagine stuff like that not bothering others as much.

(edit: to clarify, I did agree with many of her points)
