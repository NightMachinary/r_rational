  If you care more about millions of people you've never met than about the few people you can see with your own eyes, you may have a moral failing.

That's just your misguided opinion. If saving humans is good, it's objectively better to save more people (assuming they all have the same worth).

  Here's a puzzle for you: Would you give up your life in exchange for the lives of a million strangers you've never met?
#+end_quote

No, because /to me/, my life has infinite more worth than any stranger's.

You're probably on the wrong sub.
