(I love Lindsay Ellis.)

I think a lot of what she talks about in that video applies more generally to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic]["fix fics"]], of which rational fanfic is commonly a subset. But in the specific example of Beauty and the Beast, a lot of the fixes that they made didn't actually need to be made, and in fact, make the work /less/ like rational fiction. In particular, Belle creating a washing machine that she's mocked for and Belle being chastised for reading when that's mostly ahistoric, the villagers being paid to sing Gaston's praises, Belle's mother having a tragic backstory that her father never explains to her ... a lot of them make the work make /less/ sense, not more, and they're not justifications for what happens in the original plot, they're things added on to answer criticisms of the original.

That said, yes, a lot of "bad" rational fanfic does those things too, and even some of the "good" rational fanfic will -- how to put this -- not necessarily fix things at the expense of the original characterization, but /explore/ things at the expense of that characterization, especially in terms of pointing out ethical or moral problems, knock-on effects of character decisions, etc. I might feel that the Beauty and the Beast remake was a better movie if I thought that it was attempting a deconstruction of the original, but I really don't think that the remake was doing that, it was just trying to put its own spin on things. (My read on Lindsay Ellis is that she wouldn't have a problem with a deconstructionist take on something, but I might be wrong.)
