My perception of "fix fics" was that they typically involved the protagonist (often a self-insert armed with foreknowledge of canon) going around averting and resolving conflicts that developed originally, but it looks like the tvtropes definition is a bit broader than that! TIL! I agree that your (/her) listed changes were unnecessary, and wonder how many of them were a casualty of the script being rewritten? I hear a lot of those sorts of loose ends result from having multiple cooks in the kitchen, so that the final product is a misshapen patchwork of competing visions. Otherwise I think I was able to just treat them as fluff/flavor text, or else think they served at least a /little/ bit to add depth to the characters -- overall I found the movie enjoyable, but maybe only by virtue of going into it with sufficiently low expectations.

I recall Ellis being ok with perspective-flip/subversive/revisionist retellings (I think maleficent was even mentioned in the video on Beauty and the Beast) which seem related to deconstuctive works, so I don't think she'd hate them a priori.
