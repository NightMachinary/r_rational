I think Hollywood, and other forms of entertainment media, have become more and more uncomfortable with the costs of winning at all costs. The simple narrative of a world at hair-trigger risk is an extremely convenient tool for increasing tension, /and/ an extremely convenient tool for political overreach.

Filmmakers and show-runners and comics authors are concerned that heroes who run around killing people today will be unsympathetic in a way that they weren't in the 1980's. So something is added to the text to assure the audience that they're good people: one is kind to animals, another loves his wife or children, another makes hard choices protecting the innocent when there are dangers.

The bleakest example from MI:F wasn't its inciting incident, it was Ethan fatally shooting four gang members in order to save the French police officer who saw the team stashing their prisoner. The movie only introduced, and killed, those characters in order to save the protagonist from a dilemma! They shoot her for him, functionally disarming her, and the fact that he kills in order to save her gains her trust. I'm even sure the movie chose to have her be a woman in order to make her seem especially vulnerable and innocent. Imagine the same scene with a character played by, say, Henry Cavill. It's lazy writing at the expense of potential character development. If you don't let Ethan learn the consequences of this sort of hard decision, he's going to find himself making this same mistakes over and over again.

Good for the movie series, I'm sure, but not so good for the making the sense.

A story could also concentrate on the hard decisions that "bad guys" had to make that put them in a situation where many of their deaths are, so far as this movie is concerned, worth saving one life. How many deaths are Ethan and Friends responsible for compared to any given disposable thug?

So the film is trying /really hard/ not to have us think about that sort of thing. ETHAN IS A GOOD GUY, it shouts over and over. I agree this has rather the opposite of the desired effect.
