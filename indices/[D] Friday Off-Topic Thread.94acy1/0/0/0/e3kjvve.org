Funny enough, [[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mission-impossible-tom-cruise-pushed-a-dark-plot-was-cut-1130744][the original script was much more ambivalent about Hunt being a good guy]]:

  Case in point: McQuarrie and Cruise conceived of a plot that would have seen hero Ethan Hunt assume the identity of extremist John Lark for an even longer chunk of the film, a move that would have taken the IMF agent down some dark roads in pursuit of his goal and would have forced him to do some "horrible things," notes McQuarrie. The expanded plot was eventually scrapped, as the director felt it made the film too intellectual and robbed it of the trademarks that people expect from a Mission: Impossible movie.

(The interview has some discussion from the director about a "dark" Ethan that I found fairly interesting.)
