A nice variant on the Shadow Clone: [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/posts/720578][Kaizou Kage Bunshin (login required)!]] In order to prevent chakra poisons and memetic hazards from being transmitted to the original, the copy /doesn't/ return its chakra and memories to its creator when it's dispelled. Immediately after being created, it knows that it has been doomed to an imminent death. (I get the feeling that it needs a more specific name, though, since =kaizou= apparently ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizo_Mario_World][1]] [[https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E6%94%B9%E9%80%A0][2]]) means merely =modified=. [[/u/subrosian_smithy][u/subrosian_smithy]])

Fanfiction idea: A ninja who knows a technique that absorbs chakra from other people learns this technique and uses it---or, alternatively, a clone that was created with this technique by a poorly-disciplined ninja and then went rogue stumbles across a chakra-absorption technique. Now, roaming the Elemental Nations is a clan of chakra-vampire clones who must steal chakra from others to avoid dying. The story ends when they learn Sage Mode and become able to absorb chakra from plants and mundane animals rather than having to go after humans and summon animals---or when they've multiplied to such an extent that all human life has been extinguished and the summon animals have retreated to their homes (which are either across the ocean from the Elemental Nations or on a separate plane of existence from Earth, depending on the author).

Optional twist: The original is dead, and only his clones are still around. Maybe clones even are /immortal/ as long as they have enough chakra to continually Henge their malleable pseudo-bodies into younger forms---or, maybe, without specific souls to "remind" them of their proper forms, they gradually lose definition and deform into monstrosities, Glory Girl-style, if they attempt to prolong their lifespans.

See also the traditionally-published book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40600413][/Kiln People/]]. The book revolves around disposable clones, of varying lifespans and qualities, whose memories are uploaded back to their originals only if the clones return to base before running out of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital]["élan vital"]] that was used to create them. IIRC (I haven't read this book in /many/ years---though [[https://www.goodreads.com/deals/about][Goodreads Deals]] recently facilitated my snagging a copy for $2, so I'll get around to reading it again soon enough) the ultimate villain of the story is a clone whose original discovered the secret of infusing élan vital into /existing/ clones (which normally isn't possible) in order to make those clones immortal. The clone, being high-quality enough to impersonate his original (most clones are cheap and unconvincing), killed the original and made himself immortal.

It's interesting to note how different authors treat [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique][the Shadow Clone Technique]] differently. The default assumption is that, when a Shadow Clone is dispelled, its memories (along with some of any leftover chakra---or not, because the connection is purely soul-based, not chakra-based*) are transmitted back to its creator. Some authors, however, allow those memories to be transmitted, not only to the original, but also to /all/ the original's /other/ Shadow Clones! This alternative interpretation allows for such overpowered tactics as quickly creating and dispelling a Shadow Clone in order to transmit newly-learned information to your entire network in the blink of an eye, and thereby gets rid of the "the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing" situations that independently-operating Shadow Clones otherwise inevitably must confront if left to their own devices for long periods. On the other hand, however, some authors decree that any genjutsu that affects a Shadow Clone can /propagate/ (with some extra effort on the part of the genjutsu user---or not, because of self-amplifying soul-resonance effects---and only after the directly-affected clone has been dispelled---or not, because the genjutsu user can sense the thread of the clone connection and follow it back to its source in the course of casting the technique) to the creator---or, under the alternative interpretation that I just described, to the creator /and/ to his other Shadow Clones, which largely offsets the overpoweredness of that version of the technique (because, the more clones you have out, the more likely it is that an enemy will catch /one/ of those clones in a sleep genjutsu and render you and your one-man army totally defenseless in a single stroke).

I haven't read much /Naruto/ fanfiction in a while,** so the only relevant story that I can add to this pile of (You) bait (other than the one that I already linked) is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5207262][/Indomitable/]].

*If chakra /is/ transmitted, however, enemies may be able to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(surveying)][triangulate]] the original's position by dispelling several of his clones and using sensory techniques to watch where the clones' chakra goes.

**/Inter alia/, I was reading [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_d%27Artagnan_Romances][the d'Artagnan Romances]]. My fifth reading of [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][/The Three Musketeers/]] was as good as I remembered, and my second reading of [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259][/Twenty Years After/]] was significantly /better/ than I remembered---but I had to throw in the towel approximately 40 % of the way into my second reading of /The Vicomte de Bragelonne/ (halfway through [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681][Volume 2 of 4]]) because it was just /too/ boring and I wasn't willing to skip as much as I did on my first reading. /Ventre-saint-gris!/ Maybe I'll finally get around to experiencing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] for the seventh time after reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35066358][/The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August/]] (thanks, Goodreads Deals!)... but what about [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/135][/Les Misérables/]]?
