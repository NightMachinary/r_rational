  A nice variant on the Shadow Clone: Kaizou Kage Bunshin (login required)! In order to prevent chakra poisons and memetic hazards from being transmitted to the original, the copy doesn't return its chakra and memories to its creator when it's dispelled. Immediately after being created, it knows that it has been doomed to an imminent death. (I get the feeling that it needs a more specific name, though, since kaizou apparently (1 2) means merely modified. [[/u/subrosian_smithy][u/subrosian_smithy]])

If I was writing that today, yeah, I would go out of my way to give it a more specific name -- either getting input from a friend who knows Japanese, or (much more likely) just giving all technique names and such in English. I would also publish it elsewhere, where logins aren't required (and deleting posted fanfiction is actually possible without contacting moderators for support, lol). I anticipated getting much farther in that story than I actually did, but that's what writing is like.

  Maybe I'll finally get around to experiencing Time Braid for the seventh time after reading The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August (thanks, Goodreads Deals!)... but what about Les Mis√©rables? There are so many options!

Les Mis is pretty damn good, IMHO. It's a pain to find a good translation, though -- there's French wordplay flying left and right like Victor Hugo was competing with Aaron Smith-Teller.
