  This sounds a bit like "you don't understand how potentially important being homophobic is to homophobes, so you don't know how much suffering you'll cause."
#+end_quote

Well yes. Not only that, but also the fact that you're modifying their core being without any warning or recourse. Just because homophobia is distasteful and immoral, it doesn't mean snapping it away wouldn't be a form of harm.

#+begin_quote
  Let's replace "homophobia" with something like "non-sexual sadism" now.
#+end_quote

Do you mean "acting sadists"? Because it could also be taken to include "people who would like to behave sadistically but are able to contain their urges". I'll take the first definition.

#+begin_quote
  Would you have the same objection? That I should privilege people's potential desire to cause harm as a consideration of harm caused to them by no longer desiring it?
#+end_quote

Yes/No. Not /privilege/, though that's a possibility (it could be that for humanity as a whole value-function integrity is of greater importance than avoiding violence and hostility), but I would still try to weigh which of the two outcomes causes greater harm.

Interestingly though, I think it's safe to say non-sexual sadists are way less than homophobes, and I also think that there's a chance a relevant slice of sadists would want to have their sadism removed. Obviously you would still need to think about it and draw your conclusions (and the problem about the temporality of the harm in changing a value function would still need an answer).

It's probably correct to eyeball that snapping for sadists would be a net improvement, so, despite taking my time to think about what to do, I would probably have less reservations about snapping acting sadists away.
