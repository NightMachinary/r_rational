  It's not so much "respecting values" (which is morality), as "not changing value-functions" (which is "no brainwashing").
#+end_quote

Right, "no brainwashing" is deontological, not consequentialist. You're saying it's not because the changing of value functions is "harm," and I'm saying "show me the harm inherent to the value change, because I'm not seeing any in cases like this."

  If instead of snapping the homophobes into acceptance you could snap the homosexuals into heterosexaulity, would you deem the outcome equally favourable? Not trying to be snarky, it's an honest question.
#+end_quote

No, because now you're changing more than just people's values, you're actually messing with millions of happy homosexual relationships, which is clearly harmful.

  I don't think it is, in fact I think that if you ask people how they would choose, between the time-travel option and the killing homeless people option, you wouldn't get an "it's the same". Also I don't think the Hitler analogy works all that well, because there is extremely little moral grey in stopping the holocaust. The "kill Hitler" hypothesis will practically always come on top, even if it comes with "but Hitler will suffer agonising torture for a million years".
#+end_quote

Point taken about the Hitler hate skewing things, but my actual point is that there is extremely little moral grey area in eradicating homophobia. I'd say there's actually none, like the holocaust. Both are unambiguously bad things. The fact that some people disagree does not change that, anymore than some people thinking that starving themselves makes them healthy actually changes what "healthy" means.

  What I'm saying is that the quantities and the measurements, in this particular circumstance, are enough to warrant forsaking the snap out of caution.
#+end_quote

Okay, but you're not actually demonstrating any actual harm being caused at all. You're presuming that value-changing is harmful. I'm saying "show me how."

This is like the "what if bugs are sentient" question, come to think of it. I don't think bugs are, personally, so I don't care about bug suffering. If someone wanted to convince me that bug suffering matters, they would need to not only show me that, because there are trillions of bugs on the planet, even tiny amounts of suffering add up to more than humans, they /first have to prove that bugs suffer./

To make me care about the scope of this snap, you /first have to prove that value changing causes suffering./ I don't think you have, yet.

  We could add a caveat. You can make them hate their family heirloom and cherish an object reminiscent of a random insignificant moment in history at the same time. Do you think the overall morality of this snap is neutral?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand the example, but if you mean "we can make them hate the literally worthless Object A that they have attachment to, and make them suddenly love another literally worthless Object B that they also own but previously had no attachment to," that WOULD seem neutral to me, except consequentially it means people around them would be confused by this sudden nonsensical change in preferences. If no one else around them would ever know the difference or care, then yes, it's neutral. It may still be harmful or beneficial depending on other factors, but the mere transference of sentiment from one object to another seems harmless to me.

#+begin_quote
  Let's try this: if you asked most people to snap away the love for a dead relative, they wouldn't accept, despite the fact that they are suffering from the loss and nobody gains anything from their continued suffering. The thing that they don't want to loose is not an advantage in how they feel, or a memento of something else. They literally care about keeping caring.
#+end_quote

Sorry but this is a horrible example :P Feeling love for someone who is dead causes suffering, but it doesn't erase the love itself, which has benefits of its own. They care about keeping caring because their caring /is itself valuable./

Homophobia is not. You're saying that people want to keep hating others the same way grieving people want to keep loving the people they grieve. But I don't care about the former. I don't value their value of their mindless, pointless hate. I would not snap away ANY hate or ALL hate, but this kind of hate, yes, there is literally no value in it that I can perceive, and I'm not going to bully my reason into thinking it's a bad idea to get rid of it without someone demonstrating actual harm that comes from snapping it away, even if they say that the actual act of value-changing is itself harmful.

Harmful how? Show me the harm, where is it? What does it look like? What tears does it spill, to wake up one morning and no longer hate someone for such an utterly pointless reason? You keep trying to insist that the "brainwashing" act itself is bad, but "bad" is meaningless if you can't point to the observable harm it causes, empirically.

  P.s., sorry if this comment is all over the place, I had to write it in instalments.

No problem, it was fine to me!
