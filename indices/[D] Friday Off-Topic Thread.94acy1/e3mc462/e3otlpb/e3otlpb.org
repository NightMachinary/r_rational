The themes of modern Uplift fiction feel to me like more of a struggle within progressive philosophy rather than the older kinds which were, as you say, pretty colonialist.

I mean, if you could snap your fingers and make everyone around the world suddenly accepting of other people's sexuality, would you? Maybe you'd say no to that, but I would in a heartbeat. Maybe that makes me a colonialist, or just someone arrogant for assuming that his morals or preferred social norms are better than others people's, but I think after a certain point the desire to reduce suffering and the desire to not interfere with other cultures is going to naturally come into conflict.

It's okay to draw lines in the sand or put up Chesterton fences, but they're going to be different for everyone. If one fantasy country manages to invent anti-aging magic or technology and offers it to another (freely or for a reasonable charge) maybe that would be okay to you, whereas secretly spreading it to the other country would not be okay... but then you have to consider the why. What if there are people in that country who want it, despite the majority of their country not wanting it? It's well and good to say "open borders and let them come," but what if that's just not possible? Most people don't have the money or means to just up and leave their country, even assuming their government or fellow citizens would let them. Yet it would undeniably change their society if some of them started to secretly accept the anti-aging tech and others didn't. There are arguments to be made about making sure the secondary effects of such sweeping societal changes are thought out and protected against, but if you'd call the desire to make those changes at all "bad," then I think there might just be a conflict or confusion of values.
