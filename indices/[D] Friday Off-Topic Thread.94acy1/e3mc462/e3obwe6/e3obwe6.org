Could you give some examples? I've never actually read Brin's Uplift books, so is that what you're talking about?

The example that immediately comes to my mind (though I wasn't a big fan of the book) is Clarke's /Childhood's End/. The paternalism is played to the hilt, but the identification of the reader is with the "normal humans," not with the overlords or the future humans, and the ending certainly doesn't reinforce any themes of colonialism (also the aliens are literally demons). I guess what I'm saying is I can see how there are parts that can be read as "colonialism is justified because it's benevolent," but I don't think that's a necessary reading in this case, and maybe it's not a necessary part of the causal story behind the book.
