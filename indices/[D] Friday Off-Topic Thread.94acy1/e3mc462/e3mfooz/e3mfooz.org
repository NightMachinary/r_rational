  I feel like most Uplift fiction is inherently colonialist in attitude.

I mostly agree.

  In my opinion, these types of stories are inherently flawed.

Whoa, back up a bit. The /concept/ doesn't constitute an inherent flaw in a story, because the concept itself, as reminiscent of colonialism as it might be, says nothing about how that concept is used in the story.

For example, if the uplifting character or civilization is cast a villain, then doesn't that inherently comment on colonialism in a way that comports with your personal politics? Dr. Moreau isn't portrayed as a good guy, he's portrayed as a villain whose experiments are vile. If the seminal work of uplift fiction is anti-colonial in nature, how can you say that the concept of uplift makes for a flawed story on the basis of its similarity to colonialism? (Not to say that Wells wasn't shockingly racist by today's standards, nor that his anti-colonialist bent was informed by the same social mores that a modern anti-colonialism is.)

Similarly, many books about uplift feature the uplifted characters as second class citizens grappling to form a culture and society of their own. Do you think that's /not/ a comment on modern post-colonial issues of race and identity?

If /you/ can see that there are moral problems with uplift, then authors can too, and a lot of them choose to write about the concept of uplift simply so that they can address those very concerns.

Evaluation of the message of a work which features uplift must be done on a case-by-case basis.
