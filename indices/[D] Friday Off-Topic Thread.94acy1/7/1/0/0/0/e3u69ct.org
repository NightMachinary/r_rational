  From my perspective, being against brainwashing to this degree feels deontological, and I understand why it's a valuable deontology to have, but would argue that it's ultimately a misfire of moral compunction.

Ok, I'm trying to write a response and the more I write the more stuff comes up. So let's see.

*As a premise, my moral framework is Value Utilitarianism.

Do you think that if you went to all the homophobes in the world, and you told them that you were going to mess with their mind on a fundamental level, and they had absolutely no way of stopping you, you would cause less suffering than they cause by homophobia? It's possible, and if the answer is yes, then you've got an argument in favour of the /Snap/ scenario.

We should also consider that, seeing as a certain share of homophobes don't contribute all that much suffering to homosexuals (today), the odds that the above moral calculation ends in favour of the /Snap/ is even lower. Though I will grant it's arguable.

The fact is, on the face of it, changing the value function of a moral agent (brainwashing) is an a-moral action, because the new value function you get will agree that the new state of affairs is better, whatever you do. That's how value functions work.

But we generally consider brainwashing as immoral. Also, if we were to count that way, then killing someone - by surprise - who has no connection or living relatives and is not paying taxes or otherwise contributing to society, like homeless people, would also be an a-moral action, because at the end of it there's no mind to suffer. Seeing as we don't generally consider either acceptable, you can infer that we use the prior values as the ones to be taken into account in moral considerations. (As I write it occurs to me that forcefully changing someone's value function could be considered a harm with a magnitude equal to the distance from the former values to the newer ones. But then again, is there a way to equate world-state distances to scalar value differences? I don't know).

Now, we should also consider the consequences of that choice. It's no doubt that homosexuals will continue to suffer unduly for decades, possibly centuries, because of the hostility of homophobes. But how should we consider the harm caused by changing the value function? As instantaneous? As continuous from that point forward, every time the brainwashed make a choice they would have made differently if you hadn't messed with them? None of the two seems immediately obvious to me.

If we were to take the first one as true, then Snapping would end up being the least-suffering alternative. If the second one was true, then NonSnapping could be the least-suffering alternative. And it's also likely that you would have to Snap some people again in the future, who would become homophobes for various reasons.

  Scope insensitivity may also be a thing here.

It could be for my position, and also for yours.

#+begin_quote
  If one of your best friends came out as gay and became subject of abuse from their family, you might be more willing to snap if the snap would only affect the family and the abuse was happening right in front of you.
#+end_quote

True, but this is a flawed argument. First of all, we're both against homophobia, so our preference has to be taken into account as to what we choose and whether we should choose that. Second of all, it's an appeal to emotion and proximity. I could also have one or multiple friends and family members who are homophobes, and I would want for them to not be brainwashed.

So at the end of the day, I wouldn't want to snap the Snap because I wouldn't know how much harm I'm causing, or if it's less than the harm I'm preventing, and because there are clearer and less ambiguous paths to fix homophobia.

Of course you could change my mind if you solved those uncertainties.
