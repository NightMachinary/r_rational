Wait, hang on. Why would this:

  Do you think that if you went to all the homophobes in the world, and you told them that you were going to mess with their mind on a fundamental level, and they had absolutely no way of stopping you, you would cause less suffering than they cause by homophobia?

Be a consideration? Maybe you're rejecting the hypothetical and replacing it with a more reasonable approximation of how some kind of mind-altering tech deployment would go in terms of public awareness, but in the hypothetical as it is, there's no reason to tell anyone anything like this. Even if I presume that someone being aware that they're about to undergo a change in values automatically causes notable suffering (which itself needs to be established), I don't really see any reason to believe people not being aware of their impending shift in values toward being more accepting of other people's sexualities would cause suffering.
