  I don't take the transition of values in and of itself to be a form of harm, because values can and do arise without one's choice in the first place, and can change for the same reason.

What about this: there's a distinct difference between values changing because of the world and values changing because of your magic. It's approximately the same difference as between having to sell you house because you're out of money and having someone threatening you at gunpoint into selling you house.

Importantly, new values that emerge organically (we're talking terminal values) have a relationship of interdependence with the previous values one holds, which isn't the case for the Snap. If in your life new information and experiences cause your brain chemistry to change and take on a new value, it would be in the context of yourself and what your internal state allows. I'll give you an example.

Let's say we have to homophobic women, Alice and Beth, both homophobic because of religious beliefs.

When Alice's teenage son comes out of the closet, she realises the error of her previous position and stops being homophobic. Beth instead, in that same situation, drives her son out of her house and stops acknowledging their relationship.

Now, I don't think both necessarily changed their terminal values. While Alice is at the beginning still a little distressed while witnessing expressions of homosexuality, in time she learns to accept homosexual love without compunctions and cherish her new worldview. Beth instead never stops holding her relationship with her son valuable. She will suffer for all her days for her lost son, even if the pain will eventually fade to something bearable.

Now, if you snap your fingers, you take away from her something she values more than her own son. Does that seem like not-harm?

  If I have reason to believe raising my kids not to be homophobic is good, then I should have reason to believe other people's kids not to be homophobic is good, and then I should also believe that it would have been good if all kids going backward in time had not been raised homophobic, etc. If I can accomplish that with a finger snap instead of a time machine, it seems reasonable to do so.

Right, but kids have no values that you would be changing. Using a time machine to knock on a specific door at a specific minute would also cause that homeless person to not be born, but morally that's not equivalent to killing them.

  Part of me wants to say that maybe the snap also makes them okay with their values changing, but I'm guessing you would actually think that worse?
#+end_quote

I would say that their after-snap state has no bearing on the morality of the decision, because as I said before (and I'm guessing you found that argument sound?) we tend to base our morality on the prior state of the value function.

(EDIT: I have to correct myself. The post-snap state /can/ have a bearing, in that it could determine the amount of harm that you have dealt people.)

Ok, thought experiment. There's a person that has an heriloom that holds sentimental value. You snap them into hating that heirloom, though not the memory it's connected to. Then they destroy the heirloom. Is what you did moral?
