I agree that if we're talking about potential symmetrical weapons, we should avoid using bad ones in realistic scenarios. But I don't think that actually translates to hypotheticals where you get to actually use a weapon your opponent can't. If there's actually a way to remove pedophilia from humans, for example, the people who discover that cure may decide not to spread it around if the actual discovery can also be used to change other fundamental parts of people's drives against their will. But if they happen to find a way to do so that does not risk others misusing what they've invented, they absolutely should use it to remove pedophilic urges from all humans, with or without their consent, and this seems obviously true to me for things like homophobia or sadism too.

To not take such clear utilitarian wins out of fear of some vague "badness" of changing people's values feels like deontology, or just bullying our reason into feeling bad about what it knows is obviously beneficial.
