  Now, if you snap your fingers, you take away from her something she values more than her own son. Does that seem like not-harm?
#+end_quote

It depends entirely on what those values are, in my view. There's no ur-value of "respecting values" that I think should be divorced from consequences of those values. If the value that's more important to her than her son is one that leads to better outcomes for others in the world, great. If it leads to pain and suffering for herself and others without adding anything positive, then that value is destructive and I don't think it's harmful, even to her, to remove it. Indeed, I'm still not sure where the actual harm comes in, other than potential horror or discomfort with the /concept/ of having your values changed without you knowing it.

#+begin_quote
  Right, but kids have no values that you would be changing. Using a time machine to knock on a specific door at a specific minute would also cause that homeless person to not be born, but morally that's not equivalent to killing them.
#+end_quote

This is confusing the method for the desired outcome. If I want to stop Hitler from starting WWII, I might /prefer/ to use a time machine to prevent him from being born, but if I can't do that I would still accept the ability to snap my fingers and change his values.

  I would say that their after-snap state has no bearing on the morality of the decision, because as I said before (and I'm guessing you found that argument sound?) we tend to base our morality on the prior state of the value function.
#+end_quote

No, I don't really think I agree with you that the transition from prior state of the value has as much bearing morally as the consequences of their values.

#+begin_quote
  Ok, thought experiment. There's a person that has an heriloom that holds sentimental value. You snap them into hating that heirloom, though not the memory it's connected to. Then they destroy the heirloom. Is what you did moral?
#+end_quote

No, because consequentially the heirloom was causing no harm, but it was providing some benefit to their life. You can't divorce the harm of homophobia from the concept of the value itself. The whole /reason/ I'm okay with snapping away homophobia or sadism is because they /cause harm,/ in an unarguable and observable way. It might be arguable that they provide some value too, like the sentimentality of an heirloom, but if so I've never encountered a compelling argument for how.
