  It depends entirely on what those values are, in my view. There's no ur-value of "respecting values" that I think should be divorced from consequences of those values.
#+end_quote

It's not so much "respecting values" (which is morality), as "not changing value-functions" (which is "no brainwashing").

  If the value that's more important to her than her son is one that *leads to better outcomes for others in the world*, great.
#+end_quote

If instead of snapping the homophobes into acceptance you could snap the homosexuals into heterosexaulity, would you deem the outcome equally favourable? Not trying to be snarky, it's an honest question.

#+begin_quote
  This is confusing the method for the desired outcome. If I want to stop Hitler from starting WWII, I might /prefer/ to use a time machine to prevent him from being born, but if I can't do that I would still accept the ability to snap my fingers and change his values.
#+end_quote

I don't think it is, in fact I think that if you ask people how they would choose, between the time-travel option and the killing homeless people option, you wouldn't get an "it's the same". Also I don't think the Hitler analogy works all that well, because there is extremely little moral grey in stopping the holocaust. The "kill Hitler" hypothesis will practically always come on top, even if it comes with "but Hitler will suffer agonising torture for a million years".

#+begin_quote
  No, I don't really think I agree with you that the transition from prior state of the value has as much bearing morally as the consequences of their values.
#+end_quote

Wait a minute. I'll explain myself better. I'm not saying that if I had to choose between one single non-acting homophobe in San Francisco versus a kid about to be stoned to death in Iran I would hold my breath in indecisive panic. I'm not saying that preserving the value function and avoiding persecution and hostility have the same importance. What I'm saying is that the quantities and the measurements, in this particular circumstance, are enough to warrant forsaking the snap out of caution.

#+begin_quote
  No, because consequentially the heirloom was causing no harm, but it was providing some benefit to their life.
#+end_quote

We could add a caveat. You can make them hate their family heirloom and cherish an object reminiscent of a random insignificant moment in history at the same time. Do you think the overall morality of this snap is neutral?

#+begin_quote
  It might be arguable that they provide some value too, like the sentimentality of an heirloom, but if so I've never encountered a compelling argument for how.
#+end_quote

The problem is, you're thinking about the heirloom as an item instrumentally useful to satisfy a deeper value, in this case the sentimentality associated with the object. I'm trying to frame my examples around terminal values, in themselves.

Let's try this: if you asked most people to snap away the love for a dead relative, they wouldn't accept, despite the fact that they are suffering from the loss and nobody gains anything from their continued suffering. The thing that they don't want to loose is not an advantage in how they feel, or a memento of something else. They literally care about keeping caring.

P.s., sorry if this comment is all over the place, I had to write it in instalments.
