There's no need to go to every last homophobe and do that if you decided to snap. As I said before, if you just snapped your fingers and all is done, you wouldn't */get/* how much you're violating the values of those of which you are violating the values. But if you did explain to each one what you're about to do, and the fact that you're about to do it by snapping your fingers, then by gauging their reactions you would get a sense of the amount of harm that you are doing them.

On the other hand, it's also possible that a small number of them would prefer to not be a homophobe anymore.
