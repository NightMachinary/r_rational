I feel like most Uplift fiction is inherently colonialist in attitude. The notion of one group of people going in and turning another group of people into 'smarter' people is essentially identical to the rationale used to justify colonialism in Africa. It is, in many ways, a textbook case of the white man's burden. When you strictly limit the definition of Uplift to just the introduction of new technological methods, I suppose that is something more generally acceptable. In general, however, most Uplift stories include much more than just new technological methods. They usually introduce new societal modes of being, or a new governance, or things of this nature. In my opinion, these types of stories are inherently flawed. Perhaps I am making too broad statements, but I cannot help but feel tones of colonialism resounding throughout these works.
