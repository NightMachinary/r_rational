I like EP also (the writers clearly read Yudkowsky, given that the game features AI safety, existential risk, etc.) but I wouldn't call it hard SF - exhibit A: FTL transmissions are possible in the setting, though expensive, via "quantum entangled particles" (whaaaaat).

I don't like its mechanics at all (for instance, the sanity system - ADHD, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder can be caused by trauma in adults???). I'd prefer to write a freeform or dice-light RP in the setting. There's a fan made EP-to-Fate conversion that I've been meaning to look at for a while, actually.
