  exhibit A: FTL transmissions are possible in the setting, though expensive, via "quantum entangled particles" (whaaaaat)

This isn't /that/ out there. The [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/][no-communication theorm]] is some complex stuff, and there was a stretch of time where physicists thought that maybe you could use entanglement for FTL communication. It's still not "hard" science fiction, since it's known to be false, but it's not so far from hard science fiction as FTL travel.
