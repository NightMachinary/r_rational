Yeah, I figured.

Other things that aren't hard SF: one of the major effects of the Exsurgent Virus on the setting is that psi exists, even if uncommon. If I had my druthers any work with psi in it would get thrown out the hard sci-fi airlock. Bodily. Even if there's a good "reason" for it in-story, it's something I hate to come across as a surprise in a work that otherwise almost follows established physics. Which I know is a personal pet peeve, but... yeah.
