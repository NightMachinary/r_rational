I played this with some friends at GenCon (with myself as the gamemaster). Mechanically, it plays a lot like Call of Cthulhu, which makes a lot of sense given some of their inspirations. It's got:

- Uplifting
- Brain copies
- Effective immortality
- Robot morphs
- Existential threats
- Grey goo scenarios

And a whole bunch more. In addition to that, they put out a huge amount of content for free as PDFs (though the books are also amazing, and relatively cheap as far as these things go). In what other setting can you play as an uplifted whale? (Technically D&D lets you create one with the druid spell [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/awaken.htm][Awaken]] and then possess it with [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicJar.htm][Magic Jar]], but it's not the same, dammit.)
