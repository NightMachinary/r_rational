I really like a lot of Eclipse Phase, but there's problems I have with it too:

- The demographics and numbers and time-setting of the book are badly chosen and poorly thought out.
- A lot of the rules are mechanically not very good. There's a lot of unnecessarily complicated chargen considering the central game conceits. A few of the mechanical subsystems are not very well put together. The combat is unncessarily complicated for how deterministic it ends up being.

There's a lot to like in the setting and ideas, and the product itself's licensing, and the various suggested campaign elements. I suggest focusing on the awesome setting and theme elements and trying to avoid the actual rules as much as possible. Much like CoC in that respect.
