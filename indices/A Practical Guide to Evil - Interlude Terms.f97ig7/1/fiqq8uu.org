I think the ending of the chapter is setting up for an exploration of the negative sides of the Truce and Terms. So far the Villains involved have been either of Cat's pragmatic antivillain style or relatively harmless ones. Now we have a case where the it protects someone who seems to be a mass murderer and rapist from the justified anger of one he harmed. Makes the moral calculus a bit harder to swallow.

Reminds me a little of the Amnesty in Ward. Similarly there you have villains who have done pretty unambiguosly awful things given a second chance, and good conditions, while the normal people are living in tent cities, and the heros have to put up with it for the greater good.
