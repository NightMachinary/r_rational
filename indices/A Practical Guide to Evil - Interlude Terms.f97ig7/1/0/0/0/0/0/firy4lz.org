I only read up to arc 8 or so in Ward but from my understanding they were actively trying with Teacher but he was keeping a low profile, while Sleeper remained entirely beyond Valkyrie (Or anyone else's) power to easily defeat so they just left him alone on Earth Zayin as long as he wasn't moving. Teacher was basically a power unto himself at that point, and the only capes capable of handling him on the side of the heroes would be the Dragon/Defiant duo, and Valkyrie, who were all busy dealing with the actual existential threats like the machine army, tinkers building anti-planet skyguns, and the reality breaking broken trigger events. Most of the actual hero teams in the Metropolis were pretty pathetic by old world protectorate standards.
