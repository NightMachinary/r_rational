My principle in this is: whatever you're discussing, and whoever you're debating, never lie. Never fake your principles, never misrepresent your values. You can and should do great things with your way of presenting things, your choice of language, words, examples, angles to approach things from, but outright lying or faking just makes the problem more complicated. It's how we got in this shit we're in. Don't do something you wouldn't wish as a universal principle, and everyone lying about one's ideals would make political debates even worse a madhouse than they already are.
