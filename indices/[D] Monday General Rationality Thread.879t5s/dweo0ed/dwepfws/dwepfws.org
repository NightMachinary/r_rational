It's funny, I was thinking about debating recently. Quoting myself:

It's a little abstract, but it's like, metaphorically... being aware that it's not enough to push, you need your feet to be on solid ground. Knowing "my position" and why I believe in it isn't enough, I have to know "normal", and why people would be there; what obstacles there are between "normal" and my position, and respect these obstacles as serious enough to warrant a true effort.

I think this is a process a lot of people fail at, because they see a different opinion, they see their opinion, and they just fill the gap with generic [naïveté / cognitive bias / prejudice / pure evil / a society that never taught them better / stupidity] in a way that's reassuring (my position is the right one, but people disagree because they're stupid and they grew in a prejudiced society) but not actually good at finding ways to "bridge the gap". So they just say "this is why my position is the best, you really need to realize that", and that's only enough for people who are already almost convinced.
