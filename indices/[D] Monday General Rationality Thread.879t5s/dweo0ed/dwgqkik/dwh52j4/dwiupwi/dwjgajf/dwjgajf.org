  I am not a lawmaker. ... Nevertheless, this sort of debate is basically just entertainment.
#+end_quote

I think you're misunderstanding my point. It's not that I only enjoy debates if I win them, it's that if I don't think I can win a debate, then that implies that I think my position is worse than my opponent's. In which case, why would I argue for a position that I realize is worse?

#+begin_quote
  The problem is that if people realize that you are not debating in good faith, they will promptly ignore you altogether.
#+end_quote

Well sure, but that's an implementation problem. It's pretty easy to make an alt account, and people can take a long time to catch on if you're not insulting and pretend like you're an ingroup member.

#+begin_quote
  If that's the case, you're probably facing a difference in outcome preference rather than policy preference. If so, you need to back up and address the outcome preferences.
#+end_quote

That's the fundamental question, though. /Should/ I address the outcome preference, by arguing that a more centrist position is in both their interest and mine, even if we ultimately want different outcomes (which is the tack I currently take, and of course intend to keep taking for same-side extremists)? Or should I pretend to agree with their outcome, but suggest that the political party they'd otherwise align themselves with aren't extreme enough to implement the policies that would lead to their preferred outcome?

I understand pretty well why people find some of the things I want weird or unappealing. I'm not going to spontaneously change my value system, however. But I'm pragmatic enough to know that arguing directly for them is unlikely to work in my favour, so instead I'm considering alternate strategies for getting what I want.
