So I've been thinking about the goals I have when arguing politics. Namely, to

1. Moderate the views of opposite-side extremists towards the center in the hopes of decreasing the amount of extremists my side needs to deal with.
2. Moderate the views of same-side extremists towards the center so they're less likely to go "all parties are the same", and then dig their heels in to prevent incremental change that they don't feel goes far enough.

Obviously, this is strategically contradictory. Should I seek to use dark arts rationality to pose as an opposite-side member that's become dillusioned with the "establishment" because it's not extreme enough? Or should I use dark arts rationality to dillusion the faith opposite-side extremists typically have in their fellow human beings, so they go further towards the center, but hopefully don't become significantly more likely to actually use their voting power?

(As a given, I think debate is fun and enjoyable on its own merits, so even despite the fact that I'm not really likely to substantially change people's minds I'll still keep arguing.)
