  my side

From my point of view, this is the problem. It suggests that /you/ are an extremist, or more accurately a partisan, and I'm not sure what the difference really is.

A moderate won't say "my side". A moderate doesn't want a single party in control of government, because they know a party's goal's aren't policy objectives, but staying in control (and maybe using that control for personal gain).

A partisan will find it more important to /damage the other side/ than to /achieve preferable outcomes/.

I'd be worried, but nothing I've seen indicates you have any such skills. In terms of strategy, knowing your limits is also pretty important.

--------------

In order to achieve preferred outcomes, in an open and free society, it is best to simply argue for the preferred outcomes as diligently and persuasively as possible, proposing whatever strategy seems wise. Doing otherwise can have disastrous consequences.

--------------

In terms of "goals I have when arguing politics", "achieving policy outcomes" hasn't been one in quite a long time. The odds of actually changing someone's mind is so incredibly small, and the effects of success are also highly limited -- the outcome isn't worth the effort. And "winning" an arguing is something only children try to do. Better goals are to "learn" and "educate", with emphasis on the former and humility in the latter. Suppose in the course of debate that you successfully educate someone on viewpoint. Maybe they'll convert to your position, or maybe they'll use their new understanding to dismantle your position when debating with someone else.

Personally, I just love the thrill of the intellectual battle. Experience, knowledge, and raw intelligence -- crafting hypotheticals and thinking through scenarios in realtime... no one is likely to convert anyone else (especially on key issues), but it sure is fun, and in the end, I usually know more than I went in with.
