  From my point of view, this is the problem. It suggests that you are an extremist, or more accurately a partisan, and I'm not sure what the difference really is.

I am indeed a partisan. That doesn't make non-moderate, however-- it's simply the truth of FPTP. If you're at all left of center, you vote democrat. If you're at all right of center, you vote republican. And we've learnt that anything less than total control of the government by one party results in absolutely nothing getting done.

  I'd be worried, but nothing I've seen indicates you have any such skills. In terms of strategy, knowing your limits is also pretty important.
#+end_quote

Of course I don't know dark arts rationality-- I've never needed it before. But appealing to people's basest impulses isn't /that/ difficult to learn.

  In order to achieve preferred outcomes, in an open and free society, it is best to simply argue for the preferred outcomes as diligently and persuasively as possible, proposing whatever strategy seems wise. Doing otherwise can have disastrous consequences.
#+end_quote

I'm not convinced about that. Again, I don't think I'm an extremist (at least, relative to most positions I hold), but I'm still relatively extreme compared to a lot of people. If I try to argue for what I actually want, they'll just dismiss me out of hand. And the outcomes can't be more disastrous than they already are-- these people are already doing what they can to work against me and support what is (from my perspective) bad policy.

  In terms of "goals I have when arguing politics",... (Snip)
#+end_quote

Why try to do anything other than win the debate? That's just self defeating. I try to recognize when I'm wrong, but doing anything other than attempting to further my goals is just even more of an objective waste of time than usual.

And yes, I know that it's impossible to truly convert most people. But it is significantly more likely that I can make someone less or more extreme in their beliefs, and as I mentioned in the first post, I'm wondering wich tactic is more effective.
