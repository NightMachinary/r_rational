  I'm wondering wich tactic is more effective.

The problem is that if people realize that you are not debating in good faith, they will promptly ignore you altogether.

If that's the case, you're probably facing a difference in outcome preference rather than policy preference. If so, you need to back up and address the outcome preferences. For instance, you might take the position that the ultimate fate of mankind should be digital uploading, because this offers the most potential for longevity, experience, and individuality. Someone else might say that whatever mankind becomes, we should remain identifiably human, and therefore digital uploading is off the table. You might not be talking politics anymore at this point, but it could still be an interesting discussion.

On the other hand, revealing truly distasteful views will end a discussion. People I have debated with in the past have claimed bestiality should be seen as acceptable and non-deviant behavior; or that they see nothing morally or ethically wrong with killing babies. Notably, some people promote racial or ethnic genocide. If you suspect even for a moment that people find your positions truly repugnant, then you should educate yourself on the issue more thoroughly and figure out why your position is socially or morally unacceptable.

  doing anything other than attempting to further my goals is just even more of an objective waste of time than usual.

I am not a lawmaker. I don't draft public policy. I'm not a pundit, or professor, or other sort of thought leader. Therefore, engaging in any sort of political debate is primarily a form of entertainment. Which isn't to say it isn't practical: developing a better model of the world is always worthwhile, whether that means learning a new thing, or understanding a different perspective. Nevertheless, this sort of debate is basically just entertainment.

  Why try to do anything other than win the debate?
