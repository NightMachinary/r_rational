Pretty much all the good ones have been posted at least once. Practical is a must if you haven't read it yet, super powereds and savage divinity are also excellent. Mother of learning has obviously been posted plenty, as has anything wildbow. Star child was meh, similar to small worlds, maybe a little better, iron teeth is supposed to be good but I just haven't been able to get into it. Large chests is meh, mediocre writing and too many sex scenes, same with dao of magic, except minus the sex scenes. Good student is decent, though I haven't read any since finishing 1-30, waiting for it to get farther ahead.
