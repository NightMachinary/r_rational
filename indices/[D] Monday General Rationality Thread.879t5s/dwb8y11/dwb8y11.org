I sometimes check out topwebfiction just to see if anything new catches my eye. I noticed a new series (new to me, at least) has taken the number 2 spot: [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/small-worlds/]["Small Worlds"]] by Alex Raizman. Apparently it's only been up since March 15th, but I'm a bit surprised it has so many votes. The author says he regularly posts to [[/r/writingprompts]], so maybe that explains it?

Anyway, before investing time into that, or its follow-up [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/strange-cosmology/]["Strange Cosmology"]] (currently number 18 on the site), I was wondering if anyone else had read them yet, if they were recommended, and if they were rational?
