Just a follow-up; I decided to give Small Worlds a shot. [[/u/Turniper]] hit it dead on as "popcorn reading;" it's quick and action-packed, and while it has hints of deeper themes to explore and threads to follow, it's rather shallow overall. This isn't necessarily a plot you need to think about and wonder what comes next, because "what comes next" will literally happen in the next chapter.

Like [[/u/dalitt]] said, it definitely draws inspiration from American Gods and has some MiB influence too. I also felt echoes of Unsong; a lot of the gods alter reality by manipulating equations, which felt similar to the Word manipulations in Unsong. But overall I'd say the entire thing felt like a superhero story where the heroes are gods.

Definitely not a rational story, though. /Everything/ happens because the plot requires it - or at least, we don't get enough insight into seeing why characters act like they do to say otherwise. Rather than delving too deeply into the rules of the world, the most common catch-phrase is literally "just roll with it." That said there are some decent applications for solving fights, but they seem designed solely to show off a cool outcome. The characters themselves act in such a way that these moments feel railroaded to an extent.

Anyway, it was a quick read (I finished it in less than a day). I may read the sequel, as the story stopped without remotely resolving the main plot, but only because I don't have anything else to read right now. I'd give it a 5/10, maybe a 5.5/10 because the dangling threads make me a bit curious as to where it'll go.

Thanks to the two posters for chiming in!
