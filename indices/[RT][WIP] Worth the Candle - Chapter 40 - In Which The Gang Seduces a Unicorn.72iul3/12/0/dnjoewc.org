The armor is immovable not invulnerable. Its ability to resist damage when locked comes from its ability to hold each molecule of the armor in place. Now, the immovable rod, which this is based on, should really be called the very hard to move rod, because you can move it with a strength check of 30, or a natural 20 plus 30 STR (this is very high for normal D&D play). However that is to move the entire armor. To move a much smaller point section of armor, say a few grams of metal, would take much lower strength (or in physics terms, total force applied).

It's similar to how a bullet and a fist have roughly the same kinetic energy (ballparked) but a bullet has far far greater penetrating power.

(I will confess to not actually having run the physics for this, if someone else wants to, and the show that I'm wrong about relative force of an arrow and a unicorn, or at least the assumptions you'd need, let me know.)

(On mobile, apologies.)
