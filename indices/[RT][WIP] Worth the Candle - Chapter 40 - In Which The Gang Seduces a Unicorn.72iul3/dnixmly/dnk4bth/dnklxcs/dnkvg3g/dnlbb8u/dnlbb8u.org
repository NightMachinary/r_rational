I took that to mean that the revision mage was expecting Joon to perfectly replay his actions (because Joon wouldn't remember), but Joon was behaving differently each time (because he /did/ remember), which was perplexing. And which the revision mage would only notice if he /also/ remembered.

I favor this interpretation because the story is pretty solidly locked into a first-person limited viewpoint, so Joon shouldn't have been able to describe the qualia of rewinding+replaying if he didn't remember it. He'd have just described the final replay + time suddenly jumping forward.

My guess on /why/ this is, is that while Joon's body is "in" the world-sim and vulnerable to physics skullduggery, Joon's /mind/ is an external brain-em program being synced to that world-sim, and as such is not affected by in-world time travel. It's Joon's "game avatar" that was trapped in the time effect, not Joon himself. He was there on the layer above the sim, "watching" as the sim's full-dive UI reported the whole revisioning thing.
