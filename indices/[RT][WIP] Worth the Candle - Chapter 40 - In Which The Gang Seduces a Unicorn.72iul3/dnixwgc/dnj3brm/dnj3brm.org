  Essentialism: What is it?
#+end_quote

I think it's programming.

In reality, essentialism is, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism][as Wikipedia is kind to note]], a philosophical concept which suggests that "every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function". Essentialism as a game skill would be, then, about manipulating fundamental properties of things. Since our primary hypothesis is that Aerb is a simulation, it stands to reason that fundamental properties of things are defined by programming code; this skill is used to manipulate it.

Perhaps on higher levels it would allow Juniper to hack into the root account of the computer simulating Aerb.

*Edit:* Or perhaps it would be read-only. I.e., it would allow Juniper to read the code, gathering objectively true and complete information about his surroundings, but not edit anything.

(Of course, it could just be "metamagic", i.e. the practice of creating magics such as blood/bone/velocity/flower ones. Would be less SoD-breaking, and fit the theme of everything technically being latent magic. Would be much less exciting.)

(Or maybe it's just to argue philosophy really good.)
