Yes, but I'm pretty sure Juniper already made actions sufficiently similar to this for the skill to be unlocked. As example, some of his interactions with Fenn in chapters [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26963748][26]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27276375][31]] were basically him trying to cheer her up; chapters [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27276375][31]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27427902][35]] contain some very small (but not too small) attempts at team-building.

Do you remember what it took to unlock Intimidation? Spirit would need to be ridiculously specific in order to still not be unlocked, since such skills seem to unlock from Juniper doing anything even remotely similar to what they're about.
