Oh, you're correct: “Thirty-six skills were still greyed out, their names just on the other side of readable no matter how hard I squinted at them.” (From [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25816869][chapter 2]].)

[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] I'm curious, what's your reasoning for making the skills visible to us? Or were they not supposed to be visible? (This is a pretty awesome story, BTW!)
