He picked up music pretty easily. What other skills can he develop?

- Woodworking: Grab a knife and get to whittling. Or, build a simple table.
- Smithing: Pretty similar to woodworking. He can probably get started with a hammer and some scrap metal.
- Livestock: Get a goat and take care of it.
- Language: Get one of his party to teach him another language.
- Spirit: Get some pom poms and start shaking. Or maybe give a rousing speach before they head off to battle? Hell, he might get it from something he does while high on unicorn juice.
- Shotguns: Get a shotgun and start shooting things.
- Wards: Grak might be willing to teach him something, but it sounds like it might take too much work to get started (building a wand is hard).
- Essentialism: What is it?

I suppose it's possible that he picked up some of this stuff off screen.

*Edit:* [[/u/nytelios]] pointed out that that he can't actually read the greyed-out skills, so pursuing these things isn't all that obvious to Joon.
