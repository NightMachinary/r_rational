To be clear "In Which the Gang Seduces a Unicorn" is not the actual chapter title, but when the chapter was posted it didn't have one, because I forgot (which I do on occasion).

I almost /did/ take the title of this post as the actual chapter title, because I thought it was hilarious, but settled on "The Feminine Mystique", which is the title of the book largely responsible for sparking second-wave feminism.
