I wonder if its like in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality where unicorn blood quickly loses its power and potency once its out of the unicorn, otherwise they just wasted an enormous amount of healing potential. She only drank a handful of it and it healed everything, a horse has roughly 50 litres of blood, thats a lot of unicorn blood tinctures. And even if the blood lost its power once out of the unicorn, you could still keep the unicorn alive while farming it. Keep it in some kind of immobility enclosure while you bled it whenever you needed it.
