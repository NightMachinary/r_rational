I'm curious how unicorns are born since they're these solitary virgin-harem-seeking creatures. Conceived by nature, parthenogenesis? With a low reproductive rate, I have this notion that they'd be an endangered species (so Joon can't capitalize on farming them for quick skill-ups), what with the wealthy's penchant for seeking panaceas/highs (look at rhino horns, and that's considering they're practically snake oil). They're absurdly hard to fight in a frontal assault, but they have that obvious glaring weakness that the party exploited. I can imagine the rich kidnapping or hiring virgins to use in similar ploys. Virgin sacrifice would take on a whole new meaning.

In other news, worldbuilding fans rejoice! I poked the author with a few questions and was undeservedly rewarded with some nuggets of details.

--------------

- How could Larkspur afford Fireteam Blackheart when Anglecynn's black budget couldn't muster the authorization and funds for retrieving a billion obol (ideal expected investment value over a short 5+ years) item? By their own admission, they were a below-strength team, so they could have been a disposable insurance policy sent on a low-cost, high-risk, high-reward mission. But given their relative effectiveness, it was a pretty high value gamble.

  Amaryllis was part of one faction of the Lost King's Court within Anglecynn, while Larkspur is part of a different one. It's not "Anglecynn's black budget" so much as "the budget that could be moved around by one faction without accountability checks or information leaking". I can't remember how much of the background is actually littered around the text thus far, but the Amaryllis-faction was at the point where they knew they were probably going to have to admit that they had lost the key and that they were setting up this secret research facility, and were hoping that they could wait it out so as to lessen the political impacts of this revelation. And then Amaryllis gets this kangaroo-court indictment, which she thinks she can/will be freed from, and things go to shit from there. Larkspur, meanwhile, is Foreign Security Director, so he's drawing on different budgets and working within different constraints. (The whole thing is basically a clusterfuck of overlapping plots, poor information timing, half-measures, and coverups being worse than the crime.)

- "because the teleportation key we had was ridiculously valuable and if anyone saw us arrive they would either try to take it from us, or go tell someone who would then try to take it from us."

  Why is their group so cautious in this regard? How are they at any more risk than a regular group of 5 people traveling to a touchstone (and assuming hundreds of keys are used multiple times daily)? Touchstones suggest routine usage and an officially sanctioned terminal. Supposing you can't trust some (Barren Jewel), aren't most safe? Or does each local polity have their own version of the TSA to vet arrivals?

  Private ownership of a teleportation key is basically unheard of, and unscheduled travel to a touchstone is also basically unheard of. Going to a touchstone would basically be like an unregistered 747 appearing over La Guardia airport and requesting to land; it would be cause for alarm. And yes, teleportation keys are one of the things covered under imperial law, so almost every polity does have a regulatory agency that deals with teleportation keys, if only because losing a teleportation key is a very big deal that gets lots of attention. (Teleportation into a private place like Weik Handrum would usually be handled by traveling from a touchstone and then sending the teleportation key back via bulk teleportation, with the inherent risk covered by an extensive and expensive insurance contract and significant collateral, often with an officially authorized 'rider' who is trusted and presumably lowers risk (and the involvement of a lot of major players in the event of theft or loss).) Oh, and then some of the keys are held under exemptions from imperial laws, almost exclusively by state actors, who typically use them outside the systems of touchstones for a variety of reasons. Normally they would have a ready-room prepared ahead of time and use personnel who had been there, or in rare circumstances they would pre-schedule arrival via touchstone (which leaks information about movements and capabilities, and if you're going to do that, better and less expensive to just use the public keys).

  None of these answers are canonical until they make it into the story, which they might not.
