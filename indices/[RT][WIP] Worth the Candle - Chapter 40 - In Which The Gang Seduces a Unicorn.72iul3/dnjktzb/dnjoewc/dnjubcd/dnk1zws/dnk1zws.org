50 m/s is pretty close to the right speed for an arrow, so you'll note that if an arrow takes .1 seconds to stop, it travels about 2.5 meters (uniform deceleration) while stopping.

To recalculate, I'll note that for these sort of situations with unknown timescales, it is generally best to use an energy-based analysis, and... if the arrow got its energy from being pushed by a force of 0-linearly-to-450N through 1m, then a force of 4500N (1000 lbs) would stop it in .05m (We hope the dents can be beat back out!)

So unless the immobility plate affords the entirety of the protection to the point of impact, rather than having volumetrically distributed immobility, it won't do much better against arrows than

Also note that 1000 pounds is roughly (order-of-magnitude) what you're going to need to push a 1/2" diameter point through 2mm thick mild steel (calculation omitted due to obscene number of assumptions) AND that 1000 lbs over the area of a 1/2" diameter arrowshaft is about 5000 PSI - about the compressive strength of strong woods. (At which point the the shaft splinters into little bits, mostly decoupling the weight of the arrow-shaft from the collision, and so decreasing the energy available for armor-peircing by a factor of three or so)

This is, of course, probably why the armor in question was about 2mm thick: any armor good enough that it'll block everything but a dead-on shot is good enough. (Incidentally, it looks like arrows are going to follow a linear-square rule: an arrow twice as big takes twice as much force to push through, but is four times as strong. Followed by an application of the square-cube law for drawing arrows, this will show why giants don't bother with armor when fighting other giants, while gnomish warfare mostly involves holding the enemy down while drilling holes - when the field is too muddy for the the sterotypical seige and explosive weaponry.)
