Can you quote/point to where exactly this happens? I can't find anything to support this in the chapter. Ctrl+F for "confus" finds

  The Anyblade hit him in the head and clanged off him, twisting in my hands. Aumann stared at me in confusion for just a second, then brushed the Anyblade with the back of his hand, sending it flying from my grip and through the wall, breaking several bones in my hand. Then he touched me and the world lurched sideways.

This is Aumann, the gold mage (not the revision mage), just after he's been revised from dying to the first void rifle shot; there's several reasons he'd be confused. Joon is physically attacking him (pointless against a gold mage), and from his perspective Joon appeared out of nowhere.

However, as far as we can see, the text suggests that the revision mage /does/ retain memories of what he revises, because he dodges Joon's attacks after revising them away. Nothing suggests that Joon is somehow changing his attacks with each revision.
