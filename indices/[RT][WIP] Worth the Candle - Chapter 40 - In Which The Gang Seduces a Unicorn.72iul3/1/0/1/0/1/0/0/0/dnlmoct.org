I think you're overthinking this. What happens, if you read the chapter:

1. Glove comes out, Amaryllis shoots Aumann, Joon hits Rev mage with paperweight.

2. Joon + Rev mage rewind, Joon does the same swing, Rev mage dodges.

3. Joon swings again (after having done the first swing) and hits.

4. Rev mage reverses that hit. Now to Joon's perception he has already swung once and missed and is on his second swing.

5. Joon does another swing, which misses.

6. After the third swing (which initially hit) has been reversed, enough time has passed for Amaryllis to reach the mage and stick him with the sword.

So at the start of each swing, Joon would have seen Amaryllis appear to teleport closer.

There are a few other things we can infer about Revision Magic from the text:

- It appears to be a targeted effect. Earlier in the same chapter Joon sees the gold mage send some bullets out to test for wards, which are then reversed back with Revision Magic. If Revision Magic was affecting the entire world, or even just a large area, he wouldn't see the bullets fly back in reverse. Nothing would have happened at all from his perspective. This happens several times in the chapter, for example:

  And then I was treated to the sight of those ball bearings reversing their motion and coming back to him as he rose up from the ground, with movements that made no sense unless physics were running in reverse. I dashed forward, sword drawn, none too hopeful about my chances, and brought the Anyblade down in the form of a two-handed greatsword that nearly clipped the ceiling, right as I saw the hole in Aumann's forehead fill in with flesh.

- Revision Magic doesn't affect "time" at all; just causes "physics to run in reverse" within a target area/object/person. Everything suggests that this happens at the same speed as the original events, in the reverse direction. Could also explain why it can't reverse magic; magic essentially produces physical discontinuities, so the (physical) simulation would have undefined behaviour if it tried to get past those. The important takeaway is that revision takes time to happen, while the rest of the world continues as normal.
