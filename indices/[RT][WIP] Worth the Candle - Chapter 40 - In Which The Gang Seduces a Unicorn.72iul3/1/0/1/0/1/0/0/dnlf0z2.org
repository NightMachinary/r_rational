Hmm. On the one hand (emphasis mine):

  and the thing was /I knew this was happening/, I had read all about it in the Commoner's Guide, I knew that single combat with a revision mage was essentially pointless, I knew that I *must have been* landing those hits because there was no way that he was dodging from blows he couldn't even see coming.

So, yes, each swing was his "first" swing according to his memories.†

But on the other hand (again, emphasis mine):

  But I also saw Amaryllis, who *to my fractured perception was teleporting down the hallway towards us*, holding a sword hilt in her hand, and after the third time I hit Colwin, I stopped just shy, because Amaryllis was right next to him and he had a sword sticking straight through his head.

If Joon means "teleporting" as in once---from far away to very nearby---then that coheres with the above. But if he means "teleporting" as in a series of steps, then something more complex is going on.

My own (new) guess: the revision mage doesn't rewind time "all the way" to the same previous moment each time. Therefore, there are bits of memory left "at the beginning" of the fight that are scraps of the beginnings of each rewind that were not completely overwritten, which are experienced as the external world making discontinuous progress quite quickly around them as the revision mage repeatedly uses their power.

/If/ this is true, then I wonder if it's an inherent property of revision magic, or maybe of /imperfectly performed/ revision magic (i.e. revision magic not skill-levelled to 100; or revision magic done in a hurry under distracted conditions.) I would expect that one could "take 20" to do unopposed revision magic perfectly, neatly erasing back to the same keyframe each time.

† In this instance, Joon probably attacked with "the same" series of attacks each time, so the revision mage was doing what was essentially a tool-assisted speedrun of a deterministic fighting-game CPU opponent. But, given a little cleverness, and the "imperfect erasure implies an advancing temporal context outside the bubble" hypothesis above, Joon might be /able to/ counter with /different/ swings each time! This is sort of like the thing Harry did in HPMOR with the piece of paper and the Time-Turner---it's numbering your "self" given a context, and then changing your action depending on which "self" you turn out to be. In Joon's case, he could look at the world outside the bubble, do a quick heuristic "hash" of what's unique about it, and then strike based on an index of that hash into a mental table of possible attacks.
