  In regard to Joon being a revision mage, he might keep the memories of each revision. I'm guessing that's not the case either.

Why not? The fact that (in Ch. 33) the revision mage could change his actions after revising himself from dying so that he dodged Joon's attacks (which previously hit) suggests that he did retain his memories. Or at least that, if he doesn't, there are ways to get around that.
