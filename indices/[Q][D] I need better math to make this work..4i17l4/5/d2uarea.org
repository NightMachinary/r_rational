+1 to Anakiri's comment

What you really want to look at are the maths and physics behind things like temperature and pressure, as well as (as Anakiri points out) chemical reactions. These are cases where a massive series of stacked probabilities becomes certain enough to have simple equations predicting them.

To use your word, you will virtually always experience atmospheric pressure, because the likelihood of the brownian motion lining up in /just the right way/ to remove that pressure just isn't going to happen.

Also, to reiterate Anakiri, avoid telling people on the internet they're wrong. It generally doesn't work. People are generally "smart" - as in, they have a process by which they go from information about the situation to conclusions - and I think it might actually be harder to convince them that the process they use to do that is wrong (or yielded incorrect results). What you want to do (I think) is add information to the situation they're thinking about, and then they can do their process and (maybe) achieve different results. Belief-in-belief still applies.
