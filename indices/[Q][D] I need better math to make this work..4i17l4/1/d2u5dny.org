The odds of rolling twelve sixes /once/ is (1/6)^{12} which is:

#+begin_quote
  1/2,176,782,336
#+end_quote

The odds of doing it ten times in a row is (1/2,176,782,336)^{10} which is:

#+begin_quote
  1/2,388,636,399,360,109,977,557,402,041,718,133,080,829,429,159,844,757,507,642,063,199,359,529,632,522,467,783,435,119,230,976
#+end_quote

Which you might notice is a large number (~2 trigintillion).

If you want to use "virtually certain if done a quadrillion times" then something closer to "six sixes three times in a row", since the odds of rolling six sixes three times in a row is:

#+begin_quote
  1/101,559,956,668,416
#+end_quote

Or approximately one in a hundred trillion.
