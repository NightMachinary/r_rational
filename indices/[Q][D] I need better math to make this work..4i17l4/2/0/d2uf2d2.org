We have a sample of one planet, not of one chemical process. In fact, we are pretty familiar with chemical processes and how they work, and we can get a feeling of how much variables are at play and how many events are needed for a molecule of a certain complexity to form, since we already have the amino acids formation rates from the Miller experiment and such. If we take for example amino acids and nucleotides as the basic structures, and we eyeball a "molecular complexity value" for these molecules, and a "minimal complexity necessary for self replication value", ve can get a feeling of how much events we need to get a self replicating molecule of adequate complexity in nature, and all this taking into account no other molecules that the ones we have on Earth, thus very likely accepting lower odds than in reality.
