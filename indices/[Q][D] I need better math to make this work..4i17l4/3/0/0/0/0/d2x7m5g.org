  You're mistaking my terror for some need of feeling superior.

I don't think you /need/ to feel superior. I think you /do/ feel superior. And rightly so! Creationists are scary because of how much political power they wield, while being so astonishingly, willfully stupid and anti-intellectual. Your tone is dripping with well-earned condescention towards them. They deserve it... but by making me feel all of that, you're distracting from your lesson.

The problem isn't the numbers. Even if the math worked, I would still notice that made up arbitrary math to support your argument, rather than allowing your argument to follow from undeniable math. It smells fishy. You are trying to save an argument that is flawed at its core.

If your point is that coincidences happen more than you might naively expect, then use the birthday paradox. With only 23 people in a room, there's a 50% chance that two of them share a birthday. There are only 22 chances that any one else shares a birthday with /you/. But there are then 21 chances that somebody other than you shares a birthday with Person 2, and then 20 chances that someone other than you two shares a birthday with Person 3. By the time you're done, there are 253 chances of a match, at 1/366 probability each. Lesson: Don't confuse the chance of something happening to you with the chance of something happening at all.

If your point is that big numbers make probabilities into virtual certaities, then ask why the sun is still shining. If the sun's core is hot enough to fuse hydrogen, why hasn't it consumed all of its hydrogen at the speed of gravity? Alternatively, why isn't it flickering as it blasts its fuel away from the fusion zone? Answer: Because the chance of two protons fusing when they collide in the sun's core is only around 1/10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It's only that high because of [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamow_factor][quantum tunneling]]. (Feel free to check my math!) But the sun is very, very big, so its particles keep winning that lottery at a rate that is steady and predictable enough for life on Earth to exist, while only affecting a small portion of the sun at a time. Lesson: this isn't a thought experiment, you owe your life every day to the certainty of improbable things over large numbers of trials.
