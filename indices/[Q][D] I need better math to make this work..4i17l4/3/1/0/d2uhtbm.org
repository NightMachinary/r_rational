You could really try to show a little less condescension. It's unhelpful. I agree with your points in a vague sort of way, but this is not the place for them and the tone you use just makes me cringe. Take it to [[/r/atheism]] if you want pats on the back, or [[/r/debatereligion]] if you actually want to develop it.
