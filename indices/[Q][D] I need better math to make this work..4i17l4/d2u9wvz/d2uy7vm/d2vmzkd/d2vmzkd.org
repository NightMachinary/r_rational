No worries, I've never really agreed with the mods on that point. Even if I did, subthreads are open season - discuss whatever comes up. And, your thread's been deleted. As far as I'm concerned, we're not in any subreddit at all anymore. Go nuts!

You are correct that "Every atom does exactly what you want" is way far out on the tail of the graph, on the opposite side as "No atom does exactly what you want". The sharp peak is at "X% of atoms do exactly what you want". That percent does compound as you look at reacting the results of previous reactions. But there are /so many atoms/ that it doesn't make much sense to talk about it like a probability to me. I don't think I disagree with your point. I'm basically saying that when you try to combine atoms together more than 10^{25} times, you are, in practice, guaranteed to get millions and billions of every possible result.

I'm saying that it's /so/ guaranteed that it is misleading to even talk about it in terms of probability. As narfanator mentioned, you're talking about "atmospheric pressure turns off because brownian motion lines up just right" as if it's something to even seriously consider. Yes, technically, there /is/ a probability of that happening, and there /is/ a probability of life not forming from a mixture that could have formed life, but I think even humoring those notions is muddying your intuition pump. It is /ineffective writing./

And that's the real problem here. I never thought you were asking for help crafting a debate with a real creationist, or else I would have just told you you're in the wrong place. I thought you were mentioning them for no reason. You're right, everyone here is fully on board with abiogenesis and evolution and heliocentrism. We all love to sneer at the silly little /creationists/. You have succeeded in making me feel superior to someone who isn't present, and you've got me thinking about how stupid they are. Why did you make me feel that? How does that feeling help your point? Why are you distracting me with that when you're trying to teach me?

You've just primed to me identify as an evolutionist, so I put on my scientist hat. You've told me that I should care about truth and accuracy - then you immediately start making up numbers! You told me pay attention to things like that, so I immediately notice that making up /different/ numbers leads to a different conclusion. You are undermining your own argument!

I'd really recommend that you just stick with the birthday paradox or something.
