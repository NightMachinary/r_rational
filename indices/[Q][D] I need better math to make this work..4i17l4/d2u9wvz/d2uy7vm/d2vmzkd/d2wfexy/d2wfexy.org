  I don't think I disagree with your point. I'm basically saying that when you try to combine atoms together more than 1025 times, you are, in practice, guaranteed to get millions and billions of every possible result.

Which is exactly what I'm saying.

  I'm saying that it's so guaranteed that it is misleading to even talk about it in terms of probability.
#+end_quote

And I agree, my intention was to arrange a metaphor to help make this clear to someone who doesn't have a good picture of any of this points in their minds. Some people don't think about certain things that don't influence their everyday lives, and they can be lead to certain conclusions because they lack fitting models of how some things happen. What I think you misunderstood from my text is the audience that it is addressed to, which is to say someone who fancies increasing their knowledge if the explanation is good and clear enough. Coincidentally, I think this description suits a large share of many first world country populations.

For example, in the United States (which I don't live in, but which I take interest in seeing as they're the most powerful country in the world and they are the people that vote for the person who takes the choices that will definitely affect my country in the long run, not to mention that 95% of their policies are applied here too after a couple of years) only 32% of the population is a supporter of the naturalistic explanation for the origin of species, and I think that giving the other rest better instruments for understanding is a worthwhile project for my free time. I could also leather-bind books, but that is boring to do every day.

  We all love to sneer at the silly little creationists. You have succeeded in making me feel superior to someone who isn't present, and you've got me thinking about how stupid they are.
#+end_quote

You're mistaking my terror for some need of feeling superior.

#+begin_quote
  but I think even humoring those notions is muddying your intuition pump. It is ineffective writing.
#+end_quote

I agree that could be the case. I lack writing experience.

  You've told me that I should care about truth and accuracy - then you immediately start making up numbers!
#+end_quote

That is the reason I asked what I believe to be critical thinking people to help me out with the math. This wasn't supposed to be an advertisement to my writing skills, this was supposed to be a "hey guys this thing doesn't make sense with these numbers, do you happen to know a way in which they would make more sense?".

I thought this was clearly stated in the original post, but I also think I often fall victim to the illusion of transparency.
