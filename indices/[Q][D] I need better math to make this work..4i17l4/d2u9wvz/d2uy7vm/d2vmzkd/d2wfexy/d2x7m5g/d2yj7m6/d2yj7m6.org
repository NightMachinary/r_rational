  The problem isn't the numbers. Even if the math worked, I would still notice that made up arbitrary math to support your argument, rather than allowing your argument to follow from undeniable math.

Keeping in mind that this is a thought experiment and not a scientific paper, would you care to elaborate on this sentence? As I replied to Isparrish:

#+begin_quote
  we are pretty familiar with chemical processes and how they work, and we can get a feeling of how much variables are at play and how many events are needed for a molecule of a certain complexity to form, since we already have the amino acids formation rates from the Miller experiment and such. If we take for example amino acids and nucleotides as the basic structures, and we eyeball a "molecular complexity value" for these molecules, and a "minimal complexity necessary for self replication value", ve can get a feeling of how much events we need to get a self replicating molecule of adequate complexity in nature, and all this taking into account no other molecules that the ones we have on Earth, thus very likely accepting lower odds than in reality.

This was in the original text for context. Maybe I should have added it here also... Anyway, it's not like there is no possible math that one could think of to approach the necessary number of events to get a self-replicating molecule, and actually that number should be way, way lower than what my thought experiment uses (because, as ZeroNihilist pointed out: "if every atom on the planet (~1.33e50) attempted that once a millisecond since the universe began (~4.3e20) there would still only be a ~0.0000024% chance that it would ever have occurred"). If even an amazingly and unnecessarily high number as mine becomes virtually certain with enough repetitions, then a relatively smaller number as the one necessary to get a naturally occurring self-replicating molecule should be child's play for the planet.

But this you already know, of course. The problem, apparently, is that my suggestion was /too/ unlikely. A better one would be one that falls in the range of "if every atom on earth had one ten thousand interactions per millisecond since four billion years ago, this event would have happened seven times" or something.

  Your tone is dripping with well-earned condescention towards them.
#+end_quote

Even if I agree that they earned condescension, I really didn't mean to sound condescending. Reading again now, I think that I can picture how the way I wrote may sound off, and you pointing it out helped me figure out the problem. So thank you for that.
