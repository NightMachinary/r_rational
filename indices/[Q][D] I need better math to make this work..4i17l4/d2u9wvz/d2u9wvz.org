My first advice would be to not do whatever you are doing. You are invoking tribalism for what appears to be no good reason - though of course it may make more sense in context.

If you must defend Our Side's (evolutionists? Do we call ourselves that?) righteous and true process of abiogenesis against Their Side's silly and misguided foolishness... still don't, because abiogenesis is a chemical process. Just like any other chemical process, the statistical effects only dominate way far out on the tails of the graph - functionally never, because there are many Avagadro's numbers of trials to make the graph really sharp. If you put the same ingredients in the same environment you'll get the same result. I would only feel comfortable talking about chance when talking about multiple planets, and their probability of starting in the right place.

If you must talk about chance, then you are misleading your audience into thinking that your numbers mean anything, when you actually pulled them out of thin air, annoying both of the tribes you are invoking.

If you /must/ have your numbers, I recommend not using any numbers that break your calculator if you don't have to. You don't need to go to such extremes to demonstrate your point, and phrasing it as x number of y number of die rolls is unnecessarily dense. The chance of winning the lottery is, let's say, 1/10,000,000. Earth has 160,000,000 random tickets. Now Earth's chance of /not/ winning the lottery is 1/10,000,000. You'd need to look through, on average, ten million Earths to find one without life.

With the relationship between probability and number of trials plainly revealed, a creationist will now object. They will say that you are misrepresenting the numbers, and Earth does not have that many tickets relative to the odds. They will say that it's more like rolling 120 sixes in a mere quadrillion tries. You will have no defense against that claim, because their made-up numbers are not necessarily worse than your made-up numbers, and you will make Our Side look foolish. Only proceed if that is your intention.
