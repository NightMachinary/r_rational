Hmm, so debating with creationists is not a super good use of time, in terms of "convince this person that they're wrong and you're right" since most of these discussions are not held in good faith. In general, though, as long as it's reasonably possible that somewhere in the universe there is intelligent life, you can talk about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle][anthropic principle]] (introduced briefly by SMBC [[http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=1932][here]]) to explain why it's not super unreasonable that there's life, even if it is unlikely.

The basic thing you could say is, yeah, there are tons of planets with no life. By definition, though, there aren't people on a planet without life philosophizing about life.

In a universe in which life is incredibly unlikely and only a small number of stars have it, every living intelligent creature will be in a situation that say the following: "Wow, the planet I'm on is surprisingly, unusually good for intelligent life! this is an awfully suspicious coincidence!" So, it is technically true that life is fairly unlikely to take root on any particular planet, but it happened to take root on the planet on which we live. However, the fact that this is true doesn't imply something strange is going on. This is just what things look like if you assume life happens very rarely, but does still happen. This is just how the world appears.

As a, like, more meta-level piece of advice, though: don't spend time arguing with creationists or evolutionists if at all possible. Why? Most people don't have these discussions in order to learn new things. They're doing this to try to win, and it becomes abrasive. People on both sides may also find this sort of discussion upsetting. Usually a good way to go about it, if possible, is to say something like "I respect your beliefs, even if we don't agree on everything" and your friends should (probably) extend you the same courtesy. If you have religious family and you are not religious, don't share this fact with them until you are financially independent.
