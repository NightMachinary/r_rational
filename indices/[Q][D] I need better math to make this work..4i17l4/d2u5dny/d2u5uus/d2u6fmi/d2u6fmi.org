I think it works better with larger numbers, but you'll need a way to contextualize them, since few people have an intuitive grasp on very large numbers.

What you'd instead want is something like ... let's say that you roll a die for every atom in the observable universe (10^{80} or so) every second for three million years (10^{14} or so universe-rolls). That gives you the odds of getting your twelve sixes ten times in a row an average of once. And also gives the reader a better handle on the immensity of the odds.
