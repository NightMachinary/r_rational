Hello Admin, quick question.

You said we would never again experience suffering than would make you a worse person/break you and that our body would go on autopilot til it is over. How does that work with emotional/mental trauma/suffering? Like the death of a loved one/depression/break up/ect.

Since the problem that causes the suffering isn't a physical affliction will we go on autopilot forever to stop us from realizing it? How does this work?

Sincerely, A Concerned User
