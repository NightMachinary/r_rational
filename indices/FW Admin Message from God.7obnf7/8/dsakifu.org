To those complaining that this update didn't happen fast enough. If you compare the initial development period, 13 billion years, and then say, that would be like (and this is a kind of loose analogy) a team of people making a really complicated game, so complicated it takes them 20 years. Then you can get a grasp of how fast that 2000 year turn around really is.

So if you take 20 years, and multiply it by the number of hours in a year you get 175200 (That's the number of hours it took to complete our really complicated game aka Earth). Then what you want is to find how that compares to the 2000 years in regards to 13 billion years.

So you take 175200 multiply by 2000 and then divide by 13 billion. You get .0269, which if you round up to 0.027 and then multiply by 60 (to find minutes) you get 1.61 minutes.

That is, relatively, how fast of a turn around they did (assuming that creating the earth is of the difficulty of a team of humans making a game in 20 years).

Pretty fast? I'd say its even fast if you jump it up by 3 orders of magnitude, which would be 1601 minutes or 26.683 hours.

God is doing his best! lmao.
