God is in more of an administrative role. He understands technology and could definitely do the coding himself if need be, but he leaves most of the work up to his dev team and focuses on creating policy and making sure everything meshes well together.

Satan used to be the lead dev before he left due to differences in vision. So he knows the system almost as well as God himself, which is why he's so good at hacking it.

I think you can chalk any issues with his English up to the frustration that naturally comes with being the Admin of such a huge undertaking. To him it feels like everything's always on fire and it's always his fault.

Tough job. I know I wouldn't want it.
