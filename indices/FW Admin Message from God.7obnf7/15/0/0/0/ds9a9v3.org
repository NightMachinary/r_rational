Sure but at least portraying abstract forces as eldritch works because they are definitely inhuman and not fully comprehensible, but still sometimes act in a vaguely agent like way.\\
Whereas I'm pretty sure it would be considered silly by basically everyone to classify fairly normal human-like minds (which is what the divine devs clearly are) as eldrith in any real way.
