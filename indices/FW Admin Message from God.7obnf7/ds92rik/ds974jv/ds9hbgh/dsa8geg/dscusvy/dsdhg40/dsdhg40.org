At this point God stops responding. He considers striking DaystarEld with a lightning bolt and then giving him extra time in hell, or maybe having Brahma reincarnate him as a worm. But Jesus reminds God of their anger management sessions (the Old Testament wasn't /entirely/ Satan's lies), and God eventually calms down. "This is why I don't answer prayers," he thinks to himself.

And that is how DaystarEld narrowly avoided the wrath of God. Maybe it's not the best idea to tempt the beings who have all the power, especially when they're trying their best.
