'Sup Jesus. Heard you were more chill than your Dad, but again, Satan-lies makes it all kinda suspect, doesn't it?

Anyway:

  But none of this is any excuse for being disrespectful toward your Lord. After all, if he had not used the QR kernel, you wouldn't exist in the first place. You should be thanking him with every breath you draw.

You should A/B test this notion and see if it converts anti-theists better than /not/ including a directive to blindly respect a being for creating the universe that created the species that ultimately culminated in my parents, who directly birthed and nurtured and raised me... but don't demand that I thank even them with "every breath I draw."

My prediction is it won't. Your Father "gave" us reason and a threshold for respect of what's earned: I'm using it to judge Him as not doing good enough. If you don't like it, maybe let everyone play admin in their own pocket universes to see how hard it really is to do better than was done with this one.
