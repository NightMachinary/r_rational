We have a machine that performs non-conscious simulations of you to determine whether you will eventually grow past the suffering. If it says you will, you will be allowed to endure the suffering. Otherwise, it is conceivable that you will spend the rest of your life on autopilot, yes. However, we anticipate that most people are capable of growing past their emotional trauma, especially given the certainty of the existence of an afterlife. We will continue to make improvements to this system in future updates.

Love,

God
