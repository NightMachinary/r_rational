  I don't think the public key can be just any arbitrary large number. In the case of RSA, it must be the product of exactly two large primes.

It's true that the modulus /n/ must be the product of two large primes, call them /p/ and /q/. But the public key is not these primes nor is it /n/ - it's the combination of /n/ and an exponent /e/. /e/ is related to /p/ and /q/ through some complicated requirements (1). This exponent is usually prime (though it doesn't precisely have to be prime) and could be as simple as the number '3', or typically the convenient prime number 2^{16} + 1 = 65,537 is used...but you have a lot of flexibility in choosing this.

Also note that we're concatenating on the order of 100 numbers to form this public key. There are 100 factorial ways to perform this concatenation, which is an absurdly huge number. At least one of these combinations has at least one spot where you can split the number in two and come up with a set of values /n/ and /e/ - though it's going to take a lot of work to try all possible /p/ and /q/.

(1): Specifically, /e/ can be ANY number between 1 and the totient of /n/ (the totient being approximately equal to the smaller of /p/ and /q/), with the added restriction that it must not share any common factors with the totient of /n/ (which is guaranteed if /e/ is prime)
