  Also, God could help prove his divinity by brute forcing the private key whose public key is the current physical constants.

I'm not an expert in cryptography, but I don't think the public key can be just any arbitrary large number. In the case of RSA, it must be the product of exactly two large primes. In any case, God is using a different protocol than RSA, since RSA is broken with quantum computers.

  but a 2048 bit RSA key is incalculable

I think quantum computers might be able to do this in a practical amount of time.
