  Dear God, I'm sorry to cut this prayer short, but I really need to get back to the exam now.

  /I know this as I know all things. Sinner. As I was saying, the 512 characters of my public key are 2. 9. 9. 7. 9. 2. 9. 8.../

Also, God could help prove his divinity by brute forcing the private key whose public key is the current physical constants. It's seriously impressive that Facebook was able to brute force the Tor domain key for facebookcorewwwi.onion, ([[[http://archives.seul.org/tor/talk/Oct-2014/msg00433.html][1]]], [[[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29772/how-do-you-get-a-specific-onion-address-for-your-hidden-service][2]]]) but a 2048 bit RSA key is incalculable for anyone not having infinite powers.
