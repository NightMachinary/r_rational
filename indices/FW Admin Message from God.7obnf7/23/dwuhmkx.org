This was a very good read, although the constellations point annoyed me because I thought I'd been soooo clever when I thought it up a while ago, and now I realise my super-brilliant truth-proofing system isn't unique anymore. I was thinking, 'why not stick the important bits, like the commandments, written in the stars, then make humans inherently capable of reading that particular language', although that brings about all sorts of questions about why God would allow for so many languages to exist and cause untold confusions and difficulties amongst humans when he could just undo the tower-of-Babylon event and have us all able to talk to each other, but I guess God thinks a divided humanity is more interesting.

Anyhow, if you're reading this Admin, what's your stance on souls- as in, who has them and who doesn't? Does my dog have a soul? Will my dog go to Heaven, or a Heaven for dogs? Will my dog have to go to Hell first, or does he get a free pass straight to Heaven?

If the answer is yes, then where do you draw the line on souls? Plants are technically living organisms, do they have souls? Or is there a strict devision, e.g. only vertebrates have souls- because this distinction would basically give humans permission to kill every spider they see, since non-vertebrates don't have souls, so their lives don't matter.

To go deeper, what about bacteria? Bacteria are alive, do they have souls? If bacteria do, do my own skin cells? Could I die, go to Heaven, and encounter my own brain cells? Do living beings get to pick out new bodies in the afterlife? If so, all it takes is for bacteria to want to be bigger and soon you'll have quadrillions (too lazy to look up a bigger number) of bacteria taking up all the damn space. If the answer to body modification is no, that guy who was born without legs still has no legs, you monster! Give him some legs!

Within my own thinking, my answer is yes, everything has a soul, with the line drawn at viruses (not alive), although the actual scientific jury is still out on viruses for now. I'd segregate everything into their own afterlives, which would make it ridiculously hard to reunite yourself with your pets, but I don't see an easier and still highly specific solution without 'hand-waving' the issue.
