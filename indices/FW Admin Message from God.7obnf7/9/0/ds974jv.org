Dear DaystarEld,

Look, this is exactly the sort of s*** I get all the time, OK? You don't know me. You don't know the development process we have to go through to keep this universe running.

For your information, the initial design was /Eden,/ which was perfect in every way and addressed all the problems you raised. Except for the fact that it was totally vulnerable to exploits. Eden was implemented on top of the Quantum-Relativistic kernel, and included what you might call "magic." The problem was that with magic, Satan could do /arbitrary/ damage if given the opportunity - the snake was just a small taste of how broken the system was. So we quickly rolled back Eden and were just left with the QR kernel in which you live now. /Could we/ have gone back and rewrote the kernel? I guess, but at that point we had already invested 13 billion years into the kernel, and we didn't want all that work to go to waste.

Satan can't do arbitrary damage now; interventions are much harder in the raw QR kernel. They scale with the amount of in-universe effort that would need to be exerted to achieve the same result. That's why updates take so long: the devs have to expend a ton of effort to prepare the changes. Further changes will be made in future updates.
