Dear DaystarEld,

Thank you for expressing your concerns. I forgive you for your insolence. I'm afraid you don't fully understand what sort of reality you're living in. God /is/ the supervisor. There is no higher power known to us. He is the uncreated creator. He is being itself. The universe is knit from his own body. I am a fold of his mind that he pinched off into a separate entity.

As a result of coming from nothing, God is entirely self-taught. He is constantly learning and growing all the time. Has he made mistakes in the past? Sure. But every mistake is a learning experience. I hope you can understand that. I, too, have made mistakes. Before coming to earth, I understood the human mind in principle. In my omniscience, I knew what pain was, technically speaking - I knew exactly which neurons were firing and why - but that is not the same as /experiencing/ the thing itself. After experiencing it firsthand, I informed God immediately, and then we began working on this latest update.

But none of this is any excuse for being disrespectful toward your Lord. After all, if he had not used the QR kernel, /you wouldn't exist in the first place./ You should be thanking him with every breath you draw.

Go forth, and do not sin again.

Jesus
