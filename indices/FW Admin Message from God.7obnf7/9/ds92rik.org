  That sounds like something an evil god would do, and my general policy is “don't do things that sound like what an evil god would do.” Got it?

Nope, don't got it. The initial design included unbearable/permanently-weakening suffering, which sounds like something that would be included by an evil god. You recognizing part of the mistake now doesn't change that your "general policy" isn't actually a good heuristic by which to judge you: it just means that you're as unclear about what an evil-vs-stupid god would do as many of us.

Also if you choose to communicate with us this poorly and rarely, you don't get to blame Satan for hacks.

Also also, don't blame us for bad epistemology when the Heaven interfaces you designed combined with your lack of communication spreads and exacerbates bad epistemology.

Thanks for the patches though. Maybe next do something about the whole romance thing.

Sincerely,

Somewhat Smug Anti-Theist

(In seriousness, good job on this overall! :) )
