  Now I realize that most people will not have the time or expertise to apply the cryptographic protocol on their own, which is why I'm adding a new module to everyone's brain that automatically implements the protocol. From now on, any saying uttered or miracle performed by me will be associated with a digital signature (fed to you via a sixth sense), and your brain will immediately be able to tell you if the signature is valid. If you're worried that you've acquired brain damage and that your verification module is broken, I've included in attachment 3 a suite of unit tests that can be performed to determine whether your module is working. I will personally strike down any deliberate attempts to modify the protocol in someone's brain.

Probably makes things worse for the paranoid.
