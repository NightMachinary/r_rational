Dear TheBigOneCat,

If you are a pre-existing entity older than the universe itself, you might be already be qualified. You can set up an interview by contacting Jesus.

Otherwise, you need to really wow us with your religion development skills. Start a religion that is eventually practiced by more than 10% of the world's population, and then we can talk about an interview.

Best,

God
