This happened in [[https://qntm.org/scrap][Scrap Brain Zone]]. My impression is that Wheel in general have an API for cross-layer communication, which is usually not in use because it would foul the accuracy of the simulation. Exa derives that they're in a simulation because that's the only way there could be unaccounted intruders in the Wheel meeting.

I think Exa became real by Laura wide-area copying her entire surrounding out of Akasha. She probably doesn't have enough control to limit the range precisely. It doesn't seem like an action he deliberately takes.
