Well, first you'd have to ask yourself why you'd want to do that, because I understand most people consider the Frodo and Sam bits to be the weakest part of the story.

That said, the basis for this trick in LotR is not necessarily the ring, but the fact that saurons forces are extremely centralised and depended on Sauron sticking around.

One way I could imagine that working without a load bearing boss is to have the commanders of the enemy army be spreading lies to their civilian government in order to keep the war going. Then all the actioney stuff can revolve around the good guys fighting a defensive war and limiting casualties to buy time for the main character to save the day with diplomacy.
