If you mean that the setting contains both high and low magic areas and you're worried the low magic areas will become slime-lands, than if the slimes require a certain amount of magic to not starve there'd be fewer in areas with less magic, and in areas with more magic things would be better able to deal with them.

If you mean that your setting as a whole has very few things that could threaten a slime due to limited availability of magic, than the slimes could be territorial, with a means of fighting and absorbing one another.
