I've been writing a story in a fairly archetypical fantasy setting. In one of the chapters I'm planning soon, I plan to introduce slimes as an apex predator. They would be nigh-immune to physical damage and fairly vulnerable to magic. My question, is what would prevent them from being too abundant in areas with large ecosystems that are low in magic based creatures?
