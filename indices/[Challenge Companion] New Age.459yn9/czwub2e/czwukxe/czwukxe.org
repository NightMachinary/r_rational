So far as I'm concerned, anything on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Age_topics][List of New Age topics]] page is probably fair game, and lucid dreaming is there (though there's a marked difference in how lucid dreaming is treated within a scientific context and a New Age context).

Aside from that, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.
