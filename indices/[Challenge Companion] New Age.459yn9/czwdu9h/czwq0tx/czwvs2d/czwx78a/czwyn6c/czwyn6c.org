Aristarchus of Samos jumps into the air, notes that he returns to earth, and proposes the hypothesis validated. If he's feeling saucy he throws a rock or fires an arrow straight upwards.

Positive results to negative hypotheses are the worst. It would be more than a thousand years before Newton figures out that straight up is the single most difficult direction.

Take today's announcement about gravity waves, or last year's evidence of a possible Higgs boson. Super boring and depressing! The former is another piece of evidence that general relativity is complete, the latter that the Standard Model is. Imagine somebody proves the Riemann hypothesis tomorrow by using conventional mathematics rather than by unraveling some secret pattern in the primes. Sure, she wins the Fields Medal and the Millennium Prize but what a profound disappointment for the rest of us.

Wouldn't it be more fun if we'd looked in exactly the right place and gravity waves and Higgs bosons weren't there? Better yet, /something/ was there that was provably /not/ a gravity wave or a Higgs boson. Suddenly imagination can go wild again... within the relatively strict and simple boundaries our current understanding of physics allows.

Scientific knowledge is /always/ a tin that we've mostly emptied. It's just a tin of infinite size.
