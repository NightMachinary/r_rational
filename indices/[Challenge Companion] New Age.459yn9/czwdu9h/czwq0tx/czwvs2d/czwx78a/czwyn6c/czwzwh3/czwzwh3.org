And see, your experiment is flawed. Not because we've gotten to the moon in real life. The fact that we've gotten to the moon in real life merely /highlights/ what's wrong with your experiment, which is that there are other imaginable means for reaching the moon, which are more likely to succeed than jumping, throwing a rock, or firing an arrow.

In order to truly prove that an ends is impossible /by any means/ - quite a different prospect from proving that the ends is impossible by a particular means - you must prove that the ends is in some sense a contradiction of terms. This is why it is impossible for an omnipotent being to create a rock it cannot lift - because, given the definition of omnipotence, "a rock it cannot lift" cannot /exist/.

To prove that the moon is not reachable - not the same thing as repeatedly failing to prove that the moon /is/ reachable! - you would need to demonstrate that the moon isn't a /thing in the reachable class/. For example, if approaching the moon caused it to apparently recede, so that the distance between yourself and the moon seems to remain a constant, this would suggest that the moon is not a conventional object at all, and would satisfyingly close the case of "can we reach the moon" for the "can't" side. This is similar to what general relativity says about the speed of light - though many concepts have been proposed to subvert this limit, generally with some clever bending of space.

A possibility requires some mechanism, and may be proven. An impossibility also requires some mechanism, and may also be proven - but only by proving the mechanism, and not merely by repeatedly trying and failing to do the thing claimed to be impossible.
