Like popular science fiction, New Age says "yes" where science says "no."

The scientific method is all about disproving and diminishing, limiting possibility space rather than merely expanding it. Whenever research or theory /does/ reveal a new understanding - electricity, magnetism, nutrition - 20th century New Age, like 19th century spiritualism before it, rushes to fill the gap with untested ideas.

Then, armed only with a misunderstanding of meaning of evidence and the value of a double blind, it provides all the testing most people need.

Science is a method for asking questions, but what most of us really want is answers. Positive, uplifting answers that tell us anything is possible. Not bummers like special relativity and thermodynamics.

For some of us that's intragalactic empires, omnipresent nanomachines, and jigsaw box genetic engineering. For others it's crop circles, remote viewing, and life energy.
