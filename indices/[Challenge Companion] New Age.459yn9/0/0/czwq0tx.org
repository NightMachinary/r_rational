There's a philosophical balance here that really throws me off. If we look back at history, we see a strong trend of people gaining capabilities previously thought impossible, through the advance of science. But we're expected to believe that now, the forces that say "arbitrary things we can't figure out how to do are impossible" are science and vice versa?
