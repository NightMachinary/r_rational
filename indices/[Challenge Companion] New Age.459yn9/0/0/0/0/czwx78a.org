See, given the exponential rise of technology over, say, the twentieth century, I'm not sure why we should model knowledge as a tin that we've mostly already emptied and now we're scraping the bottom. Instead knowledge seems more like a hyperbolic web, where every answer we find suggests several more answerable questions. Sometimes we may find a dead end or loop back to someplace we've already explored, but that does not at all suggest that we've hit the final wall.

"We can [x]" seems a lot easier to prove than "we can't [x]" to me. "We can't [x] by [y]", sure. But "we can't [x], period"? The burden of proof is on a claim that "we can't [x]", too. Let's say that we're in ancient Greece and you believe that man can't get to the moon. What experiment do you propose to test that hypothesis?
