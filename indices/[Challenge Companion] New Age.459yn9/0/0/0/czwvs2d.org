Some people believe that witches can simply fly, and vampires, along with nuns and prophets. Science offers a relatively blunt "no" to all of this.

That those same people can now, in limited situations, with the help of enormously expensive and complex engineering, strap themselves into an upholstered aluminum can and travel from San Francisco to Tokyo in mid-air is a relatively disappointing compromise.

A modern, technological society can fly. /You/ can't.

Imagination is limitless. Scientific testing carves it away, peeling off smaller and smaller groups of options and leaving fewer and fewer places we can look for answers. When we search in those remaining corners, we sometimes find unexpected epiphanies that do indeed allow what was previously proclaimed impossible. Air pressure, high energy fuels, and global infrastructure make casual human flight possible.

It's still a "yes, but..." rather than a "yes." Transcendental meditation promises that, with enough concentration, gravity will no longer tie you down. You, personally. No ticket or airport security required. There's just one problem: it's not true. Says who? Science.
