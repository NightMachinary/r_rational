  “Now's your chance to win her heart,” whispered Simole. “Challenge him to a duel.”

  Minister Carmine looked to be in excellent shape. A military man, Nic guessed. He was tall, his hair was pulled back from an aristocratic face, and his shoulders were broad. He had a sword at his side that didn't look like it was there for show. The scabbard was plenty scratched and scuffed, but it still looked well cared for --- glossy and polished.

  "Those books you read about romance and heroes and forbidden love,” Nic whispered back at Simole through the side of his mouth, “they aren't historically accurate.”

  “Men didn't use to duel over the love of a woman?” said Simole, sounding disappointed.

  "No, they did. I mean the part where the weaker man finds a way to win because his love is true. That part never happened. The smaller, weaker, more in love man always died.”
