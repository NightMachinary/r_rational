The author has stated a number of time that this is basically a first draft, and that significant editing will be in the future, as someone who has read it, I think the writing is passable for a royal road entry, and certainly not 1/10, maybe 6/10, as there aren't any glaringly bad grammatical errors (which aren't unheard of in RR).
