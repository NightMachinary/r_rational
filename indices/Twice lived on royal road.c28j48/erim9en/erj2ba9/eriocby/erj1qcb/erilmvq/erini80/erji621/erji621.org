Honestly, most of the stuff on royal road seems to be quite bad.

You already mentioned Mother of Learning, but that's a great example of a great story. In general the stories that rise to prominence in this community tend to be quite good, or at least enjoyable. Of newer stories I'm a fan of Marriage and Monsters.
