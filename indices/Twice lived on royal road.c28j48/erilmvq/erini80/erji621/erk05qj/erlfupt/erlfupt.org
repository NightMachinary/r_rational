Worth the Candle is kind of a subversion of the Harem/Male power fantasy trope, it pretends to be one on the surface, but a good portion of the MC's motivation is that he hates that he is a part of it, he finds the idea of a harem titillating in only the barest sense and hates even more that the 'God' of this world would create people as playthings for him. On an even deeper level is that all of the 'Fawning' females are deep and complex characters of their own, any lack of depth you perceive is likely due to the MC's own misconceptions and abysmally poor social skills. Yes it /is/ a Male power fantasy, but if read properly it is a critique of the Male power fantasy in a fantastic way.
