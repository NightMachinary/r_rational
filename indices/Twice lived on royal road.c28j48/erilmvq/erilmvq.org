Wow. This story is a horrible mess of typos and ungrammatical sentences. It's barely readable at all. This is exacerbated by a stilted style and painful dialogue. To cap it all off the protagonist is rather unsympathetic (his only emotional response to nuclear war is "glad I'm out in the wilderness").

1/10. Trash in every way a story can be trash. Do not recommend to anyone.
