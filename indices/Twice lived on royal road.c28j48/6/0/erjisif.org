To say Good Student and Wandering Inn fantastic is pushing it. Well, in term of writing skill, Good Student is good. Not fantastic, but good. You need to read more fiction on the platform so you can find a really good one. Try Scourged Earth, a solid middling (I rated it 2/5 due to grammar mistakes, even when story is solid 4/5). Then try Eagle's Flight, which is my personal favorite. I'd read everything that has perceived quality between these two, ratfic or not.

Now that got mentioned, how's the story fare against ratfic criteria? I enjoyed a small number of fictions that's the opposite of ratfic. Reading idiots acquiring unearned power-up is a guilty pleasure of mine. But I try to not read more of them, though. I might actually feel guilty if I do.
