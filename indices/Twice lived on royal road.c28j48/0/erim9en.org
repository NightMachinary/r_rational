(If anyone else is confused by the two comments on this thread being "really fantastic writing" and "horrible mess of typos", I had a look, and it's somewhere in the middle. The writing looks pretty meh to me, and there are occasional typos of the sort that I would characterise as "the author's English is fine but no-one has edited this")
