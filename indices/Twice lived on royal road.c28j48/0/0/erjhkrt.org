I think "occasional typos" is really too optimistic. Typos and other mistakes are near constant. Nearly every paragraph contains a few. Quite a few typos, but worse than that is the poor grammar. Lots of sentences where the order of words is weird, or where idiom is used incorrectly. The story is parsable, but in many places it takes effort. The actual act of reading becomes a chore and not something enjoyable.

The strong part of this story seems to be the worldbuilding. The premise is interesting. I didn't read for enough to see where it's going, but it is a strong start.

The characters aren't very interesting. The MC doesn't really have personality. His only emotion is anger and he does not seem to have any goals or desires. The father is even flatter. The mother has only two scenes in the chapters I read. In the first she is kind and caring, in the second cold and hateful. No explanation given.

Maybe my judgment of 1/10 was harsh, but this story really is quite bad.

Edit: First few sentences edited for clarity.
