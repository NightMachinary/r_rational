  First: Man Orochimaru and the Fox play off of each other so well, I'd read a bunch of chapters just on this negotiation. I can see the subtle lawyerings and implications from my knowledge of both characters seeping in to what and how they are speaking and it's hilarious watching them fence on multiple levels.

Thanks. I was having so much fun writing it, but didn't want to drag it on too long.

  Second: It's really nice of Kyuubi to be so concerned about the well-being of Team Anko. They are clearly the kind of people he has respect for and wants to see protected of his own free will, even without the deal with Naruto. We can tell because he says that he respects some people, and why would good ol' Kyuubi lie?

Exactly! I'm glad you saw that.

  After all, he's even taken it upon himself to judge and prevent people from gaining god-like powers that could warrant an existential risk to humanity! I'm sure he's doing it out of altruism or at least enlightened self interest, and not just to prevent anyone from matching his own level of near-god power.

Absolutely. He's nice that way.

  What a cool guy.

I know, right? I'm glad you recognize this; everyone else is so suspicious of him, and I've never understood why.
