I think a lot of readers on FF.net are used to very formulaic arc-based writing.

I'm sure you know that 90% of the fics on there, even the good ones, hit the Stations of The Canon pretty goddamn hard. The Mission To Wave, the Chuunin Exam and all its subplots, Pein, Timeskip, etc.

So likely, they are expecting something similar, a clear 'arc' system of A>B>C>D.

Instead they get RationalSociopath!Orochimaru and LawyerSpirit!Kyuubi. They likely were not expecting that.
