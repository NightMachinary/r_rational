Ooh.

The Fox claims that "Kaguya is dead now, so I can't fulfil my contract with her", but the Naruto setting abounds with [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning:_Impure_World_Reincarnation][ways]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Life_Reincarnation][to]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Outer_Path_%E2%80%94_Samsara_of_Heavenly_Life_Technique][resurrect]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release_Resurrection_Technique:_Corpse_Soil][the]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/One's_Own_Life_Reincarnation][dead]].

Some of these are hard to pull off (requiring the Rinnegan, which I doubt is as absolutely-bullshit as it was in canon) and some are obviously not going to bring the soul back, which is probably what is required; however, the Impure World Resurrection, if part of Kaguya's body could be found, would allow Orochimaru to release the Fox from that bargain - or, put another way, have the biggest bargaining chip at the table.
