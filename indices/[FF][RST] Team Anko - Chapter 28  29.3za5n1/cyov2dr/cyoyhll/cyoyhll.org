  The Republic seems like it was chakra-free long enough to get over the hump, and now can actually fight against the ninja in The Elemental Nations. They may be assholes, but if they come bearing democracy and industrialization, it may be better the world live under them than under a dictator, even a fairly friendly one like Sarutobi Hiruzen.

  Orochimaru is an evil guy, but he's clever and cool and seems to be trying to preserve this world's magic, which is cool. He also might be the only one really capable of standing up to the nine-tailed fox in conversation.

I think Sarutobi or Jiraiya could as well but yeah, not many people.

  Should the Republic win, will they be able to contain the Tailed Beasts?
