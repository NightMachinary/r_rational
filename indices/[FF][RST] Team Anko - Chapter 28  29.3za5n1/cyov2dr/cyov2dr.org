I'm really enjoying this fic, but since the revelation of The Republic across the sea I'd been having trouble getting invested in that particular conflict on the side of the Ninja. Narutoverse in general seems to be a kind of horrible dystopia filled with monsters in the shape of men who can effortlessly kill people and establish military dictatorships that will never be toppled by the common people. Your average person has few political freedoms, and even if the standard of living isn't literally the worst, it's significantly worse than that of developed nations. Even worse, it doesn't seem like there's any way for it to improve with Ninja running around as a permanent untouchable warrior class.

The Republic seems like it was chakra-free long enough to get over the hump, and now can actually fight against the ninja in The Elemental Nations. They may be assholes, but if they come bearing democracy and industrialization, it may be better the world live under them than under a dictator, even a fairly friendly one like Sarutobi Hiruzen.

That being said, I'm still rooting... for someone, here. Orochimaru is an evil guy, but he's clever and cool and seems to be trying to preserve this world's magic, which is cool. He also might be the only one really capable of standing up to the nine-tailed fox in conversation.

An interesting thought: Should the Republic win, will they be able to contain the Tailed Beasts? Or is this something that can only be done with Chakra? In this light, the idea of the Republic exterminating chakra-users becomes much more worrisome.
