I assume this is all above board, but it seems perfectly set up for the next chapter to open with "so what do you really want to talk about?"

I could just imagine oro and kurama pretending to jockey for position and then debate and negotiate for hours until team anko went to bed.

I guess there is no point, because naruto will still know what happened. He hasn't seemed very good at preventing manipulation so far, so it could still work though.
