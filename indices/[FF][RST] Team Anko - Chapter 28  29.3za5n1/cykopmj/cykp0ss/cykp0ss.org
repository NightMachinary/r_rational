In particular, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7103346/1/Cleaning-no-Jutsu][Cleaning no Jutsu]], a story about a civilian cleaning woman in Konoha. Short and really fun.

In general, check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/favorites/story.php?sort=update&categoryid=1402&userid=0][my favorites list]]. Some of them are guilty pleasures (i.e., stories where the writing is mechanically poor or the hero is a bit Mary Sue), but I still like them.
