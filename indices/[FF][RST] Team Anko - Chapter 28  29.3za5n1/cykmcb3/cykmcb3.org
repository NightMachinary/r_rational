Maybe it's my naivete, or my lack of canon Naruto knowledge, but I find myself actually rooting for Kurama and Orochimaru. Because I don't think that two beings capable of rational thought who live on the world would want to see said world destroyed, so their stated goals make sense to me. I know that something bad is going to happen, and it's definitely going to involve these two, I just don't think it has to necessarily be bad for all of humanity.
