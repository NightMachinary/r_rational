You people. All of you. So suspicious of poor Orochimaru. Just because the man is a psychopath, you feel he's untrustworthy. I mean, sure, there's a little vivisection going on and, well, I suppose he does kill his own people if they even slightly question him at the wrong time, but that's not so bad, right? I mean, it's not like he burned down an orphanage or cancelled Firefly!
