Ah, but he's just "demon" because that's what they decided to name him. They could call him "god" or "angel" or "chakra beast" or whatever, but they of course went for the most evil name.

He's just a living furball of chakra. He has feelings too. Don't go calling people demons, they might believe you and act accordingly.
