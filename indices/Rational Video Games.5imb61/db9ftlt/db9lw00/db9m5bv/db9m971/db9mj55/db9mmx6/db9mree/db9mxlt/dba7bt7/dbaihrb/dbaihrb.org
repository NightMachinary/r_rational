  I mean, the game seems to track the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream

It seems to, but only if you don't actually know what's going on, which I do, being one of the most experienced active Dwarf Fortress modders around (and I say that with confidence).

  makes it have an effect on the creature, which varies based on the creature's volume (a proxy for its blood volume)
#+end_quote

Blood volume is actually an integer exactly equal to current body size divided by 10.

  If I happened to use the word "metabolism" as shorthand for "equations that determine cat drunkenness based on a bunch of complex factors including cat volume and how long it takes to metabolize--er, i mean, lose--alcohol from the body" I don't think I've committed an error the type of which makes the story invalid, see?

The main problem is that it's not actually alcohol--it's anything with the "inebriation" syndrome attached. Note that I very specifically avoided mentioning alcohol in particular--the only thing that matters is "inebriation". If you use metanbolism to describe inebriation, you might have to use it to describe /werewolf transformations/, which run on the exact same system.

I'm aware of the relativity of wrong, but the problem with this particular wrongness is that it invites the imagination in unpredictable ways--it might make the user think that a dwarf who has a mangled liver might have more difficulty losing inebriation, which is simply not the case.
