I mean, the game seems to track the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, makes it have an effect on the creature, which varies based on the creature's volume (a proxy for its blood volume), and also based on a multiplier that is different for dwarves, and (I assume) causes alcohol to be removed from the bloodstream over time until your creature is sober (a sorry state of affairs of a dwarf). It might not literally be a metabolism but it looks and acts like metabolism, and is like, based on simplified versions of things you'd expect metabolism to act like. I'd also note that to come into compliance with your requests I changed like 5 or 6 words, so again the idea that this is a made up story seems, if not completely incorrect, at least a little misleading.

After all, the facts (cat steps on ground, gets beer on foot, licks foot to clean it, and this causes the cat to consume beer, and there are in fact already mechanics in case to deal with cat drunkenness because the game is simulationist, and due to a bug in beer volume consumption, the cat becomes very drunk, because cats are small and minimum beer consumption is large) are in fact all true. This is like, a true story that also conveys the underlying idea: DF is a game with a lot of detail that causes interesting emergent behavior. Unlike the catsplosions or other things, this is a real phenomenon covering real things. If I happened to use the word "metabolism" as shorthand for "equations that determine cat drunkenness based on a bunch of complex factors including cat volume and how long it takes to metabolize--er, i mean, lose--alcohol from the body" I don't think I've committed an error the type of which makes the story invalid, see?

That isn't to say it's not more correct now that it has all this detail, but... hmm. I'm reminded of [[http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm][Asimov's story about the Earth's roundness]]. As the story goes, Asimov responded to basically every letter sent to him, and in this response he noted that there are tiers of wrongness:

  My answer to him was, "John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."

  The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that "right" and "wrong" are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.

  However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.

In any case I guess like, broadly describing the cat as having a metabolism and a blood volume when instead it has drunkenness and alcohol-removal equations and a body volume is wrong, but only in the sense that saying the Earth is spherical is wrong. The overall shape of the story remains true, even if little fiddly bits needed work. This isn't some example of stuff being made up about DF; cats lick themselves, and this did make them drink and get drunk and they do have drunkenness mechanics, there are Taverns, this was a bug, etc.
