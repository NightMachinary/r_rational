Showdown is fantastic. I was actually on it as we were reading it. I really like the way that you're characterizing predictions, although I feel like you're only bringing in the tactical part of competitive play. You also have to create the team of pokemon you're going to use to fight people with, which involves guessing what people are going to use and having an answer to it before you even encounter them. It's pretty indepth and a really fun game.
