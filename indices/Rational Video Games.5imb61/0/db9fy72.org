Perhaps not exactly rational fiction tropes, but I get a lot of kicks out of playing [[http://pokemonshowdown.com/][Pokemon Showdown]] .

It's an online battle simulator against real people.

Pokemon's "rock-paper-scissors" style typing matchup teaches you quickly what it means to try and play "one level higher" than your opponent.

At level zero, you can try and hit your super effective moves so you can knock out your opponent's pokemon easier. This is pretty obvious, yes.

At level one, you start anticipating these attacks from your opponent and switch into something that resists whatever they were going to throw at your original pokemon. Your opponent does the same, and your attacks don't do much damage.

At level two, you start trying to be clever, selecting moves that are super effective against what you /anticipate/ your opponent will switch in. Except, if you overestimate the skill of your opponent, you lose momentum.

At level three, you forget about the clever level two prediction jukes and just select the super effective move towards your opponent's current pokemon. This is good because you signal a willingness to carry through with threats, so your opponent is less likely to try and pull weird double switch shenanigans. And then maybe you can try to pull a juke later on.

I've never gotten to level four.

But the addition of the chat bar can also be interesting. You can look up stats of pokemon through the chat which, for some reason, shows up on both people's screens, making it common knowledge if you just tried to figure out what type their pokemon is weak to.

On one occasion, I pretended I just learned about this feature. Then used it, which made it common knowledge and pretty likely that I was going to act on the info. Then I used that to my advantage to fake out the other person and catch their switch-in.

So, yes, in a nutshell, I think pokemon teaches good object-level game theoretic reasoning, even if it doesn't have good in-universe logic.
