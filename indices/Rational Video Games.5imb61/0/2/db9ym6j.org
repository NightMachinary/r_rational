I'm rank 1500 in random doubles, a format which makes it essentially all this sort of rock-paper-scissors. In the end I've found there's a lot less luck and mindgames than people imagine - of course if you're constantly out-predicted you lose, but that's very unlikely if you aren't predictable, e.g. by being semi-random.

Most of the strategy is in picking those weights, mainly by taking into account the risk and reward for each play, the long-term strategy based on which of your Pokemon needs to survive, preparing for the next turn, and only then on modeling your opponent.
