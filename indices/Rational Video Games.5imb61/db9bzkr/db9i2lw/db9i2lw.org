For related reading, see the famous David Sirlin article (later expanded into a book) titled [[http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub][Play to Win]], which is about discarding notions of how a game "ought to be played" for reasons that generally have no rational justification.

  I once played a scrub who was actually quite good. That is, he knew the rules of the game well, he knew the character matchups well, and he knew what to do in most situations. But his web of mental rules kept him from truly playing to win. He cried cheap as I beat him with “no skill moves” while he performed many difficult dragon punches. He cried cheap when I threw him five times in a row asking, “Is that all you know how to do? Throw?” I gave him the best advice he could ever hear. I told him, “Play to win, not to do ‘difficult moves.'” This was a big moment in that scrub's life. He could either ignore his losses and continue living in his mental prison or analyze why he lost, shed his rules, and reach the next level of play.

For those who don't want to read the entire book, [[http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win][this summary article]] captures the book's main thesis and the points of many of its introductory chapters.
