Sirlin's absolutely way too aggressive about this, yeah.

The way I read the article, I don't interpret him as saying "oh, if the optimal strategy is to block fifty times in a row, that's fine". I interpret him as saying "if your strategy can be countered by me blocking fifty times in a row, you should learn to deal with that, rather than house-ruling that you can block at most forty-nine times consecutively".

The objection to

  trying to house-rule such that better play involves executing complicated combos over spamming single game-winning, max-DPS, hard-to-counter moves
#+end_quote

is that it cheapens the metagame aspect of the fighting game - trying to devise strategies that work, and learning to execute them - if you're rejecting the answer to "what's the best strategy now?" when it's not something you like.

Take chess as an example. It's beautiful when one player sacrifices his queen for a checkmate in ten moves, but it's beautiful /because it follows from the rules of the game/. If we added a house-rule to chess of the form "if one player tries to sacrifices a queen, you can't refuse the sacrifice, even if accepting it means you lose", that is no longer beautiful: it's offensive.
