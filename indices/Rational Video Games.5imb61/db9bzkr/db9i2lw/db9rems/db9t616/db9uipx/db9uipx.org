But then is complexity actually what players are trying to maximize? It seems that would favor trying to house-rule such that better play involves executing complicated combos over spanning single game-winning, max-DPS, hard-to-counter moves, which the author rallies against. And in my experience, game-designers might be very clever and eat, breathe, and sleep mechanics, but will still end up quite far off perfect balance (outside simple toy-scenarios -- e.g. rock-paper-scissors). Hence the need for updates to re-balance (and to keep the game fresh, maximize player engagement with content, make more money, etc.). And even then, long-running games with plenty of balancing opportunities can [[https://i.imgur.com/tMfeyjY.png][end up]] pretty boring and [[https://i.imgur.com/AS8vFrH.png][uniform]] at [[http://i.imgur.com/ZqjqbxH.png][the top]] when there are only a handful of viable strategies.

I agree that being good at a game and winning does matter, and that many non-professional gamers feel this way, and that that's a perfectly fine way to play. But in my interactions with gamers the desire to win is conditional on being challenged -- victory is sweeter when it's hard fought, and winning too easily is neither fun nor fulfilling (and so you're not actually "playing to win" at all, beyond superficially). Indeed, why would the author even mention that "the experts are having a great deal of this “fun” on a higher level than the scrub can even imagine" if it's not about fun, it's about winning?

I might also be a wee defensive since I'm firmly in the "casual-moderate gamer" camp (I play maybe ~3hr a week, on average) and go more for graphics, physics, story, etc. than rich or complicated gameplay (so long as it's fun). Games with 100+ hours of learning curve hold little appeal -- sure, I can put in the effort to "master" them (or not), but what little resources I have are, given my values, better allocated elsewhere (and if people would prefer devoting their attentions to games, and no pockets are picked nor legs broken, then more power to them). So the somewhat aggressive tone of the article inspired me to be somewhat aggressive in return. I guess my uncharitable initial impression was that the the author was making fun of people who win at the game but [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys][lose at "life"]].
