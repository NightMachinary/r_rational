  Second, obviously some games end up requiring house rules to function. I suspect that Sirlin would say that (a) those games are bad and just shouldn't be played, and (b) if a game has been played for a long time, and you think it's unbalanced to the point of being broken, then you're probably wrong.

I read his book (/Playing to Win/). This was several years ago, so this probably isn't entirely accurate, but: supposedly one of the Street Fighter games had some truly game-breaking characters, in the sense that there were strategies a good player could use to win 100% of the time against excellent players with other characters. These characters were banned in competitive play, and Sirlin endorsed this. He also gave some rules for when bans like that should be imposed, which I don't particularly remember.

(Apparently the way the ban was enforced differed between America and Japan. In America, it was an official rule. In Japan, it was unwritten: the good players just didn't pick those characters, and would politely defeat the players who did.)
