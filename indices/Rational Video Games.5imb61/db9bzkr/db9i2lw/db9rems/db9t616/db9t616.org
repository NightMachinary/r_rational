I'm uninclined to defend the article 100%, but there are two good points to be found there.

First, you point out cases (like a game-breaking bug that instantly wins) where the "cheap move" reduces complexity. But equally often, banning a perceived "cheap move" increases complexity. I'm thinking of cases like "no rush 20" rules in RTS games.

Second, obviously some games end up requiring house rules to function. I suspect that Sirlin would say that (a) those games are bad and just shouldn't be played, and (b) if a game has been played for a long time, and you think it's unbalanced to the point of being broken, then you're probably wrong.

(Also, I think that this article only makes sense if you already have the point of view that /how good you are at a game matters/. If you disagree, then you disagree, and that's that. But being good at a game does matter, and winning does matter, to more people than just professional gamers.)
