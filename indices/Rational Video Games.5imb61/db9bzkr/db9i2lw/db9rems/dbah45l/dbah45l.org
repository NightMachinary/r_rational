The author addresses the topic of changing the rules to support a better play experience in one of the following chapters, [[http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/what-should-be-banned][What Should Be Banned]].

  Bribing your opponent to not play (or disconnecting their controller, etc.) also increases your chances of winning, but where's the fun in that?

This point is also addressed in one of the chapters immediately following, titled [[http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/how-far-should-you-go-to-win][How Far Should You Go to Win?]]. Things like messing with the hardware setup (unplugging your opponent's controller, or engaging in collusion, bribes, or match-fixing) are disallowed in competitive environments, as they clearly lie outside the bounds of the game and are not fair play by any reasonable definition.

In fact, competitive environments are often the places that go to the greatest lengths to oust this kind of behavior. If you're in a recreational environment and say to your friend, "Hey, I'll give you $5 if you let me win here," it's unlikely that anyone will complain, whereas if you make a similar offer in the context of a sanctioned Magic: The Gathering tournament, it's grounds for immediate disqualification.

  Would [[https://i.imgur.com/ySl1dFj.png][this]] be the author's favorite game? How does the author know who's having more fun? I have a lot more fun in games when executing something tricky or pretty than when I find a quick exploit that ascends me to godhood -- if I do the latter I'll usually get bored really quickly and either re-handicap myself or stop playing altogether.

Perhaps this excerpt will answer your question:

#+begin_quote
  Some games don't hold up to high-level play. That's sloppy design in my opinion. A solid game holds up to experts playing it as hard as they can against each other. That way, the game can be fun for beginners and experts.

  When a game doesn't hold up to expert play, it's degenerate in some way. There's only one good move or one good character, or one good strategy, or something like that. The game offers what appears to be a lot of fun options, but you don't actually get to do those fun options against experts, even if you are an expert too. So for this type of game, playing to win really will make it less fun, but that's not a problem with the players who are doing their best; it's a problem with the game.

If the game you're playing contains, as you say, "a quick exploit that ascents [you] to godhood," then that points to severe flaws with the game's design. Any game that can be reduced to a single button that says "I win" severely requires modification (possibly through bans) to provide an interactive experience (see the chapter about "What Should Be Banned").
