Any purely competitive game is, in a deep sense, rational -- particularly if there is no way to interact other than competition. Rocket League, for instance, is essentially RC Cars with rockets playing soccer. Nothing happens solely because the game requires it. The conflict is motivated directly, there aren't 'good' and 'bad'. Players solve their problems and achieve their goals through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources (for something like Rocket League, practice and training play a big role in noticing what resources you have in a given moment, but same with real life, so that seems fine). And the rules are sane and consistent (it's soccer).

Rational/ist/ games are more rare, but if the game is both purely competitive and deterministic, you should be able to use the same techniques as good players to be just as good, and being good at the game means it is possible, in principle, to determine the best next step using the information you get leading up to that event. That's just because it occurs in real life linear time it's super easy to capture what they knew at the time, because it's on the screen.

[EDIT: games like Rocket League also teach the important real life lesson that, while something may be simple /in theory/ it can take tons of practice to get good. Also, practice can be fun. But boy howdy do I not see a lot of staying power in modern culture. If you can jam on practice, you'll crush at almost anything. Important rationalist lesson in there.]
