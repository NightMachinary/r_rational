One of my favourite videogames is currently on sale for -85% off - [[https://www.gamersgate.com/DD-DOM4TA-STEAM/]]

Dominions 4 is the Turn Based Strategy equivalent of Dwarf Fortress, in that it's a game where the focus is clearly on depth and detailed simulationism, over things like 'graphics' and 'user interface'. It has a vast and intimidating level of complexity. Basically, the game is a free-for-all war in a magical world where you are a god who wants to conquer everyone and get everyone to believe in you. The game is ludicrously detailed in combat and war, but heavily abstracted in e.g. economics and building things. Featuring a couple thousand different units, over ~70 factions, hundreds of spells and magic items... there's a lot to learn and explore. The factions are based on mythologies and on popular fiction - including Norse myth, the Cthulhu mythos, and Aztec myths. I am currently playing in various games as giants based on Jewish mythology, lizard-people based on Egyptian myth, elves based on Celtic stuff, demonic ogres based on parts of Hindu legend, and blood-sacrficing Phoenicians. A lot of the most classic fantasy tropes are present, from conjuring elementals to blowing things up with fireballs, to epic things like putting out the sun or summoning up dead gods from the pits of Tartarus.

The game's only real problem other than the interface/UI stuff is that the AI doesn't play at a high level. Luckily, the multiplayer community is thriving pretty well. Most people play by e-mail, in longer-term games that take months of real time at rates of one turn a day more or less, but some people play 'blitz' games over the course of several contiguous hours. I am in half a dozen such games at the moment, and they are all interesting/enjoyable.
