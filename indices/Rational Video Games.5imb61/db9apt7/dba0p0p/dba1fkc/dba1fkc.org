I make a weekly post in the off-topic thread here on [[/r/rational]], tho that only touches on the big stuff and never has enough space to actually go into detail on what we designed that week. These design discussions are [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][on the #pokengineering channel of the Discord server]], with logs going back more than two months. At some point (probably soon, now that I think about it) we'll need to set up a subreddit. I'll continue to make weekly posts regardless, to ensure people aren't stuck out of the loop.
