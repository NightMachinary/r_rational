Regarding Soulsborne, this is only really true for Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne.

Dark Souls 2 is infamous for enemies with infinite stamina + auto-tracking in the middle of attacks. In Dark Souls 3, enemies have standard poise, while the player does not.

They are all good games, but only DS1 and BB are even playing fields.
