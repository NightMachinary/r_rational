  the basic concept of the story is true

Oh, yes. Very popular bug.

#+begin_quote
  the bug itself and overall reasons why are like clearly not made up, right
#+end_quote

The bug itself (that being an issue of minimum drink size) and overall reasons why aren't made up, no; in fact, come to think of it, I wouldn't say that anything there is so much /made up/ as extrapolated in ways that dangerously approach falsehood. I don't really like when that happens, it causes weirder things like obviously fake stories or screenshots getting upvoted to the top of [[/r/dwarffortress]], which always bothers me.
