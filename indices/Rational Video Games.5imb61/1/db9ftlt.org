Mentioned in [[/u/ketura]]'s essay, but bears a specific shout-out: my all-time favorite game in category, [[http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/][Dwarf Fortress]]. Dwarf Fortress is a highly simulationist super fine-grained game where you manage a bunch of dwarves who set out to found a fortress. Before you even begin to play, the game does stuff like creates the world (mountains, tectonic plates, etc, then rainfall/wind shadow / erosion patterns, then growth of plants and animals, biomes, then hundreds or thousands of years of history as gods, dragons, mortals, empires, etc rise and fall, leading to a rich and dense world--all made deterministically). What civilization your group is a part of, who comes to visit you, what monsters exist, etc is all deterministic from the random seed and procedurally generated. But also like, the low level stuff is super important too.

Here, let me explain a bug that recently developed that will illustrate just how fine-grained the physics engine of this game is. There was a new patch, and suddenly any housecats in the fortress started barfing all over the place, constant vomit. What's going on? Well, it's a long story. See, this new patch introduced Taverns as a concept. A place for Dwarves to socialize, feel good, and drink. And part of Taverns code is that in any Tavern where drinking is happening, some booze ends up on the ground. Now, enter the Cat. Cats get dirty over time, as pretty much anything does. For example, a cat that steps in a puddle of blood has blood on it and leaves blood footprints. Or if it steps in booze, it has booze on it and leaves booze footprints. However, they do not bathe or go in water. Instead, they lick themselves to clean themselves. So, for example, a cat might lick its paw to clean it. But, you see, when you lick something, you consume a tiny bit of whatever is on it.

You may be guessing what was going on now. A cat walks into a Tavern, and steps in a puddle of booze. Later, somewhere else, it licks its paw, consuming some beer. But, it turns out, the game doesn't have code for consuming amounts of beer less than one pint or something similar. It assumes (pretty reasonably up to that point) that all beer is consumed in pints. So, the cat drinks a pint of beer. As it turns out, the game code doesn't crash here, because cats, like dwarves, have fully fleshed out drunkenness mechanics, and their drunkenness can be calculated. As it turns out, Cats have like, a pint of body volume anyways, so after licking its paw the Cat's body is now effectively 50% beer (in rough terms) making it possibly more drunk than any creature had ever been before.

So it vomits.

A fun bug to track down! And a good example of just how simulationist this game is.
