One thing that I find interesting in competitive games is how often dominant strategies will be discovered only after they have been theoretically possible (due to balance patches, etc.) for a while.

I'm most familiar with DotA, and it happens all the time there. Some hero will get a minor buff which scarcely affects their actual performance, but this buff prompts people to investigate ways of playing the hero and eventually hit upon an "overpowered" build.

As an example, there's a hero called Tinker whose ultimate ability, Rearm, lets him reset the cooldown on his spells and items at the cost of a lot of mana and a short duration spent standing still while casting. There's an item in the game called Boots of Travel (BoTs), which allows you to teleport to allied non-hero units after.

It took a surprisingly long time for people to realise that you could use the cooldown reset to get ridiculous map mobility with the BoTs, plus free trips to the base area (which heals health and mana quickly). Suddenly there were Tinkers in every game, constantly able to fight and output a huge amount of damage before returning to safety. It led to a succession of nerfs to the hero and the items the build used.

This goes to show that a sufficiently complex system that has been insufficiently analysed (either due to low populations or recent changes) can have powerful yet unutilised strategies, which is obviously relevant for rational fiction (and potentially real life rationality, if you get in on the ground floor of a new technology).
