I'm not familiar with this website or author, but... are they being sarcastic here? What's wrong with making up house-rules to optimize for fun or beauty or whatever? Who cares about "winning" in a recreational framework (if you game professionally -- i.e. for money -- it's another question). It's... it's just a game, right? There's no "right" way to play, and "winning" is "meaningless" (hence why activating godmode and setting damage output to ∞ is not as popular). Do non-professional players actually play to win independently of having fun (ignoring the case of "addiction", e.g. grinding endlessly in MMOs at the expense of most everything else).

I can get challenging yourself and thereby finding enjoyment, clawing your way to victory against the odds, etc. but that seems to run counter to "playing to win", since you'll necessarily have to avoid game-breaking exploits. Maybe this article assumes games are perfectly balanced? (but even if they are, if the counter to the "cheap" tactic is not fun, it still seems totally legitimate to occasionally house-rule against boring-ness, else you end up [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-items-fox-only-final-destination][here]]).

It's hard to read lines like

  Who knows what objective the scrub has, but we know his objective is not truly to win. Yours is. Your objective is good and right and true, and let no one tell you otherwise. You have the power to dispatch those who would tell you otherwise, anyway. Simply beat them.

or

#+begin_quote
  If you block for fifty seconds doing no moves, that's cheap.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  The first step in becoming a top player is the realization that playing to win means doing whatever most increases your chances of winning.

  But any close examination will reveal that the experts are having a great deal of this “fun” on a higher level than the scrub can even imagine.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  You can gain some standing in a gaming community by playing in an innovative way, but that should not be the ultimate goal. Innovation is merely one of many tools that may or may not help you reach victory. The goal is to play as excellently as possible. The goal is to win.
#+end_quote

seriously. Because, like, WGAF? Blocking for 50-seconds might help you win, but you're not actually "playing" the game. Bribing your opponent to not play (or disconnecting their controller, etc.) also increases your chances of winning, but where's the /fun/ in that? Would [[https://i.imgur.com/ySl1dFj.png][this]] be the author's favorite game? How does the author know who's having more fun? I have a lot more fun in games when executing something tricky or pretty than when I find a quick exploit that ascends me to godhood -- if I do the latter I'll usually get bored really quickly and either re-handicap myself or stop playing altogether. Is the author just making fun of those who get a false sense of fulfillment or power by "beating their opponents"? It's really hard to tell.

Someone mentioned the Pokémon competitive metagame elsewhere in this thread. There are often lengthy banlists there for a reason.
