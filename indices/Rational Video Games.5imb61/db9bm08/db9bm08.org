Pasting a comment of mine from another thread about an old educational game I played as a kid, as food for thought:

  I'd give you a link and would recommend you to acquire it without skipping a beat, but as it happens it was first launched in 1996 (its first installment in 94), only available through CD-roms, and in Brazilian Portuguese; it doesn't even have a Wiki page. In a rough translation it was called Galactic Ranger 2: Prisoners of the Green Tribe and was about the galactic ranger, who cruised space alongside his robot (the comic relief). They fell in a planet inhabited by walking plant-like superstitious creatures, with primitive technology, and were made prisoners.

  In order to advance through the game the player had to solve scientific problems from the most diverse fields. Those involved concepts such as photosynthesis, greenhouse effect, combustion, air density, etc. The cool part is that those weren't done as if in a quiz popping up on the screen, those tasks were embedded naturally within the game. The robot provided tips when you got stuck but due to a "hardware failure" wasn't very useful. What I spent the most time checking, though, is a "galactic encyclopedia" which you could access from the main menu. In it you could learn about the big bang, galaxies, stars, supernovas, black holes, neutron stars, and so much more, not in a boring, text-like way, but by watching hilarious conversations between the ranger and his robot, accompanied by animations.
