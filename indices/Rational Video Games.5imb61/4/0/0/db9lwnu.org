I asked the same question (I'm currently learning Portuguese so looked like a good game to play for me). Here is his answer:

  O Patrulheiro das Gal치xias - Prisioneiros da Tribo Verde

  It was the 2nd game in the series and I just found out a 3rd one was launched as well. A member of the > development team listed those as:

  - O Patrulheiro das Gal치xias - Falta de Ar em Outro Sistema Solar. 1996.
  - O Patrulheiro das Gal치xias II - Prisioneiros da Tribo Verde. 1997.
  - O Patrulheiro das Gal치xias III - ABC do Sistema Solar. 1998.
