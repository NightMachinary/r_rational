There are three different methods of traveling long distance with various draw backs:

The /teleport/: is the one that Zorian already knows, teleport is great for short range movements (like in a fight or battle). But is stupid hard to do long distances and isnt actually a viable way to get around the world in less than a month.

A /gate/ has no extra cost due to distance, but the problem is that it requires a mage on either end ... and currently Zorian has no way of getting himself or a simulacrum or whatever to Koth.

The third method uses the connects two Pre prepared Standing Stones with a /portal/. This is the ideal method for Zorian because you don't need anyone already at your destination, and the mana costs are reasonable. The problem is that standing stones are typically under cities in their dungeon area, and the areas are typically controlled by spider clans, and you still can't open the portal until you figure out the right method/destination address.

Ideally Zorian would be able to negotiate for use of a portal. He would only have to figure out how to open that portal once, and then every other reset it would be only a matter of re introducing himself to the local spider clan.
