Teleportation can be long ranged, but is not unlimited ranged. Zorian sees Zach use it to quickly vacate his mansion and go to far away points of the country one restart using the tracking marker, which he considered to have a huge range.

The author uses many D&D inspired spells in his story (magic missile, gate, etc) and D&D's teleport is 100 miles a level. Great for crossing countries, not continents.

And Koth is another continent.
