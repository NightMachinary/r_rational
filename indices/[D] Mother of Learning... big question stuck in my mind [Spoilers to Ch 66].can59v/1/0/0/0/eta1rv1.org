If memory serves, main cost in a teleport is the divination requirement - thing that actually allows you to determine where you are teleporting. That's the part that scales with distance pretty sharply, as divinations apparently don't work well over great distance. Short-distance that part may presumably be discounted completely, and you'd be left with the constant (or perhaps also scaling, but slower) cost of all the dimensionalism teleportation stuff.

TL;DR I doubt cost will go to 0 in the limit of null teleport distance.
