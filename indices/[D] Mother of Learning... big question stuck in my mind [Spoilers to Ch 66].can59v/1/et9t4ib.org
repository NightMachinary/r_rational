As [[/u/lordcirth][u/lordcirth]] says, there is a range limit to teleporting, because the mana cost increases with distance. You can keep that mana cost down by putting up spells that do a lot of the work of teleporting for you, like the one in Cyoria which makes it much easier to teleport in. The gate spell is different in that it has the same cost no matter the distance, it's just rare and difficult to perform over long distances because you need two mages to do the spell simultaneously for it to work.
