Even if you're exceptionally strong, you'll need leverage to use that strength, and as the hammer is half your mass you won't be able to provide that much of a counterweight.

The first image that comes to mind is a caber toss: if the ready position for your hammer is vertical, you'll have gravity on your side and can focus on using your strength to guide its descent onto the monsters. A lunge would require more a shot put motion to push the base of the handle up as it falls. Of course, this will be predictable and leave you vulnerable after dropping the hammer, but you may be able to use your comparative intelligence to control the engagement.

With two hammers, each twice your weight, I'd imagine this approach is used instead of a heavier single hammer for two reasons: crushing monsters between the two hammers rather than knocking them away with one, and having two counterweights to use to change your position. In this case I'd expect a shift towards having both hammers swinging horizontally instead, although maybe you could use the single hammer technique on alternating sides if you can lift the hammers back into position quickly enough?

I'd also suggest having a look for games or series that depict similarly absurd weapons, but at the moment the only one that comes to mind is Guts from Berserk and I haven't found a good clip.

It might also be worth thinking about why hammers are the best weapon to use against the monsters. Maybe they have carapaces that act like plate armour, so slashing and piercing attacks are less effective if you can't aim for the weak points?
