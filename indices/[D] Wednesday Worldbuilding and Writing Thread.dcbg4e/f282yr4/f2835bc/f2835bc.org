So here is the outline for a game to give an idea for what I am going for.

Game : Sticker Madness

Players: 1.4 million

Equipment: Sheets of stickers with your name on them

The Game Board: The city limits of Washington DC

Time Limit: Starts at noon and game lasts until there are 100 winners

Rules:

You are not allowed to tell anyone you are a player until after it is over.

-people discover that writing things down or being obvious does not count

No violent actions or language is allowed.

This is a game of walking only. Walking being defined as having at least one foot on the ground while moving.

If you place a sticker on another player they will be informed by the game master of that fact. If a player has two stickers put on them they are out.

If a player successfully catches you trying to put a sticker on them, you must add 10 stickers to your collection that you must use up. You will also not be allowed to try again on the same player for 12 hours.

Players that are out are not allowed to interfere with other players

Non-players are not allowed to help players.

-Anyone not playing that tries to interfere falls unconscious when they enter a player's range

-It is discovered that this has a few mile range so people can use telescopes/radios to help people a few miles out

players that enter a building or structure with a roof are automatically out

The first 100 Players to use up 100 of their stickers enter the next phase.
