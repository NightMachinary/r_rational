Incidentally, racewalking has official rules on what 'walking' means. The above is half of the official definition; the other half being that the front leg must remain unbent until the body has passed over it; both rules carrying the rider of "an infraction only counts if it is visible to the unaided human eye".

Also incidentally, a professional racewalker can probably walk faster than most people can run; so such an athlete would make a very strong competitor. At the very least, he'd be /super/ hard to catch...
