I'm imagining a 6'2" 140 kg bodybuilder, something like Arnold Schwarzenegger with 25% more body mass as pure muscle. With a 70 kg hammer, it's basically the equivalent of swinging an average-weight adult male around, except that all of the weight is on the end of a lever.

For the sake of being able to maneuver it and actually do damage with it, I hope the hammer is made of some extremely hard and dense metal, like an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmiridium][osmiridium]] alloy. That would likely be about twice as dense as lead, and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02417.pdf][close to the bulk modulus of diamond]], so very, very rigid on impact. With something between the density of irridium and osmium, you'd get the required 70 kg mass in a cylinder which is about 11.28 cm in diameter and 31 cm long (shape shown in [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cylinder+5.64+cm+radius%2C+31+cm+long][Wolfram Alpha]]), or about 4.4 inches in diameter and almost exactly a foot long.

I imagine Super Arnold could pick up the 70 kg hammer and lift it above his head without too much difficulty, as even regular Arnold was able to do a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_and_jerk][clean and jerk]] with 135 kg, and I imagine Super Arnold might be about 35% stronger. Ideally, Super Arnold would probably want to work with a long-handled hammer, likely similar to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_maul][spike maul]]. When lifting the hammer from below his waist, he could have his grip in close with his right hand just below the hammer head. Once he reaches eye level, he could orient the hammer vertically, with the hammer head going upward, and then use his left arm to slide the shaft up through his right hand until he reaches about 18 inches of spacing between his hands, with the right hand at eye level. With the hammer raised, he could do a slight tilt backward and then slam it forward with his arms and torso, or possibly lever it over his shoulder for a faster but less powerful swing.

Against very large monsters, I think the trick would be to try to get a one-shot kill, preferably with a solid blow between the eyes or a sideways impact with the temple. The hammer is likely heavy and rigid enough that a single, swift blow to the head of most creatures, probably even up to the size of elephants, would likely cause enough trauma to result in immediate death from the concussion, or at least loss of consciousness and severe brain damage.

Two hammers is silly. It would reduce your impact force to potentially less-than-lethal levels, reduce your accuracy with each blow, and force you to use a shorter grip which would significantly reduce your ability to reach the vulnerable points on very tall monsters. You'd be left with a Super Arnold pitifully bashing away at the legs of an elephant before it takes a step forward and tramples him.
