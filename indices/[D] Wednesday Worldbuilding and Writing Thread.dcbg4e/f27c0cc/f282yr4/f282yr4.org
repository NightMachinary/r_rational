Totally not sure if this is the right thread for this but I have read quite a few well written web serials recently and got inspired to write a few chapters/outlines for a some of my own. Don't know if I will ever fully write one, as while I have written quite a bit of fan fiction, I'm really not that great of a writer nor can I write fast enough for it to really be worthwhile. But I am practicing and it was surprisingly fun.

The story is inspired by Yu-gi-oh, Metalocalypse, and Penny Arcade's paint the line. Where death, intricate conspiracies, destruction, social upheaval, rebellions, and more occur around simple games. All while the games master tries to do everything he can to ensure the games finish with minimal death and destruction.

But I'm having some trouble with some game strategies and the interplay with the rules. As truthfully, I have an average intelligence and it's really hard to write a believably intelligent character. In the story there are numerous organizations, people, and governments that do everything they can to win. Some ideas for strategies/games, ways to circumvent the rules, and just general feedback would be appreciated.

Storyline Outline so far:

The story takes place in a world similar to our own except for the existence of a very small number of people born with powers that often have strange conditions that can causes its strength to vary wildly. In the past before guns and science, they were the premier players of the world. But in modern times they are seen as little more than occasional scientific curiosities. Most governments give very generous incentives for people to register their powers and beyond a powered person using their power for occasional pranks or the odd crime every few years, they are pretty much ignored. At least until the main character accidently becomes a Super Villain with his power causing worldwide chaos and disruption.

The main character is a man named Louis (goes by Lou) who is currently suffering from crippling depression and anxiety. He has recently lost his job when his company moved overseas, just lost his beloved niece to cancer, and has a major physical handicap due to an issue with his lungs. Everything changes for him when he discovers he has a superpower.

Super Power- Bilateral Contract

Louis can create a projection of himself and anything he is wearing within line of sight. This projection forcibly creates a telepathic link of the people that are directly around it. This link makes it impossible to lie or tell half-truths as people can see each other's thoughts and feelings. He can only keep the link active for about ten minutes before he gets a massive headache and he will eventually fall unconscious if he keeps pushing things.

Anyone in this link can come to an agreement or mental contract with each other, which forms a geas on the brains of the participants to give them incentive to follow the contract. It also allows Louis to mentally communicate with and look out the senses of anyone currently under the geas if they are within his line of sight. If a person believes they have broken the contract, everyone under the geas instantly knows about it and they have to suffer a random mental penalty. But to compensate, there is also a random mental benefit you gain as soon as you are put under a geas to encourage the participants to follow the contract. This geas cannot be put on someone who is unwilling to have it. It must be voluntary.

The punishments are temporary and can include things like blindness, increased sensitivity to pain, severe and uncontrollable muscle tremors, the inability to recognize faces, unusual delusions, and visual/auditory hallucinations. Rewards can include things like enhanced senses, being able to temporarily use bullet time, increased memory recall to the point of mental time travel, a cure for mental disorders, improved learning capabilities, etc. If a person actively hates and fights the geas it only lasts a few weeks but otherwise it can actually last for months and potentially even longer if the person under the geas desires the benefits from staying under it.

Despite how powerful his ability is and how easily it would make him wealthy, Louis chooses not to register himself as a powered person. He does not like or trust his government and considers them idiots beholden to the rich and immoral corporations. Instead he decides to use his power to try and make himself happy and get over his depression by pushing people into playing games with him. As Louis is a former game designer who used to design board games and he has always been a huge fan of media involving mental battles, unorthodox strategies, and heavily studies game theory.

He has some fun running a few games but his mental issues make it really hard for him to get out of bed and push himself. So he gets the idea to put a geas on himself. Unbeknownst to him, it greatly ups his power gaining the ability to have anyone who sees his projection come into his telepathic link and the rewards/consequences of the geas are greatly increased including brain damage/death. All of the winners of his games will now gain the ability to put a temporary geas on everyone around them in a very large radius and they can force everyone to follow one rule as long as they themselves follow the same rule. So if they tell someone no running the subject is literally unable to run as long as they do the same thing.

In the story, one of the winners goes to Washington and forces the rule of always telling the truth, before giving a tip to reporters. A presidential candidate and several senators openly admit to crimes and holding nasty views. The Winner goes online and comes clean about why they did it and surrenders. The media determines with testing that this geas works on a several mile radius and Louis becomes known internationally.

Shocked, Louis tries to fight the geas he has but fearing it could kill him or worse, decides to keep holding games. He sets up the next game location in a isolated location and hopes that the authorities will stop anyone from going to the game but is utterly shocked when over 40, 000 people show up early to camp out and play from all over the world.

Louis now realizes he has to hold at least a dozen more games within the year before the geas he has wears off. With what seems like the entire world watching and all kinds of shadowy groups, organizations, and people wanting to play, looking for loopholes, and doing whatever it takes to win.

Hilarity ensues.
