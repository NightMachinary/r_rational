Rational!Bruce Wayne would see a psychologist to deal with his PTSD after his parents' deaths, and then use his fortune to improve Gotham City and reduce crime rates indirectly, or at most by donating to the police department. (Also he might donate to gun control efforts.) He wouldn't dress up as a bat and punch muggers.

I can imagine him doing consulting work for the police as a detective, in a scenario like the reversal of The Dark Knight -- where instead of the Batman's presence making the villains escalate and leading to the Joker, the Joker comes first and Batman is a response to that.
