Rational!Joker is just the Dark Knight version.

He has a really strange utility function most people would consider absolutely insane, but he plans things meticulously, spends no time carrying the Idiot or Villain Balls, plays everyone like fiddles, and, in the end, WINS. (Batman kills Dent, thus breaking his rule, as he set out to accomplish.)
