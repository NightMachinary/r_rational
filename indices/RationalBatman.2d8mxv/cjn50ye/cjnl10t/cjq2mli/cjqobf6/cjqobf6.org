Not...really? Certainly not all in one continuity.

Batman doesn't train norms (and certainly not police) to fight crime, he doesn't publically consult through official police channels like Sherlock Holmes, he doesn't wear a suit and tie to organize other people into fighting against alien invaders, and he is often shown in comics as being obsessed with personal power and physical ability as a part of his intimidation tactics. Someone else brings a laser vision, he brings anti-laser gauntlets strapped to his utility belt /that he then personally uses to punch the lasers/ -- that sort of thing.

His reasons for finding Justice League weaknesses are also different, as would his more involved and less personally-actualized solutions. There was also my hints at a more Lex-Luthor-like attitude towards Superman and other aliens in general.
