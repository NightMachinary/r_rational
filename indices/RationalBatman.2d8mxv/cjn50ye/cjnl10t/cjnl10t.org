  I can imagine him doing consulting work for the police as a detective

If you want to go full-on master detective, have a Sherlock Holmes style consulting detective setup, only with Bruce Wayne, super villains, and a SWAT response team he trains and prepares.

But that's still sort of bland. You need Batman to live in the big DC world, with people who have real powers and seriously scary existential threats to the entire world.

So /still/ have Bruce join the Justice League -- only, he's actually in disguise this time, to protect his more mundane interests in Gotham. I'm thinking, sharp black business suit and a wrap-around domino mask with tall ears. He calls himself The Bat. With his help, they can work out rational plans in advance to counter superpowered international criminals.

Some of his teammates are really scary-powerful, but Bruce doesn't feel the need to match them in physical prowess or eye-laser-shooting. It isn't a contest about who can beat up who, after all. But Bruce is really not sure about that Superman guy. He's an alien who's practically invincible, and accountable only to his own conscience?

Better keep an eye on that one. Seems too good to be true. In fact, given how much mind-control tech is out there, and the frailty of the human mind in general, best to have a plan to neutralize any of the Justice League, just in case. Including himself.
