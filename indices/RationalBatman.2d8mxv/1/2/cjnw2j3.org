Decapitating strikes has a limited effect. There are a great many criminals, many with magical powers, who can resist his attacks and kill a lot of people if he fights them and even if he takes them out he leaves a great number of angry young people itching for the next crime boss.

If he does try to do so, with every strike the remaining crime lords will get stronger, and with this dangerous psychopath on the loose they'll be more willing to ally to take him down, to hire that dangerous clown to end this threat's life. If he takes too long there are other billionaires like Lex Luthor and Ra's Al Ghul and millionaires like Penguin, the Black Mask, Mr Freeze who are working hard with their own sinister goals to subvert the world and who have no problems sending assassins after him.

And his enemies are very skilled and deadly. They frequently beat and captured Batman in the olden days. With an extra boost of rationality they'd probably kill him. This is a lesson he should realize. People who attack mobsters have a tendency to die.

Although it'd be sad, I'd perfectly understand if he made a gentleman's agreement with the other rich folks to not kill each other. Too much violence is distasteful. Much more fun to beat up the lower classes.
