Batman makes the most sense as an extralegal detective/judge/jury that can break as many laws as he wants in pursuit of the truth. He wouldn't go after random muggers, he would go after organized crime, and make decapitating strikes at the heads of the criminal underworld. Because he doesn't have to worry about probable cause, warrants, or corruption within the legal system, he can accomplish his takedowns much faster than any police system could hope to do, even one with the funding of Wayne Industries behind it.

He's still use his funding for charitable works, but I think you could make the case for a lone agent working around the law being a boon to the city above and beyond the material costs of being Batman - especially when you factor in the psychological value of having this dark and scary entity that deters crime just by existing.

(And yes, he's got heaps of psychological problems, but there are decent enough reasons that he might not want to deal with them - for example, coming to terms with his parents' deaths might make him lose his relentless drive towards perfection. I see repeated warnings about mental self-modification and can imagine Batman thinking the same.)
