However powerful he could be as a lone agent, imagine that power wielded towards a reformation of the system for increased efficiency, effectiveness, fairness and accuracy?

I see Rational!Batman as a political powerhouse, outmanouvering the corrupt in the justice system, pushing recruitment of honest and intelligent law enforcement while lobbying for reform of the incarceration system towards rehabilitation. This combined with Rational!Wayne pushing to reduce as much as possible the causes of urban crime, tackling sanitation, education, and healthcare.

Batman, Inc could secretly create an elite force of agents to conduct necessary decapitation strikes, but I imagine causing power vacuums in organized crime would be a bit of a crude tool.

However, there would need to be a response for those who simply refuse to rehabilitate and just "want to watch the world burn". I imagine the Batmen unit could turn lethal in such situations.
