Seconding! I've been reading it since the year of it's release and this is a story worth looking at. In addition to the above it had some plot points delivering looks at civilations in deep time and how low probability existential risks can become certainties given a large enough sampling size. There's also a few (at least three off the top of my head) plots illustrating multi-polar coordination traps AKA Moloch.
