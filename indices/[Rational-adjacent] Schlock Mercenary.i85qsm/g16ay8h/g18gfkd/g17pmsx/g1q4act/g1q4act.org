Yeah the whole immortality filter and Fermi paradox approach with the missing Ancients was underwhelming, and TBH the ending was a bit on the 'meh' side. there still are some very enjoyable arcs in the latter books IMO - like the diversification of the Gavs and its hijacking. I would have liked that the artificial nature of the dark matter entities which was implied at some point led to something other than their simply being able to regenerate after being scattered.

IMO the best, truly satisfying ending to a long-running webcomics was that of [[http://starslip.chainsawsuit.com/][Starslip]].
