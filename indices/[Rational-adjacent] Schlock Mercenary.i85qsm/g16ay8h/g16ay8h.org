As it just completed, I would like to recommend the (very) long-running webcomic space opera /Schlock Mercenary./ As a strip-a-day webcomic, it's perhaps not perfectly rational, but it is internally consistent and concerned with ideas the [[/r/rational]] community is interested in. (Among them, strong AI, transhumanism, alien-human relationships, simulated afterlives, and so much more.) It has been at times, funny, clever, dramatic, lighthearted, tearjerking, and awe-inspiring, and I cannot recommend it enough.
