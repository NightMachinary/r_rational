Huh, Schlock Mercenary actually finished? That's crazy. I stopped reading around book 19 because I realized I wasn't enjoying the story as much anymore, and the last book I actually liked was 13.

I'll probably chug through it to get to the end and I hope it improves my opinion of the last third of its run but I kind of doubt it will.
