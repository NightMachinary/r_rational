Below is an intentionally shitty plan meant to display how to make an entry into this context.

--------------

*Godlike Power*

CYOA: [[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Magical_Realm_CYOA][Magical Realm CYOA]]

[Global Choices (this spoiler intentionally broken):]#s "Demiplanes: Area Increase 2 [3 points], Planar Features: Gateways 1 [1 Points] (I'm going to place one gate in my home, and the rest in Belgium.), Population: Population Increase 2 [4 points].")

[Personal Choices Tally (this spoiler intentionally broken):]#s "Personal Benefits tally: 92 points. Personal Drawbacks tally: 0 points.")

Plan: Step 1: Become a god Step 2: invade Belgium Step 3: ??? Step 4: Profit.
