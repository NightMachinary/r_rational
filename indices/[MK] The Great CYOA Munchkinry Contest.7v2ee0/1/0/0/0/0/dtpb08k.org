On a related note I wonder about how fundamentally incompatible human values are, or at least the subset of human values you're ever liable to see from the groups likely to create GAI (that religious extremists have fundamentally incompatible values is unremarkable). As well as how many moral disagreements are rendered moot by nearly unlimited resources.
