(I assume that this is the meta thread.)

More examples of CYOA images can be found on 4chan ([[https://boards.4chan.org/tg/cyoa][SFW]] and [[https://boards.4chan.org/trash/cyoa][NSFW]]) and on [[/r/makeyourchoice][r/makeyourchoice]].

  For those not in the know, a CYOA (Choose Your own Adventure) is an image where either you make one of several choices[...] or where you're given some "points" to spend on either setting up or having an adventure-- buying companions, abilities, enemies, setting details, whatever.

I feel the need to point out, in order to reduce confusion, that the new-fangled CYOA /images/ have very little in common with the old-fashioned CYOA /books/ (descriptions: [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure][AllTheTropes]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure][Wikipedia]]) with which people probably are more familiar.
