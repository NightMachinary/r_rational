I saw this comment and it made me sad so I decided to chime in, as someone who was somewhat intrigued by the title but quickly lost interest in actually participating, with reasons as to why I think this didn't see the success you were hoping for (it's worth noting that I'm not very familiar with this more modern style of CYOA)

I can't speak for everyone (obviously) but CYOA images do seem to be somewhat of a niche activity (which is not bad) and this CYOA contest in particular was narrowing that down to an even narrower niche, based on the rules and limitations you listed, at least from my understanding. In addition, the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] subreddit isn't very large. Combining all of those factors meant that the amount of people who would know enough about CYOA to participate, care enough about your topic to put in the needed effort to participate and are on this sub would be a very small amount.

I'm sure that's not really anything you don't already know but I still figured I would point it out anyway, just in case you didn't.
