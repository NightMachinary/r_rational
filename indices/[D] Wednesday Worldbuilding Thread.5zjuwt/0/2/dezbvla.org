I can't believe I missed this problem with wizard spells. Since money is only a medium of exchange, spells would have to transfer it rather than consume it in order for them to make any sense. I could just have it that the materials being "bought" have to be physically purchased from vendors in advance and put in a state where nearby wizards can draw on them, but I worry that is too thematically dissonant from the concept of money powered magic.

Then again, the concept is kind of absurd from an economic standpoint. If I had to do something else, then I'd just say mana is a natural resource that corporations gather and convert into a power source like gasoline and electricity that anyone can draw on if they can afford it. However, this lacks the feature of how spells change based on the local economy, which I thought was especially creative of me. I liked coming up with these zany ideas.

The only example I've even seen of a magic system based around money was the anime C: The Money and Soul of Possibility, which I do not recommend since it is about economics but the economy makes no sense.
