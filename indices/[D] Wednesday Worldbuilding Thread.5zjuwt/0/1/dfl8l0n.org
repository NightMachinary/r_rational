Sounds like a cool idea. Basically extending the Pratchett esque idea that gods are fueled by belief into a modern celebrity context. You could add into the backstory that past culture heroes, kings, etc. were powered by that sort of belief. Same could apply to modern politicians etc as well.

In narrative terms you probably need to impose some costs and limitations on the power that fame can give you. Perhaps your fame empowers you only in ways that fit with your persona, e.g. the singer with the bad boy persona is empowered when doing reckless things, but not in other situations.And over time the persons original personality fades and is overwritten by the simplified archetype, which could be played for existential horror.

I'm less convinced by the latter ideas like wizards since they seem to be moving away from the core idea of the setting and trying to hammer in more generic fantasy classes. Sticking to the core idea and expanding on its implications is often more interesting.
