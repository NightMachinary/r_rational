I was toying with the idea of a D&D game where the players were a band of bards who's performances caused magical effects (someone else already posted here about a magic system based around music, which I recommend if you can find it), and it grew from there to a way of reimagining D&D-style classes in a modern-tech setting who each draw power from a different source. The setting is vague but would have to be as adventure-friendly as D&D tends to be.

Bards are now celebrities who gain power from their fame and channel it through their artwork (why limit it to music?). Reproductions of their work don't have much (if any) power, which is why people obsess with getting original copies and even just autographs for a piece of real magic. The paparazzi are especially dangerous since they can leech power off of their subject by affecting their public image.

Clerics are geeks and fanboys whose power come from ritualistic "worship" of ideas more generic than traditional gods. A cleric based around music, for instance, doesn't necessarily see musicians as gods just figures in their mythology. The larger the fandom they're in, the more power there is out there, but the more they have to share it. For them, discussions about the meaning of art and abstract ideas are very serious since they can alter the rituals and power they grant.

Wizards ideally would be scientists and engineers, but since their magic is built around money businesses tend to have the most power even if they're technically only intermediaries. Spells originally consumed material components of recipes, but since money is a medium of exchange for materials it can be consumed just as easily. The only disadvantage over material components the cost changes based upon the value of the materials in the location being targeted.

Fighters are athletes who don't have any magic, but instead receive magical items that boost their abilities in the form of awards and sponsorships. Of all the classes, they are the only ones who are expected to go on heroic adventures. Sporting competitions are important, but there's still monsters to slay and damsels in distress. They've got the brute force to take on what no one else can.

These are all pretty abstract ideas probably more suited to a narrative game like Fate than D&D, but I still found them interesting. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to come up with cool ideas for all the classes. Druids could probably be New Agers and health nuts (or environmentalists who are reward by animal spirits if they're boring) while Barbarians are survivalists and conspiracy theorists, but I can't think of any way to make Rogues weirder than regular criminals.
