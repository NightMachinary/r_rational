I'd go a different direction and make barbarians drug abusers. Specifically things like PCP, steroids, and magical variants with more potent advantages and disadvantages. The survivalists and conspiracy theorists would suit rangers more, I think.

As for rogues, maybe make them hermits and hoarders? As in sort of bard-inverses, where their complete lack of human contact powers their ability to go undetected, glamour themselves, magically persuade people (diplomancer-style), and acquire hard-to-get things.
