How about: A ritual can make material components "available for purchase" at any price. Summoning these components can be done as part of spellcasting. A fraction of the summoned material is lost based on distance. (Plot hook: Unbeknownst to all, that fraction or part of it actually goes to the inventor of the ritual who built in a backdoor to that effect and then went on to market it as the only sane form of spellcasting) The user automatically summons from that source which costs him the least money.
