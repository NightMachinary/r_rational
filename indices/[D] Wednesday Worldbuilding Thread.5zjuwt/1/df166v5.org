Note: I am working on a kung-fu battle wizard setting. Would like your feedback.

* Concept:

  :CUSTOM_ID: concept
  :END:
It was almost the same story on every world. Once humans built farmlands and cities, they ruled the world. Not even the mighest and most powerful of beasts and monsters can challenge the might of their civilization. With the wilderness posing little threat, they turned to their attention to each other. They did many wonderful things in building their civilizations. Art, science, and philosophy flourished. There also however, negative impulses. They quarreled and warred against each other, commiting atrocities that only led to further revenge.

That was not to last on this world.

Nobody knew exactly when, but strange beasts powered by QI made their appearance from the West. At first those beasts only threatened the locals who were unforunate to live near them and the armed force that had to dispatch them. That was just the beginning. The Qi beasts also brought seeds, which then began to overtake the local ecosystem. This in turn, brought even more strange beasts to the land of the humans.

The invasive species also threatened the farmlands. The Qi creatures feasted on the crops, or more frequently, the new plants just overtook them. The cows, horses, sheeps, chickens, and other animals were not spared either.

Humanity fought back, but their knowledge and capability was outpaced by the new ecosystem growth. They couldn't adapt both to the threat posed by the Qi beasts or exploit opportunities posed by the new ecosystem.

Then, there were the quakes, which gradually became more frequent and more powerful over time. That was the last straw that broke the civilizations of old. The destruction of infrastructure led to a population crash, and scattering the rest.

--------------

Centuries passed, and humanity lived on. The reminder of human civilizations huddled together in heavily fortified settlements.

Still, the settlements couldn't provide everything humanity needed or wanted. There's still plenty of reasons to explore outside world, such as trading and obtaining rare resources which cannot be found in any settlements' farms or mines.

Enter the elite soldiers known as lanterns, who wield the power of qi better than any other in a combat environment. They are heavily specialized for movement and parkour, and their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters rather than hunting them, perfect for the environment and challenges they contend with on a day to day basis.

There are three classes of lanterns in this setting:

- *Scouts* - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers, such as useful plants or animals, or dangerous beasts who can threaten supply lines and routes.

- *Runners* - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements.

- *Heavy combat* - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

* Environment
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: environment
  :END:
Centuries of constant earthquakes shaped and broken the grounds until it became impossible for any wheeled transportation. Walking wouldn't fare much better in this environment. However, given the danger of the ground floor below, human begun to travel by branching and jumping through tree lines.

The wildlife were unsurprisingly, very dangerous, and very big, much like the trees which had grew very high and wide since the emergence of the Qi ecosystem.

Another dangerous force of nature to contend with are the fast moving waters at the bottom, which had became unpredictable and torrential. It carved cave systems and created further elevations, making the land even more unnavigable except for lanterns.

It is rare for lanterns to venture so far below, but there are dangerous water beasts lurking beneath the water.

Qi crystals are the lifeblood of settlement everywhere.

- *Light crystals*: Useful crystals of varying qualities that emit light. The best light crystals emit no heat, and only the wavelength needed to support plant growth. Those light crystals are the primary mean of growing food for colonies, or otherwise it would be impossible to practice agriculture. Certain colors of lights are better than others for growing plants.
- *Ice crystals*: Crystals that generate ice that usually come in a variety of cool colors. It can also be distinguished from other crystals by its coolness.
- *Fire crystals*: Crystals that generate heat that usually come in a variety of warm colors. It can also be distinguished from other crystals by its heat.
- *Tuner crystals*: Crystals that assists sigilmasters with creating sigils. It can be distinguished from other crystals by its thumming while held.

* Power and Abilities:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: power-and-abilities
  :END:
Every human beings born uses qi, and have roughly the same basic powers, though only a fraction of the population will be scouts and warriors.

- *Adhesion*: Using a basic qi technique, it is possible to stick to objects using bottoms of their feets and their palms. However, nothing can stick to the body elsewhere.

- *Enhanced Kinesthetic Sense*: Anybody could easily fall to their death if they made the wrong move, so it's important for people to be highly aware of their own bodies and what they are doing at all time.

- *Enhanced Upper Body Strength*: Since the world is three dimension, all four limbs must be used.

- *Sigilism*: A relatively undeveloped science. By drawing diagrams certain way and aligning tuner crystals in a three dimensional space, it's possible to create qi effects independent of a person.

- *Signs*: Any techniques casted by the user in the form of body motions and gestures to create effects. Although those motions were not strictly necessary, and could be omitted, it makes creating effects easier. Using a sign without making any gesture is an indicator of the mastery of that technique.

* Sigilism
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sigilism
  :END:
The art of creating magic through the drawing of sigilism and its infusion by qi and tuner crystals.

- *Sigilmasters* - Scientists, engineers, and craftmen who study and practice sigilsim.

*Type of Sigils*:

- *Storage Sigil*- A standard sigil store objects in a pocket dimensions at the volume of one cubic meter with one-fifth the mass. This is what make lantern logistic and trade between colonies possible. However, since movement is life, carrying those storage sigils are an encumberance to the lanterns who carries them.

* Signs
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: signs
  :END:
Magic which are performed through equal part concentraction, motion and bodily gestures.

- *Elemental Ball* - Cast an elemental ball against an enemy, such as the classical fireball.
- *Boost jump* - The first sign that any lantern recruits learn and one that must be mastered before graduation.
- *Qi sense* - A very basic sign that can be powered by being continuously aware and alert. It is also enhanced by motion through the forest. It gives the qi user a partial 360 degree awareness of the world around them.

* Ranks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ranks
  :END:
This is the Lantern Military Structure for all the villages.

Colors indicate skill levels and experiences. Chevrons indicate rank. The two systems usually go hand in hand with each other, though it was not always the case for various reasons.

- *Purple* - The elite and the very best.
- *Blue* - Veteran.
- *Red* - The basic grunt.
- *Green* - The rawest recruits who had just graduated from the academy.

* Colonies
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: colonies
  :END:
All humans live in colonies. Colonies, are self contained supporting environment, heavily fortified, more akin to acrologies than cities as we know it.

Colonies are usually underground and organized vertically into levels. The lowest level is the mine, followed by agriculture, the city, and finally, military installation.

*Mine:*

The mine is the most important level in any colonies, for it support agricultural production. Mainly, it contains access to qi well or veins, allowing the cultivation of light crystals vital to agriculture.

*Agriculture:*

The wilderness is extremely rich, supporting a density of biomass not found anywhere on Earth. It is therefore perfectly capable of supporting the human populations larger than any cities combined, but due to the amount of danger, this is not possible.

Agriculture in this context is having a safe place to farm, which are made possible by light crystals, freeing humanity from their dependence on sunlight.

*The City:*

The city levels are the beating heart of any colony, and also where everyone live irrespective of their position in society, from kings to miners.

Like any city, it is also where workshops and businesses are located.

One exception to this is any sigil workshops, which will be explained in the next section.

*Military Installation:*

Everything military-related are located here, including boot camps, obstacle courses, gyms, and so forth.

It is also where the sigil workshops are located, due to the nature of their work. Sigil infusion failures are known for their danger, thus it must be located away from the city below.

It is also the most ideal location to disembark from, as it is the highest level of any colony. Even in a three dimensional environment, the high ground is still an advantage.
