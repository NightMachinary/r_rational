I'd be up for doing it. A couple of warnings: 1. I don't get scared by anything (most people say that, but it's not really true. It is with me), 2. I'm not sure how "wise" of a reading I could give (and yes I have read the post about it), though I am working out a good method for doing it, and 3. I haven't read very many (any) horror novels.

Anyways, I could do it, if none of those warnings bother you.
