  Secondly Velika was becoming increasingly erratic and unstable in her behaviour, and this is someone who could physically kill the entire city one by one without much trouble. In addition to her decreasing stability she was on the verge of tipping into a death spiral where she terrifies people to rule through fear, then people make mistakes because they're terrified, so she kills more people to set an example, repeat until rock bottom. Remember that she was shown struggling to tell the difference between mistakes and treachery.
