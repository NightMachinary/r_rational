I think something can be morally right but tactically really dumb. Like, I 100% agree that the Watch are justified in trying to take back the city. But like, it was still a dumb call. They're betting /a lot/ on trying to take Velika off-guard, in a poor situation (the whole "she evaded their attacks by just re-entering the dungeon" thing), on the hope that she defeated them individually or in small groups and would lose against the entire group.
