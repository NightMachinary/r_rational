But is there any chance that a chance this good would come again? Is there any certainty that she would re-enter the dungeon again rather than send underlings? They had to do something before she became established and this was their only option. If she had been slightly slower or farther out she probably would have died.

I honestly don't see a better option for them except lay down and hope this awful plan doesn't result in the entire city and most of the people being destroyed...
