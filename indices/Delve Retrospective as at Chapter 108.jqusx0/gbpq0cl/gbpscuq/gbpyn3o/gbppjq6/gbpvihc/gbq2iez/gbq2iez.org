There were a lot of unknown facts, and the Watch was acting on guesswork for most of their actions, but there were several things they believed to be true.

1. The barrier was under Velika's control, so if she died either the barrier would drop automatically due to the user of a System skill dying, or they could retrieve some remote for controlling it from her corpse. Obviously they were wrong about this, but it's hard to guess something like that Westbridge trapped her in Fel Sadanis with everyone else. Or even that the barrier was a Magistraal artifact which had been hidden in the city for centuries without detection.
2. If they didn't attack her as she was leaving the dungeon, they will never get any other chance to beat her. This part is true, because Velika would have sent any member of her new guards to lead any future dungeon parties. Also dungeons take a while to recover, which could have cost time the city didn't have.
3. If they didn't commit fully to attacking her, they would lose. As we saw, a near-Gold like Velika was unbeatable in a fight against multiple Silvers and hordes of Bronzes. Levels have an exponential effect on an individual's strength. So if they hadn't thrown everything they had at her, it was a guaranteed loss.
4. They would have succeeded in killing her if they committed fully to attacking her. This part was completely correct as can be seen by how Velika's leg was completely wrecked and took significant time to mend afterwards. The Watch actually attacked slightly too soon and gave Velika the ability to escape from most of the attacks by ducking back into the dungeon. If they had waited possibly a second later for her to take a few more steps away from the dungeon, then they might have won in killing her.
5. If they gave up and did nothing, the Watch would die under Velika and/or the DKE. This part is very accurate. Velika is an unpredictable individual who can and has killed people with no reason (eg. Melka). You can argue that she isn't that unstable, but from the Watch's perspective, she can't be trusted to be consistent and reliable. Furthermore, while the DKE says that they have the city's best interests in mind, they are still an invading army. Invading armies have no reason to leave the current law enforcement in place or to even release them. The Watch could expect to be executed by the DKE (the DKE could likely just claim they were "resisting" or something like that).
