An organisation that solves serious situations with martial might (or the threat of it) tries to use martial might to solve a situation. I don't think that counts as an idiot ball. People not properly adapting to facing a new threat and using outdated strategies/thinking is pretty standard, look at the responses to climate change for example.

Throw in the stress of the situation and the fear of the Watch "losing" here negatively affecting the Watch as a whole organisation as they are perceived as weaker by their enemies and there's sufficient justification for the sequence of events, even if it ain't the best path for them to take.

I could just be bias because I like the story and all though, so grains of salt and all.

Anyway I've been reading ahead, super short answer is that Rain leaves Fel Seldanis and Velika doesn't follow him.
