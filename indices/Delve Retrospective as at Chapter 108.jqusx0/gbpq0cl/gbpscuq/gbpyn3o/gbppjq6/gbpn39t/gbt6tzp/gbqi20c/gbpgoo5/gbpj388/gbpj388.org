I agree, the watch fucked up. We knew they were a faulty organisation, hypocritical and lacking self awareness, but this attack was a very very bad decision, for all the reasons you gave. I'm hoping there was a reason behind it that we don't know, something that the upper brass, the warden and goldplates, are privy to.

It's happened a couple of times in the past that I've been disappointed by how stupid some decisions characters make are, then later find out they had their reasons (like The Mad King's plan in Blood Song and the explanation given in the opening chapters of the sequel) so thats what I'm hoping for here.

I think Rain is aware that his feelings towards Velika aren't fair. I think he'll resolve that in time.

I, too, don't expect Velika to come back for a very long time.
