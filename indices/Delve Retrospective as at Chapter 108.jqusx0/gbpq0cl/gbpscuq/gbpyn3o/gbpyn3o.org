I disagree about Velika. Firstly she was the instigator of the conflict, she invaded the city through military might and held everyone hostage. Given that the locals have a de-facto right to rebel for freedom - especially since this is a pre-modern world. Peaceful protests and referendums are not a practical option in this world.

Secondly Velika was becoming increasingly erratic and unstable in her behaviour, and this is someone who could physically kill the entire city one by one without much trouble. In addition to her decreasing stability she was on the verge of tipping into a death spiral where she terrifies people to rule through fear, then people make mistakes because they're terrified, so she kills more people to set an example, repeat until rock bottom. Remember that she was shown struggling to tell the difference between mistakes and treachery.

Given this the watch had two options: Do nothing and pray she climbs out of her funk. Take your one chance to kill her while you can. We as readers know the solution is the first one, because Rain quite quickly found a way to control the barrier and that will make Velika calm down. The watch did not. They had two high risk choices and chose.
