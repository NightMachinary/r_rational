I feel like this is missing the point that Lady V was essentially a tyrant who had seized the city and was holding them all hostage. The watch had one single chance to kill her and from their perspective, retake the city and overthrow a dictator. Sure they acted rashly, but all this talk about how Velika hadn't killed anyone misses the point that they were entirely justified in attempting to assassinate her. Their reasons for trying to kill her were arguably more valid than her self-defense, are we arguing that occupying dictators are the ones in the right when defending themselves against resistance movements?

What happened was a tragedy, but Velika was decidedly the antagonist of it. The entire thing could have been avoided if she came clean, but she couldn't because she was a dictator ruling by the equivalent of military might and she couldn't show weakness.

We as the audience know that it wouldn't have solved the main problem, but we also know that if it weren't for Rain then this entire plot by the Citizens was so stupid and reliant on a single point of failure that the entire city would have died.
