The city *did* die, for all practical purposes.

Had Velika and Westbridge not invaded and put up the barrier, the Watch and the Guild could have handled the rank shift so much better. For starters, more of them would have been alive to help, and they wouldn't have been constantly drained of mana trying to charge the barrier.

Let's not sideline that point, theirs was the inciting action that caused the death of practically the entire population. Now, it would well be argued that because of the /other/ invasion force (that subsequently slipped away unscathed), they were equally screwed. But the Watch, Guild and Halgrave (sp?) could have put up a good fight for that at least.
