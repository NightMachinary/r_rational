  Now, it would well be argued that because of the other invasion force (that subsequently slipped away unscathed), they were equally screwed. But the Watch, Guild and Halgrave (sp?) could have put up a good fight for that at least.

I'd agree there. That army beat a whole strike team of citizens, Halgrave had no chance.

That said, I think from the POV of the average civilian they'd be better off under the empire. That army wouldn't kill them and might even protect them from the rank shift. Velika ignored them to sulk while the city died.
