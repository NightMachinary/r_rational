Rain is a weak character, the kind that is approaching for an employee in, say, the bay area, but not in the litrpg world. He is not the kind of person who has a big edge in the LitRPG power ladder. His lackadaisical ambition also hurts the story (when Rain himself hardly cares about advancing, why should we?). He is trash at game theory. He not only repeatedly admits that he is a cooperate-only bot, the one time he bluffs to not cooperate (the scene with the thieves), he immediately gets all guilty and lets the thieves just go. Frankly, this level of naivety/virtue-signaling is bad even in the most civilized subcultures on Earth, but in the novel universe? Rain should have seen a lot more bad consequences.

Rain's approach to morality is also not effective. I'm now in the middle of the Empire invasion arc, and he is continuously wasting his mental focus on trivial quibbles such as paying for food that people gifted him. There is a line that really hits it home for me:

#+begin_quote
  He looked around guiltily, conscious of the fact that breaking and entering was pretty much exactly what he'd just finished saying not to do. This is different. I'm not stealing anything, and I will pay for the damage, I swear.

  Satisfied that there were no witnesses to his unprovoked attack on the innocent door, he made his way inside.
#+end_quote

“Satisfied that there were no witnesses.” Even the canon is saying his primary moral concern is signaling.

I wonder why he didn't whine when they were stealing from the mine.

His ideals are also childish AF. “Awakening everybody” (like the ruling institutions already don't want this), “making healing free” (Presumably by slaving the medical staff, as evidenced by his reaction when Wallace refused to heal Val), ... .
