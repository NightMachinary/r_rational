The problem is the Dark Side doesn't make any sense.

They don't seem inherently more powerful then a light side user.

The only advantage they seem to have is lightning coming from their hands, which is easily deflected/absorbed by a lightsaber, "Don't throw your lightsaber away Luke you dumbass!"

So it just seems to be a belief that your more powerful, as well as other massive personality changes.
