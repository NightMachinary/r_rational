True, though Mace Windu would too have a comparable period of experience as Palpatine, or even less. In fact according to this logic, if the universe has races as long lived as Yoda's, and if ability with the Force depends more on knowledge and mental clarity than outright physical prowess, all the top Force users should be incredibly old. A human could never hope to reach those heights with such a puny lifespan.

On the other hand, every Jedi in the Temple has had many chances to train by sparring with other Jedi, and has fought many battles on the ground against multiple weaker enemies. Palpatine has had forty years to... huh... train with whoever his master was, kill his master (probably in his sleep, if it was Darth Plagueis), train alone, maybe spar a bit with his own disciples such as Darth Maul and Dooku. That's it. The rest of it, he had to pretend to be a honest Naboo politician so he didn't really get much time to train at all.

Yeah, I'd say a "Dark Side boost" is a thing.
