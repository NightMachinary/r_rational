  They don't seem inherently more powerful then a light side user.

One Sith somehow manages to hold at bay multiple Jedi. Consider this: Palpatine might be an equal with someone like Yoda or Mace Windu, but he completely slaughters less skilled Jedis in almost no time. So perhaps he was never that talented to begin with, and the Dark Side automatically makes you the best possible Force user?

That said, it's still not much. But if we hold to the idea of the old Expanded Universe of Palpatine keeping a mental hold over /the entire Empire/, that's released upon his death, well, that is /some/ power.
