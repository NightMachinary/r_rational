A possible rationalization of the Dark side (also the Jedi prophecy about Anikan, and the rule of 2).

​

Premis: The Light and Dark sides are not opposites. The cycle of life and death, and the balance of opposing forces is the Light side. This balance is the "natural" state of the Force. And Light side users learn how to maintain that balance when they interact with the force. The Dark side, is a 'corruption' of that whereby the force user doesn't bother maintaining the balance. The result is easer access to flashy effects and exclusive access to some things that require not "balancing the equation" like eternal life.

​

The ethical issue with using the dark side is that the force does still have to balance at the large scale. So the Dark side is essentially imposing a large externality on the force as a whole. For every dark side user living forever the life of every other living this is shortened slightly to make up for it. Similarly any dark side technique creates local disruptions in the force that have to be smoothed out at the cost of spreading them across the whole of the universe. This is what ultimately creates the seemingly random regions that are "strong with the dark side".

​

The temptation of the Dark side is that it's easy. Any trained force user can just stop worrying about the balance thing and get an immediate boost in power, and a force user learning for the dark side for the first time has less to learn. It is also a gateway to the ever tempting eternal life. The problem with using it is that it's a tragedy of the commons. The more dark side users there are the shittier the force as a whole gets from the lack of matiannce, and at some point it even starts to backfire on the Dark side users themselves.

​

So, The Jedi interpreted the "bring balance to the force" line in Anikan's prophecy to mean "cut all that Dark side nonsense out for good" because the "imbalance" is the existence of the dark side. The Sith have the rule of two, because the fewer dark side users there are the less work using the dark side is. And the Dark side continues to be tempting because it's a shortcut, with no obvious down sides if you're the only one doing it, plus eternal life.
