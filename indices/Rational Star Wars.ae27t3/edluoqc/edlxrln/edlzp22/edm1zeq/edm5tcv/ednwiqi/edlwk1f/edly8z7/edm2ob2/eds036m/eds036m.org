This seems based on a flawed understanding of the force. It isn't really divided into 2 halves.

There is the Force, and then the dark side which is corrupted. The Dark Side has a tangible impact that can be felt, and is distinct from sacred force areas. Places like the cave on dagobah or Sith shrines.

Philosophically the force is about being in harmony with the world around you. The Dark Side is like a ripple in the pond when you try to bend it to your will. This creates a corruption that expands as you continue to feed it.

There can be things of 2 as long as they are justified.
