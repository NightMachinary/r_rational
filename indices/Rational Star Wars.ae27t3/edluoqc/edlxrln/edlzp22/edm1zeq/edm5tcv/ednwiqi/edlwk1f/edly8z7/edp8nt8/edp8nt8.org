The idea is that the Force itself pushes certain behaviours. If you start "going Dark", it exerts a corrupting influence. I liked Eliezer's idea (posted below) because really there doesn't seem to be such a feedback mechanism for Jedi: they are simply trying their hardest NOT to fall for the Dark Side, /all the time/. The Sith are the ones that stopped bothering.

If I wrote a rational fic about Star Wars, I guess "destroying the Force" might be the ultimate objective. It really seems like it's more harm than good. At the very least, it's a semi-sentient force of nature that likes screwing around with human affairs.
