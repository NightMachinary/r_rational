Man, I always find those political opinion pieces about Star Wars so bizarre. The guy actually *praises* the new trilogy for having black-and-white morality and villains with no discernible motivation. I actually thought the weakest part of the new movies was how I still have no idea what made Kylo Ren or Snoke or even Hux do any of the things they did.

Cheers for the links, I got a lot of new stuff to read now.
