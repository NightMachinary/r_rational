Some fics:

- The Son of Suns trilogy, which is an AU where Vader captures Luke at Cloud City, and the Emperor raises Luke as his newest apprentice. This series is comparable to /Worm/ in terms of torture and brainfucking of characters. Comes in three separate works:

  1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm][Into the Storm]]
  2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4344112/1/In-Shadows-and-Darkness][In Shadows and Darkness]]
  3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4520729/1/At-the-Brink-of-the-Dawn-and-the-Darkness][At the Brink of the Dawn and the Darkness]]

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4121383/chapters/9290023][The Trial of Darth Vader]], where Vader survived Episode VI as the Rebellion's prisoner.
- [[https://prokopetz.tumblr.com/post/152005706762/random-headcanon-owing-to-differences-in-certain][Random Headcanon]] about why Star Wars' worldbuilding feels off. I'm not going to spoil it here; it's a short thing. But I'll add my own conclusions: The Empire never developed radar, and there's atmosphere in space.
