Pretty sure I've read someone's Star Wars headcanon that had examined the Force in light of modern statistical parables: there are only 0, 1, or infinity of things, not two. The Force does not have infinite sides; it does not have zero sides. Therefore, it must have one side. And based on observations of Force weilders, it's a continuum from being immune to the Force to being the worst of the Sith, and Jedi are only an emotions slip away from becoming more-adept Force users. There is no Light Side to the Force; there is only the Dark Side, which the Jedi skim.
