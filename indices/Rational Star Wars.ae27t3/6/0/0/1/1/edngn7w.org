Acid/base is a poor example, but positive and negative charge is a better one.

​

If the force worked like charge then people who try to balance dark and light end up with week or no force power, those who exclusively use dark Xor light get stronger but only in the direction of the one they use. And reversing course would directly weaken them until they cross the neutral line.

​

Further if the reflect vs cancel behavior is relevant it may explain why a week light side user can benefit from using the dark side when fighting a strong dark side user. They don't have enough light charge to cancel the stronger dark side user's charge, but even a small dark side charge will repel their charge rather efficiently. While in the long run this brings their total charge closer to neutral (or even to net-dark) in the moment it can mean surviving an otehrwise hopeless fight.

​

Technically you could argue that this is an "infinity" case as there are infinite distinct charge levels between negative infinity and positive infinity. However that's kind of missing the point which is that when two charges interact it matters what combination of positive and or negative they are at least as much as it matters what they respective magitudes are.
