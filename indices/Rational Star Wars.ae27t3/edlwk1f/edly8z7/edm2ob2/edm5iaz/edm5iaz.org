He's misremembering the quote a bit:

#+begin_quote
  Zero, one and infinity are the only numbers that need no justification
#+end_quote

is the actual quote. I'd say phenomena that come in sets of two do need a justification for why exactly two although in many cases the justification is easy to do.
