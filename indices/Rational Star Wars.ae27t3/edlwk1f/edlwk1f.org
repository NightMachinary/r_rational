rational? space opera often is not, even if specific characters may be.

I tend to see the jedi/sith divide as being a flase dichotomy. the force is not just two conflicting groups and their ideologies, those are just the two we see in the films. sith want control at any cost, and are sociopaths at best, psychopaths at worst. the jedi were an order that refused all emotion out of fear, and cut off all emotional contact out of fear. fear of the dark side, of the sith, of losing control.
