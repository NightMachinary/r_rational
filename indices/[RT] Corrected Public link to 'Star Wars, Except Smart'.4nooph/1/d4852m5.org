I wonder about the RoTJ railgun idea, I would think that the asteroid would punch through the planet like a bullet through a watermelon without transferring much kinetic energy to the planet. Life around the entry and exit holes would suck, bu the planet would be basically OK.

In order to achieve the 'trash the crust all at once' effect, the asteroid would have to be going fast enough to impart enough energy to the planet, but slow enough to not punch through.

The asteroid targeting the Death Star presents a different problem. Even if the shield stays up, the kinetic energy has to go /somewhere/. Possibilities include: 1. The shield heats up, cooking everything inside. 2. A billiard ball collision with respect to the shield, but NOT the contents. Everything inside is turned into metallic goo. 3. The 'safe against any bombardment' wasn't planning on a 0.9+c asteroid strike, the shield fails like any other shield when hit by too much energy.
