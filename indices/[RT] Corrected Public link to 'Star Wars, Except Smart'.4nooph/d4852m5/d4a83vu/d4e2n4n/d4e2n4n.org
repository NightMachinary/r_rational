You're assuming that ftl drives increase momentum. The problem is that if ftl works that way it breaks the whole setting. As planet destroying weaponry would be ubiquitous and impossible to defend against. Their hyperspace travel is never really described, but I'd vaguely assumed it didn't affect the realspace momentum of the ship.

In the EU (no idea if its 'canon' now) a big plot point was that hyperspace was affected by gravitational fields in realspace, so an unexpected gravity well could pull you out of hyperspace. Which fits with the no momentum idea. But raises further questions....

This still leaves open the possibility of ftl capable missiles/drones that suicide jump into the target. Possibly after gaining a lot of momentum in realspace first by conventional means.
