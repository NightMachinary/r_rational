There's also an open question about the ability to communicate at inter-system range. Vader and the Emperor did it when Vader had the ship move out of the asteroid field. It happened a few times in the prequels. The probe droid on Hoth sent pictures back to the Empire. Given that we don't know the mechanism of any of these, they might not be jammable. They also seem to exist only when it's convenient for the plot.
