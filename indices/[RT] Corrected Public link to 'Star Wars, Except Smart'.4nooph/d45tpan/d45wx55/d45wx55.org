In fairness, there are advantages to a planetary base. You aren't living in a closed system, so you can easily get water, mine things, etc. Air is free. Fire and heat aren't nearly as much of an issue. You can do that in ships as well by mining asteroids/comets and careful cooling, but it's harder.

Also, it really shouldn't be possible for the Empire to find them with the tech shown. The number of probes it would take is off the charts. The. There's the way it happened: to he probe that discovered them, for example -- they sent one probe to search an entire planet, and it happened to touch down within a few miles of the base? Also, the probe sent a signal back to the Empire, which I think is the only time we see interplanetary communication in the OrigTrij. Could be that the probe transmitted to something in orbit which then traveled back to the Empire, I guess. That's my new headcanon.
