To borrow from Watchmen: "She's not a comic book villain. She did it thirty-five minutes ago."

More seriously: she did it before Vader got on her track. He couldn't be jamming transmissions, because he saw the incoming message. She saved that message to her Dropbox and sent out the pre-prepared emails. It took about a second and a half.

Or maybe the Bothans put it in their own Dropbox, sent the emails with her name forged on the From line, and the transmission Vader detected was just "It's done." I'm not really sure; she was being a little cagey when telling me the details, and kept going on about OPSEC and information hygiene and a lot of other fancy spy words.
