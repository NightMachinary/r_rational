...fair enough. I can certainly see ways for the Empire to defend against both options, even both simultaneously - especially given that they can effectively and completely cut information transfers to/from a single planet if they so desire, perhaps only with a ship carrying a diplomatic mission being able to legally pass through the blockade - but then again, one must also consider that with Darth Vader chasing after said diplomatic ship, he's /not/ personally manning the blockade, and that means that a good enough pilot with a fast smuggler's freighter can probably slip through their net with a message in any case...
