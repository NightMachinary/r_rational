People here liked the previous book in the series, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56r15v/dcrtbook_orconomics/][Orconomics]], when it was about Economics in a D&D-like world. So I'm posting the sequel here on the day of it's release.

For some understanding, the first book in the series reads a lot like the author of the [[http://www.critical-hits.com/features/dungeonomics-bibliography/][Critical Hits]] blog chose to write a fantasy book. Even though I'm fairly sure the author of the book and the website are two different people.
