Alternate history fiction about a historian traveling back in time into the body of Arthur Harris who became the leader of the British's bomber command, in charge of the British strategic bombing campaign against Nazi Germany.

Hindsight, however, is not all that cracked up to be superpower. Bureaucratic obstruction, personality conflicts, clashes of ideas, all conspire to keep Bomber Command from functioning at the most rational course of action.
