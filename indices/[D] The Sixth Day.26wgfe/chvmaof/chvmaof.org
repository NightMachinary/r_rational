This is very common in (stupid) sci-fi. The author comes up with this cool plot that requires certain technology. They then stop thinking about the real implications of their technology and just write the plot they wanted in the first place.

Just look at In Time for another example. They can extend someone's healthspan indefinitely and all they use it for is oppressing the masses. This might not be completely unrealistic, but it's probably the most boring plot you could write with that premise.
