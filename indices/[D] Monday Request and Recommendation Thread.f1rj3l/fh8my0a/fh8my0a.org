So after reading all 7 Cradle novels Ive discovered there's a huge world of XianXia fics. Could you all recommend your favorites to me?

I have read sufficiently advanced magic and shadows of what was lost.

Also is there anywhere I can go to discuss cradle with people? Now that I know book 8 is coming out in March there is so much I want to discuss and theorize before it comes out.

I guess for recommendations Id like to recommend two pieces which have probably been recommended in this sub before but want to mention them in case it slipped by anyone.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]]. It is an isekai similar to Im a Spider, So What? In that the protag is transported to another world as a monster. Unlike Im a Spider, it keeps that lighthearted tone from the beginning throughout, up to its latest chapter. It is not finished but has a huge chunk of chapters and updates almost daily, but in short bits. It's fun to see a protagonist be lighthearted but also consider the ramifications of their actions. It is not rational, I wouldnt even call it rational adjacent, but the character isnt dumb. Any dumb mistakes made by people are in-character for them, rather than forcing the plot to progress. The only downside is that the updates are often rather short and leave you watching more, so when you catch up Id leave it for a week or two at a time and then read the updates in one burst.
