What elements of xanxia do you think are missing of from Street Cultivation? And what do you think the difference is between xanxia and "power creep fantasy" (which I'll admit to not having heard of as a genre before). "Power Creep Fantasy" sounds like a pretty good, succinct (if incomplete) way to describe xanxia to me. Street Cultivation is definitely different than most xanxia, but that's kind of the point. It is taking a lot of the common tropes and ideas and putting them in a substantially different setting and seeing what it looks like. It's literary fusion, and I'm really not sure what other genre you could call it that would be more informative to a prospective reader than "xanxia", since that's very clearly (and explicitly from the author) what it was inspired from.
