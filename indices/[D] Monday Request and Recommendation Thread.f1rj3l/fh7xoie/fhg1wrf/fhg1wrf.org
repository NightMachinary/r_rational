- *Mother of Learning*

- *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*

- *Harry Potter* because it's a part of who I am and because it spawned a ton of great fanfiction like HPMOR

- *HPMOR*

- *Gurren Lagann* inspirational and keeps me happy

- *Bloons Tower Defense 6* I'll be honest I'm not a huge gamer and I just like seeing people play this strategy game

- *Avatar: The Last Airbender*

- *Sangatsu no Lion* really good drama anime

- *Saiki Kusuo no Î¨-nan* really funny and surprisingly heartwarming anime

- I think *Attack on Titan* is probably going to be on here once it ends

And honestly, I don't think I consume enough entertainment to really have a top 10 but I like these. In addition, my favorite podcast is *Hello Internet*, my favorite webtoons are *Gourmet Hound*, *Your Letter*, and *A Good Day to be a Dog*, and my favorite book series *Dresden Files* and *Kingkiller Chronicles*.
