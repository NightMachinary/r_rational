I'm willing to tentatively believe that something about Xianxia stories forces them to be long, but I'm sure I've read short stories where the protagonist ascends to godhood, so that doesn't seem sufficient.

Thanks for the recs; I think I'm going to hold out for someone trying to boil the genre down, but the upvotes say some other readers got use out of them.
