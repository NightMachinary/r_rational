[[https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/][Should the Sun not Rise]] is a complete, shortish webserial about an old Aztec being that is caught between her murderous nature, and the human guise she's worn for the last couple of centuries. She's dragged from her self-chosen isolation when in Rhode Island corpses are discovered, who were murdered in a style that suggests Aztec ritual sacrifices. She needs to prove her innocence to the local magical community, and avoid the secret being revealed to the world at large.

Of course, Wildbow's other works [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], and [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]], are great as well.
