I've read many fictions that get dropped or put on permanent hiatus, but it's been almost a year since I read [[http://alexanderwales.com/glimwarden-prologue/][Glimwarden]] and I can't get it out of my head. I love the setting so much. I think there are three aspects that I love about it. 1) I like the "it's a big scary world, and man is eking out an existence, and it's not perilous necessarily, but anything could be out there" setting of it. I think I especially like the use of a beacon to hold back the "darkness". 2) I like the superhero aspect where everyone "gets one power" and judicious munchkining is expected. I've read a lot of superhero fics in my day. 3) I like the "kill monsters, gain essences, get more power"aspect. I've been reading tons of lit RPGs lately, and they're so addictive to me.

Any recommendations that might scratch that itch? I haven't really looked for fan fiction or anything of it, but if there is any decent fanfic of it I would read it, or anything that . I read [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/the-story-so-far/][Pyrebound]] to current about a month ago, which kept reminding me of it, but never actually scratching that itch. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good story in its own right, but doesn't fill the hole that the few chapters of Glimwarden somehow created. Halp!
