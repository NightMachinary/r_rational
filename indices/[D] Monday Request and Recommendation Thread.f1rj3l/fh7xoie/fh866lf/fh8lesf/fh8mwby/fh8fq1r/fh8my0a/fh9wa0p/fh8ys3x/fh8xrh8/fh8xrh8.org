Lazily copying from another comment of mine:

- Reverend Insanity's been pretty good (with an amoral protagonist, mind.)

- The first time I tried to read Forty Milleniums of Cultivation I couldn't get past chapter two. The second time I picked it up and read the whole 1700 chapters - it's easily my favourite Xianxia novel. It subverts several Xianxia tropes but I don't think you have to be familiar with them to appreciate them.
