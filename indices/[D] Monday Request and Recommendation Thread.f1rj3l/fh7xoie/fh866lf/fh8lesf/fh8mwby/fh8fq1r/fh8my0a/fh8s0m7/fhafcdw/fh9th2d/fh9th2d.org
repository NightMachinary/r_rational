Sorry, I really don't. Pact was a weird place for me, because the entire time I was reading it I thought it was pretty good, I guess...but I miss Worm and why wouldn't he just start up the sequel immediately? And now...it's something I keep thinking about. Just especially the karma and "spirits watching you" parts. Like, you can gain an upper hand by declaring that you will not be hurt...but if you are hurt, then you lose a lot more than you would have gained. Very cool. Sorry I haven't looked into good fanfics for you.
