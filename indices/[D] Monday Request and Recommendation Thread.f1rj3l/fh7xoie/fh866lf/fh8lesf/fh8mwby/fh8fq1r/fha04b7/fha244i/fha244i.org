Hah, I tried the first one and it wasn't too great. I'll give it another pass though. The Wandering Inn is so highly recommended. It's one of the few that I haven't read up there because of the variety of positive and negative reviews it receives. I guess I'll have to give it a try now though xD

Thanks!
