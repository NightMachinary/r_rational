I don't mean the story or plot has religious undertones. Let's say, for example In the ‘Completionist Chronicles' my immersion was completely destroyed after the MC asked his in-game god if he could not be a priest because ‘worshipping' him when he was Catholic IRL went against his beliefs. Like what was the point of that? It wasn't a major plot point or anything, there wasn't an overarching story that involved an analysis on in-game religion and moral choices. It was a throwaway line in what is, in my opinion, a mediocre but not terrible story.

It just ruined the series for me, or it made me feel like reading it was a waste of time when stuff like that was included with such little purpose.

Also Unsong is a ‘rational' story that has a lot of stuff about the Bible in it. I liked how religion was handled in that one. I'm not at all religious myself but the way it was all handled in universe was fascinating. The story kind of asks the question of ‘what if the Bible was mostly true' in a world like ours which quickly devolves into the esoteric. I said this already but it really was a fascinating read and is definitely in my top 20.

I don't have any particular problems reading stuff that has ‘religious overtones'. I just... It was so bad in that book I couldn't even anymore. So I've added it to the long list of things I exclude from my search of recommendations.
