Not really - I read Time Braid and have never read Naruto. It mostly explains what you need to know, and there's a good Naruto wiki if you need more background info than it provides. But I didn't enjoy Time Braid as much as many other readers, and unfamiliarity with Naruto probably played a part in that.
