[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] is a Naruto fanfiction centered around time loops. It's fairly popular around here.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] features a protagonist who gradually grows in power, somewhat like Zorian does in Mother of Learning. There's a magic academy arc, but it's not a major part of the story. You may have heard of this one already - it's one of the best works of rational fiction out there - but in case you haven't, I'd highly recommend that you check it out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] resembles HPMOR more than MoL since it's, you know, a Harry Potter fanfiction, but it fits the criteria of being rational and set in a magic academy. It's also hilarious and full of munchkinry. Note that while the first and second "books" are complete, the third one is unfinished and hasn't been updated in over a year.
