What are your top 10 favorite works of fiction?

 

I'm talking about the best of the best that you've seen/read/experienced across any medium whether it's books, movies, tv, anime, video games, web fiction etc anything really. Doesn't have to be rational either. I would like to see what people here like in general and maybe find something new to experience.
