*Hyper Light Drifter* - absolutely gorgeous and immersive. Conveys itself perfectly to the player without the use of written language, which perfectly fits into the "drifter among aliens" concept of the game.

*Hadestown* - never actually seen the musical, just listened to the album, but it remains a favorite to listen to while relaxing.

*My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected.* - absolute guilty pleasure, the most light novel-ish light novel to exist. Still great.

*The Gnoll Credo* - short and packed full of content, really appeals to a minimalistic mindset. Good kick in the pants to read every now and again.

*Helck* - the genre shift to end all genre shifts, all perfectly foreshadowed in a way that makes perfect sense after the fact. Tears and laughter for days.

*Witch Hat Atelier* - medieval-era harry potter in a world of nuanced morality and a bitchin' magic system, and absolutely gorgeous art on every page.

*Dennou Coil* - deceptively slow-paced, absolute gem of a world (google glass + internet wild west = pseudo-supernatural AR shenanigans). Really tries to lull you into boredom then smacks you in the face with the last 6 episodes or so of pure hype.

*Worth the Candle* - gets shilled all the time in here so just read that not this.

*Permutation City* - great on its own merits but also one of the first books that really got me into scifi/fantasy and thus holds extra sentimental value.

*Calgary's Gideon Keys* - not a straightforward recommendation. While the execution is not overly great, the /aesthetic/ of urban supernatural found tales is exactly what I was looking for when I first stumbled across it. Similar to The Holders Series before that community got infested by terminal edge syndrome.
