I feel like The Wandering Inn is underrated. It's got solid character development, distinct character voices, quite consistent worldbuilding---I was rereading the first volume recently and was actually impressed at how much foreshadowing I'd originally dismissed as throwaway fluff---and is just all-round my favorite ongoing text serial right now. I will admit that there's something about that feels guilty pleasurish, but I can't quite pin it and I don't think it fits in that category for me personally.

Homestuck, on the other hand, has plenty of guilt-inducing elements that I'm not going to bother listing, but I also admire it /as a literary work/ for its originality, themes and the raw creativity of the whole work. Its takes on predestination, identity, etc. are interesting and engaging without being preachy. It's something I could see being brought up in a literature class, for its clever use of medium and the sheer ambition of the project if for nothing else.

OPM... it's a good work of fiction. I enjoy reading and watching it, but not as much as some of the others on the list. There are some interesting themes and characters in it, there's an original premise, but that's really the most I can say about it. ONE doesn't impress me as much as Andrew Hussie, and One Punch Man doesn't entertain me as much as the Wandering Inn. It's a guilty pleasure not because of anything wrong with it, but because I can't name anything special about it beyond "I like reading it"---which is perfectly fine, that's the ultimate goal of entertainment media, after all! But if it hadn't been specified "top ten", it wouldn't be on the list at all.
