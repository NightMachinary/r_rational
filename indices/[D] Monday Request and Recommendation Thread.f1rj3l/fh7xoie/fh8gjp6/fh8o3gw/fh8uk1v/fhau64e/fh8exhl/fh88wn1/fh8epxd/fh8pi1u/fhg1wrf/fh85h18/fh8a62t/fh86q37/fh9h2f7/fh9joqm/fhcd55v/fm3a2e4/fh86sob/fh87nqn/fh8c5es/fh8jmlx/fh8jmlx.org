Second Mote in God's Eye (don't forget Jerry Pournelle co-wrote), but found The Gripping Hand deeply underwhelming--like they decided they didn't like the bleakness of the universe they'd set up, so they'd hand-wave their way out of it. Mote, however, is awesome in spite of its being pretty dated by this point. Loved it.
