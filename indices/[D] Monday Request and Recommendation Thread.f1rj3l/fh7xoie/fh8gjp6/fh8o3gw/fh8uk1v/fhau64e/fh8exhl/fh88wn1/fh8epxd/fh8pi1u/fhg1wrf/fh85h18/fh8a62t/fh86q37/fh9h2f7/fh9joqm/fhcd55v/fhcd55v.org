I ended up with more than 10 because you said /any medium/. That sort of loose wording is how you get Professor Moriarty breaking out of a holodeck simulation, you know. Bolded things that I suspect would jive well with this community, conveniently narrowing it down to 10.

Film:

- *The Man From Earth* - Science fiction / philosophy thing consisting of a bunch of people talking in a cabin.
- I'm A Cyborg But That's Okay - Romantic comedy set a mental hospital and the shared delusions of the cast. It's zany, it's sweet.
- Ong Bak - Still my favorite martial arts movie.
- Princess Mononoke - I really enjoy Miyazaki's moral stance, and I think it comes through best here.

Plays / Musicals:

- *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJir5uPRXcM][Into The Woods]]* - Fairy tale deconstruction. Hilarious, bleak.
- *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjKUVK9A7rI][The Pokeon Mewsical]]* - Pokemon parody play. College production, so don't expect the execution to be perfect, but it's still hilarious and gives me warm fuzzy feelings.

Video games:

- Earthbound - The humor and writing in this really are great. I like video games but this is the only one I particularly want to recommend as fiction instead of as a game.

Serial television (mostly anime):

- Battlestar Galactica - I felt like every episode of this was twice as good as the last until midway into the second season. Unfortunately the third and fourth seasons are increasingly a mess due to studio meddling.
- *Ghost In The Shell* - Excellent zig-zagging between transhumanist mysteries and cool action sequences. I think it's at its best when it's doing one-off episodes, and the also-excellent Psycho Pass does a better job of telling a multi-episode story.
- The Eccentric Family - A nuanced, thoughtful look at what it's like to be a magical talking raccoon in modern day Japan.
- *Kino's Journey* - Kino goes on a quiet adventure, visiting towns based on science fiction or philosophy concepts.
- *Shinsekai Yori* - I don't really want to say anything about this. It's certainly a trip.

Serial fiction:

- *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth The Candle]]* - Isekai deconstruction/reconstruction.
- *[[http://daystareld.com/pokemon/][Pokemon: The Origin Of Species]]* - This has displaced HP:MoR for me, I think it's the best version of this concept so far.
- [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] / [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]] - Ward is better, but it's a sequel so start with Worm of course.

Dead tree fiction:

- *[[https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]* - Transhuman space horror. WORDS.
- Hitchhiker's Guide - Timeless sci fi humor. Or I assume it's timeless, it's been decades since I last read this.
- Reaper Man - It's been ages since I read Pratchett, probably outgrew him by now. But he's a lot of fun, I liked his Death series the best, and I liked this the best out of those.

Bullshit:

- *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw][Human History Movie]]* - Hour long well-produced cartoon where the author explains the history of the Earth according to his new age / all conspiracies are true / crank magnetism world view. It's a shame that somebody actually believes this stuff, but taken as a fiction setting it's an amazing alternative to orcs and elves again.
