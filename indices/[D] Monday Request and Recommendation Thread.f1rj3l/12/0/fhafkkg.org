[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] starts with action, and basically never stops. The main character does rarely ever have time to stop and think for even a moment. Reading it all at once actually felt like a slog because of that, but reading along at two chapters or three per week, like the [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep in Pact]] podcast, actually made it really nicely paced.
