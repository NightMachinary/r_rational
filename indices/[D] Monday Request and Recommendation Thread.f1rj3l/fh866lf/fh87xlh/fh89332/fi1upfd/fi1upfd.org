A bit late, but I also read Time Braid before knowing anything about Naruto (or Oh my Goddess) and enjoyed it. However it was very confusing to read Naruto fanfiction later because Time Braid is a rather unique reinterpretation. Generally it really does assume Naruto knowledge, though you can fill in the gaps for most of it. Probably worst of all the climax is a massive Deus Ex Machina without knowing something about Naruto (I was seriously annoyed by it). However you can probably skim the wiki and get the idea.
