That's a question I ask myself all the time. I think right now they are probably, in no particular order:

Worm by Wildbow (aka. John McCrae),

Sufficiently Advanced Magic,

The First 15 Lives of Harry August,

Ra,

14 by Peter Clines,

Delve by SenescentSoul,

My Hero Academia (more for the FF Iv'e imagined. I think you could pack all the anime I've ever watched together into one recommendation. It's fun to watch but generally doesn't leave you with much afterwords. So you could add Sailor Moon, R+V (the manga) and such like Doctor Stone and Naruto. Nothing particularly amazing but, still.),

The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury,

Harry Potter (I loved it when I was a small child, not so much now but it's certainly become a part of who I am),

And perhaps a bottle of all the ‘rational' fiction I've read. Even though a lot of it is self aggrandizing it has a tendency to get you thinking about your own behaviors. I know I act irrationally more often then not and examining the motivation, or lack of, behind my choices is fairy fascinating. That's not a work of fiction though so, perhaps

Doctor Who (though it's dragged on, as it tends too, and I've neglected to watch the recent episodes. Much like HP, it has become a remnant of my youth.)

And there is a dossier on my interests. I wonder how much I've revealed about myself on reddit...

tl;dr - Read ‘The First 15 Lives of Harry August by Claire North'. It's a fairly high quality piece of fiction revolving around what reality might be like if certain individuals lived their lives over and over again.
