Not in any order, author given where it would otherwise be ambiguous:

- The Comonweal series by Graydon Saunders
- The Craft series by Max Gladstone
- Blindsight
- The Northern Caves
- Steven Brust's Dragaera books
- Most things by Zelazny (Amber, Lord of Light, Night in the Lonesome October)
- The Culture (especially Use of Weapons)
- Homestuck (Including Act Omega, the Epilogues, but none of the other material)
- Unsong
- Even Further Beyond (SV quest)
- EDIT: In the Wake of the Dawn (a stunningly atmospheric CYOA with fantastic lore, subtly conveyed)
