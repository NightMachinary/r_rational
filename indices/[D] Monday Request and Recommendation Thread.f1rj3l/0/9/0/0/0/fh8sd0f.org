I think this is part of the author really making an effort to add humor and 'slice of life' elements that create atmosphere. A lot of authors just skim by that to keep everything tight and related to the plot, but pirateaba isn't afraid to let characters breath for a bit.

There's something really special about their style, and a great understanding over writing.
