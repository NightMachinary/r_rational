Its a different book, yes. Not written around a single concept, eg deep time malthusian trap but really a character study and homage to oriental culture. His Excellence, Trader Magnate Horace Hussein Al Bury is one of my favourite characters to date. The focus of the book, much more political and still bursting with suspense.
