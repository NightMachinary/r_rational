In no particular order:

1.  [Book] *Master and Margarita*, I really feel like this is a book which is /perfect/ at what it does. I couldn't think of a single thing that could be improved.

2.  [Book] *HPMoR*. I kinda see why people might dislike it, but for me, this was a life-changing book.

3.  [Series] *BoJack Horseman*, which has /by far/ the best representation of mental illnesses in all of television. Watching it is probably my most painfully relatable experience with media.

4.  [Webcomic] *Romantically Apocalyptic*. It's a pleasure for eyes, and I really enjoy deciphering the highly cryptic plot, much more so than in Homestuck, for comparison.

5.  [Videogame] *Factorio*. More like Cracktorio, amiright?

6.  [Manga] *Made In Abyss*. Haunting and engaging, and damn if it's not the most beautiful manga I've ever seen.

7.  [Book] *Atlas Shrugged*. Before you skin me alive for having the worst taste in reading ever, I'd like to note that I recognize all its flaws and like it because it's something /I could've written/ when I was 16. Down to the mistakes, to the characterization, to the plot points, to the ideas, to the style... I read it and was amazed at how /young me/ this book was. It's the nostalgia of the highest caliber, and nothing has ever come close.

8.  [Web Original] *CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good*. I like it for reasons that can't be disclosed, and if you aren't familiar with this story, please don't try to learn more---just go ahead and read it. Literally once-in-a-lifetime experience.

9.  [Videogame] *Baba Is You*, the best puzzle game I've ever played.

10. Several well-written shipping fics that provided amazing emotional feedback loop. Guilty pleasure, so I really see no reason to list them by names.
