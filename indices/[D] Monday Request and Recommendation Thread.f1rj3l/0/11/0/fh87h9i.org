The Belgariad was so good as a kid, but impossibly cliche as an adult. The sequel series was worse though.

Also it kinda helped that my school library was missing a book in the series (the second I think?) and I didn't realize you could, you know, /buy/ books, so the events of that story were a mystery to me for half a decade, like some sort of inside joke the characters had without me.
