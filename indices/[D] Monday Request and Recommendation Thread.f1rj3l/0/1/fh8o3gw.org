1. *The Mysterious Island* by Jules Verne. During the time American Civil War, little group of people end up on crashing on a tropical island, where they survive using mostly their bare skills. When I've read it for a first time at 6, it was astonished. But whats more important, when I re-read it to my son when I was 30, I still found the book enjoying, which is a very rare thing for fiction books I've read through my life - most of them you just overgrow in due time.
2. *HPMOR*. It was really a life-changing book. No less, no more.
3. *Mother of Learning*, by [[https://www.patreon.com/nobody103][Domagoj Kurmaic]] aka nobody103. Lots of info about it here on Reddit, so I presume, no additional comments needed.
4. *The Arithmancer* trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]]. Harry Potter fanfic, but centered around Hermione, who, opposed to original books, is really smart, and not kinda-smart-by-plot. Also, with a very strong dramatic part.
5. *Worth the Candle* - its still in progress, but there are huge amounts of text already, and it is really good. It has its weak spots, but overall - its great.
6. *Age of the dead* trilogy by Andrey Kruz, russian writer and ex-military officer. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018, and there are no translations and the moment. However, this is a wonderful zombie-apocalypse-themed books with a protagonists that make rational decisions. I mean, not /always smart/, but /rational./ So, they are mostly ordinary people, but without plot armor or plot-induced-stupidity. Also, the zombies are slightly more complex than usual dumb and slow walking targets, which win only because of protagonists' plot-induced stupidity.

These a books, that I /will/ eventualy re-read. Of course, there are lots of books, that I've already read more than once, but most of them I will not read again - the life is not infinite, and there's so much more to read.
