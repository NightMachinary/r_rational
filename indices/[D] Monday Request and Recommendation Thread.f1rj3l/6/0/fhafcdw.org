Mostly crossovers with Worm:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/familiar-pact-worm.629776/][Familiar]] has Taylor die during the Cell arc, and be summoned from the Abyss by Molly Walker. Not dead according to the author's beta reader.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mans-one-shots-and-snippets-worm.624913/#post-51845468][The Barber]] by the same author - three chapters of Taylor triggering with the Barber's powerset.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/#post-54733534][Aspects]], still the same guy: Four-way fusion of Worm, Pact, Twig, and Harry Potter, with the post-canon protagonists of each work being inserted at the start of Hogwarts in a slightly different HP-world which seems to slowly be merging with the Pact universe.

More recommendations in [[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/d6zx5g/fireborn_pact_destiny_crossover/][this]] thread, but the only really good one which had an actual story was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10888845/1/Knights-of-Broken-Swords][Knights of Broken Swords]], which has Blake from during the Lordship Contest of Jacob's Bell end up in Dresden Files to assist Butters with a side mission.
