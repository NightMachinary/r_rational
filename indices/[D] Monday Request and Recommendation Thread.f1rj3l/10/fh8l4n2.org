What creators have y'all started supporting on Patreon or a Patreon-like system? (Though ofc if you list too many people might be able to figure out your account, so be careful)

[[https://www.patreon.com/Macronomicon/][Macronomicon's Patreon]] is one I particularly like - Wake of the Ravager is being run in a way that's almost like an inverse quest, with the author asking people for ability suggestions and then the character picking them.
