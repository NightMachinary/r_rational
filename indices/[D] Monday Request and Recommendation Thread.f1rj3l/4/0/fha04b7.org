[[https://tiraas.net/][The Gods are Bastards]] can maybe be described as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ekv9s8/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fdhjx2r/][an anti-Worm]] in terms of tone. It's a pretty straightforward Fantasy, but mixes things up by questioning /why/ a fantasy world might exist, and what might happen if it started to go through an industrial revolution. The biggest draw here is the characters, who are excellent, and there's a lot of them. This is currently ongoing, with a mostly consistent update schedule. It doesn't come at things from a rational angle, but the characters act consistently and generally rationally, the world is internally consistent, and it hits enough of the same themes to be relevant to the same audience, I think. I also think it deserves more support and viewership, so try it out.

[[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]] is an excellent LitRPG - but instead of becoming the hero, the main character instead decides to run an inn. Starts off a bit slow, but is currently one of the most engaging web serials I follow, with an extremely well thought-out setting and a wonderful cast of characters, along with very good writing. This is currently ongoing, in its sixth book with a consistent (and extremely robust) update schedule.
