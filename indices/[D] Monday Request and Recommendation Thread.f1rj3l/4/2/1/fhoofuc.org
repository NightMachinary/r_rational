The former emperor kept multiple wives for diplomatic reasons. The protagonist is the son of wife number four (married to cement relationship with the goblins) and sent off be out of sight and out of mind, which means he both /doesn't/ die in the highly suspicious accident that thins out the line of heirship, and is also about the only living member of the family that cannot possibly have set it up. Cue coronation. Remarkable mostly for being extremely conscientious about his new job, and pretty good at it despite a pretty significant social handicap (IE; being half goblin in a pretty fecking racist empire. ). Very good book.
