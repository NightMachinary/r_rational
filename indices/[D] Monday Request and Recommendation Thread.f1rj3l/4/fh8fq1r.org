Can anyone recommend to me some interesting works of â€˜rational fiction'? Assume I've read all the popular ones (Ra, 14, Sufficiently Advanced Magic Series, Into the Labyrinth, Metropolitan Man, MoL, HPMoR, N20, the Martian, Wildbow's Stuff, Delve, He Who Fights Monsters, Life Reset (was terrible, don't read it) etc. etc.).

LitRPGs, gamelit, etc. are also a genre I'm trying to find more of. Most of what I've read has either been translated so badly it results in immediate unimmersion, someone patting themself on the back for being special in a world specifically created for them, has uncomfortable and unnecessary religious undertones, frankly ridiculous or contrived premises, HaReMs, polygamy, wanton violence, terrible writing, cOnTriVeD premises, etc.

I'm despairing of finding any more vaguely quality content to feed my boredom.

Help me. Please.
