[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-1][Lord of the Mysteries]]. English TL just finished up to Vol 4, which is my personal favourite.

The MC woke up as a forced suicide victim in a Lovecraft-inspired world (among other things like SCP, Bloodborne, steampunk fantasy Victorian England) and realised within the first 10 chapters that he's not the first to be kidnapped to that world due to some anachronistic things all invented 100+ years ago by an "amazing inventor" Emperor.

Be warned that it's a translated from Chinese work and the word choices by the translator is a bit weird. Still a high 7/10 work with excellent plot and atmosphere.
