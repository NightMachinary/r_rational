The only other xanxia I have found that I liked almost as much as Cradle was Street Cultivation. Someone else on this sub described it as xanxia + capitalism, and it's set in a much more "modern" world than most xanxia. Book 1 is available on Amazon, and book II is currently updating on Royal Road.

The only criticism I have of it is that the main character looks at everything a bit too...coldly? Maybe? Not sure how to describe it, but it results in him not really seeming entirely like a real person. This is partially due to his absolute laser focus on cultivation/advancement/etc. which is sort of a staple of the genre, but there is just something that very subtly yet consistently triggers my "would a real person really react like that/think that?" reflex. But even with that criticism, I still thing that overall the characters are well written and the dialogue is mostly pretty good, including the MC. If you liked Cradle, I'm pretty sure you will like Street Cultivation.
