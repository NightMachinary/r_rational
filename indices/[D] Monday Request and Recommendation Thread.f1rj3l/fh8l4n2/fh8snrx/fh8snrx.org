Basically just [[https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow][Wildbow]] and [[https://www.patreon.com/doofmedia][Doof Media]], who do a lot of media analysis and discussion, but mainly I listen to their [[https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-ward/][We've Got Ward]] and [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep in Pact]] podcasts. Recently they also acquired [[https://www.doofmedia.com/we-want-mor/][We Want MoR]], I've been slowly going through those episodes.

Wildbow's patreon is entirely empty, he puts everything he does out for free. On Doof Media, there are a bunch of things attached - their Discord, for example, some bonus podcasts, and being eligible to vote in their fanart/costume contests, or voting for the next month's book discussion subject.
