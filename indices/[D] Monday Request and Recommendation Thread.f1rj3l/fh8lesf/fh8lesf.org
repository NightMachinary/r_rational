[[https://myanimelist.net/manga/5820/Sumire%E2%99%A116-sai][Sumire 16-Sai!!]] is a story about a kind, upbeat, and outgoing high school girl, who withstands the bullying and derision of her classmates with a cheery smile. She's also a ventriloquist puppet controlled by a middle age man who never, ever, breaks character. This is obvious to all the students and staff at the school, except for the headmaster, who is evidently the only person to believe in Sumire.

This manga was surreal, hilarious, and oddly touching. 8/10
