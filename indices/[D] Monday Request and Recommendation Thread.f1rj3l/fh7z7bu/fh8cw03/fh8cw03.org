How necessary is the -hobo part? [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]'s protagonist Sylvester is more readily classified as a state-sponsored terrorist in a biopunk 1920ies, where the Frankenstein experiments enabled the British Crown to conquer the world with zombie armies. Him and his group of friends are kid experiments, used as spies and assassins to hunt down dissenters and rebels. The webserial is their coming-of-age story.

Sylvester in particular is infamous for his convoluted plots and plans, which usually end with him hurt and his opponent dead or worse.
