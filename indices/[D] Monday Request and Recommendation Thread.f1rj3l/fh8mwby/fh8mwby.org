Just finished Unsong. Somehow it had been in my to-read pile for ages and I'd completely missed any mention that it's funny. Unsong is very funny. Also it's pretty good overall, and the first book of it is great. Though later on I feel like it's weighed down by under-using some of its best characters and relationships. Overall, best summary is this quote by [[/u/NotACauldronAgent]] in one of the comment threads: “That is both really clever and the stupidest thing I ever heard.”

Sports recommendation: bouldering has a lot more puzzle-solving elements than I expected, and is actually pretty videogamey. Would recommend if you're looking for physical activity and it's available in your area.

Rec request: Looking for a short, archetypical xianxia story. Good writing would be a plus, but being short is a substitute. Doesn't have to be rational or deconstructionist at all. I'd like to know more about what this genre is and whether I like it before starting to read something with 40,000 chapters.
