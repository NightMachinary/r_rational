I'm not sure there are /any/ short Xianxia stories. They're essentially almost entirely about rising from the bottom rung of the cosmic power ladder to the very top, and whilst that often happens unreasonably fast by the standards of the other characters, it takes a very large wordcount.

I can only recommend on the basis of quality.

- Reverend Insanity's been pretty good (with an amoral protagonist, mind.)
- The first time I tried to read Forty Milleniums of Cultivation I couldn't get past chapter two. The second time I picked it up and read the whole 1700 chapters - it's easily my favourite Xianxia novel. It subverts several Xianxia tropes but II don't think you have to be familiar with them to appreciate them.
