I guess there's Chrysalis, an English web novel where the MC reincarnates into an ant monster, the weakest monster there is. Pretty good actually, if you can ignore the MC's occasional bout of stupidity.

Of course there's also So I'm a Spider, So What?, where the MC reincarnates into a weak spider monster. One of the best out there.

Honestly I just call that genre monster reincarnation. The weakest organism they reincarnate into is always some weak monster that even other weak fodder monsters can easily beat, and it's fun to watch them go against the odds and go from a weakling to a walking cataclysm. It's hard to find other such novels, there's very few examples of it, and most of them end up being terribly written too.
