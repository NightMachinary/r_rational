Lately I've had an itch for what I'm going to call "overwhelming odds isekai". A protagonist ends up in a world or siituation where the bottom rung of the food chain is still about ten rungs higher than them and only survives^{\}) through luck, time loop shenanigans or being amazingly careful.

[[https://thesnekreport.com/][The Snake Report]] is my favourite (and also only) example of this (made up) genre. Person gets reincarnated as a tiny snake in an everything-eat-snake world and survives mostly due to luck and resourcefulness. And the mercy of the tiny snake god.

I'd appreciate any recommendations or nudges towards the real name of this genre, if there is one!

^{\}Survival of the protagonist is not necessarily a requirement, but I imagine a story where the protagonist permanently dies in the first two lines would be rather short. (And very funny))
