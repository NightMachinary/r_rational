Sort of difficult to come up with any examples from mainstream media, and even with rationalist fiction few characters actually come close to my particular disposition.\\
So I can say I've /occasionally/ identified with characters in rational fiction, but never for more than a single moment wherein their thinking/behavior was similar to what mine would be in that same situation.
