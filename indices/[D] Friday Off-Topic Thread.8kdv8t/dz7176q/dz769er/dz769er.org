Only twice have I ever identified with characters in a movie.

The first time brought me to tears. Edward from Edward Scissorhands. His complete lack of knowledge of social cues and inability to communicate well with others really struck home with me. Im always left sobbing at the end when he's forced to live in the mansion all alone with no one to care about him. It just hits me on a base level by magnifying all my fears and self image.

On a more comical note. Marty from The Cabin in the Woods. Im not really a stoner but all the ways he reacts to everything going on around him is how I would react, which is totally the point of his character. Also, that inevitable acceptance of failure at the end is me too.
