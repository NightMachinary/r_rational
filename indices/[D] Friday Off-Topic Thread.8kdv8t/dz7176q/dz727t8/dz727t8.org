I think my answers have to be /Fight Club/ and /The Matrix/, though those are super embarrassing answers. I was 13 years old in 1999, when both those movies came out, which probably tells you everything you need to know about why I would see myself in the protagonists of those movies.

It's much more common for me to have the "this speaks to me and of me in a way that nothing else does" for books though, which I think is usually the direction that people are gesturing in when they talk about "representation".
