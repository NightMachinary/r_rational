I tried to come up with a mathematical rule using the net scores, but nothing I thought of was satisfactory.

So, crowd-sourcing...

How about you randomly select some number of challenges, then for each of those you ask the winning author to name their favorite personal submission for any challenge? I imagine authors remember their own stories quite well and are capable of ranking them by quality.

This means a story won't be excluded from the running just because it didn't win or it won an unpopular contest--it just requires that the author won at some point and likes that story more than their winning story. Beyond that, this weights on victories and thus more accurately reflects how favorably the community views that author's work. Popularity is still a factor, but it's popularity of author rather than specific topic or story.

If someone is unreachable you can just go with their highest scoring entry, or choose a different challenge, or you could read all their stories and try to choose the best one. Even without responses this method significantly reduces the amount of reading you have to do.
