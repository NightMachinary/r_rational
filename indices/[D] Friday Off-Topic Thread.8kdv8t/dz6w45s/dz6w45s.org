We're coming up on [[http://reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][three years of the (bi)weekly challenge]], and I've been trying to think about how I want to do a "best of" compilation. I've read /most/ of the stories, but don't remember them well enough to just make a list from memory. I also don't want to just have a list of winners, because we've already got that.

I've been trying to think about the pros and cons of different algorithmic methods I might use. Reddit doesn't expose upvotes vs. downvotes, just net votes, which means using the Bayesian formula for "best" is probably out. I don't want to do it by net votes, because that's sort of dependent on how popular the topic was, rather than the distinct qualities of the story (and I wouldn't want to penalize someone who wrote a fantastic story about a prompt that few people were interested in reading about based on the prompt alone).

Is there any way out of just doing simple human curation of a list? Because I don't think that I have the time to do that much rereading. Crowd-sourcing?
