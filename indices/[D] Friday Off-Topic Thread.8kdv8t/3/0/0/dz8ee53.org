It is probably worth considering the controversies around whether immigration courts actually follow due process. The justice department can review every ruling, judges can be fired for not working fast enough, and many defendants are not guaranteed legal counsel.

The law may place the burden of proof on the government, but the legal system is heavily biased in their favor and frequently incentivizes delivering a guilty verdict as soon as possible with relatively little evidence. That's all before taking into account the biases of the lawyers and judges.
