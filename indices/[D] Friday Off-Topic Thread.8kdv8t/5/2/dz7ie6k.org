I've never felt "represented" in a movie, even as a straight (well, /mostly/ straight) white male. The closest I've ever come to feeling "represented" in a work of fiction was HPMOR. I looked at HJPEV and remembered the person I was at ages 7 and 8 and 9, and I saw what I could've been if the confidence and curiosity hadn't been bullied out of me in middle school.
