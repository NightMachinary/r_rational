I think I'm the kind of person who would not like the tabletop RPG [[https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/invisible-sun-preorder/][Invisible Sun]]. The mechanics don't serve my kind of fun, the setting is so weird that I don't know how to create anything with it, and the story demands an imagination that is utterly beyond the scope of mine.

The game is like Harry Potter meets The Matrix with the aesthetic of a surrealist version of 1920s Paris, but loses me when it turns out to be explicitly anti-rational. It's a pretentious Changeling Fantasy where the “real world” actually runs on mysteries with vague answers and unknowable magic, but does not defy the culture of wealthy white privilege that these ideas are a product of.

However, I freaking love the people who play this game. I want to have that kind of whimsical love of creating mysteries for the sake of being mysteries and imagining life in a weird fantasy world in my life. Seeing that magic in others is enrapturing and I just want to experience the act of weaving that magic with them. The escapism is meaningful to them and that resonates with me.

I don't think I wish I was the kind of person who loved the game since I associate that mentality with my New Age pseudoscience/conspiracy theorist-believing teenage self. Uncovering the magical secrets of reality isn't escapist fun for me, it's a painful reminder of something I used to believe and the real life horror of anti-science cults.

So the distance I get from listening to podcasts like [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3-PonsBj4qPT1FNluLQCj9bIPy-9bHns][A Woman With Hollow Eyes]], especially when they are better at straddling the line between fantasy and reality than I was, is something I never knew I wanted. I want to follow everything that happens in the community of Invisible Sun so I can keep exploring this side of myself in a safe space.
