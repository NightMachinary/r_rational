My depression has been really kicking my ass. So much so that Ive had to withdraw from most of my classes to try and work on me. I'll be taking up a full time job to keep myself occupied and out and about. But what really worsens things is when I have time to just think. I want to work on building up a solid base of self esteem before I try to go back to school though.

What are some hobbies that are easy to pick up and improve in? I have piano and woodworking for the summer but I'd like a variety of suggestions as the main symptom of my depression is overwhelming apathy. I tend to lose interest in things incredibly quickly due to my ADHD and the depression is making it worse.
