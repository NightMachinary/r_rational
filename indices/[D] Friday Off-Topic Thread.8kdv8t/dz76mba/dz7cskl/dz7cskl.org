Juggling worked for me. The initial hump is being able to juggle three balls, which should take less than a week, and maybe as little as a day. After that, there are always new tricks to learn. I find that it takes just enough attention that I can have something on in the background (television or podcasts). It's also good for both indoors and outdoors, and there are usually juggling organizations if you're in a mid-sized city. Pretty cheap too, until you start getting specialist equipment.
