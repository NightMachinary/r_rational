In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has the burden of proof to prove alienage. If they can't prove that you're an alien, then the immigration judge will let you go. In the interim, you'll either be out on an immigration bond, or maybe without needing a bond at all, though DHS/ICE will still be keeping track of you.

I don't know how good interdepartmental cooperation is, especially across national lines, but if they suspected that you were from country X, they would probably try to obtain records from there. They would also look at your records within the United States, where they were either available, or could be obtained by warrant.

In theory, you wouldn't be sent to a random country, because the government wouldn't be able to pass the burden of proof that you're actually an alien. You'd need to dig into the case law to find the edges of what's accepted as passing that burden though.
