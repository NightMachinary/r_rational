Say you've traveled/moved to a country without jumping through the required hoops and obtaining the necessary paperwork, and are discovered and detained by that country's immigration law enforcement agency. They want to deport you to your country of origin. If you refuse to disclose that information to them -- how do they figure out where to send you? Maybe you claim you've lived here all your life, but have kept to yourself (so there's little corroborating evidence). Would they ballpark it off language/accent? What if your speech is identical to that of a local native speaker? Would they just hold you indefinitely? Send you to a country with very lax immigration policy? What? Can't seem to find a definitive (country-specific) answer on google.
