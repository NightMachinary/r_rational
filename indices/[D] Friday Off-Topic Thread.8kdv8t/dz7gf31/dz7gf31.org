Guys, Beat Saber is /crazy/ good. I got it last Friday and played it every day since except one.

Doing so has actually been a very interesting exercise in watching how I learn. This was a mostly novel experience (I have a handful of other VR games and played Guitar Hero once) that has a good learning curve and utilizes skills that I mostly haven't ever had need to improve (swinging an invisible lightsaber around). It involves a good mix of both high-level coordination ("here comes X formation, need to be sure to get my left hand up in time") and low-level interaction (I can't tell you the number of times that it felt like my arms were moving on their own).

I'm /pretty/ sure (although this could easily be confirmation bias) that I noticed an inherent difference in the way that I could optimally use both right and left arms (I am right handed). When focused on the right hand I would typically do better with that hand, but when I focused on the left it would do /worse/. Focusing back on the right hand would lead to inexplicably accurate left hand usage, if a bit slow and clumsy. This made me think a lot about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8][CGP Grey's "You are Two" video]] about the apparently independent and competent right brain hemisphere, and I wonder how much that has to do with it.

In addition to the apparent competence of the unconscious right brain in particular, this concept sort of applies in general as well. I'm a fairly sedentary person, and playing a very active game for an hour or so every day was a big shift for me. After playing four days in a row, I noted that when I tried to play more I was sluggish and couldn't bring myself to improve speed any further. So I took a day off, figuring that my body needed additional resting time to make up for the change of focus, but coming back to it yesterday gave me a bit of a surprise: not only were my limbs back in working order, but I was able to sit down and complete all five or so Expert levels that so far had /completely/ stonewalled me. And it was /easy/, more or less; 1 try for three of them and only 2 for the other two.

I was left wondering how exactly I had made such a big leap, and I think it has something to do with the rest and giving my brain a chance to encode--it was apparently enough not only for me to have been able to practically master all the sections that I had tried and failed at previously, but the competence to smash the parts that I /hadn't/ played yet either. I was struck with the realization that, as in a lot of ways the brain is a manager or director of the body rather than a master of it, I, me, the algorithm or pattern or layer or whathaveyou that emerges from the brain is only a director of it in part--there are parts that apparently play video games better than I do, and letting them do so is actually somehow a better strategy than me taking the wheel.
