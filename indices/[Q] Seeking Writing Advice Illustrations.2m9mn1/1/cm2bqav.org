If you have access to it, I find that "[[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62031.The_City_of_Dreaming_Books][The City of Dreaming Books]]" handles pictures pretty good. I'm at work now, so I can't check, but I believe it shows new characters being introduced (and the fact that the characters universally look weird makes that a great help), but also complex structures. The book has a lot of weird environments (giant libraries, a house in the skull of a cyclops, a cave full of flying fish, a hollowed-out mountain...) and it helped me visualize the story and the action.

So basically: characters, and places people might not have seen themselves.
