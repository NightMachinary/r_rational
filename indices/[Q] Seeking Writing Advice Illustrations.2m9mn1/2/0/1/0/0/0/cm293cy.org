  This is all speculative.

After having read Scott McCloud's "Understanding/Making/Etcing Comics" books, I have a strong suspicion (~30% confidence) that inline images are heavily underused in modern adult fiction, possibly due to publishing economics or publisher culture. Since I don't have to worry about my book being printed on the same presses as hundreds of other titles, those reasons aren't a concern for me - so I have an opinion that my story is much more likely to be improved than harmed by adding imagery.

  If you want people to keep reading you'll need to have a compelling story with characters people want to follow. All of the interest must come from the writing.

I've been planning on the text of the story being worth reading on its own since I started; but that doesn't mean I can't try to leverage as much added value as possible from other aspects, from font choice on up.
