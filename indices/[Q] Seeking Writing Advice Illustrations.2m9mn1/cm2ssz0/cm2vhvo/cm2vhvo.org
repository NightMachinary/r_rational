Hee - that's almost exactly the phrasing, and very much the method, I've ended up using when talking to artists about my earlier, furry/hard-SF setting, "New Attica". (Hm... I wonder if any economists have studied the "DeviantArt/FurAffinity/SoFurry/InkBunny/Weasyl/etc" commission micro-economy? It can't be a very efficient economy, what with the lack of information in finding artists who might be willing to draw your particular description of a sparrow-mouse micro-griffon, let alone enough to be able to compare prices, which might mean there's room to snag some cash by coming up with better ways to facilitate such transactions...)

However, for my current project, the artist in question has English as a second language, and I'm not expecting them to try to read through 200,000+ words of story to pick out their favorite items.
