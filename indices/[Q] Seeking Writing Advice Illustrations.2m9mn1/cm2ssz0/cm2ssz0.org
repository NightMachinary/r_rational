I haven't done this /particular/ thing, but in general I find that when in doubt dealing with a creative worker the best thing to do is to discuss it with them and let them take the lead to choose what would excite them the most. (You should still communicate any constraints and preferences that you know you have. The idea is to constrain such that you'll be happy with most things that fall within the constraints, and to communicate just enough that you remove the tendency to "play it safe" under uncertainty from the artist's perspective).
