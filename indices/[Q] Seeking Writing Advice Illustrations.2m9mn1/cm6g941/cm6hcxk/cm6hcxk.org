Map-wise, I'm at least partly tempted to find a present-day paper road map, which covers at least Toledo to Rochester, including Toronto to the north and Cleveland in the south, and taking a picture of that. (Digitally adding torn edges, aging, weathering, and arrows pointing to off-map areas (Montreal, Acadia, Pittsburgh, Phoenix) optional.)
