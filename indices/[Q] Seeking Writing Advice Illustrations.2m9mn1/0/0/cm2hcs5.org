When I imagine your points put together, I like the style that results. I'm not convinced it's the best style, but it's not a bad one, and I could do a lot worse than working with it.

In addition, it made me recall another genre of books that can do well with illustrations: choose-your-own-adventure books, and related game books such as Lone Wolf. Just flipping through such books, even with everything scrambled out of order, you could still get a very good feel of the atmosphere.

Oddly enough, I've already suggested this approach to the artist I'm currently exchanging messages with. It seems to go well with the story being a first-person narrative.
