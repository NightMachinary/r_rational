In my personal opinion:

- Images should always be between chapters - never within a scene, and probably not breaking up scenes within a chapter.
- Images should be either small, simple, or both - enough that you can stop and look at it for a few seconds after a chapter ends, but you don't want to stop the reader in their tracks.
- Images should be /suggestive/. Suggestion engages the mind and pushes a person to seek more information. If your images are leading the chapters, each image should raise some question or evoke some mystery that makes the reader want to dive in. There are hundreds of tricks here, some of them cheaper (and more effective) than others. Just the picture of a broken window at the start of a chapter will leave the reader wondering when that's going to happen within the chapter. In other words, the image shouldn't be a thesis statement, it should be a tease - an enticement.

I've always liked the way that the Harry Potter books did this. The /Stormlight Archives/ also do something similar, though often it's used for exposition (of a sort) showing fighting styles or varieties of armor that would be laborious to describe. These images all exist in-universe, taken from a sketchbook of one of the main characters or otherwise as some kind of document or something, which I think is clever and helps to keep the reader grounded in the story.
