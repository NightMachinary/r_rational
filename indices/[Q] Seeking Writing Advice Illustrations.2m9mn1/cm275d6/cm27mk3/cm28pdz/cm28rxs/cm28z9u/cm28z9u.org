Then we need to get the marketing department in on this ;)

I don't think people generally read 'not picture books' for the pictures. I feel illustrations do something more on the lines of increasing production value, as it were. While they do make the reading more pleasurable, I don't think they will do anything to hold the reader base. This is all speculative.

If you want people to keep reading you'll need to have a compelling story with characters people want to follow. All of the interest must come from the writing. Otherwise I doubt people will gain anything about rationality from it.
