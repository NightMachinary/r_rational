Not many people post to this subreddit, but there are a bunch of readers who come here. This makes it easy for one person to start a trend. Recently, the sub started shifting more toward Worm fanfics. Now it's ponies again. The pony fics are pretty well entrenched in this sub's history, actually. We've got [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] and other [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/folder/4096/canon-compatible-optimalverse?order=rating][Optimalverse]] stories like [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Caelum Est Conterrens]]. Then there are a bunch of stories where the authors just happened to be in the LessWrong group, which resulted in stories like [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal][Mortal]] and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]]. There are more, but you get the point.
