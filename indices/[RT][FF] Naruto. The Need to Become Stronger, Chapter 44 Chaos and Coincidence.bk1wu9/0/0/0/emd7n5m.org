Haha, true enough, but it's not like I'm seriously depressed or dying here. I actually did have a couple chapters more or less ready when I dropped off, and I *just* promised everyone I would do regular updates before suddenly vanishing, so I think a little self-flagellation is appropriate here. :)

Also, I'm pretty sure that if you're a writer you're supposed to beat yourself up 100% of the time no matter what. It's a whole thing with artsy types, don't ask me why. :p
