I'm really sorry, guys. A hiatus is one thing, but I've always hated authors who just leave without saying anything, so I'm doubly sorry for being that guy. I suspect I'll have lost a lot of readers, but thank you to everyone who stuck around waiting this long - especially the people who sent messages urging me to continue (even though I wasn't using Reddit and didn't see them until now). You guys are way better than I deserve. >_<
