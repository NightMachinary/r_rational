Chronic goodguyness, it's a thing! Also, even though this Kakashi is a bit more cynical, he was still raised by the Fourth with the idea that they have to fight back against the darkness of the world, so he feels like he has to try. Also also, he believes that the /real/ enemy is still out there, so fighting her doesn't really accomplish anything in his mind.
