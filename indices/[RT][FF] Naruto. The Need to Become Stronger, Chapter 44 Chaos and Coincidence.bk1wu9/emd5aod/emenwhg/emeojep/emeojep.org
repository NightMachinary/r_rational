Thanks! I'm glad you like the mastermind plot - I've been worrying that I haven't set it up properly since there's been little speculation about it on the whole. I'm writing a separate post for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] on that topic, actually.

Naruto and Sasuke were training with the Sand Siblings before, but last chapter it was revealed that they hadn't shown up to that day's meeting yet (because they were training with Lee and he has a ridiculous training schedule) and so the Sand Sibs were just with Shikamaru and co when the fighting started. I'm not going to spoil anything else in case you missed that chapter, but I would really read it if you haven't already because it's a good one. :)
