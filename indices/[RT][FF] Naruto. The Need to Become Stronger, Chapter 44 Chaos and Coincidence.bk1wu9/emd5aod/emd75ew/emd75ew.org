What do you mean, the loss of your job and illness are a terrible excuse for putting an unpaid writing project on hold? That's ridiculous self-flagellation.

Even if you consider writing fiction your one true calling, you can expect to write more and better fiction if you stay in good health and not live in poverty. Those are essential instrumental goals, geez.
