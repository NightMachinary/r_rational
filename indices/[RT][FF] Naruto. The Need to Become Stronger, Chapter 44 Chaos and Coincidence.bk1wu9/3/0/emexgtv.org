For the entire story??? No way, that would take a full team of voice actors and even then it'd take way too much time. I think most people would much prefer I focus on writing instead. I did tape myself reading a few passages of NTBS though, just for fun. Here's me doing the Kyubi:

And a reading of Fire and Ice, just to see if I can:

Anyway, if you want me to read a specific passage I can give it a shot, but overall I think I'd better stick with writing :)
