Nah. You've made it so that various characters have discussed or thought about it in ways that feel natural. You havent forced it into the plot or had the plot go around it, which is hard to execute but wonderful when done properly.

The only issue I could see is that characters think of similarities far apart in time and connect them easily but that is brushed aside because youve made everyone sufficiently clever. No one seems to be level 1 intelligent but level 2 or higher. Everyone is paranoid for decent reasons and are used to playing the game on multiple levels so they are used to looking for underlying pattern connections.

Im eagerly awaiting for the moment they actually discuss this underlying pattern and the moment the master plan is revealed. Youve engendered my trust as a reader, I just hope you dont burn yourself out. Make sure you prioritize your health and stability okay?

And youre right. I merged the last two chapters before this one in my head together. Probably because the Sasuke blitzing Naruto moment was so prominent in my mind.
