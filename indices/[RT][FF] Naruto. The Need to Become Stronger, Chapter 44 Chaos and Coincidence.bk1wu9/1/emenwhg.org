I am absolutely LOVING this in depth connection of all the past events. Especially since it seems that whoever directed the 4ths death is having their plan slowly unfurled to all the MCs.

Ive always adored mastermind plots and I have high expectations of this.

Forgive me if Im wrong but I thought Naruto and Sasuke were with the Sand Siblings the previous few chapters. Did I miss a transition?
