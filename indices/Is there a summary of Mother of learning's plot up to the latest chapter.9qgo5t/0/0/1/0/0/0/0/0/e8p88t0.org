Yeah that's a point, they had a decent amount of time from learning Zorian wouldn't loop.

Zach had been relying pretty heavily on the orb for memories, which is broken this loop, not sure if it would retain memories if it was broken, but I can't think why it wouldn't

So he really only needs to know the Koth gate.

I think Zorians memory mods' where pretty high level mind work, rather than structured spells. He specifically made them from the spiders work which was more native mind magic than the human spell work.

Not to say Zach couldn't have, but with the orb, and expecting to get out I doubt Zach would have overcome his bias against mind magic to use it.

My bet on Zorian trying to overcome the mind blank is so he can solo the lich, as they need quite a setup in their favour otherwise, something they are unlikely to get with the two hostile loopers out there, RR and Silverlake.
