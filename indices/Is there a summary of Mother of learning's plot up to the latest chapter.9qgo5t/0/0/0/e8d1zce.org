  Quatach-Ichl expects the angels to do what they can to keep the primordial bound
#+end_quote

It's actually slightly different, he expects his plan to free the Primordial to work, but he expects the angels to dramatically limit the damage that happens once it escapes. He humorously thinks that the separation of the material and spiritual planes means that he will have an easier time freeing the primordial, not that it is a symptom of a scheme to stop him.
