I'm pretty sure they mentioned the gate was re-unbarred before the bridge was attempted, but with an avatar of Pax breaking in, and an anomaly breaking out, who knows what the Guardian's response would be.

Biggest problem if Zach needs the key to prove for permissions again, is that he hasn't been able to solo the lich. They always cheesed the surprise dispel into the lich being rusty at mind magic.

So Zach has 12 (13?) loops to work out how to do that, with the additional challenge that I bet it was Zorian who memorized the gate address for the spiders, I'm betting on he just exits through the unbarred gate in the current or a subsequent loop.
