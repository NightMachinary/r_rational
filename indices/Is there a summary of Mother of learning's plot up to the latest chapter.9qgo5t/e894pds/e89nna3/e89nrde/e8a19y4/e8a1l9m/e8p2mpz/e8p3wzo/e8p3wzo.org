  I bet it was Zorian who memorized the gate address for the spiders

I'd be really surprised if they didn't prepare for the situation where Zach has to loop back without Zorian, especially since it was the default thing that was going to happen if they didn't succeed at breaking out. I'm sure Zach found time in the 5 months in the orb to memorize the gate address. (Also, is there any reason he wouldn't just learn Zorian's fun memory spells?)
