> The gate is still unbarred

This isn't actually confirmed although narratively we can expect that Zach will escape somehow.

We also know that angels made some kind of preparations for the loop, such as telling the Sulrothum to just hand over their Key piece. Quatach-Ichl expects the angels to do what they can to keep the primordial bound, and Zach's unusual mana reserves appear to be a divine blessing such as the angels can bestow. They're also the most likely candidates for marking the original Controller, since the Maker of the gate is probably one of the gods (which have vanished) and the Key was scattered across several continents at the time the loop started.
