This is what has happened, to the best of Zorian and Zach's ability to figure it out: Zach ended up in a time loop through some currently unknown means. He is the "controller" of the time loop. The Time Loop has special abilities, meant for the Controller to use. The Crown, for example, puts a temporary marker on someone's soul which lets them loop for 6 iterations. The dagger expels someone's soul from the template used to create the world each iteration, effectively erasing them from the loop. Red Robe somehow obtained a temporary marker and somehow subverted it, so that he was able to continue looping. He believes it is possible for others to do the same. He messed up Zach's memories, so Zach doesn't remember how he entered the loop, interacting with Red Robe, all his memories of a person named Veyers, and possibly other things. Red Robe worked for a long time to optimize the invasion, possibly because he made a deal with Panaxeth that Red Robe would make sure the summoning would succeed in exchange for Panaxeth's help exiting the loop.

While RR was working on optimizing the invasion, Zorian enters the picture by a freak accident. QI attempted to merge Zorian and Zach's souls, which would render them insane, but the Time Loop safeguards triggered a restart when Zach's soul was messed with. This resulted in the merge succeeding only slightly, in a way that was very lucky and convenient for Zorian, because it gave Zorian a broken copy of Zach's Controller marker. Since it wasn't a Temporary Marker, Zorian didn't have any limit to his looping abilities. Zorian and Spear of Resolve hypothesize that someone like RR exists and they conspire to capture him. Their deception results in RR believing there is "an army of time travelers" who subverted the Temporary Marker the same way he did. RR "soul-kills" the aranea and exits the loop, barring the gate. Before Spear of Resolve died, she learned much about the time loop's operation from the Ghost Serpent. She left this information in a memory packet for Zorian. Zorian unfortunately got only an incomplete message packet. Therefore, he learns Aranean mind skills in order to read the other memory packet (the one that Spear of Resolve was using to loop), which also contains a copy of the message. From this and talking to Ghost Serpent, they learn many details of the Time Loop. They visit the Sovereign Gate and meet the Guardian. They learn that the gate is barred because someone (RR) already left and that to unbar the gate they need all 5 pieces of the key.

They find the soulless body of Veyers. (The person that Zach has no memory of, despite having interacted with him before the Time Loop began.) They hypothesis that he might be RR, but there is some evidence against this: they think that when RR left the loop, his body would likely be reset like normal, not appear soulless. Ultimately this is inconclusive: they don't have a good idea whether veyers is RR or not, and they don't know what his significance is.

They eventually find all 5 pieces of the key. They use the crown to bring in an army of temporary loopers. They use the key to unbar the gate. Activating the key also has the unexpected side-effect of triggering the guardian to do a full sanity-check of the time loop, where he identifies that Zorian has a corrupted copy of the Controller Marker. Thus, the Guardian plans to reset Zorian at the end of the iteration. Since the gate is unbarred, Panaxeth is able to help someone out of the gate, and he makes a deal with Silverlake. He brings Silverlake out of the time loop. The gate is barred again. They still have the key, so they unbar the gate. Zorian makes his escape through the dimensional portal. The gate is still unbarred, so presumably Zach will still be able to exit.
