Also energy costs and its size. If it needs to be put on a SUV/Truck, its abuse potential during operations is hampered.

And if they want to make grendades/explosives they need to actually store the energy in the explosve. A rough estimation gives 200g TNT per grenade, thats 200kj, meaning a standard power outlet will take about ... 100 seconds. Mh, thats less than I expected.
