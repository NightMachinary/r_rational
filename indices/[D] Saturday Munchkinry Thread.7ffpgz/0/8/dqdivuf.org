Does the machine do chemistry?

If so, you could make a ton of money going into medicine, drugs, wine or industrial components.

Alternately, use it to forge perfect copies or money or art.

To block this, I might say that the machine works by re arranging tiny particles of ceramics, metal and polymer.

This prevents chemistry, most forgery, and anything with true micro circuits. That leaves you with reduced item costs, but nothing world breaking.
