I run a larp where, against my better judgement, we gave the players a nano assembler. Pour material in top, product comes out the bottom, as long as it has plenty of the proper molecules in the "in" hopper.

It also needs to completely take apart (and destroy) any item to scan it into a blueprint.

How badly will this ruin the game, and how can we stop it?

Note: weapons are DNA coded, so if you copy those, only 1 person can use them.
