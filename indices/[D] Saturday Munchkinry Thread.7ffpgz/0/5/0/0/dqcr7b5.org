I mean honestly the best explosive you're likely to get to work here (assuming non-nuclear since trying to go nuclear would be extremely difficult and likely to kill you a million different ways) is octanitrocubane (2.38 times better than TnT) which is 30% better than the HMX used in military application (though much more expensive). Trying to get do all the engineering work required to figure out how to get another explosive set up that will massively beat existing explosives is just too much effort for too little results (given it would be a mission in its own right). Even getting some octanitrocubane would require enough work that it might not be worth it when you can just use existing explosives that are /nearly/ as good.

Still like I said you shouldn't underestimate how OP having access to pretty much unlimited amounts of high end military weaponry and explosives is likely to be. I mean for one it makes it quite feasible for the party to just defeat every enemy using anti-tank rifles, missile launchers and lots of explosives (plus given the tech level needed for a nano assembler prototype to exist the party might well start mass producing weaponized drones and never actually get into combat). Also carrying around all these explosives isn't that much of a hazard either if you wanted to punish them that way, since military grade explosives are generally difficult to set off (shooting it usually won't work).
