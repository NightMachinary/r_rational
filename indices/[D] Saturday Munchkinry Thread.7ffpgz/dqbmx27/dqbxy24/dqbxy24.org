Depending how fast this thing works, the person who holds it is more powerful than Miss Militia. They get to make any tool or weapon for any obscure situation as long as they've seen one once. You will never be able to give them a quest which involves collecting a bunch of something, and you will have to make sure that any puzzles you give them can't be unintentionally solved by any tool they have ever used before. Each player should drop their weapons into the machine and then print out new ones so they can never be broken, stolen, or otherwise rendered impotent. They will always have the pinnacle of everything they have ever collected, and anything less useful in most situations which might have a fringe use somewhere else is something they can and will have available at all times. For the rest of the game, they get to turn random garbage loot into the best items they can possibly have.

If you're ok with that, then go ahead.
