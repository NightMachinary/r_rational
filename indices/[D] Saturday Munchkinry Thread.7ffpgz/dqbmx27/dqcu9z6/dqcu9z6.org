You are combining A LOT of functions into one device. It not only prints, but also scans and dissassembles.

So why does the nano assembler have a scanner inside? Thats an easy way to restrain the abuse. Have them use expensive DRM-plans or go to use open source/cracked "recipes" with their own disadvantages. See "The Diamond Age" by Neal Stevenson for inspiration.

Cracked weapon recipes wouldnt have to be DNA coded, but might stutter or explode at unopportune times.

Raw-stuff is also another restrictable parameter- you cant feed your paper printer coal to print stuff. Ink needs to be manufactured to specification and is protected by DRM, and is about the most expensive fluid on the planet. Why would that be any different with nanotech? Get rid of the disassembler.

Shadowrun RPG has nanotech. They govern that with "nano-desktop-forges" can make everything you can buy on the free market, but you pay 10%-25% more for the raw-stuff.

Stuff to look out for: have everything applicable made of diamond - its just Carbon deposited in a certain way. Knives/Windshields/Glasses from it.

If, as you answered to my other question, there are no nanites yet - why give them a super mature nano-tech device? You are handing them the equivalent of 2050 PC in 1960. Just give them access to a prototype with all its flaws. Think a 1990-2000 PC in 1960, still awesome tech, but no-one can fix the bugs, there are little programs to run, any technicians/coder that program for it need to be kept silent etc etc.
