I think you kind of have to assume the assembler is a one of a kind prototype otherwise the assemblers would be absolutely everywhere. After all there's no reason you can't use a assembler to create large numbers of smaller assemblers (or even larger one's in multiple pieces).

My point is that if this sort of nanotech were widespread then pretty much the entire setting is going to totally revolve around it, which it isn't stated to. So either it's a one of a kind prototype, or this tech would be /everywhere/ in which case letting the players have one would be impossible to avoid to to their prevalence.
