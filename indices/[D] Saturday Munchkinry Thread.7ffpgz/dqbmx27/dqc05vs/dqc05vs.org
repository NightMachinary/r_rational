This is probably extremely powerful, since they can mass produce anything provided they can get one copy and enough supply of raw materials, but it depends on how your world is set up.

One solution is to design your world such that all of the powerful equipment contains some quantity of rare material, with more powerful equipment requiring larger quantities (or rare materials). Effectively, you could use it mechanically as an NPC shopkeeper with infinite stock, using the rare material as currency. If, for example, your rare material is gold, then maybe this cool weapon requires 5 oz of gold, and this cool armor requires 20 oz of gold, and this cool helmet requires 20 oz of gold, and they have to ration their supply and choose what to "buy".

This doesn't prevent them from mass producing common items like food by feed a tree into their machine, but if you're in a world where nano assemblers exist and aren't extraordinarily rare then the economy should reflect that and prevent most extreme market exploitation. But you'll need to make sure all of your market prices reflect that.

If nano assemblers are extraordinarily rare and their use isn't capped by rare materials, such that they actually are overpowered, then that means everyone would want one. This means that super powerful and influential people are going to want to come and steal it from them. You could either use this to throw more powerful enemies at them to compensate for their increase in strength from having this, or you could use it to force them to lose it by having an overpowered enemy defeat them and steal it from them. I don't suggest going as extreme as that, but perhaps it would be appropriate to throw some extra tough enemies at them and have them face a higher threat of losing than they usually face. If they win they can keep it, but might have similar battles in the future, if they lose they lose their nano assembler, but also lose the interest of this organization and thus face normal battles in the future (or go on a quest to get it back if they want)
