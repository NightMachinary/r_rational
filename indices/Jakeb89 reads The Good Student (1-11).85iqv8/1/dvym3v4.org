Mages as brainwashed demons is a wild speculation of mine, don't mind that. (I'll say, though, that I have a history of successfully predicting mega-scale plot twists months in advance --- have you read /Twig/ perchance? --- as well as connecting smallest hints and word choices into absurd metafictional singularitian conspiracy theories with probability of correctness approaching zero for mild amusement. Take of that what you will.)
