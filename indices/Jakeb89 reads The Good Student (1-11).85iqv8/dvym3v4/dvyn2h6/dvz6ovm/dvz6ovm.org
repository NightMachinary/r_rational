Twig has some of the best challenges for catching an unreliable Narrator you will ever face. It does feature a fair bit of grimderp, but they are at least thematically rationalized and even arguably, fit for the setting. If you every wanted to both root for the underdog, and the magnificent bastard, you might be doing yourself a disservice if you don't give twig a second try.

Also; Thank you I'll have to give this a swing.
