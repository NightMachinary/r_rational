NB. I'm a little late to the party and will likely also post this on the comming wednesday worldbuilding thread.

A friend of mine has asked me to run a short(either everybody dies within a few IRl hours or the goal is quickly achieved) roleplaying game and inspired by [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][Scott Alexander's story about the 8 pill choices]] I want to give my players the options between a number of various powers, with the caveut that each power is equally 'deadly' if managed improperly. Here I mean deadly in the sense that it either litterally kills the character or removes their character from taking any meaningful actions for the rest of the game.

Stealing some of Alexander's points. Green pill let's you shapeshift, unfortunately pretty much anything in nature have a natural killer who might be humans. Yellow pill gives you mindreading but you every time you use it you become a little more insane due to the massive information dump/get depressed because people. Pink let's you make anyone you touch love you and also makes them unlove you on another touch, beware of jaleous partners. Red makes you superstrong and aside from a 'how much does raw strength actually matter in real life' I'm unsure. Thoughts on other powers that easily can go horribly wrong?
