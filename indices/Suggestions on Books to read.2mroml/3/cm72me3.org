I'd recommend most things by Charles Stross. The /Merchant Princes/ series gets very little love, but is all about revolution and the creative use of power (though if you read this, try to get the reissue that cuts the six books into three fat ones as was originally intended - it's a much better read that way). His science fiction stuff is also probably right up your alley due to the subject matter. And lastly, the /Laundry Files/ series is one that I really enjoy, though it varies in how rational it is. Stross has a firm understanding of science and puts a lot of thought into his ideas. Oh, and he's also written one of the best time travel stories I've ever read, /Palimpsest/, which is part of the /Wireless/ collection.
