There's not much on offer, I'm afraid. Things that fall strictly within the "rational fiction" category are sparse.

(Low hanging fruit: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][check out the tvtropes page.]])

Your best bet is fiction that doesn't have all aspects of the genre, but does possess some. ([[http://measureofdoubt.com/2013/03/18/what-would-a-rational-gryffindor-read/][Here's a list of books rationalists might enjoy.]])

Personal recommendations:

- Anything by Terry Pratchett, but especially the stuff dealing with witches.
- Anathem, by Neal Stephenson
- [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando]], by Charles Stross
