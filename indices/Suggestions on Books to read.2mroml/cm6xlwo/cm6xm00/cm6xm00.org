A Rational Fic is one which makes a deliberate effort to reward a reader's thinking. It's the opposite of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim][Bellisario's Maxim]] . The world- building is intended to stand up to careful thought; the plot is driven by characters or circumstances that themselves are part of the story, the heroes generally think clearly (in ways the reader can follow), and a clever reader can deduce what's hidden or what's coming. Very often, the fic is also intended to teach the reader something about rationality.
