Anathem is fine for the intelligent aspects, but as a story it's largely a rather thin framing device, complete with "let's throw in a romantic conflict that means nothing and goes nowhere because I guess that's what needs to happen in these stories". It's also been described as a reaction to the "just Google it" mentality, which given that I look at Google as a faster and somewhat less rigorous encyclopedia seems like a meaningless knee-jerk reaction to the pace of modern technology, which admittedly is borne out in the novel to an extent.

So, it's a good book, but you can ignore [[/s][spoiler]] Hopefully I've got those terms right. It's been a while.

Also Accelerando is fantastic for the patter and jargon alone, though the story is a little unwieldy at times.
