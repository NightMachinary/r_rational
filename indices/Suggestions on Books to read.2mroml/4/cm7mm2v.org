I'd recommend /The Dragon's Path/ by Daniel Abraham (Book one of /The Dagger and the Coin/ series)

It's well written, and has characters that seem tailored for a rational audience. They range from book-smart (with "clever" solutions) to actually smart, from noble to practical, and everything in between. It hits all four parts of a rational fic in the sidebar, though "solving problems through intelligent actions" is sort of hit-and-miss: the characters often end up creating problems through stupid applications of their knowledge and resources.
