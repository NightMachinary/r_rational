If the earring starts out by saying "better for you if you take me off", then it understands that a series of short term decisions that can be good will have a long-term impact that is bad.

If the earring then fails to say "take me off" when actually making short term decisions, then the earring is providing bad advice, because it is deliberately ignoring the long term effect of the decision to claim that the decision is good solely based on its short term effect.

(The obvious response is that the earring doesn't say "take me off" for the innocuous reason that it won't repeat a suggestion that was already refused. This argument doesn't work because 1) that opens a way for the earring to be manipulative by choosing exactly what aspect of the current situation it's making suggestions about so that it can avoid having to make such suggestions later, and 2) what counts as a repeat suggestion is not well defined.)
