I will reply in more detail later, but first I wonder what you would say about the following hypotheticals:

At first, the earring is useless and only suggests the decisions you would make anyway. After wearing it for, say, ten years, the earring begins to be bolder and starts whispering innovative suggestions (/maybe you should order beef instead of chicken?/). They start out pretty innocent, small decisions, what to wear, what to order, minor things you might not have realized yourself; but they escalate slowly over the course of decades (/become an accountant rather than a soldier/) and you slowly become a different person. One day:

1) you have a stroke and the earring takes over.

2) the earring breaks. You take it off. You feel a little woozy for a while, but your brain feels normal after some rest. You keep on making the choices the earring has been suggesting (the thing clearly knew what it was doing).

Would you say "you" (or "your mind" or whatever) have survived in (both, either, one of) these scenarios?
