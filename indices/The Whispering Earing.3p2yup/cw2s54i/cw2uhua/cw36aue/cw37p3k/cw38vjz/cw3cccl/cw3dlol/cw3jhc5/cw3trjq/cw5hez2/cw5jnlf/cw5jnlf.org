  Imagine that, after having worn the earring for decades, you go to the same restaurants, choose to obsessively re-watch the same movies you always have, and volunteer to canvass for the same political party. If "you" or "your personality" is understood to be some kind of continuously changing pattern, it is natural to conclude that "you" or "the decision-making part of your personality" is very far from having atrophied -- rather, its as strong as its always been.

What I mean here could be clarified with a real-life example, without having to talk about some magical object. Suppose I enjoy chess and often play online. Eventually I get tired of losing all the time, so I purchase a powerful chess program and only play the moves it tells me to. Some time later, my skill disintegrates and I forget all I ever knew, although I win a lot more often. Now, can "I" play chess or not? Does it make sense to consider the program a part of my mind? If my mind is a pattern, and there are all kinds of patterns all around me, where do we draw the dividing line? Perhaps we should consider that the program is now a part of me and I'm playing better than ever before?

I think it makes sense to say that the chess program is not a part of my mind, and my ability to play is, in fact lost, because: 1) the algorithm of the program is not remotely similar to anything my mind has ever run, and has not continuously grown out of the algorithms of my mind, the way my current mind grew from the algorithms of the 10 year old me. The program has been added to the mix in a very abrupt and discontinuous way and 2) because currently there is very little communication between the program and me - as far as I'm concerned, it works entirely like a black box. I can't look into it's thoughts, and it can' look into mine.

I would say that these two point are enough to consider the program separate from me. Same can be said about the earring. However, I could describe a slightly different story, where my conclusion is very different, and closer to what you think my conclusion should be, I imagine.

Imagine a similar earring, but different in that it's no smarter than me and only suggest to make the decisions I myself would naturally make without its help. As such, it's pointless for a while. As I'm wearing it, it doesn't seem to make any sort of difference whatsoever. However, some day I have a stroke - a part of my brain that's responsible for decision-making shuts down and the earring magically takes over as if nothing happened. In this scenario I would, in fact say, that my mind is as it ever was and nothing of importance has changed. If, from the start your vision of how Scott's earring worked was closer to this, than perhaps we only ever disagreed about the specifics of the story. (This is also more or less the plot of Greg Egan's story /Learning to be Me/.)

Re: arbitrariness, I won't say much, but I agree with you that it should be possible to explain our preferences in a way that seems compelling and natural to other humans, although there's will always be arbitrariness at the bottom if it. My own views certainly feel that way from the inside, and I believe they could be presented that way, but that might take writing a book or similar.
