"Why is death uniquely bad?" Like I said, roughly because it represents a stop for the patterns we would consider good and want to continue - the ones that represent humans being happy.

"Is it silly and arbitrary that we care about only about those patterns and don't care when other patterns come to an end?" Of course it is silly and arbitrary. But any preference is going to be. Terminal values don't require a justification.

"What do I think about Scott's story?" I was always confused by it. I didn't make it clear, but when I first mentioned it, I was trying to present it in the spirit Scott wrote it, with the message he intended, which is not exactly what I think of it. I said: /"you sorta turn into an interface between the earring and the world, your personality becomes forever irrelevant and atrophies"/ and I think that this is mostly accurate, (although I should replace "personality" with "the decision making part of your personality"). The question is - is that a bad thing?

My strongest pro-earring arguments would go like this: whoever is wearing an earring is not going to experience any extra pain or suffering. In fact, he is going to be much happier than he'd be otherwise. There's going to be an atrophy of some part of your brain, but the reason we usually consider that bad, is because we need that part to make decisions, and if an earring takes care of that, perhaps it's not so tragic to see that part gone? In the real life we might have to worry about losing an earring or it suddenly turning traitorous, but as far as the story goes, we can ignore those possibilities.

My strongest anti-earring arguments, that aren't really very strong, would go like this: it is not true that at any point your personality is running on the hardware of the earring. Earring is a much better decision-maker than you. You share goals and values, but it's thought patterns are not yours. You do not have access to its thoughts, the way you have access to your own. The earring's mind is not continuous with yours and always remains separate. You only communicate through a very narrow, slow channel. If it can experience pain, you will not experience that pain, for example. There is a clear dividing line between you and it, and what lies on the other side of that line doesn't resemble you very much.

Wearing the earring is going to make you dumber, although it won't have impact on anything external. If being intelligent and a good decision maker is something you value terminally, it makes sense to be disturbed by the story. However, if you only care about those things instrumentally, as most people do, I imagine, you should answer all of the above with a big "so what?" and happily ride into the sunset, the earring in your ear.
