I typed a long answer, but later I decided to delete it, because I realized I didn't understand what I was talking about as well as I thought and I should think more before saying anything. Since you're curious, I'll give a brief answer though, without trying to spin a complete theory, which would turn out to be stupid.

1. When I talk about "self" being a pattern, I don't mean a fixed specific pattern, otherwise I would have to conclude that I'm dying every second, as you say. I mean a sort of pattern that depends on the moment of time and continuously develops by it's own rules, like a solution of the heat equation or something. Some states of the pattern correspond to what we'd call "happiness" and some - to "pain". I don't want my pattern to reach the bad states and want it to reach the good ones, but I'm not against it changing, which it inevitably will. Death would not correspond to change, but to a sudden change to "zero" from some point forward. I want to avoid death, because it would mean the end of all the good states and would probably be accompanied by some bad states (fear and anticipation).

2. I don't necessarily find Scott's story disturbing. It's very ambiguous. It was intended as disturbing, but I could be persuaded to think that what happens there is completely fine. Maybe.
