Tasty, I'm wondering what you would say about the following hypothetical (which is just a restatement of the point I was trying to make above).

Imagine that instead of having suggestions whispered to you by an earring, you are suddenly inspired to use logical reasoning to figure out reasonable actions to take. You never used to do that before. /Should you become a soldier or a poet?/ You make a list of the things you are good at and enjoy doing, and use that to make a decision.

As you do this, your brain changes ([[http://psychology.about.com/od/biopsychology/f/brain-plasticity.htm]] ). Dormant connections between neurons suddenly strengthen while others weaken. The brain slowly rewrites itself.

You die a happy life with wealth, family, success, etc etc etc. A scan taken before your death shows your brain to be completely different from the brain you had before you got into the practice of using logical reasoning. It is almost impossible to guess from looking at the two scans side-by-side that they belonged to the same person.

Would you say this is roughly as disturbing as the story about the earring?

If you think that (i) what matters is the personality pattern (ii) it makes little difference whether the pattern is executed on meat or some other hardware -- then it seems to me that (i) & (ii) more-or-less compel you to find this hypothetical roughly as disturbing as the story about the earring.
