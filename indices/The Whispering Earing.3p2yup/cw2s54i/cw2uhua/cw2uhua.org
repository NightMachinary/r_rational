Bet the thought experiment is very different. The point of it is that you remain unchanged: it doesn't matter if your brain made of meat or silicon ships, if the pattern is the same, your identity, that which makes you - you, remains exactly the same.

In Scott's story knowing the optimal course of action 100% of the time completely obliterates you - you sorta turn into an interface between the earing and the world, your personality becomes forever irrelevant and atrophies. Pretty much a polar opposite outcome.
