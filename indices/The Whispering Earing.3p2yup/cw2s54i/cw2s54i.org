A very nice story.

I recall a related thought experiment suggested elsewhere by Daniel Dennett:

One of the neurons in your brain is steadily accumulating damage from old age. So you decide to have surgery which replaces it with a computer chip. The chip sends out currents on the axons connected to the neuron which are exactly the same as those the original neuron would have sent out.

When you wake up after the surgery, you don't feel any different.

So you do it again. Prevention is the best cure!

10^{12} surgeries later you are a robot.
