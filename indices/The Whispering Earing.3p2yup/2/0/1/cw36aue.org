First, note that I said the two experiments are related; I did not say they were identical in every aspect.

Second, whether the outcomes are indeed polar opposites depends on what you define to be "you." You assert that if the "pattern remains the same" then "you" remain exactly the same, but this is not a fact -- at least, not in the same sense that "1+1=2" or "two charged particles of opposite charge attract each other" are facts. Rather it is a choice you have made, a choice of how to think of what it means to be you.

There are other possible choices. It is pointless to spell them all out but see e.g., [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/]]. I believe that almost all philosophers reject the simple account of "you = your personality," since it implies that there could be more than one "you" existing simultaneously. The account of personality you implicitly offer is vulnerable to the same objection, though, of course, this may be a pill you are willing to swallow.

I've never committed myself to any one of these theories of personality. On the other hand, death still feels like death even if I knew that someone else would later be created with the same personality (or even the same neuronal pattern). So I would say the subject is "obliterated" in both hypotheticals. This is not a fact, but rather a consequence of how I've chosen to think of what it means to be me.
