In answer to your question: in one scenario, the biological mass of your brain atrophies, in the other it disappears entirely. Both of these are obviously forms of destruction.

Now whether you should /care/ about the disappearance of the biological mass inside your skull (given that a silicon mass replaces it) depends on how you conceive of the self. I don't think there is a way to avoid that discussion.

A related, but distinct, point: if who you are is a certain pattern, then you die a little bit every day as your personality changes. Let us suppose that you are a completely different person now compared to fifteen years ago (true for most people, I would say). If you believe that you = a certain pattern, you should think of this death as essentially equally bad[1] as the physical death you'll experience at the end of life. Indeed, it isn't a metaphorical death that you've gone through these past fifteen years -- under the definition of you = pattern, it is a very literal death. This is a pretty counterintuitive conclusion, and justifies rejecting this conception of the self entirely in my view.

[1] Well, almost. The effect on the people around you is not the same.
