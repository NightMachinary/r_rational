By the way, do you still think that your initial statement /"you sorta turn into an interface between the earring and the world, your personality becomes forever irrelevant and atrophies"/ is correct, given theory of self you've articulated in this comment?

After all, one might say that your personality is now running on the hardware of the earring (so to speak). Thus the atrophy of the brain shouldn't bother you (according to my understanding of your views). And the fact that the original personality pattern is gone -- well, that is perfectly fine as well if "you" is a /changing/ pattern. If I am not misunderstanding your views, it seems to me that your account of self & your initial characterization of what happens in the earring story are somewhat inconsistent.
