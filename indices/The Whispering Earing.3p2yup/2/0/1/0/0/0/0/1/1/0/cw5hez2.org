/I said: "you sorta turn into an interface between the earring and the world, your personality becomes forever irrelevant and atrophies" and I think that this is mostly accurate, (although I should replace "personality" with "the decision making part of your personality")/

This can be a correct statement; for example, it is correct if you think of "you" or "your personality" as somehow inextricably connected to the biological mass of tissue residing within your cranium. On the other hand, under the understanding of personality that you have previously advanced, this statement is very hard to justify.

Imagine that, after having worn the earring for decades, you go to the same restaurants, choose to obsessively re-watch the same movies you always have, and volunteer to canvass for the same political party. If "you" or "your personality" is understood to be some kind of continuously changing pattern, it is natural to conclude that "you" or "the decision-making part of your personality" is very far from having atrophied -- rather, its as strong as its always been.

On death: how much arbitrariness in terminal values is acceptable is in the eye of the beholder. Let me illustrate the issue by moving away from death to something more basic, namely causing harm.

A. I think that causing human beings harm is an inherently bad thing, but scrapping a toaster is not. I believe that there is such a thing as /the experience of feeling pain/, and that a human being can feel it while a toaster cannot. There is, of course, an arbitrariness in my beliefs -- why should we care about causing pain in the first place? It is something I take as an axiom without further justification.

B. But suppose we now say that a human being is really just a certain continuously changing pattern; and a toaster is a certain pattern as well; and we designate certain states of the human pattern as "bad," and consider it wrong to take actions to reach them. On the other hand, we choose not to do this with the toaster.

In some sense, account B is no worse than account A -- terminal values are arbitrary as you say, and both accounts ultimately involve a decision to care about some things and not others. And yet I find the arbitrariness in A acceptable while the arbitrariness in B is not, so much so that I view the difference as a reason to say that accounts such as B are missing some fundamental.

There is certainly no contradiction in subscribing to accounts such as B. If you find the account in B perfectly satisfactory, then certainly I have nothing to say that can persuade you otherwise. Every reductio ad absurdum proceeds this way: if you do not find the conclusion to be absurd, the argument will have no force for you.
