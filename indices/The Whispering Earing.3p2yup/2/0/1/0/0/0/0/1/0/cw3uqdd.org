  If you think of yourself as some kind of shifting pattern, it suddenly becomes much more difficult to articulate why the death of a human being is so uniquely bad. Should we think of the cessation of other patterns as being pretty horrible as well?

Why would you need some deep reason that the death is bad anyway? It's quite obvious that the vast majority of people prefer to stay alive, rather than become dead. Additionally the death of an individual often causes grief among those still alive. Is this nigh universal preference against death somehow not enough for something without a deep philosophical foundation?
