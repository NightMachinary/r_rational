-- Surprisingly, at the end we might not disagree on all that much. I think the account of personality-as-a-shifting-pattern makes it difficult to be disturbed by Scott's story, which I view as a reductio ad absurdum for that view of self (and you do not and are perhaps willing to bite the bullet?).

-- In the philosophy literature, this viewpoint is called the "psychological continuity theory of personal identity." Broadly speaking, one reason why I do not subscribe to theories along these lines is that they really undermine the argument for the /badness/ of death.

Death is horrible, right? Something really awful happens when you die, which is completely different from what happens when you, say, replace your old laptop with a new one?

If you think of yourself as some kind of shifting pattern, it suddenly becomes much more difficult to articulate why the death of a human being is so uniquely bad. Should we think of the cessation of other patterns as being pretty horrible as well?
