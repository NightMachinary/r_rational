I don't think arguing about how to define "self" or "I" is particularly meaningful. If an answer to a question about Jabberwocky depends on how you define a Jabberwocky, it's a sign that it might be a good idea to temporarily stop using the word Jabberwocky at all. If I try to answer the question: "how is what happens in Scott's thought experiment different from what happens in Dennett's experiment?" without using the words: "I" "self" or "personality", I can say: "In Dennett's experiment, a certain pattern remains unaltered although what forms that pattern is changed, while in Scott's experiment a pattern is changed very profoundly". Hopefully, everyone can agree that this is true.

Can you explain what exactly is similar in both scenarios and what exactly is being destroyed in them, without referring to "I" or "self"?
