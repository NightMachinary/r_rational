Yes, or about fulfilling them more. If I want to write an amazing book, 1 is sitting through engineering classes and only writing when inspiration hits, 2 is only writing when i feel like it, 150 is a very effective plan to write a good book, and numbers higher improve my potential book by a larger margin, or reduce the cost to my other priorities.

In some situations, numbers go higher and in others it'd be impossible to get over a thirty without outside information. A perfect plan my not score as highly because it's a perfect plan for something that isn't in my personal motivations, and is an inneffective way to fulfill them.

The numbers have no clear scale, no unit of wisdom, but you can always compare plans this way.
