That doesn't help. Advice that you could provide on your own won't have the long-term negative consequences we're talking about. If the earring advice has those long-term consequences, then the earring advice is not only bad advice, it's also worse than what you could come up with on your own.

Basically, the problem is that if the earring really gives good advice, by /any/ standard (even if it's just good relative to advice you could come up with), "good advice" has to be advice which is overall beneficial /even taking into account the highly negative value of dependency on the earring/. If, in fact, giving advice causes dependency, and dependency is bad enough that anyone who understands it would want to avoid it at all costs (which is the implication I get from the story), then it's not possible for the earring to give good advice other than "take me off" because there is no such thing as good advice other than "take me off". (Unless less than X level of advice doesn't cause dependency in which case the earring can give less than X level.)
