If you take off the earring, does it remember you if it is placed on someone else, taken off and then replaced on you? If your prefrontal cortex is atrophied past the point of dementia, then removing this piece of robot-jewelry is effectively KILLING you and the "moderately better" version of you.

If it turns out that the earring is essentially a transdimensional prefrontal cortex of the better version of me and the link can easily be reestablished, then that calls into question whether or not our brains are the center of our "soul/identity/find-replace-a-term-of-your-choosing." And perhaps the earring isn't as bad as I think it is.
