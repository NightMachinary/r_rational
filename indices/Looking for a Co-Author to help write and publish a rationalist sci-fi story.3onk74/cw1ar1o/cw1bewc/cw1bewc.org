Publishing house, not sure what POD is.

  2) Why publish?
#+end_quote

Its not really about the social validation or about the money. Making money off it would be nice, but I want to be able hold a physical copy of the book in my hands and know I made it. I guess the social validation is part of it, but its less that I want to show off how awesonme I am, and more that I want to create something that stands some slim chance of outlasting me. I want to create something to share with the world, to bring excitement and joy to other people. Hard science fiction is a niche genre of a niche genre, so I don't expect it to be a blockbuster success, but I want to create something that will be sitting on someone's bookshelf fifty years from now, for their kids to pull down and discover.

  3) What do you want your co-author to do?
#+end_quote

I'm imagining a back and forth wherein I pick a couple characters in the world and tell their story, and the other person picks another couple characters and tells their story. We write a few chapters, then trade the chapters we've written for editing and discussion. They go over my chapters, I go over theirs, we talk about what we like, what we don't, how to move the larger plot forward, and how to bring all the story arcs together. Its not that I can't do it on my own, but I've no idea how good anything I made by myself is. If I have another person whose equally literary then we can go over each others work and make sure we're not writing ourselves into a corner, or creating a knot in the plotline thats impossible to later untangle. Could a really dedicated editor do all that? Probably, but that sounds like less fun to me then having a hand in actually creating the content in the first place, and I want the other person to be able to get as much enjoyment out of the process as I do. I want them to be able to have a stake in the creative process that they wouldn't have as an editor alone. Plus, its probably easier to find someone to co-write with me and co-edit, then to find a dedicated editor whose willing to read through the whole thing.

The other thing is that while I've imagined the plot in very broad strokes, there's a lot of detailing in that needs to be done, and it would be fun to just have someone who's just as invested in the story to talk about those details with. Someone who would enjoy helping fill in the blanks and flesh out the universe.

  4) What's in it for your co-author?
#+end_quote

The same things that are in it for me. The possibility of making something that might outlast them, that the rest of the world could read and enjoy. Telling a good story that people like is a reward itself, outside of whatever small amount of money might come out of it.
