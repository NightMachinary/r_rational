  I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but writing a novel is a mountain of work, so if you're going to do it you need to be really clear on why you're doing it. If your goal is to have a physical product that other people can hold, then I strongly suggest going through a POD service instead of through a publishing house.

Oh, I know exactly how much work it is. I've already written one manuscript, and its junk that I doubt will see the light of day. And that took me six months. I know it will probably take /years/ for something I write to make it through a publishing house's doors, but I'd rather go with a publishing house then with POD because I want the wider availability. I want it to be something someone could buy in a bookstore.

  Get an editor. Upwork has editors for $20/hr and up. (This is not a recommendation of those people or upwork, just an example.)

That costs more then I make in an hour, so not really viable.

  Or just post it here on Reddit; people will be delighted to tell you how good or bad your story is.

I've been considering that, and I want to. I want to write a chapter, share it, and get feedback, but if I do that, won't it harm my ability to get it published through a print publisher? Would even Amazon take it if its already out there like that?

  Yes. Alternatively, sit down with a friend over coffee and brainstorm, then you go off and write it. It will save you a tremendous amount of time and frustration, and will give you the things you say you're looking for.

That'd be great if I had some nerdy rationalist literary friends who I could gush about transhumanism and writing styles with. But I don't have anyone like that in real life, the only people I know that are like that are...you know, here in this subreddit.

  Go to some creative writing workshops in your area, take a course at your local community college, start a writers group, or go to some open mic nights and strike up a conversation.

I'll see about that, it might be a good idea, but I already have a community of fairly like minded people here. I'm already casting the net, I'm just doing it over the net instead of in meatspeace. I'm not of the opinion that you can't be friends with someone unless you're around each other in meatspace, a lot of my best friends are those I've made over the years online.
