One comment I'd make about the setting that vaguely bothers me - what caused the massive collapse that destroyed the food sector so much that everyone effectively eats rations?

Taste and hunger seem like one of the most low level pleasures that humans get, on nearly the same as sexual pleasure, so any setting that has a roughly thriving population with mass levels of either one missing seems like it would require an explanation to me.

More believable to me would be that it's devolved into mostly just junk food/fast food places, possibly with the base material of almost all fast food being the space kelp mush, in the same manner than most fast foods today seem to be random shaped meat stuff.

However, lack of diversity in the food supply to me indicates that none of the megacorps are in any sort of food supply business, meaning that companies like P&G, Kellogg, and Coca Cola have all either gone out of business or been bought out and then dismantled due to somehow no longer being exorbitantly profitable.
