Gotcha.

So it's not everyone eating tasteless algae bricks, it's just that the "steak", "chicken", and "cheese" in my Chipotle all originally come from space algae, rather than from any actual animal or plant, and everything else is likely some form of artificially generated sweetener or seasoning?

From my perspective, this actually doesn't seem all that bad, then.
