Also the methods of terraforming shown aren't exactly "subtle". Slam an asteroid into earth to cool it down some and you've caused an extinction level event. Do the same to Venus and... there's nobody there to go extinct, so who cares?

Making something uninhabited become habitable is a lot easier when there are no existing balances that need to be kept, so if you overshoot a bit, just fire up something else to balance it and wait a bit longer.
