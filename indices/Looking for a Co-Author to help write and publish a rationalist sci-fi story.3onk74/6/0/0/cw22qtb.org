That makes more sense.\\
To be clear, I am all for expansion to other worlds. I was just skeptical at the mention that Earth was straining under the weight of 40 billion humans, which shouldn't tax the planet's resources or atmosphere too badly unless we're /still/ chugging fossil fuel.\\
Terraforming is great, but the ability to expand human influence to other planets shouldn't mean we stop caring about Earth. It seems like a troubling mentality to rely on the eventual extinction of the planet to justify leaving it a garbage heap. Fundamentalist Christian's do the same thing to justify ignoring pollution, except instead of an asteroid they're waiting for the Anti-Christ.\\
I'm no hippy. My point is pollution is a real problem that is ignored or handled too lightly in spec fiction to the detriment of the strength of the setting.\\
If anything, just treat this as advice: Your setting sounds good, and I get into all sorts of high concept stuff, but you don't have to treat Earth like something to crumple up and throw away now that we're "done with it." You don't even have to change anything in the setting. I'm just suggesting that you not sever the emotional connection most people would naturally feel towards home just to seem more science-fictiony.\\
But if you'd rather depict a callous outward expansion I'd still consider reading it. It's your story, after all. Maybe I'll just write my /own/ story, with Black Jack, and hookers, and a compassionate treatment of the human home world...\\
Ah, forget it.
