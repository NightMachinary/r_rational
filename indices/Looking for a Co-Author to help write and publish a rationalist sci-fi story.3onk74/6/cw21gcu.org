Something that seems to crop up a lot in speculative sci-fi is emergency projects to terraform other planets in order to save the human race, but I just don't buy it. If we haven't gotten our ducks in a row sufficiently to keep Earth's atmosphere from choking us, how are we supposed to believe a coordinated effort to radically transform another planet to make it habitable to humans? I know this concept may seem strange, and the idea of terraforming Mars is really cool, but why don't we see more speculative sci-fi dealing with making /Earth/ habitable for humans rather than scrambling off of it in such a big hurry? Yes, I love the idea of expanding out into the stars, but terraformation of other planets isn't a very good plan for avoiding the 'choking on our own gases' type of extinction event. At this point the idea is starting to harm my suspension of disbelief.
