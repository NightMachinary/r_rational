the corporations have been hammering away at Strong AI like everyone else, and the AI researcher character in the story would have been working for one of the corporations on just such a purpose at the beginning. Everyone wants strong AI.

But the corporations are also very protective of the intellectual property rights, and they don't just let their AI researchers have access to the uploaded consciousnesses of their 1% leaders. The uploads are treated as an entire separate branch of research and technology, one that's 'finished' already. They have uploads, they work, they use them to back up their rich and important people. That's all the tech needs to do. The idea of applying it back to AI research isn't something that has occurred to them "you want us to let some AI researcher tinker with and possibly damage the upload of XYZ important person? What if they torture the upload into giving up trade secrets? What if they make secret copies of the upload and dissect them for trade secrets? Better to just keep it all sealed up in a nice neat bow.
