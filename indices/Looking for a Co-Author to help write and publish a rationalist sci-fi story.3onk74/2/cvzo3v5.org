That sounds very cool (and actually somewhat similar to a setting I came up with at one point).

Question: Why aren't the corporations taking advantage of the incredible earnings potential of strong AI? Are they that stupid that they don't see the potential? Is it considered very difficult (if so, why don't the corporations have everything the heroes have in their labs -- uploads, brilliant researchers, etc.?)? Is it illegal? Is is illegal and everyone with enough power has done it on the sly and is currently trying to keep their skynetish strong AIs boxed while getting useful work out of em and the whole thing is a powder keg about ready to blow up unless something outside the system saves them? (That was what I went with in my setting.)
