In this case, its largely that the Earth is seen as irrelevant at this point. Humanity won't go extinct if the Earth's atmosphere becomes inhospitable to life, humanity on Earth won't even go extinct. A lot of people on Earth already live under domes to avoid the air pollution, and very little food is grown planetside at all.

As for why not make Earth habitable before going to other planets, do you have a moment to talk about the gospel of The Asteroid Will Not Care How Clean the Water is?
