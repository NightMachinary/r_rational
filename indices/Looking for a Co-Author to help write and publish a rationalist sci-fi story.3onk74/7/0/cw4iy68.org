  More believable to me would be that it's devolved into mostly just junk food/fast food places, possibly with the base material of almost all fast food being the space kelp mush, in the same manner than most fast foods today seem to be random shaped meat stuff.

This is basically it. Coca-Cola still exists, Pepsi-Cola still exists, its just that all these companies have merged together into four massive conglomerates. Their food is all sourced from the algae mush because its the cheapest way to get the desired effect. Just like how all sugar in america is corn, all food in the future is algae derived. Earth tried to hold onto its local farming as long as it could, but with central africa, Brazil, and the midwestern united states turning into deserts, the ability to grow food continued to be gradually hemmed in more and more. There's 40 billion people on Earth in need of food, and the climate just continually proves itself too chaotic to provide that, so a lot of the farming moved indoors. On earth, you can probably still get locally grown organic produce, its just that it would be grown via hydroponics in a giant vertical farm in a city instead of in an even more giant horizontal farm in the country.

Thats on the Earth though, off the Earth, there's not a lot to work with, providing food for the billions who live and work in space has basically come down to cramming as many calories and dollars worth of growing into as little space as possible. Algae farms are huge in space, because they don't require gravity to grow correctly. Corn and vegetables and other crops require spin gravity. Some orbital colonies have this, and their corridors would be lined in some places with vegetable plants to provide a bit more air and a bit of color to your diet, but that's a long way from providing for the entire population.
