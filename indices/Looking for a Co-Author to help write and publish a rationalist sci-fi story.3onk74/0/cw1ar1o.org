Interesting premise, and your synopsis is well enough written that I would read the book.

There's a few questions that I think you need to answer; I'll apologize in advance for the brusque tone of some of them, but they're important.

--------------

1) You want to publish this. Atoms or electrons?

If atoms, publishing house or POD? Why?

2) Why publish?

Do you want the social proof of saying "I published something?" If so, take one of your existing (finished) stories and put it on Amazon. I'll be happy to talk you through the process; start to finish it will take about an hour.

Do you want to be recognized by a big-name publishing house? That's really hard to do and will take a lot of time and effort on your part. The opportunity costs are very high, so why is it worth it to you?

Do you actually want to make money? If so, do basically anything else. Income from publishing a novel is for crap, especially since Amazon's changes to Kindle Unlimited in July.

3) What do you want your co-author to do?

How do you envision this working -- you write the odd-numbered chapters and zie does the even-numbered ones? You do setting and worldbuilding, they do the actual writing? You collaboratively work on everything?

None of these are great models. Co-authorship of fiction is pretty rare, because fiction doesn't lend itself to being done by two people at once; usually when you see two names on the cover it means that one is a big name who is helping launch a smaller name. You don't have that cachet to lend, and you claim that you don't have the chops to write this yourself. (Although I suspect you could.)

4) What's in it for your co-author?

You've heard the phrase "ideas are worthless, only execution matters"? Well, it applies here. There's no money in this book, so what does the other person get? You've already provided the setting and premise, so there's no reason someone couldn't be inspired by this and write it themselves. What do you have to offer that would make someone want to put in the effort of collaborating? Before you spread the call around the Internet, I suggest having an answer to that, as it will make it much more likely that you'll get a taker.

--------------

You've got a great setting here, and your synopsis was really engaging. Instead of beating the bushes for a co-author, I suggest just writing it. Post your chapters here as you go; you'll get lots of feedback that will be useful when you do the editing phase, and then you can publish it all on your own.

Again, I'm happy to talk to you about publishing on Amazon if you're interested.
