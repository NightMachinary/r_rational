  I've been considering that, and I want to. I want to write a chapter, share it, and get feedback, but if I do that, won't it harm my ability to get it published through a print publisher? Would even Amazon take it if its already out there like that?

Amazon has no problem with your book being available elsewhere unless you sign up for the Kindle Unlimited program, which is basically a lending library. If a book is in KU then it needs to be exclusive to Amazon; you can give up to 30% of it away elsewhere, but you can't distribute the entire text through any other venue. That means no selling it with another dealer and also no giving it away. If the book is /not/ in KU then you can go nuts -- give it away online for free, sell it on B&N / Smashwords / etc, print it out and hand out copies in Times Square, whatever.

About 50% of my income from my novels, and about 30% of my total income, comes from KU, so if money is relevant than the KU decision is an important one.

  I'm not of the opinion that you can't be friends with someone unless you're around each other in meatspace, a lot of my best friends are those I've made over the years online.

I would definitely agree with that.

I wish you all the best on this. If you succeed in writing it, I'll look forward to reading it.
