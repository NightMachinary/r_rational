  Publishing house, not sure what POD is.
#+end_quote

Print On Demand. Something like [[https://www.lulu.com/][lulu.com]] for example. Basically, they shop for your book online and, when there's a purchase, Lulu prints and binds a copy, then sends it off. (I haven't used Lulu myself.)

  Its not really about the social validation or about the money. Making money off it would be nice, but I want to be able hold a physical copy of the book in my hands and know I made it. I guess the social validation is part of it, but its less that I want to show off how awesonme I am, and more that I want to create something that stands some slim chance of outlasting me. I want to create something to share with the world, to bring excitement and joy to other people. Hard science fiction is a niche genre of a niche genre, so I don't expect it to be a blockbuster success, but I want to create something that will be sitting on someone's bookshelf fifty years from now, for their kids to pull down and discover.

I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but writing a novel is a /mountain/ of work, so if you're going to do it you need to be really clear on why you're doing it. If your goal is to have a physical product that other people can hold, then I strongly suggest going through a POD service instead of through a publishing house.

The primary value that a publishing house provides is that all the components are under one roof -- editors, cover artists, advertising, distribution, etc -- and all of those components are good quality. The downside is that you have to go through a lengthy vetting process to get accepted, and then they take a slice of your royalties. If what you want to do is produce a book that people can hold, then a publishing house has nothing to offer.

  I'm imagining a back and forth wherein I pick a couple characters in the world and tell their story, and the other person picks another couple characters and tells their story. We write a few chapters, then trade the chapters we've written for editing and discussion. They go over my chapters, I go over theirs, we talk about what we like, what we don't, how to move the larger plot forward, and how to bring all the story arcs together.

This sounds more like a collection of short stories than a novel. If you're working with a co-author you're going to need to plan pretty closely -- have a plot skeleton in place and some details filled in on characters and etc. Pantsing (writing "by the seat of your pants") is not a good plan if you're coordinating with someone else, because you're just going to end up throwing out a lot of what you create.

  Its not that I can't do it on my own, but I've no idea how good anything I made by myself is.
#+end_quote

Get an editor. [[https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=editor][Upwork]] has editors for $20/hr and up. (This is not a recommendation of those people or upwork, just an example.)

Or just post it here on Reddit; people will be delighted to tell you how good or bad your story is.

#+begin_quote
  Could a really dedicated editor do all that?
#+end_quote

Yes. Alternatively, sit down with a friend over coffee and brainstorm, then you go off and write it. It will save you a tremendous amount of time and frustration, and will give you the things you say you're looking for.

  4) What's in it for your co-author?

  The same things that are in it for me. The possibility of making something that might outlast them, that the rest of the world could read and enjoy. Telling a good story that people like is a reward itself, outside of whatever small amount of money might come out of it.

I strongly suggest to you that co-authoring with a stranger over the internet is not going to work. If you really want a collaborator, you will almost certainly be better off finding a friend in atom-space; if you don't have a friend with those interests / skills, then cast your net for a new friend. Go to some creative writing workshops in your area, take a course at your local community college, start a writers group, or go to some open mic nights and strike up a conversation. [[http://nanowrimo.org][NaNoWriMo]] is starting in two weeks, and they have meet'n'greets with the specific intent of helping writers motivate each other. That would be a great place to meet a potential collaborator. (Although, not for this November's challenge!)
