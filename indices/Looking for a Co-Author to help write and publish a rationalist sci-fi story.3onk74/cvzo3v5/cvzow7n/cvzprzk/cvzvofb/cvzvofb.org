The answer to "Why don't the corporations just do X" with restricted technology is always going to be that the technology is restricted. Why would they let a /mere/ AI researcher have access to the technology they reserve for their cabal of rich snobs? Being an AI researcher is a fairly mainline middle class career. No one's going to pay the license fees to upload an AI researcher when they could use that money to repaint their private spacecraft.
