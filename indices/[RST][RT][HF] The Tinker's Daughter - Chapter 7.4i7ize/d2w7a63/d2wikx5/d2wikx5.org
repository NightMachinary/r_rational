  Interesting chapter, but won't the fact that she left the driver mechs there be an issue? Both because they can be tracked to the company that manufactured them and then to the ones they were sold to, and because the company requesting the repairs will notice 2 of them missing when they put the factory line back together.

They are generic mechs used by a lot of companies but yes, they are distinctive. I don't think most tinkers put serial numbers on their work or that there's a central registry, so it would require a lot of legwork to trace them back to her, but it is possible.

Jess is smart, but she's sixteen; sometimes she's not as smart as she thinks she is.

  Not only, but the work she did on the alarmed door, bypassing it like that, is something that probably very few people in the whole city are able to do, so that could be an issue as well.

Yep, the work she did was very clearly done by a tinker and a moderately skilled one. It's low-journeyman level work; most apprentices couldn't do it, but you certainly don't need a Master or above. Then again, any criminal that wants to be able to break into things will have studied these skills. It narrows the field a lot, but it's not a direct pointer.

  In addition, she scribbled down the 3 names she read, right? Where did she put the paper? Was it in the jacket that she left behind? Did she close and put away the document where she read the 3 names? If not, then that could be easily traced back to her.

She put it in her pants pocket, so she still has it.

  Did the jacket have other things in it that could be traced to her?
#+end_quote

It had her callbox. (Essentially her cell phone.)

  The notepad in her rucksack didn't have anything that could be traced to her? Was it a new one, bought specifically for this?
#+end_quote

Yes.

  Last but not least, could you please take a look at the tool you're using to make the .epub? THe issue of there being 2 copies of each chapter within it (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7) has been going since the first one, and still hasn't been fixed.
#+end_quote

I hadn't realized that was happening. I'll look into it; thanks for the heads up.

  EDIT: it could be interesting if you also went the HPMOR way: put the character in a difficult situation, make a full list of everything (s)he has to work with then leave it open ended to allow for a challenge post, where you allow everyone to submit solutions to the character's situation.
#+end_quote

Interesting idea, thank you.
