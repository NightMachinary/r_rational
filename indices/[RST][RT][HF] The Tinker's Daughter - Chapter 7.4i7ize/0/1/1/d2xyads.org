I actually don't see that issue with the epub file... Depends on the epub reader used? I use iBooks on my laptop and use a Kobo ereader. Both show the chapters fine without any duplicated chapters. There's a few strange things though, Kobo doesn't recognize the Title (iBooks does however) and there are duplicated chapter links in the table of content on Kobo (not on iBooks) but they all point to the same chapter (the second links point to the second page of each chapter).
