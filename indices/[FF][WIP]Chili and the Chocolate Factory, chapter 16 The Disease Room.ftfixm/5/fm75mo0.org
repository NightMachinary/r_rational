I theorize that the location Wonka never could get to is the White House because Ronald Dahl never wrote the third book /Charlie and the White House/.

The less than five people in the world who knows about the place could be a reference to how there was only a few characters from /Charlie and the Glass Elevator/ who came from the White House. The [[https://roalddahl.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Great_Glass_Elevator][wiki]] mentions President Lancelot R. Gilligrass, Vice President Elvira Tibbs, and the president's best friend as being from the White House who met Charlie.

Or it's just an attempt to go faster than light with pickle-based fuel to get to the Knid's home planet.

Another theory is that all of the pickles reference is to do with the Knids somehow.
