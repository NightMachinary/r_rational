It just shows how insane just-world reasoning is. Charlie doesn't see any need to adjust his behavior, because how he affects people and the deeds he performs don't matter in any moral/ethical sense.

The world is /fair/. Whatever people do, everyone will get punished and rewarded. So Keerti will get punished sooner or later, or she'll get pass every trial. He doesn't have to think about if he should kill her or not. If she's good, then he won't succeed and it doesn't matter how many times he tries.

By that same logic, it doesn't matter if he's doing anything wrong or not. As long as he's not being punished, then he must be good and every action of his is just.

Therefore, the only way that Charlie will ever realize that he's doing something wrong is if he's punished. [[/u/Nic_Cage_DM][u/Nic_Cage_DM]] Your theory that Chetan is getting warped when the "use his insecurities against him" line comes up is incorrect. Chetan recognizes punishment is the only 'good' thing that people can do for Charlie at this point and the only punishment the children can reasonably carry out is psychological warfare.
