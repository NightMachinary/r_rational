  Lim picked up Mr. Bucket with one claw and held another seven to his neck. "Her face! What did you do with her face? My scanners aren't detecting-"

  Keerthi took off her Commedia Dell'arte mask. Lim dropped Mr. Bucket and giggled.

This object permanence gag is possibly the best thing in this story so far.

I /cackled/ all throughout this chapter. I think I'm missing dimensions of the Commedia Dell'arte bit that are too highbrow for me to catch, but I'm delighted it's here all the same.

God. How was there so MUCH in just one chapter? BUCKET WENT FULL PENNYWISE FOR A SECOND THERE.

And.

OUT ON A LIM. OH MY GOD.

And.

  Keerthi, fresh masks are like sharks in the womb. They love having friends.

Shark embryos cannibalize their siblings

Fridge logic edit: they love having friends. Like one loves having dinner. Or having a snack.

  "It would require a long speech, I am sure none of you want to hear it."

  "Sure," said Tide. "We can move onto the next room."

  "Fine!" yelled Mr. Bucket. "I will tell you, I will tell you! Only because you are all so insistent! Today Wonkaland makes many products! We make bombs and jeans and pollution! If we make it, with only two exceptions, we make it the best! Better than everyone else!"

  "I vape," said Mahuika.

  "Yes," he admitted. "Vapes and..."

In addition to being hilarious now we know there's one other thing Wonkaland is not the best at making. Speaking of mystery plot threads, WHO WAS THE THIRD PERSON WITH WONKA AND BUCKET. And, /brined?!/ Wonka's death is being set up for an incredible +revelation+ gag, I can smell it.

If this chapter's occurrence is the full payoff of the Chopin gag, I'm fully satisfied with the course it ran.

And. And. Bucket YEETED A BABY

  "I vape," said Mahuika.

  Mr. Bucket looked at Keerthi and struck himself on the chest.

  "Yes, you do! But do it out of love, not fear. It is what Lim would have wanted."

Writers who read this sub, take note. THIS is +podracing+ dialogue.

  "Many! There is sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, slavery, lecithin-"

  "What?"

  "Lecithin is an emulsifier..."

See, this is what I'm talking about. This trope is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint][older than God]] and it's played perfectly. It's the rhythm. Every beat lands with the maximum pop. And if anyone thinks I'm attempting to imply in any degree for a nanosecond that this work is derivative or unoriginal, I defy anyone to point to anything remotely like this story. The execution on these gags is /flawless/ and in service to something alien and beautiful and familiar and horrifying and thick and sweet and bitter and airy and crunchy and creamy and a /searing/ deconstruction and monomolecularly sharp. Razors are butterknives compared to the edge on this thing.

Ok, enough fangirling. I need to go proselytize so I can annoy my friends with how EVERY BEAT IN THIS STORY IS FUCKING PERFECT

Edit for meta: [[/u/Makin-]] I see the omission and I choose to perceive it as a continuation of the bit, therefore: hahahaha

EDIT EDIT: WAIT DID WONKA TURN HIMSELF INTO A PICKLE /U/GAIZEMAIZE YOU GAZZTROMPLE DID WONKA TURN HIMSELF INTO A FUCKING PICKLE
