  He pointed with his cane to a statue in the middle of the room. It was black and mostly featureless as far as Keerthi saw from a glance, aside from the face, which resembled an old man's.

  "There is not! There were people in there."

  "People?" asked Keerthi. She ran around to the other side of the statue and looked closely at the sections where the wires fed into it. There were frozen faces burnt into the torso and back of the body, five in total. Two men, three women.

The way I read this, Grandpa Joe is the main statue's face, the other two male faces are Mr. Bucket and Grandpa George, and the female faces are Mrs. Bucket, Grandma Josephine, and Grandma Georgina.

My reading is that Mr. Bucket's fatal flaw was enabling Grandpa Joe's laziness and expensive tobacco habit at Charlie's expense (after all, /somebody/ was *actively* buying all that tobacco instead of the occasional chocolate bar or chicken dinner, and it certainly wasn't a grandparent.)
