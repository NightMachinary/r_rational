I think, on some level, the fatal flaw thing is as bullshit as Charlie's moral worldview. Much like how his belief in a perfectly just world allows him to explain the badness of someone after they're punished, the fatal flaws are all things you couldn't really predict beforehand, just backfit afterwards.

I suspect the gag is, in some sense, about preventing someone/something from speaking, along with being a joke.
