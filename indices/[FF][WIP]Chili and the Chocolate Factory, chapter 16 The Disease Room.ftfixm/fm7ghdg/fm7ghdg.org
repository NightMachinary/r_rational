So. Any thoughts on the remaining kids' fatal flaws?

- Juror's was his laces.
- Chili's was his, ah, gluttony.
- Lim's was his love for Chopin music.

Now, Bucket has been trying to murder Keerthi a few times (in a way very similar to how Chili behaved, I might add), but it never seemed linked to a "flaw"; it's just him saying "murder everyone in this room whose name starts with K".

Although he mentions wanting her to befriend the things he sends to kill her, so maybe he thinks friendship is her fatal flaw?

Mahuika already went through the vape room and nothing happened, so I don't really see what could be in store for her. Some kind of test where you need vocabulary to win? A password that doesn't include the word "vape"?

Tide... I'm assuming it will be related to the diving suit somehow?
