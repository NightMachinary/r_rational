I think the fatal flaws are based off of what gave the kids their golden tickets in the first place, the thing they love the most.

- Juror was incompleteness, so Charlie got him with his shoe laces. (But if I remember right he never tied them because his parents were never there to teach him)

- Chilli's was food, and I think his was more blatant because Charlie had just failed to kill Mahuika. (We know the real reason he "loves" food is his horrible childhood.)

- Lim loved Chopin. (He was also still a baby, who had never had to give up anything important to him, let alone the music he's likely been listening to non-stop since he discovered it.)

- Keerthi's is, of course, that she's a perfectly well-adjusted person, which Charlie can't seem to get a handle on.

Given the pattern,

- Tide's is the ocean and its creatures, which may be where we're headed now. I can't quite recall her family issues, but I think she was abandoned by her parents and raised by the sea?

Mahuika does have another, bigger weakness: No vaping. Where she either gets eliminated, gets saved, or (best outcome) she stops vaping and blows everyone's minds with her advanced grasp of delayed gratification.

As the Oompa Loompas say in the original, it's all the parents fault.

Does anyone else feel the "fuel" might be child sacrifices? Charlie says they'll be patched up, but so far he's killed them all first. Although he's also said the whole point of this was for a "gag". Acronym? Play on words? Just doing this for kicks?
