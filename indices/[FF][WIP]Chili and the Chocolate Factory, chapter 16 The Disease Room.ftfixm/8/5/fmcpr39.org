Surely if Bucket actually wanted Keerthi to die, she would be dead by now. I think he's trying to prove that she is in fact justly protected from his ridiculous attacks - that he is correct.

He killed Juror and Chili and Lim on the first try IIRC. How could he kill Lim if he couldn't kill Keerthi?
