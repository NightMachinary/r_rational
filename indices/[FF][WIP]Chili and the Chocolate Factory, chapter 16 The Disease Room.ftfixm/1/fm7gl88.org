I feel really bad for Lim. Him and Tide really went the extra mile to save Keerthi, even though they had no incentive to do so, and it might actually have endangered their life. And in the end Bucket just throws him with the bathwater.

Mahuika is okay. (that "vaping" line from Lim last chapter was golden)
