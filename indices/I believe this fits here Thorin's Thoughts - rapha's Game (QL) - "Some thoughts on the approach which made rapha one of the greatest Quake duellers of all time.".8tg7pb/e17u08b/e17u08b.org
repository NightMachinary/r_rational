I'm not sure if this fits here. I listened to the whole thing despite knowing nothing about Quake because I'm weird like that. The overall message seems to be "Rapha won against more technically proficient players by planning around their strengths and how they were most likely to act." It's the sort of thing I could see a smart protagonist doing, but it's not really the theme of this sub?

I don't know, I don't feel comfortable upvoting or downvoting this.
