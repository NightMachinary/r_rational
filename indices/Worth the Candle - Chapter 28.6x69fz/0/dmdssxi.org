If you haven't read this, it's a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy (but in a way where you still might want to give it a chance even if that would normally scare you off). [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][First chapter here]] or just [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][read the entire thing on one page]].

Also, this comment from me posted on AO3 might be of interest (I assume very few people read comments there, since I wouldn't if it weren't my story).

  The plot has an end, but there's more middle that's only loosely plotted out in broad strokes, mostly so that I can write in whatever directions feel most natural to me as characters organically develop. I think it's easier with only a single viewpoint character, because you don't need to have people doing independent things that are developing in tandem, but we'll see whether I still think that's true in another 100K words.

  I'd say that 70% of the worldbuilding is done, but the last 20% takes 80% of the effort, and some of that will develop organically too as I go. I have an 18-page worldbuilding doc for this story, which is expected to grow to 30 pages before the story is done. I'm leaving myself some wiggle room in worldbuilding design - exclusion zones by their nature can have confined effects that don't entirely spill out into the rest of the story, so I don't have to have a defined list of all of them and their rules right away. Same goes for races - the major ones are pinned down, but the more minor ones are free to not have definition until the spotlight moves over them.

  I'd say about 90% of the elements come from my time as a DM, sometimes with a twist here or there to make it fit within the world of Aerb, and the remaining 10% are just on my ideas scratch sheet for being included into a game some day. Conversations at the D&D table are obviously not verbatim, and I didn't do anyone the disservice of using their real name, but they're all approximations of friends, and the "real life" plot follows my life closely enough that I think a few people would be able to figure out I'm the one who wrote it.
