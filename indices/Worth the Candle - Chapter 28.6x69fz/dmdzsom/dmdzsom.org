Made me smile.

The [[https://mathnawiofrumi.wordpress.com/story-i-the-prince-and-the-handmaid/][actual story of The Prince and the Handmaid]] turned out rather disturbing with some funny parallels. So then the moral's got to be "poison the goldsmith." If he paid attention in lit, Joon's got this.

The frequency of Joon's ogling has gone up lately. With Amaryllis and her animal magnetism gone, Fenn's now the only eligible gal in the vicinity. Propinquity in action.

I had a thought about forge frenzy. Amaryllis never confirmed or denied that there were more magic items being created compared to the past. If we assume that most (or all) of the items are the result of Earth D&D brainstorming and a billion is a fair approximation for the amount created so far on Earth, then even though the population has been cut by three quarters, the incidence density ratio of forge frenzy would be increasing relative to the population. Might be weak evidence for the Earth-as-principal theory.

When Joon reached Intimidation lvl 10 last chapter, I was expecting him to gain a new virtue. Like the Yellow Power Ring's ability to perceive fears. Too OP?
