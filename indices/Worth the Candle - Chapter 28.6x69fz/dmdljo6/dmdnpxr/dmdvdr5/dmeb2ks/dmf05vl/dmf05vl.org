  AO3
#+end_quote

Can we talk about this acronym for a sec? Specifically, how it /sucks/. If you don't know what AO3 stands for already, you can't really figure it out - it sounds like some sort of shortening of "AoE 3". Sounds both dumb and /boring/.

We should call it "AOOO" - it mentally sounds like a werewolf howling! How is that not /awesome/? Or AooO if we want to be slightly more boring and readable.
