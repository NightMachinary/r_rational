Afaik you can't without it being labeled as a new chapter. And it might make the story flow tedious if there's appendices littered here and there. Maybe on a blog or even as a thread here?

I'd really hate if any information spoiled the story. You could do it in the classic style of lettered (titled?) appendices, where the excerpts are details that won't come up in the course of the story and only relevant to the current chapter(s). Like the Mother of Learning blogs. Or like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vjk83/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dm0ummj/][your post in the worldbuilding thread]] on elvish f√§sh which I really enjoyed (it even came up in a subsequent chapter!).

There'd be no suspense or wonder of discovery left if you just shared your Tome of Worldbuilding. Less is more!
