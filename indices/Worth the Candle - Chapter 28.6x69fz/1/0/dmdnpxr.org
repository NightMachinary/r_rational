This is the second or third time I've gotten this comment, so that means I probably need to go back to ch 19, specifically this section:

#+begin_quote
  There were twenty-seven different kinds of magic, and that was the conservative count. Many of them were hereditary, racial, or otherwise not the sort of thing that was available to just anyone. Looking at my character sheet and assuming it was laid out in a sane way, I would have access to at most fifteen of them, though probably less.
#+end_quote

... but I also don't want to just sit there and list out all the different kinds of magic and their specific gates for a few pages, because that strikes me as the kind of thing that I really, /really/ wouldn't want to read, especially since it would come in an already slow/exposition-heavy section. It would just be masturbatory worldbuilding with no payoff, no connection to the plot, and no character development.

It's kind of frustrating me.

Edit:

  There were twenty-seven different kinds of magic, and that was the conservative count. Many of those only included in the less-conservative count were hereditary, racial, or otherwise not the sort of thing that was available to just anyone. Looking at my character sheet and assuming it was laid out in a sane way, I would have access to at most fifteen of them, though probably less. (I was extremely interested in learning more of them, but Amaryllis thought that all the low-hanging fruit had already been picked. That didn't stop me from asking questions, but she was right that there were significant barriers that it didn't seem like my ability to learn things really quickly would overcome, or which would be useless to us without the necessary resources to capitalize on them.)
