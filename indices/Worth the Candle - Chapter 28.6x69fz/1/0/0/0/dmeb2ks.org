I'm actually not sure how to implement addenda on AO3, since their only unit of content is the chapter. There's no way to say "this goes at the end of the book and should always stay at the end". I might play around with it some to see whether I can have a Chapter 999 that serves as an appendix, with all the chapters of actual prose slotted into there automatically, but I don't want to break update notifications and similar.

The bigger issue is that an appendix would spoil some of the story. You'd get to the place where flower magic is described in full (as an example) and there would be no sense of mystery or discovery left, because you'd have already read all about it in the appendix. That's the case even if the appendix is kept as non-spoilery as possible.
