Yes, but

- If you haven't been on the site (but have heard it mentioned), that's irrelevant
- Most people don't go to the site to read the header - they're there to read the stories. It's entirely possible to never notice the acronym on the site itself.
- Even when you know what AO3 stands for, it still throws you off majorly if you haven't come past the acronym in a while - again, it takes a couple of moments to un-connect it from Age of Empires. AoC, AoE3, AO3, they all sound /way/ too similar.

...

- Werewolf howl. It's your patriotic duty to whatever-country-you-live-in, to use /awesome/ acronyms and not /boring/ acronyms. Also if you don't, you /hate freedom/.
