  As for writers of contemporary fiction, let me mention some stories I admire: “Ralph the Duck” by Frederick Busch; “You're Ugly, Too” by Lorrie Moore; “Men Under Water” by Ralph Lombreglia; “The Bear Came Over the Mountain” by Alice Munro; “Memory Wall” by Anthony Doerr; “Archangel” by Andrea Barrett; and “Medium Tough” by Craig Davidson.

Fresh material to add to the list...

Also, I thought his mention of science fiction as a "marginalized genre" and contemporary realistic fiction as the default was fascinating, or how readers have changed.

Can anyone who's currently involved in that field say anything about the current state of what's accepted/encouraged?
