No worries, looking forward to tomorrorw! Just a tip aside, you can use plugins for your browser to backup the content of any text field so you can recover it if you accidentally delete it / close the site / refresh etc. An example for that is [[http://www.maketecheasier.com/backup-restore-forms-in-chrome-firefox/][Lazarus]] and I have to say this really saved me some troubles from time to time.
