Eh it's frustrating, but I've had worse happen before. Once I accidentally lost an entire ten page essay I was working on and stayed up all night to recreate it for my college writing class. I got a B on that paper and ever since then I've been able to stay calm about losing my work by telling myself that it could have had another nine pages for me to rewrite in 12 hours.
