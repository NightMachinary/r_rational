I think Afolabi is going to cause trouble for Cat although it may have turned out the same irrespective of Cats treatment of him. Also, it looked like Cats treatment of Afolabi sent an important message to Ranker and Kegan.

I can't wait to find out what Cat has in store for Summer. It's good that she can't rely on Masego this time.
