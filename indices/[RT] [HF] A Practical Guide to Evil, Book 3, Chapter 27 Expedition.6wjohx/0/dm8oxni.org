Just some quick thoughts:

- I don't think purposely humiliating Afolabi is a good idea. I agree she was right to put him in his place, but outright bullying him after is just begging for a lasting grudge. I could see Black threatening generals, but I don't see him ever making them do petty tasks to humiliate them.

- What is a "jesha"? I'm assuming it's a rank or title or something, but I don't recall seeing it before. It's from this quote:

  He seemed displeased that Nauk was in attendance, representing my jesha from the Fifteenth.

- On the first night when the fae start their guerilla tactics, it feels like Cat took a tenth of mages for some task. Was it putting out the fires? Because those got mentioned /after/ she said they were tired; and the manner in which she mentioned it implied it wasn't for the same reason the other legions were tired. I'm referring to this:

#+begin_quote
  When we camped out for the night I sent for a tenth of mages, half of what the Fifteenth had left -- the rest had all gone with Robber. More than once during the night I wished I had Masego or even Kilian along, instead of these ones. The difference in skill showed badly. I emerged only around morning bell, exhausted, and found I wasn't the only one in that state. The fae had hit us during the night, in a manner of speaking.

- For that matter, what's Robber off doing with the rest of the 15th's mages?

- Dark humor, but near the end Cat said it took them 6 hours to get the army through the portal the first time, so they'd have to hold for that long again. That's not quite true; they've lost a couple thousand soldiers (maybe a bit less than that). So, hey! Faster exit time!

- I wonder what Cat's trap is going to be...?
