It's a longer trip than the last one, but it's also a lot longer in Creation (about twice as long as Marchford to Laure): [[https://practicalguidetoevil.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/wnkjrov.jpg]]

Also, these are pretty long distances. Per Nauk in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/chapter-19-order-redux/][Chapter 19]] that Marchford->Laure journey would have taken them over 1.5 /months/ of hard marching. Double that, and they'd be traveling for at least 3-4 months.

They might not surprise Akua anymore, but they're giving her a lot less time to prepare than otherwise, I think.
