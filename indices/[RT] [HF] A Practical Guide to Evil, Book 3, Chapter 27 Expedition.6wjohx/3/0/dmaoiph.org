I have to wonder, was marching through Arcadia /at all/ worth it?

- It's the longest trip by far through Arcadia yet, and can't be that much quicker than just marching through Callow
- They're taking /way/ more casualties from the fae than they would in Callow, and the fae here are much more difficult to defeat (as this chapter reminds us, they're much stronger in Arcadia)
- They're not even getting the drop on Akua anymore

Sure, they've refilled their warchest during their most recent siege, but it seems like a poor tradeoff for such heavy troop losses...
