That's perfectly fine. I was just pointing out the fact that you probably could sum it up in a shorter amount of words or even leave it out. If you leave it out, then most readers aren't going to notice it and the ones who do will probably just chalk Allen's fitness up to living on a farm where he's accustomed to hard work and a few centuries of minor genetic manipulation by Albert.

I personally prefer that you leave it in since it's so interesting and demonstrates Allen's intelligence and education with regard to genetics (and a lot of other implications about Nirvanian society), but it's my first choice if you really need to cut out a large number of words out in one go.
