A high density planet can't work for the story because it's a metal-poor world. Nirvana doesn't have an iron core, it's mostly oxides of lighter elements. Lots of silicon, potassium, calcium. Aluminum is the most common structural metal, and it's very rare. Iron and other heavy metals are so rare that they can't even be seen in rich deposits. Uranium and other extremely heavy elements are present in such low traces that even an advanced industry can't effectively collect it.
