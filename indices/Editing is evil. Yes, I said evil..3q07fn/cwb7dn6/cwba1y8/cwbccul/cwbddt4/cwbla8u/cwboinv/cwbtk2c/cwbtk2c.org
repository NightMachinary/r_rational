You're right about the 7 km/s escape velocity (I guess my eyes deceived me, oops). Also I made a silly mistake when I said increased density would result in lower surface gravity at the same escape velocity. It turns out the ratio between surface gravity and density (at a constant escape velocity) is proportional to g = D^{.5}\\
That explains why Nirvana's escape velocity is higher than Earth's at the same surface gravity. Sorry for all the mistakes! I was more cautious this time and calculated that if you wanted to, you could shrink Nirvana all the way down to a radius of 5642 km (with a resulting mass of 2.071*10^{24} kg), giving it a surface gravity of 4.34 m/s^{2} which is 44.3% of Earth's gravity. That seems to verify with the calculators you linked (the mass is .3468 of Earth's, and the radius is 0.8861 of Earth's). I don't know if that's actually a good idea for the story, but I'm decently confident the math and science at least works out.
