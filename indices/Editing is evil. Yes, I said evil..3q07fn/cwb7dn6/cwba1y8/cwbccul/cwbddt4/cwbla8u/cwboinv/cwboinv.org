Hrm. Looks to me like atmospheric water has a lower bound of 7 km/s escape velocity at Earth temperatures. The density of Nirvana is significantly lower than that of Earth, but the planet is larger.

I used the following numbers: Nirvana radius = 2x Earth radius. Nirvana gravity = Earth gravity.

This leads to Nirvana having a radius of @ 12,732km. With @ 9.8 m/s gravity, [[http://www.ajdesigner.com/phpgravity/gravity_acceleration_equation_planet_mass.php#ajscroll][I used this calculator]]

Nirvana's mass is 2.38x10^{25} kg as compared to Earth's mass of 5.92x10^{24} kg. Nirvana masses roughly 4x Earth.

Now, volume-wise, Nirvana is 2x Earth's radius, which means Nirvana is 8x the volume of Earth.

Nirvana masses 4x Earth, and 8x the volume. This means it's density is roughly half that of Earth's 5.51 g/cm^{3.} A vast number of different nonmetallic rocks are in that density range or below.

[[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vesc.html][Using this calculator]] with 4x Earth mass and 2x Earth radius, I come up with an escape velocity of 15.8 km/sec, which puts Nirvana at the edge of the atmospheric helium zone, if it is roughly Earth's temperature.

EDIT - I had a math goof. Calculated escape velocity for Nirvana at Earth's mass, not Nirvana's mass. Corrected now.
