The gravity on Nirvana is a little less than that of Earth, but not much. I haven't put a number on gravity but I'm thinking 95%+ of Earth gravity.

Too little gravity, and the planet wouldn't have maintained an atmosphere or water. I'm pretty sure it's a leading theory that Mars is so dry because it has lower gravity than Earth. (Low gravity leads to atmosphere loss. Low atmospheric pressure leads to evaporation. Evaporated water becomes part of atmosphere and is lost)

Writing rationally in a world significantly different from Earth in gravity or oxygen, where there has been time for evolutionary changes, would lead to a lot of things I didn't want to deal with. Birds, rodents, insects, fish, and other rapidly reproducing animals /would/ adapt and change their forms and functions. It's fascinating but it would have been too much.
