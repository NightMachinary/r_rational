Interesting. I'll have to look at that more closely. Everything I've read on Amazon and about Amazon indicated that if someone were to press the link (which appears on every book's page) that asks buyers to tell them about a better price elsewhere else, then tell Amazon about the page, Amazon would investigate and immediately lower the price of the book to the price it was available for elsewhere. You say this only happens for KU?

I'll have to look at it again, if you're talking from the voice of experience.
