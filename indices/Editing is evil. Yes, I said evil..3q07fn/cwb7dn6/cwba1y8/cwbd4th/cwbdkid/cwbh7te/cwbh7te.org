  I'll have to look at it again, if you're talking from the voice of experience.

I've received an explicit answer from Amazon customer service saying that it's okay to be in KU and still distribute 30% of the book elsewhere.

As to the other part, the following quote is from [[https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A6KILDRNSCOBA][the FAQ]]: "If you choose to make a book exclusive to the Kindle Store, which is a requirement during your book's enrollment in KDP Select..." I don't know why Amazon uses all three of the terms "Kindle Select", "Kindle Online Lending Library", and "Kindle Unlimited" -- as far as I'm able to tell they are effectively identical. Regardless, the question is "do I (a) put it in KU, thereby making it exclusive, and earn money from extra money from borrows, or do I (b) NOT put it in KU and sell it on other platforms in order to make extra money?"
