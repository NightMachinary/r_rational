Actually, Amazon only cares about exclusivity if you're in the Kindle Unlimited program. If you don't KU your book, you can feel free to distribute it for free as long as you want. If you /do/ KU your book, then you can still distribute up to 30% of it for free.

That said, 30% of my total income and 50% of the income from my novels comes from there. It's probably something you want to do.
