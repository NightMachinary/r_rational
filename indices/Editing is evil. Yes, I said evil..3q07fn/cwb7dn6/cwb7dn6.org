Speaking of editing, I wonder why do you spend time in the early chapters talking about Allen's unusual metabolism? Unless it's meant to be a Chekov's gun for later books I think it could be one of the parts that you can cut out without too much trouble if you're looking to lower the word count. I haven't read the beta chapters yet so I don't know if you've reached that point yet or even already cut it out.

In addition, why are you writing an entirely new chapter if it's not going to even appear in the final version?

  When the book is published, all this content will go away.

EDIT: Or did you mean that this will be our only chance to read the chapter for free?
