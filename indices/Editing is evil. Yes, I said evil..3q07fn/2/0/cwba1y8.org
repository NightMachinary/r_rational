The discussion on Allen's metabolism could be a bit excessive, I suppose. I felt like I needed to justify some of his feats. He runs a marathon in about 2.5 hours and then comes back to the farm and cuts wood for more than twelve hours. That's barely within the realm of possibility for any human today, so I decided to spend a little time setting it up. Does that make sense?

The new chapter is a flashback to Allen and Marza's encounter with Rikard (who has been renamed Oskar, to avoid confusion with Riko)

All the Beta content will go away after I am ready to publish, or Amazon will definitely zorch me.
