I /think/ Yeerks in canon /do/ have essentially human aesthetic preferences and /don't/ have force fields. The notion that they might not have the resources to casually switch continents every meal is... I dunno...not /more/ unrealistic than a lot of things we let slide which prevent the technologically space-fairing aliens from insta-winning. (Why not just put all the humans in coma with an Arn bioweapon and then harvest them all?)
