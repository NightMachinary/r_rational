  Arn bioweapon

If you consider the Arn, the rationality of several factions breaks down hard. The Arn were able to create the Hork Bajir to some pretty good specifications, and they were able to mod themselves to die if infested by Yeerks. They should be theoretically capable of upgrading Gedds into very good hosts for the Yeerks but instead they just passively resist and the Yeerks use them for target practice.
