Yeah, that episode was pretty high on the stupidity scale. After the kids poison Alloran, Visser 3 escapes and crawls through a river fast enough that none of the Animorphs can stop him. Seriously, I don't know quite how to say this, but HE'S A SLUG! How can he go /anywhere/ too fast for you idiots to stop him? And even once he's in a river, well rivers aren't freaking rollercoasters, and the kids have falcon morphs. Why don't they at least try to track him down and fish him out of the water? And why do they leave Alloran alive, even though they were totally okay with killing him to get V3 five minutes earlier? And why don't they at least /try/ to take him to safety with them, instead of letting him behind to be re-infested like complete assholes?

And why do the yeerks subordinates even go through the effort of tracking Visser 3 down (which would probably be super hard given the yeerks haven't shown any heat-seeking technology before and V3 doesn't have any mean of signaling his position) when any random lieutenant could go "Nah, I'll let him die in the wilderness and report that he was eaten by the snakes. Also, I'm totally gonna infest Alloran now." since everybody hates V3?

Joker immunity indeed.
