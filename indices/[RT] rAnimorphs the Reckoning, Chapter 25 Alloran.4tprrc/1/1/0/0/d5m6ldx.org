I always got the sense that "We need to help our poor brothers that can only infest Gedds" was only the rationale delivered to the foot soldiers for why they were fighting. The yeerk leadership would probably care more about fast resource acquisition and military supremacy than the livelihood of individual yeerks, especially since their fast rate of reproduction probably made it more convenient to always have more yeerks than hosts available.

In that context, stealing grown bodies makes more sense than cloning/breeding new ones from scratch, which takes more time and resources. Of course, using the bioengineers who designed your main footsoldiers as manual labor and target practice is still a ridiculous waste of resources.
