I am once more so excited to read this. Being a patreon supporter meant I got an email announcement too! No more stalking [[/r/rational]] obsessively!!!

edit: and another interesting chapter. For some reason the focus on Alloran brought my mind to that book where Ax morphs the snake and bites V3 while he's feeding Alloran. In retrospect it's such a goofy premise - evil alien slug wants to go out in nature and eat some grass, commune with nature and all that? If the host needs to eat, just keep regular shipments of turf coming through. If you need somewhere scenic because you have aesthetic preferences, take control of a country club somewhere, put a force-field around it and call it a day. Or if you really can't do that, then get yourself dropped off in the wilderness on a /completely different continent/ where there are no 'andalite bandits' to spoil your day. Omfg. It never bugged me before but it's SO RIDICULOUS.
