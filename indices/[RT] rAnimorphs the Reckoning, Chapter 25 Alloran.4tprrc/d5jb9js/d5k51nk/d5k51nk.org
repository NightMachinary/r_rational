I would qualify the author's comment with the fact that there are some canonical details of Animorphs that are extremely out there (weird alien races or technologies that only show up for one or two books out of the 54) that are played straight by the author. They may seem weird or out of place at first, but the author uses to advance the plot and does good world building for them, but if this was an original fic instead of a fanfic they would seem like extremely weird choices for story telling/world building.
