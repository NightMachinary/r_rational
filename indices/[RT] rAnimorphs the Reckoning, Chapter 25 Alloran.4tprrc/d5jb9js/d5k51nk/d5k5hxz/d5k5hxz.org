Examples that will emphatically /not/ show up in this fanfic, but which will give you a sense of what scruiser is talking about:

- Tiny aliens with a Napoleon complex
- Broccoli as an alien import around the time of the dinosaurs
- A character who turned into a starfish, got cut in half, and then returned to human form /from both halves,/ one of which was good and one of which was evil
- Atlantis. Literally Atlantis, they just went underwater and found it.
- A Satan-figure tempting a character with superpowers /so long as they promise to use them for evil/
- An ant accidentally being exposed to the technology that allows shapeshifting, turning into a human, and developing sapience
- A mission into a top-secret government facility to retrieve an alien toilet
