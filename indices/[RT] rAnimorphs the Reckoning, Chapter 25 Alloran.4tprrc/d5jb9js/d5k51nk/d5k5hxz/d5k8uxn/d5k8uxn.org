#+begin_quote
  A character who turned into a starfish, got cut in half, and then returned to human form from both halves, one of which was good and one of which was evil
#+end_quote

Actually one half was the one who relied entirely on short-term planning and impulsive actions (resulting in a stupidly brave character) and the other who could only do long-term planning and spent all their time second-guessing their plans (resulting in an intelligent but cowardly character). The climax of the story was them figuring out they needed each other and working in tandem to defeat the Yeerk plot-of-the-week before eventually merging.

So yeah, the premise was pretty silly but I think it was a nicely executed bit of character exploration.
