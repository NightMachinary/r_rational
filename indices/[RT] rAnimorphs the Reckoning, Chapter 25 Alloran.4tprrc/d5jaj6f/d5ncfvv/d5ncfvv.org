Maybe I'm alone here, but this chapter makes me root for the Visser a small amount. Maybe you're right and one of his enemies is disorder, but I think the primary enemy discussed in this chapter is entropy, the inevitability of death and the ruination of the specific structures one values. Chaos in general is not a good thing, although it is at least good at destroying bad things. When people say they value chaos, almost always what they really mean is that they value certain specific types of freedom.

  Gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour. “An artist is identical with an anarchist,” he cried. “You might transpose the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man who throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment to everything ... The poet delights in disorder only ... Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will tell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach. It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh, their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street!”

  “It is you who are unpoetical,” replied the poet Syme. “If what you say of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry. The rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious thing is to miss it ... Chaos is dull; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to Baghdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride ... every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and that man has won a battle against chaos. You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria. I say that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape. And when I hear the guard shout out the word ‘Victoria,' it is not an unmeaning word. It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest. It is to me indeed ‘Victoria'; it is the victory of Adam.”

  Gregory wagged his heavy, red head with a slow and sad smile.

  “And even then,” he said, “we poets always ask the question, ‘And what is Victoria now that you have got there?' You think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem. We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria. Yes, the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven. The poet is always in revolt.”

  “There again,” said Syme irritably, “what is there poetical about being in revolt? You might as well say that it is poetical to be seasick. Being sick is a revolt. Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions; but I'm hanged if I can see why they are poetical. Revolt in the abstract is---revolting. It's mere vomiting ... It is things going right,” he cried, “that is poetical! Our digestions, for instance, going sacredly and silently right, that is the foundation of all poetry. Yes, the most poetical thing, more poetical than the flowers, more poetical than the stars---the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick.”

Really, it's a balance of chaos and order that's desirable. On the scale of the universe, things are constantly sliding towards chaos. Wanting to oppose that makes a lot of sense to me.

Visser did grant his subordinates latitude for initiative, you'll recall. I don't know that he's necessarily the control freak you see him as. He does not want control in general, he only wants to prevent threats from taking control over him. Also, for a perverse example, notice that he does not take total control over Alloran. Instead, he takes enough control over Alloran so that there is an "equilibrium" of suffering reached that is pleasing to him.

My problem with Visser is his weird egoism and lack of empathy, not his philosophical worldview.
