Exactly. They're smarter than any human, but they're also isolated from reality by a pretty heavy filter (think Plato's cave) that leaves them with low-resolution information. They can aggregate information over time, but they also can't change their mind without overwhelming new data. They live a long time, but there are very few of them. They can communicate telepathically/memetically, but only with small, small exchanges.

And let's not forget, their planet was canonically resource-poor, as well, so they didn't have the same opportunities we did to learn about metallurgy, biology, chemistry, etc.
