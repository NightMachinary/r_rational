It could also be that Gedds are /really stupid/ creatures. The intelligence of a Yeerk-infested creature is about 15% higher than the creature itself; and while the Yeerk Pool might have substantially higher intelligence, it can't /do/ anything on its own, which makes experimentation really hard.

If a primitive human sees lightning strike a tree and set it alight, he might see the opportunity to build a fire outside his cave and chase away predators. Perhaps a non-infested Gedd is just about smart enough to realise that he shouldn't stick his nose into the flames - a Yeerk-infested Gedd is smarter, but cares less for the safety of the host body, and probably wouldn't bother.

...incidentally, infested Gedds will presumably try to lure more Gedds for infestation. Which, if infested Gedds are less likely to breed, means that there is suddenly an evolutionary pressure /against/ trusting more intelligent Gedds - which translates to an evolutionary pressure, amongst the Gedds, /against/ intelligence. It may be that Yeerks from Earth coming back and introducing a bit of modern biological knowledge to the Yeerk pools might have a dramatic (long-term) effect on the planet...
