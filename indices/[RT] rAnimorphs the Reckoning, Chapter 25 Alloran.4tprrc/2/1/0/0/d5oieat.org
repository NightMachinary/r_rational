I think that only works out if the Gedd-controllers are either (a) still breeding, or (b) somehow causing their uninfested family to breed more successfully (such as by keeping them safe from threats).

If the Yeerks know basic evolutionary theory, they should see the usefulness of (a) - but I'm not sure that the ones back on the planet have any idea of basic evolutionary theory.
