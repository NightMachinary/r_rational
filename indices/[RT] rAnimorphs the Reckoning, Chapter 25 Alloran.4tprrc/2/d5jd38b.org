I'm not sure that the part about Gedds being infested when they go drink in a lake makes sense. As a 'beginning of evolution, this is how first infestations happened', sure, but I'd think that, as times went on, yeerks would infest hosts more efficiently.

First off, I think most species don't put their ears in water when they drink, although the yeerks could climb on their faces anyway (unless they have hands or a trump).

Second, I'd expect the yeerks to be infesting and breeding aquatic and amphibious creatures to defend and maintain their pools since those are immediately accessible. Infest a few dozen crocodiles, teach them ambush, camouflage and coordination (or teach them nothing and let them use their mad crocodile skillz) and getting new hosts quickly becomes less of a problem.

I'd also expect more advanced yeerk civilizations to learn to build weapons and cages to capture and hold better hosts and go hunt for them. You could make a pretty awesome inter-species civilization that way: some species build tools and weapons and have no idea how they're going to be used or why they're building them, other species use the weapons to hunt for new hosts, and have no idea where the weapons come from, only how to use them. While the individual yeerks aren't any wiser, the pool coordinates them all semi-efficiently and oh my god this could totally be a cool video game.
