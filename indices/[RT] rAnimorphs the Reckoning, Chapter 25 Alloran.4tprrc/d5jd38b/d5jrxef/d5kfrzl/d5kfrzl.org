This is basically how I approach the idea of gunpowder weapons in Pokemon. Would humans in the pokemon world eventually invent them? Sure, probably. But that's not the direction their current society went on the tech tree, and at this current snapshot in time, it's not where they are (and even if they did it's not like it would be an instant solution to all their problems: many pokemon are quite bullet proof).
