For sure Yeerks would infest hosts more and more efficiently as time goes on. But remember (Duncan begs) that progress is non-obvious and slow---that humans who were genetically identical to us and every bit as smart and capable were nevertheless living in caves and banging sticks together 10,000 years ago, that Australians never got around to inventing the bow and arrow, that even today there's low hanging fruit we refuse to see or refuse to seize, and that the Yeerk population is basically somewhere between 1000 and 100000, unlike our millions and billions.

Just as fantasy stories can basically go "we're using circa 1200 technology, 'cause I said so," I've chosen a specific moment in the cultural-historical evolution of the Yeerk species. Had the Andalites /not/ intervened, their society would certainly have continued to progress, doing things exactly like those that you described. I agree that those developments are inevitable, and realistic. To some extent, forcible infestation is clearly already a meme, since they're using it on Earth; it's likely that it happens at least haphazardly on their homeworld. I haven't gotten into why the pool itself doesn't need that much defense, but that's also under active consideration.

I just think the story is a better story if we posit that the Yeerks /weren't quite there yet,/ overall, and I'm pretty confident that the chosen point is defensible as one that would realistically exist on their timeline. In other words, your comments about "more advanced Yeerk civilizations" are both correct and non-applicable.
