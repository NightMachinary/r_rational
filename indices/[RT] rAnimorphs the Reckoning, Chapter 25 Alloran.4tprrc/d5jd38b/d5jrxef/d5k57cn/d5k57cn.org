  I just think the story is a better story if we posit that the Yeerks weren't quite there yet, overall, and I'm pretty confident that the chosen point is defensible as one that would realistically exist on their timeline.

Agreed. I think I eugenics program for better Gedds would have made sense, but the Yeerks probably just didn't think of the idea.

My headcanon for the Gedds in canon is that the Yeerks tended to favor more symmetrical hosts and better hosts for usage which tended to get them killed or otherwise prevent them from breeding, causing them to accidentally select for the asymmetrical, practically disabled Gedds we see in canon.

On a meta-level though, I am wondering what the super intelligence of the pool is good for if it doesn't actually let them think of creative new ideas all that fast. Like even if the population of pools is only in the thousands, they are all supposed to be super smart. On the other hand, their information is restricted and the immortality of pools collectively might actually restrict their ability to think of new ideas.
