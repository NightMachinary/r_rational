Natural symbiosis works because the symbionts don't prevent each other from breeding.

If Gedd-controllers don't breed or protect their families, then, in evolutionary terms, being infested with a Yeerk has similar consequences to a rabbit being eaten by a fox. A rabbit that gets eaten by a fox also doesn't breed - which means there is a selection pressure /against/ being eaten by a fox - in the case of rabbits, that's a selection pressure in favour of breeding more children (so there will always be some survivors), better senses to know when the fox is coming, and a better turn of speed. Similarly, if the Gedd-controllers don't breed, there will be evolutionary pressure on the Gedds to /not/ become Controllers, and also evolutionary pressure to not /trust/ Controllers. And slowly, over millennia, the Gedds who are not considered good hosts will be more likely to breed and pass on their genetics, which means the quality of the Gedd hosts will go down - a vicious cycle which the Yeerks can easily end if they know how. Or even if they notice the number of available hosts is dropping, and start making their hosts breed with each other to get more...
