I consider the line about Esplin wanting Order tentative support for my hypothesis that the Crayak (if it's the one that supports the Yeerks) is also the one that supports Order. After all, what could be more ordered than a universe dominated by a single hive mind?

That would make the Ellimist the one that supports Chaos, for example by empowering a group of what are effectively child terrorists to engage in guerilla warfare.
