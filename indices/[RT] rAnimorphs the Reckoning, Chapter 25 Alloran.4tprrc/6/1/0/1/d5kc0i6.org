  Atlantis. Literally Atlantis, they just went underwater and found it

Also, Atlantis with explicit references to raping survivors of shipwrecks to keep their gene pool deep and taxidermied humans.

Man, that book was so weird. I remember buying it because of the orca on the cover, and orcas are cool. I definitely have a softer spot for the few books I owned (as opposed to borrowed from the school's library). The bat one, and the tobias-morphing-ax-to-test-the-demorphing-ray were two others I owned.
