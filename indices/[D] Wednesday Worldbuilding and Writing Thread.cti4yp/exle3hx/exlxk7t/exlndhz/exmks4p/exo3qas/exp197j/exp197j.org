Spells are powered by magic users doing great or terrible feats. A puppet show to get the children's wonder or giving a speech while slaughtering merchants. The more attention you get, the more energy you'll get to power spells.

-I think but don't remember, 60% sure. A spell focus is needed, it gathers energy gained and is used to cast spells.

-A spell is anything you can possibly imagine given form.

-How effective and whether the spell is successfully cast depends on how much energy is put into the spell and how the spell is casted. Like putting on a performance when casing. (The more edgy or weeb you are, the better the spell.)

-Depending on where you got the energy it can effect the nature of the spell, it was explained as

"... energy from an energetic dance is typically suitable for physical attributed spells, while a speech's power might better be used for illusion magic."

Also it's further divided in to negative and positive energy aka making kids laugh gets you white energy and telling a bad joke and angering a crowd gets you black energy.

The best result are using negative energy to do offensive or dangerous magic while positive energy is best for positive or support magic. Negative energy can heal but it wouldn't be as effective as positive energy.

I see this as less tech magic and more as art magic. Note the MC in the story is a plane shifted guy from Earth who has the ability to access 4chan to power his spells. Swears are censored but he has it uncensored on another site that he links to. Also this story is unfinished and on hiatus.

Post 8 in the story is when magic is explained by one of the characters.
