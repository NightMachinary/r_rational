Frankly, the only way a "humanoid mech" would work realistically is in the form of human-sized full body power armour for the average infantry (to minimise front-line losses). Tanks/aircraft alone couldn't bunker down and hold objectives, and neither could giant mechs.

Of course, by then infantry squads or any front-line humans might long be phased out by swarms of small hovering guns (drones?) that can clear buildings of hostiles competently and remote-controlled by operators from miles away.
