That's what I meant about "produced at an equivalent tech level".

I'm aware of the in-universe justification for why mechs are best. The problem is, the only way the setting can justify itself is by irrationally handicapping the tanks.

The first thing a rational protagonist would do is realize that the humanoid form is *actively insane* for a war machine, strip the legs off a Kintaro or a Catapult or something, and mount it on treads. Suddenly you've got a mech that's significantly harder to hit than normal, yet doesn't lose any mobility at all.

With a bit more thought they might realize that hey, combined arms tactics /are a thing/, maybe we should take some of these jump jets and mount them on an airframe?

And now you've got an air force that's significantly more mobile than any mech, and a ground force that's significantly more /durable/ than any mech, and you win /all of the battles/ until people realize they were being silly and start copying you.
