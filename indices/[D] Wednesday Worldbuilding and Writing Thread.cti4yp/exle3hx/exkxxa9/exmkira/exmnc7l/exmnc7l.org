setting-wise, tanks are cheaper but much much more fragile, and far less mobile.

the mechs are all-terrain (even space and underwater), jump-capable, and run with a neuro-helmet. they have fusion power (water for fuel, to get the hydrogen), and damage is more likely to be compartmentalised. mechs were based on earlier industrial mechs.

now, tanks do get used, but are a more defensive garrison unit overall. also, tank armor is weaker than mech armor with several wepons able to bypass armor to crit internal components.
