Have you read Pact? It has some good ideas for this.

Edit: The Craft Sequence books also have an endless source of ideas in their central metaphor of magic as society.

If gods draw on the faith of their followers, what happens if there's a run on the bank? If magic is based on contracts and bargains with powerful entities, doesn't that mean mages are basically lawyers, and a fight between them is basically a courtroom drama? Isn't time travel - altering the past to effect the present - reminiscent of propaganda and censorship, and likely to appeal to the same sort of people?

The great thing about this is that they haven't remotely exhausted it. Almost any social phenomenon has a magic equivalent if you think about it - e.g. if power can be transferred between people, as it can in most settings, what's the basic equivalent of a pyramid scheme? Maybe a cult, or a clan of vampires?
