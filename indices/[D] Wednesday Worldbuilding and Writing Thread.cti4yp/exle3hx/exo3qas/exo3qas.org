/El Goonish Shive/ has a magic system wherein the magic itself literally has a personality and will outright change the rules under which it works if it feels that it is not being used in the way that it wants to be used. (Moreover, it /wants/ to be used, but only by a relatively small pool of people; it thus deliberately resists efforts to try to ensure that it is publicly known).
