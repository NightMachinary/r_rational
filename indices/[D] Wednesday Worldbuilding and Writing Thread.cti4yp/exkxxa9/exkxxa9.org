[[https://www.sarna.net/wiki/Main_Page][Battletech]]. a human-only scifi setting with FTL, giant robots, and some genetic engineering. the setting is generally from 2750 through 3145, with most the activity between 3025 and 3085.

this setting is basically game of thrones in space. a religion controls all ftl communication, and were responsible for keeping the fires of war burning for centuries. the use of nuclear weapons on an interstellar scale caused technology to backslide a lot on two major occasions (1st succession war 2786 and jihad 3067).

what should rational fiction in this setting of nobility with armies of giant robots look like?
