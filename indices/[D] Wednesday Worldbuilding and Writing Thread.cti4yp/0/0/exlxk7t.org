Sanderson's Laws ([[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][First]], [[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Second]], and [[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-third-law-of-magic/][Third]]) are worth a read. The first is probably most important:

  The author's ability to resolve conflicts in a satisfying way with magic is directly proportional to how the reader understands said magic.

So let's say that magic is a conversation, or it's art, or it's something that's not intuitively logical/mathematical. The only problem with this is that if you're using the magic system to resolve conflict, that resolution won't be satisfying unless the audience really understands why it worked (a consequence of conflict resolution being a matter of tension, which can't exist if the audience doesn't know why things are tense).

The first thing you're going to have to do is work out the boundaries of your system, even if it's going to be incredibly soft. Make a list of things that magic can do, and then a list of things that magic can't do, which will be invaluable in helping to keep the system feeling consistent, even while it's still soft. You should also figure out the linchpin uses of magic in the story as soon as possible so that they can be properly foreshadowed, which will keep the climaxes of scenes or of the plot as impactful as possible. If magic is a conversation, what does the conversation with magic at the climax look like? If magic is artwork, what does the artwork at the end look like? Working backwards will help you a lot.

I personally think one of the biggest problems with making a soft magic system is the question of why you can't just repeat the magic, which you'll probably want some answer for. Any system with repeatable and clearly defined effects will likely be at least a little bit hard, which doesn't seem like it's what you want.

(DaystarEld and I have two podcast episodes on magic systems [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/][Part 1]] and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/][Part 2]], which go over some of my thoughts in a lot more detail. It is a podcast though.)
