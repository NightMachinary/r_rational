It depends on what kind of themes you want to contrast against technology. If you consider technology as the collective, easily manufactured, spread, and used, then make magic a fundamentally individual process. Every person has their own "tuned" aura that interfere with one another, making it impossible for magic users to collaborate or even work close to one another. Structured magic loses coherence the further away from its creator's aura it gets, so it can only provide benefits in a localized area.

As for the actual use of magic being more artistic and less scientific, you could take a page from /Pact/ and make magic a form of imposing narrative over reality, creating a personal story and convincing the world that's the way it works for a time. Rather than measuring things in terms of points and resistances, make it about how convincing a mage can be, whether through oration, sleight of hand, or acting.
