Everybody has a personally unique interface to magic which they understand intuitively. Different interfaces have different capabilities, strengths and weakness. (Maybe mages acquire their magic system by taking a particular hallucinogenic mushroom or something). If a mage's magic is known about by people other than the mage then the mage's magic weakens in proportion to how large the information leak is how (how detailed the knowledge is and how many people have it).
