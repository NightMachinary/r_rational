Not quite as good as the previous chapters, I think, but I still look forward to where the story goes from here. It's been a little while since we've heard from Voldemort, I think ...

Glad to see Lesath, though. And a good point from [[/u/ArisKatsaris]] in the HPMOR thread:

  Also I feel that Harry's "to control Dementors" is somewhat badly expressed, if Harry's supposed to be expressing the truth of what happened here. "to fight against Dementors" or "to protect against Dementors" seems more accurate than "to control Dementors".
