  You could selfishly hate Death.

Quirrel supposedly can't cast it. Invoking Death of the Author for a moment, I don't actually think it's about hating Death per se.

"Ignore bad things, think happy thoughts" = animal patronus

"see bad things, feel bad" = no patronus

"See bad things, and thing happy thoughts about /ending the bad things/" = human patronus

Death is just the largest, most horrific example of "bad thing people try to ignore" that Harry (and the Authors, if they weren't both under the DotA clause) believes exists in reality, and thus the Dementors symbolize Death more than they symbolize other types of suffering.

A person who wants to end their /own/ suffering is not the same as a person who wants to end /suffering in general/.

  I'm curious if as I commented on the last chapter, anyone is going to start wondering how he knows it was certain to kill her.

This doesn't explain how he knows, but I think that if he didn't at the very least /believe/ the human Patronus was extremely dangerous to the user, the Phoenix wouldn't have come to him when he was considering using it on the Azkaban Dementors.
