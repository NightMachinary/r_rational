Okay now I Have to go back and re-read ever chapter Hanno shows up in. We have a protagonists raised in an imperial orphanage raised up by her conquerors and exalted by a man with a will against heaven, and a developing antagonist raised by an imperial refugee orphaned and cast down by thier host city's bad government (presumably before exultation by the God's).

Not even to mention Hanno's evident value of the human experience, some of the discussions I imagine there are about his inhumanity (I've only seen him called a p-zombie but the way he repeatedly rewrites his procedural memory . . . )Well yes That, and Cat's current human/other dichotomy I hope her new name will mitigate

Bravo and well crafted
