  Yet you also mention, and Blue laments, that the current Elite Four members were undefeated. I don't think this is something Blue himself would casually overlook. Why /doesn't/ he manage to achieve what they did? What did they do that he didn't? What didn't they do that he did?

Blue had two competing goals: to win undefeated, and to issue and complete the required challenges in as short a time period as possible. I believe it was mentioned that those who were able to complete the challenges undefeated took longer to do so. It's only natural that it would take longer to be assured of success. Blue impulsively tried to shave off time in his speedrun attempt, but he wasn't ready, so he ended up failing the undefeated goal by prioritizing the speed goal.

Also, despite him being a main character of the story, there's no inherent guarantee that his talent and capabilities match all of the famous trainers he's comparing himself to. Wanting something and working towards it aren't always enough. Even among Olympic-level athletes, not everyone can be a world-record holder.
