As [[/u/Alphanos]] said, Blue had delusions of grandeur: he's definitely above average in skill, but he was trying to beat the records of his idols, not just getting his badges faster than they did but also assuming he'd be undefeated. He lost because he simply didn't put in the time or training that he needed to make sure his pokemon were strong enough or well trained enough.

As for "use a stronger pokemon," there's definitely more skill involved in that than in the games. They try to put a soft limit on how powerful your pokemon can get too early by making your pokemon occasionally not listen to your orders if they get too high a level: I believe the threshold before the first badge is level 30 pokemon and up stop listening to their trainer.

But while a good idea and a cool concept to reflect the trainer's lack of experience making it hard to control more mature pokemon, it's poorly implemented. Level 25 is more than enough to beat the first badge, hell, level 20 is even overdoing it. On top of that, the power difference is just so strong between levels that even if your pokemon stops obeying you all the time, as long as they get one attack off every few turns they'll still melt whatever's in front of them.

So yes, Blue's idea (because he still wants to win quickly) is to put in the time and training not just with his other pokemon, but also to train his unruly shiftry for the raw power he needs. Having such a strong pokemon is an invaluable asset, and taking the time to train it properly should be a high priority for any trainer that gets one.
