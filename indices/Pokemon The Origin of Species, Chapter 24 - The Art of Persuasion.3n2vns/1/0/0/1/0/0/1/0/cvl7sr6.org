I am not sure if you're responding to the wrong person, or pointing out that the passage only says traded pokemon with no reference to caught pokemon.

In the case of the second, while it may not specifically state that caught pokemon will disobey neither does it say anywhere on the page that they will not, and I have personally had it happen (for whatever that's worth).
