have you had it happen to you? I am currently at 70% certainity that it only happens for traded pokemon, as i have reached excessive levels in the early game before without pokemon disobeying. (level 30 pre-first gym, once in saphire, when i got lost. level 70 before gym number 8, in gold.) I could be mistaken, though.
