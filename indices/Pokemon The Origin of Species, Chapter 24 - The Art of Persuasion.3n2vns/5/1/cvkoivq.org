Hey, thanks for the typo spot and the feedback. I actually thought of just showing what she writes, but had two problems with it: 1) It would mean a chapter with pretty much zero dialogue and all exposition, and 2) It would miss an opportunity to show Leaf and Laura's relationship develop "on screen" rather than as an informed trait.

That said, I probably didn't get the balance of information and immersion right. I had the same problem with chapter 6 originally, and ended up rewriting it after publishing to make things more compelling. If I can think of a way to do that this time around while still respecting 1 and 2, I'll do so :)
