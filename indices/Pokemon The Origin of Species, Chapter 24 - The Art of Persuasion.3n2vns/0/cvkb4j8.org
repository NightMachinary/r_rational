Hey all, welcome back! Two things of note unrelated to this chapter: First, I finally got around to updating Chapter 1 to improve the characterizations of Red and Blue off the bat. Second, I finally completed and uploaded a digital copy of the full flowchart that Red used in Chapter 20 upon noticing that he was upset. I put it in an earlier post, and here it is again:

All feedback on either is appreciated, as always!

As for this chapter, I just want to quickly note that the grant application and endowment process for research is far more streamlined and rapid in the Pokemon world than ours. Red's experience, grueling as it is, is not at all representative of the full struggle researchers in our world go through.

I'll get around to another major edit wave for the chapter sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, feel free to post any typos I missed in response here.
