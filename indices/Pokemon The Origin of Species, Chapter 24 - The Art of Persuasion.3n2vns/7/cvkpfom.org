One minor thingie. Leaf used "logic, emotion, and ethics", but not appeal to authority.

I'm assuming you're referencing the notion of Logos, Pathos, and Ethos... but I think Ethos/ethics in that context actually means a sort of appeal to authority of the speaker. (Or have I totally misunderstood?)
