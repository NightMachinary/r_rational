Yeah. Just that you grouped them, making it sound like you were talking about the traditional rhetorical "logos, pathos, ethos" thing.

Other than that, just a question re clarification:

Are we meant to assume that Red eventually off screen told Blue, Leaf, and his mom that it turns out that he's psychic, or those conversations haven't happened yet?

Oh, also, was wondering why didn't Leaf want to explain about how she didn't want to do a "humans vs pokemon" thing?
