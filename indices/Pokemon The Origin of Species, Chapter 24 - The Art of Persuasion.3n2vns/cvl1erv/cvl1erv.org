Also, on an unrelated note, I'm considering perhaps writing a short half-a-dozen-chapters fanfic in the same world you're presenting here, exploring a contrasting but similar perspective from the work you're doing here based on both the details of the universe you've explored so far and some suppositions/explorations I've mentally made of the same subject.

Would that be ok with you?
