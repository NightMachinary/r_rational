I'd imagine that Magikarp are not known to evolve into Gyarados by most people in-verse, perhaps, or that it takes a lot of time and training for a 'weak' Pokemon such as Magikarp to evolve when taken out of the game context.

I mean, if you need to train and work with a 'mon who can only flop about until it evolves, it's unsurprising most pass it off as too much effort.
