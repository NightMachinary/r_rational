I'm disappointed in myself for forgetting about Significant Digits- I do think it has rationalist elements and fits the bill. But I would characterize TOoS as having a "teaching" rationalist tone that ironically is more reminiscent of HPMoR than Significant Digits.

And I will definitely give the Draco Malfoy fanfic a try, then... It's just getting pretty hard to keep up with all the HPMoR fanfics we have nowadays.
