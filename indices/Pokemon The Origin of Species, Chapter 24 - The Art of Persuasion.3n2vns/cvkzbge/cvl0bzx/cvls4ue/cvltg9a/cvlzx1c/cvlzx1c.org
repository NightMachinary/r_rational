True, but those are the only two that I'm aware of continuing to update. Might have missed a few, I haven't tried the Following the Phoenix sequel yet so not sure about that one.

There was also the Ginny Weasley one too, but that finished, and turned out to be kinda disappointing anyway, for all it's occasional brilliance.
