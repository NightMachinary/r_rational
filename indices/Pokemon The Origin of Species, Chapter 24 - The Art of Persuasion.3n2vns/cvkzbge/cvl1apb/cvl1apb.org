It's simple. in the games, adult pokemon are substantially stronger than the basic ones. shiftry is fully evolved/metamorphosized and with the removal of general levels as per the video games, or at least the loss of the interface, this is one of the most obvious patterns- raichu can do more than pikachu, which is generally true. plus, while shiftry aren't amazing species in top-level play in the games, they are a substantial upgrade from squirtle, pidgey and rattatata, while a smaller downgrade from from other potent pokemon, like steelix and alakazam. compined with type advantage, (shiftry is grass/psychic, and onix's special defense is mediocre.) shiftry is a very dangerous weapon against brock's pokemon, and that's why blue wants to use it.

the setting seems to break the pokemon rules on occasion, but this is a pretty common one.
