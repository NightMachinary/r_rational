Blue's section was thin because he had two chapters to himself just before this. Not that I'm trying to balance each character perspective perfectly, but I like to mix it up when I can.

As [[/u/notaheroyet]] says, more evolved and older pokemon are generally much stronger than younger ones. I'll add a few lines about it though :)

And I'm glad to hear you're getting so much from the story. Thanks for reading!
