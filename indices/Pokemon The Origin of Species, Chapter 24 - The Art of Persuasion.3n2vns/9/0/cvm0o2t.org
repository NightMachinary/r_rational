  The first is simply this, are there no state/country grants?
#+end_quote

There are, but they very rarely give them to independent researchers, let alone novice ones.

  While Red is pre-committing to stopping his investment before it gets out of hand, and even though he added the "for now" on his project, it's also a common behaviour for people to have an inertia to resume their previously abandoned projects. Would it not be more realistic considering his character to also stipulate a future point where he might approach this idea gain, re-evaluate its worth and perhaps repeat the process? After all seasonal interest might also have an influence in his various rejections.
#+end_quote

Possibly, but I think his perspective is that he'll find so many other things to potentially research that short of some other new observation making this one relevant again, it won't need to be revisited anytime soon.

#+begin_quote
  I brought up the first point because I thought it would work well with this second point. Postponing his grant applications until the annual grant proposition period seems like a reasonable and well defined goal for a rational Red.
#+end_quote

You know, I think that works pretty well. It's a long shot from his perspective, but at least worth a try. I'll add that in when I get the chance, thanks for the suggestion :)

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps I'm just over thinking this because I'm more involved with this kind of stuff nowadays, but either way keep up the good work.
#+end_quote

Not at all, comments like yours encourage me to keep thinking through my ideas and refining the story. Thanks for the feedback!

Also, are/were you Denubis on Fanfiction, by chance?
