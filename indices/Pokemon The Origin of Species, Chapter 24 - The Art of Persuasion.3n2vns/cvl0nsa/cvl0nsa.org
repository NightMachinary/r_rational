Ok so first of all, good chapters all around lately, I haven't had the availability to comment on the updates but I've read them all as they've come out and I've appreciated a lot the full characterization of the universe as well as the gradual build up of the characters and their reactions and expectations to the society around them.

Pulling now from two different but intertwined points, I would like to explore again the idea of scientific publications on the Pokemon world.

The first is simply this, are there no state/country grants? You mention the Pallet Lab as an option, but even if there are more organizations and private companies performing research all around I would imagine the governing bodies(which I'll honestly admit I don't really remember which structure you've described as having) possess a general research grant proposal system to prevent from any one lab unfairly advantaging their local researchers instead of the most skilled ones. This would not be necessary to be a current option, because I would assume this would be similar to our world, and like many countries, those specific grants would be open for submission on a strickly defined period of time with annual regularity. This ties into my second point.

While Red is pre-committing to stopping his investment before it gets out of hand, and even though he added the "for now" on his project, it's also a common behaviour for people to have an inertia to resume their previously abandoned projects. Would it not be more realistic considering his character to also stipulate a future point where he might approach this idea gain, re-evaluate its worth and perhaps repeat the process? After all seasonal interest might also have an influence in his various rejections.

I brought up the first point because I thought it would work well with this second point. Postponing his grant applications until the annual grant proposition period seems like a reasonable and well defined goal for a rational Red.

Perhaps I'm just over thinking this because I'm more involved with this kind of stuff nowadays, but either way keep up the good work.
