In a previous chapter, you mentioned that letting Blue win in his first match against Brock would have set a bad precedent storywise, that you felt it would reinforce a stereotype of him. Yet you also mention, and Blue laments, that the current Elite Four members were undefeated. I don't think this is something Blue himself would casually overlook. Why /doesn't/ he manage to achieve what they did? What did they do that he didn't? What didn't they do that he did?

As a rational fiction protagonist, he should perhaps want an answer to this before he comes back, and "use a stronger pokemon" shouldn't be the whole of his solution without some reflection, it would feel nearly as cheap to the story as being handed the victory in the first place. Now perhaps it can be part of it. Shiftry is Dark. Did Agatha win her gym trials with a strong lead of ghosts and poison? Did Bruno win with rocks and fighting? If so one might deduce that matching pokemon to your personal type affinity is important, and justify Shiftry.

Or perhaps, the exceptional circumstances by which Blue's skill and friends for backup led him to own a massively overleveled pokemon ahead of the gym rating schedule (first badge, oh, and my guy's level 30 btw, pikachu, quick attack that rock to death) - in exactly the same way that the Elite Four have managed. Through personal risk and hardship, they get powerful pokemon ahead of schedule and so blow through the tiered ranking system that didn't plan for that.

Or maybe I'm just full of it. What do you think?
