I was reflecting lately on how the way narrative laws that shape the Names and influence stories in the PGtE world compare to the concept of [[/r/teslore/comments/aqyo1f/mantling/][Mantling]], or the idea of [[/r/teslore/comments/6dfhsm/could_i_get_a_simple_explanation_of_the/][enantiomorphic configurations, in the Elder Scrolls lore]]. I think there are interesting parallels there. TES does not draw a thick line across a Good/Above and Evil/Below binary though, with its complex and shifting alignments to Aedric and Daedric entities.
