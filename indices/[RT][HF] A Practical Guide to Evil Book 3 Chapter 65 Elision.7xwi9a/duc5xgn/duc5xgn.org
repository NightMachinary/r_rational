Also, in terms of power, we seem to finally see hard limits of Break.

Previously it broke the containment spell of Duke of Violent Squalls, a particularly inconvenient gate to the palace in Laure and what I'm assuming to be a ward the fairies made from souls of residents of Dormer. Here, though, all it could do was to kick the chair from under Diabolist.

My theory is that, assuming Akua didn't somehow find out about this Aspect and thought how to include it into her illusion, Break cannot affect Squire's opponents directly, only destroy their tools (possibly, the ones she can't Take).
