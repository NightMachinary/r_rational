Cat might reasonably think that a version of her who worked with William, and never had that particular talk with Thief, would have the Bard in her band. After all, the Bard /was/ in William's band.

I agree that the spell must also force extrapolations that lead to Akua's desired "Kneel" outcome. Either that or Cat did it all on her own--she might be arrogant enough to believe Akua's ascending to the throne is inevitable without her intervention! But the spell would be kind of unreliable in that case, so it's probably built in.
