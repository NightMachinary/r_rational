This is a strong argument in favor of the path Cat chose, and I want to clarify that I'm not saying pursuing heroism /wouldn't/ have been worse for Callow. I just don't think the scenario presented in the illusion necessarily shows what would "really" have happened. Whether or not things would actually have gone that badly--and they very well might have--I'm speculating that the /reason/ the illusion shows them going badly is because it's what Cat expected, not because the spell has actual knowledge of alternate realities or the ability to accurately predict them.

Personally, I think it would be more interesting that way. Cat's deals with the devil have more weight if there's always some doubt as to whether she's helping or hindering Callow in the long run. Having /proof/ that, for instance, her heroic path would have ended with Callow in tatters would kind of take the wind out of those sails.
