i just realized that the whole split in the chapter was an illusion, akua is not dead, yet.

- just before the split: "What began as a broad procession grew narrow as it rose, leading to *tall gates of bronze* that now stood sealed. Behind them, I knew, awaited the woman I had come to kill."

- last words of the chapter: "My boot touched the stone. I looked up to doors of *bronze wide open* and began the climb..."

this chapter was either the monster, akua is too cool to use real monster and used mind games as the big scary thing you have to defeat before the BBEG, or is /the trial/ the tribulation the hero must face before earning the right to challenge the BBEG. i am leaning for the trial.

also the chp ended with cat singing the girl who climbed the tower.
