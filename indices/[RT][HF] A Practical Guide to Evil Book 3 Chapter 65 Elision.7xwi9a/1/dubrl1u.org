A part of me desperately wants to think that Akua's bluffing ... but she's been avoiding the idiot ball thus far, and killing Black before Cat could ever have a chance to save him is /exactly/ what someone sans idiot ball would do.

I do know one thing for sure, though - the wait for the next update is going to /kill/ me.

Also: "In linguistics, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision][*an elision*]] or deletion is the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant, or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase." Any ideas on the significance of the chapter name?
