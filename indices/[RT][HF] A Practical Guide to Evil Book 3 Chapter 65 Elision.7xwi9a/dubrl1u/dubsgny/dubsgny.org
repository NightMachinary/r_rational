I'm pretty sure Black is actually dead (though he may not remain that way for long), as EE is heavily hinting at a transition here. Black's death here is a great catalyst for such a transition, regardless of if it's to Knight or Queen.

Edit: Reading this again, I'm a bit less certain on Black's status. Everything between Cat taking the first step and the last paragraph appears to be part of the split lives thing, and so Akua never said those lines. I still think Black's dying here, though
