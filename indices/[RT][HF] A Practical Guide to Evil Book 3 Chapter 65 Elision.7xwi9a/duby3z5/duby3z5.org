If Black really is dead this could be Cat's transition into Black Knight - with killing (fake) Akua being her Choice. It would fit with the "We Do Not Kneel" mantra too.

It seems like Cat has passed the Trial. I think this wasn't really Diabolist - just an illusion or a flesh puppet. It might be that Akua doesn't need her body to live considering how her soul is part of the Breach control mechanism. The Monster is either Black or the illusion was truthful and it will be a Summer fae.
