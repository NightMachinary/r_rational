So I think what happened is that Cat experienced 3 illusory alternate lives, in which the day that began her story as the Squire ended differently, setting her life on wildly different trajectories. Every version of her life led up to a seemingly hopeless moment when Akua stood before her, in the fullness of her mantle, and demanded obeisance. In order to pass the trial, Cat had to rise and strike at Akua in /every/ lifetime. She had to be the kind of person who would do that regardless of her experiences and her role. She had to be able to do it even if she wasn't Named, even if she wasn't Black's apprentice, even if she wasn't a villain at all.

Everything that happened between Cat approaching the sealed bronze doors and "splitting," and Cat proceeding through the now-open bronze doors, was most likely part of the illusion.

I'm not 100% sure about "only one strike," but it may have referred to the fact that all four lifetimes had to converge on a single shared decision, a single strike.
