The illusion itself was Akua's doing, a way to force Cat's line of thinking into a groove that would fit her desired story (Cat losing her way and becoming Akua's Black Knight).

The bullshit is courtesy of Black, who decided to turn it into a trial and so set Cat on the path of eventually stab Akua for real, at the cost of being captured.
