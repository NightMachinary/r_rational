Probably Akua set it up. I could be wrong, but I believe this was the "trial," one of the key story components you have to face when assaulting a villain's stronghold.

The quality was probably more than just wanting to stab Akua really hard, since none of the 3 alternate Cats had the kind of personal grudge against her that our Cat has. I'm guessing something in the vein of "determination." Which fits quite well with Cat's internal narration about how the trial tests you for a "trite and actually fairly common quality [you'd] had in [you] all along."
