Okay, so the alternate Catherines were really cool, but /oh my god/ I can't wait 'til this stories goes back to making sense again.

Seriously, I have no idea what happened, what will happen, what is important, what was real and what wasn't, how exactly the "Only one strike" thing worked, and what are the consequences of anything that's happening / not happening.
