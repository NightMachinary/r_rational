Something that struck me about the Pyrrhic nature of heroic!Catherine's victories:

On a first read, this seemed like confirmation that Cat was right all along not to pursue heroism. Just as she expected, driving out Praes came at the cost of thoroughly wrecking Callow.

But what's more likely--that this trap faultlessly extrapolates the alternate realities that would result from changing key events, or that it simply generates scenarios based on the memories and expectations of the person it's "splitting"?

I suspect that heroic!Catherine's victories were Pyrrhic because Cat /believes/ they would have been--needs to believe it, even.
