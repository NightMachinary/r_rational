Also I'd like to point out that by sending Lone Swordsman to stir up the rebellion Squire ensured that the uprising would be as small as possible, and so there would be relatively few casualties (even if the following campaigns turned out to be far more bloody). Even Akua's interference didn't inflict that much damage on Callow itself.

If Thief was right and the potential five hero band was to match the Calamities, then the Calamities would actually take the field alongside the legions - and there would be more legions, so the rebels would need more levies, and all knights would come out too. If Truebloods, and Heiress specifically, would interfere the same way to achieve their own goals, their contingent would have actual household troops and devils it it. If, best case scenario, the legions were driven out, Black would indeed order to scorch the earth and wait until Procer pounces on the opportunity.

But the problem, as both Black Knight and Squire understood it, was that sooner or later Heavens spamming heroes /had/ to end up either in a heroic party or at least an open rebellion. In Southpool Assassin couldn't risk Thief manifesting a third Aspect or surviving in some other way that would allow her to become his mirror in the upcoming confrontation, and had to let her live questioning whether she's actually a hero instead.

So, when the first instance of meeting a rebel group ended with Squire facing the Lone Swordsman, the decision to spare him looks dubious both for her and the readers. But Catherine didn't pick just any hero. She picked William.

William "All my associates are knocked out in a burning building, time to brood" Greenbury.

William "Hey, let's play with goblinfire and take the entire Summerholm hostage" Greenbury.

William "Free brainwashing for everyone" Greenbury.

And she basically set him up to fail, too:

  If you want your way to beat mine, then come at me again. Properly. Earn your Name, hero. Run and hide and muster your armies in the dark. Make deals you'll regret until you have nothing left to bargain with. I'll be waiting for you, on the other side of that battlefield.

He came back at her, making his story not about freeing Callow, but about beating Squire (note how during the first rebel meeting he talks about blowing up Black Knight next, but after starting the uprising he focuses on killing Catherine). Her story, meanwhile, is about appropriating the Imperial system to rise to prominence and protect Callow. So he gets what he wants, and kills her - but that's the end of his story, and so /she/ gets what she wants and leverages her claim into getting resurrected and crowned, and her story goes on. Cue Squire killing the Swordsman.

He earned his Name by entering Arcadia and getting all three Aspects there - but those Aspects' main function is just giving him the perks of an average hero (fencing that he was already good at, healing that the Gods Above usually provide anyway, inevitable victory) despite being a gritty antihero. Catherine, by the end of the first book, still had potential for growth - and so she outgrew the rivalry with William, while he was stuck in his tragedy that could only end one way.

He raised an army, something he was uniquely unsuited to do - and so had to ask Procer for money, hire Helikean and dwarven mercenaries and deal with the band he didn't know how to lead. As a result, most of the knights stayed in hiding, the main pitched battles had the mercenaries instead of Callowans suffering the biggest casualties, and the band was essentially just William and Almorava after Summerholm.

He made deals he regretted until he had nothing left to bargain with - not even his own life, sacrificed for a stunningly bad, if desperate gambit to turn the tide of the uprising. Squire basically straight up told him to lose undermine himself, and he did so, until the very end.

I'm sorry for this digression, but I wanted to lay out that Lone Swordsman was a terrible rebel leader, and Catherine had limited the scope of the conflict (and with it, the damage) by forcing him in a Role he was unfit for.

Back to the damages wrought, though. For someone who made a point of using devils and demons to set up her transition, Heiress did remarkably little damage. Her intervention was too limited by the scope of the rebellion, but also by the systematical undoing of every reliable piece of her forces. Even her carefully set up pattern of three went unnoticed by Catherine, and so affected only Akua.

She used human sacrifices, but instead of, say, taking the rebels for this, she purposefully lost two thousand slaves she herself bought (and about a thousand of her fantassins in the process), and sacrificed them for a pack of devils that was dismissed a couple of hours later.

The fantassins allowed her to take Dormer and pillage rebel holdings, but that only resulted in her mother having to pay the reparations for it, and later she decided to dismiss them to not pay for the campaign and to rush for the ritual site.

Even the demon she used on the mercenaries instead of Callowans, and while the casualties from it hampered the Fifteenth, the only long-term consequence of it was the gate in Marchford, which the Empress countered by positioning Squire, Apprentice AND the entire Fifteenth legion at it.

To sum it up - while I think that Catherine may be somewhat shortsighted in the areas she has no experience in, all her actions as the Squire were directed towards limiting the damage to Callow - and she was successful at it, too. If the Fate didn't have both Courts invading Callow to set up Squire and Diabolist as equals for their final confrontation, Catherine may well had rooted Akua out before she did irreparable damage.
