To elaborate on how unsuited William was to take decisions on his own: if you look back to the examples I used to illustrate his "brilliance", you'll notice that most of his bad decisions came after he was forced into the Role of a leader. The initial plan of smuggling out written-off munitions to catch the Praesi off guard and then blow up the key figures was viable, it just wasn't enough for his desired outcome to stir up the rebellion while the Praesi are on the back foot.

In contrast to that, aside from the earlier examples, I'd like to point to Interlude: Nemeses. Bard starts hinting that Heiress will have a role (and a scheme) to play in the siege, but William doesn't get it. She /physically throws hints at him/, but he ignores them. She all but says that Catherine still has to face Akua one last time before she can actually be killed, but William still ends up dismissing that. In the end, Bard sighs, and basically tells him: "Fine, if you don't want to actually think about the plan, do the stupid brainwashing thing".

The end result is that instead of sparing Catherine to let her die to Akua's trap and then killing Squire and Heiress, he puts her down for less than an hour. All because he refused to look beyond the limits of his personal tragedy.

Even the Hashmallim only try to save his life by making Cat the one to take decisions instead of him. Had he won, he still would die as the angel would enter Liesse.
