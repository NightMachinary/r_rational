Do you think that Cat would include the Bard in her potential heroic band after her talk with Thief in Laure?

Personally, I think it's something in between, a bunch of visions that mostly rearranges the past events but also adds extrapolations that would put the whole experience into a perspective benefitting the creator of the vision (kind of like Contrition's vision of Queen of Callow, only with "Kneel" instead of "Repent" as an inevitable outcome).
