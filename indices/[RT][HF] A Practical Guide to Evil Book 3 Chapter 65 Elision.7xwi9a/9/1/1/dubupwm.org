Honestly, this feels more like the monster, to me. It was something directly set up by Diabolist to attack Cat when she tried to enter, not really a twist within Cat to make her worthy of victory. She hasn't changed in any meaningful way, or made any profound conclusions, she just badassed her way into it.

The trial will look more like when she withstood the pressure from the angel in the climax of book two. "Justification only matter to the Just" was big character development at the time.

At a guess, I'd imagine the trial will be accepting that Black is really dead, and that she's the next Black Knight.
