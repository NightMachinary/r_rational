My understanding is that when Cat reached the doors a illusion of some kind triggered and showed her three different lives:

In one she became a Squire of good and lead the ragtag band of misfits into defeating the empire in a bloody war. When she was about to win procer came knocking she fought them off too. the empire was in a civil war Akua defeates Malicia and became empress; she comes at the head of an evil army and ask Cat to kneel.

In the second Cat became the leader of the shadow guilds. The empire entered in a civil war, and cat took the chance to screw with the empire. procer came with their crusade and cat fuck them too. Akua won the civil war became dread empress and came to command Cat to kneel.

In the third Cat went to the war college without meeting black. Rose through the ranks with lots of blood and help from Akua's mother. She became her general and helped her defeat each of the empire's armies in Callow with poetic beauty. Then the empire retreated out of callow to fight the civil war leaving Cat the defacto leader of Callow. Procer came knocking and she was in diplomatic talks with them when Akua apperared as the dread empress and a flying fortress and asked her to kneel.

Then she was shown the current future. she fights with akua and she seizes the weakness in Cat's soul and forced her to kneel.

Cat said fuck you and stabbed akua in all of the parallel lives. That broke the illusion and the doors were now open.
