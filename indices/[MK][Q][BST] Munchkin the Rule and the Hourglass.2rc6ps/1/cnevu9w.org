'aight, pretty sure i've got a complete utopia genesis plan. only the rule is necessary, nothing here requires the hourglass.

first, claim any supernatural proof award generic enough for your items to qualify. [[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prizes_for_evidence_of_the_paranormal][wikipedia]] says that'll net on the order of one-and-a-half million. use this money to buy several diamonds of the highest quality/size you can, the use iei to make them into 10000 carat monstrosities (this is preferable to gold in every meaningful way, because gem worth increases exponentially with mass). the "very large gem" market probably isn't big enough for sustainable cash via this method, but it'll be good for at least a few billion. next, commission very small samples of perfectly-pure metals (a microgram or so). at this point, you either abuse a) the si definition, or b) the way item enchantments work in 3.5e. si (and presumiably ei by extension) can be stacked an arbitrary number of times on an object, provided the previous casting was permanencied:

#+begin_quote
  Shrink item can be made permanent with a permanency spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.
#+end_quote

the meaning of this is obviously intended to be simple reversion and reapplication of the first si, but according to strict raw allows recursion as well. :y

the second method is by exploiting the fact that an item (and by extension its enchantment) designation is fundamentally unique and intransferable -- that is, an enchantment cast once may only apply to one continuous body at a time by the 3.5 rules. if, therefore, you split an item on which iei has been applied, the end result is a smaller body of unenchanted material and a larger body of enchanted material; both cannot have the same effect at the same time. crucially, this operation can be repeated; you can split the larger body into two objects, both of which smaller than the unenchanted first piece, and that piece will remain unenchanted (the item designation doesn't leap across space to the largest remaining part).

the end result is, of course, that you may produce arbitrary quantities of a material with the same qualities as the original. applying this to the previously-obtained metal samples, you can create a complete monopoly on all homogenous materials -- and by extension, acquire absolute control of the economy.

the next stage is to leverage complete market control into complete political power, thereby ending coordination problems and (by using your magic) scarcity of basic resources. a rough fermi estimate indicates that a single use of the rule can create 2e8 l of an arbitrary material. since a human requires something like 0.5 kg of soylent per day, you would only need to use the rule eighteen (!!!) times a day to feed the entire populace of the planet (provided you hire people to fill and process the gargantuan vats of nutrition powder). since you can produce any raw substance orders of magnitude more efficiently than any competitor, the planet will quickly become entirely dependent on you. bask in your global dictatorship.

the final stage is the reapplication of the populace to tasks that strictly advance humanity. there are a lot of jobs that are no longer necessary (retail, finance, agriculture, etc.), and those people can be reassigned to research or manufacturing. more importantly you can direct research directly onto high-yield subjects, and tailor incentives to match maximal efficiency. of particular note it would be important to reduce x-risk as much as possible very quickly; eg by introducing total global surveillance for nuclear weapons and ufai. it would be fairly easy to colonize mars: people most likely count as "items" before complete information-theoretic death, so it would be trivial to isi them (with the cloth option), dehydrate and freeze the dolls, then resuscitate them upon arrival. equipment and habitats can be miniturized and stored in the same way, and since cloth is fairly light there would be a payload mass reduction on the order of 20000 times. especially with antimatter propulsion (antimatter is, ofc, as easy to duplicate as anything else), you could achieve obsene quantities of dv while holding all equipment necessary for a complete mars colony -- and probably shorten the transit time to a couple of months.

next, get everyone working on friendliness theory until you're absolutely confident that you're correct. win everything forever.
