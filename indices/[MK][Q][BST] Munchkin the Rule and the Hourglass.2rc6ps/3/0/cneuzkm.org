  Enlarge/shrink something that is made up of atoms.
#+end_quote

...can you provide an example of something that you could enlarge / shrink that /isn't/ made of atoms?

#+begin_quote
  Enlarge/shrink something larger than three Planck lengths. See what scientists can do with the edges of it, which change positions at FTL speeds.
#+end_quote

Well, for one thing, you can make the entire Nobel committee cry as relativity and thermodynamics go out the window.... :>

  Check whether cloth-like things are affected by normal processes. If not, it would be good for storing medical isotopes, blood/organs (or organ donors)/forensic evidence, food, antimatter, volatile chemicals, hazardous waste, or pretty much anything else.
#+end_quote

Ooh, yeah, good one.

  What does an alloy of shrunken and normal metal act like after you cancel the spell? (and the same for an alloy with Enlarged metal)
#+end_quote

That would be interesting...I think it would look like metal with holes in it, but the holes would likely be (sub)microscopic.

  Make a reactionless(?) drive for a spaceship. Start with the item at the front of the ship, and enlarge it. Launch it at the back of the ship, which requires that a (large) opposite force pushes the ship forward. While the object is still going towards the rear of the ship, shrink it. Catch it at the back, absorbing the (small) amount of momentum it has. Launch it to the front again, slightly slowing the ship. Enlarge it, and catch it at the front, absorbing a large amount of momentum and speeding up the ship a lot. Repeat as needed.

Ooh, clever.

  Check all the definitions
#+end_quote

Nice. I hadn't thought of those.

  Abuse the hardness-negating properties of Adamantium. A 2-inch thick iron door has 60 HP, meaning that a normal commoner could break completely through it in about 10-20 hits with an improvised weapon like the Rule.

Hey, no fair! This is the real world, you can't play RAW games out here! ;>
