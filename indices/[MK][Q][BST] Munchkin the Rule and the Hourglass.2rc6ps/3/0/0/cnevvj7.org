  ...can you provide an example of something that you could enlarge / shrink that isn't made of atoms?

More specifically: Something that "being made up of atoms" is a relevant feature of it.

This was inspired by a rationalist idea I heard (and lost track of). It basically goes "on Monday, phones work by [Electromagnetism, radio waves, etc.]. On Tuesday, phones work by magic. How is the world observably/testably different between Monday and Tuesday?" Apply this to enlarged/shrunk objects, and get "On Monday, they are made of atoms. On Tuesday, they are made of magic. How is the world observably different between Monday and Tuesday?" and then test anything that would be different between "Monday" and "Tuesday".

Examples:

Material for a particle accelerator: They can measure individual atoms (or smaller pieces).

Something iridescent: It interacts with light on a single-wavelength scale. Would it still result in the same colors at 16x the size, or would it change?

Presumably a bag with 1000 marbles turns into a bag with 1000 very large marbles. Would a bag with 1 mol of buckminsterfullerenes turn into a bag with 1 mol of very large buckminsterfullerenes, or a bag with 4096 mol of them? If 1 mol, then see if it can enlarge atoms on their own (and find the limit for how small something can be). If 4096 mol, then find the limit the other way. Does a bag of 1 000 000 very very tiny salt crystals turn into a bag of 1 000 000 large salt crystals or a bag of 4 096 000 000 very very tiny salt crystals (etc, etc.)

Basically anything "nano-" would work for the tests as well.
