  Can you cast IEI on food without harming people,
#+end_quote

Probably not a good idea to eat something with an IEI or ISI on it; the command words would remain active throughout the duration, so if someone used one of them around you then something inside your body would either shrink or grow.

Nope. I've added that one (and the explanation) to the original post.
