1. See what happens when you shrink sentient people. Stop their heart, make them clinically dead, shrink them, wake them up.

2. Make a rail gun. Shrink a metal tube, put it in a foam circle, surround that with a metal cannon, have some object at the top of the cannon that it can expand into. When you expand the metal tube it will with great force expel whatever is above to the great beyond.

3. Fly. Get a helium balloon, expand and contract the balloon as needed.

4. Attack any forces still opposing my rulership. Expand buildings around them, shrink the ground beneath them.
