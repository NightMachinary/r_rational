  Explosives-free demolition. (What happens when you unshrink a metal sphere in an area too small to contain it, or let shrunken water seep into a rock formation?)

It expands from its shrunk size to its normal size in 1 Planck time. Whichever is stronger (the surroundings or the unshrinking item) gets broken.

Yeah, that would make for some pretty effective demolitions.
