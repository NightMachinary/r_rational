Clearly the first thing I'd do would be go pick up some loose diamonds with a bit of savings, increase their size, then make the change permanent and resell them.

After that, I'm not entirely certain. Probably get a metal melting setup, buy things made of gold, melt them down, then enlarge them and sell the resulting gold. Once I'm independently wealthy, own a substantial chunk of land that's paid for, then I'll probably get down to !!Science!! dwarf fortress style, but with fewer cats and less gore.

Will have to think on it for a bit :)
