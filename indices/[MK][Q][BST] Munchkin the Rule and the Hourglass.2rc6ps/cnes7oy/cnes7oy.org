Firstly, I ask this because it specifically states that it's me, in the real world.

Has anyone considered the forces that would be imparted by the rule if it were touched against an object that then changed size to make it larger? That's a whole lot of acceleration. Your hand would probably be vaporized by the energy transfer. The shockwave through your body might cause hydrostatic damage to organs.

Heck, those things might happen due to the items expanding even if you don't have to touch them with the rule. Think on the forces acting to accelerate the air around the object away from it. The larger the object, the more air displaced.

Unless there's built-in munchkin values to prevent real world physics from applying?
