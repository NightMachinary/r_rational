Down at the bottom I suggested doing this with cheaply-available 24k gold foil, available from your favorite baking supply store. You give me an interesting idea though:

1. Buy gold thing (coin, necklace, whatever)
2. Enlarge
3. A coin the size of a quarter is now about 8" across and 1" thick. Dig into the side of it, scoop the gold out from the inside of the object.\\
4. Shrink it down again -- your digging site is now not even a scratch. Unless someone checks it with a microscope, it's undetectable!
