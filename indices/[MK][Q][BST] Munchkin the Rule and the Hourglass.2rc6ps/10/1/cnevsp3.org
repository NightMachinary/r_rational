Nice thing with diamond is you can make it from regular carbon, so you wouldn't need to use the hourglass. Just craft a large high pressure container (using the converting to cloth and tailoring trick, maybe) from scrap metal, put some pure graphite inside, and shrink it to pressurize it...

Probably make sure the graphite is pre-shrunk, so once it is crystallized to diamond form it can can be expanded by canceling the spell to create huge diamond chunks. These can then be converted to cloth and back again as needed to craft them into usable machinery and so on.
