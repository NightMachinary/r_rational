It's a magical ruler. Do I have to tell it a number, or can I use it for divination?

For instance, command the ruler to change length to a number of inches equivalent to the first drawn number in tomorrow's lottery...

After divining the Powerball numbers on a big lottery pot, go spend a couple dollars at the convenience store, and you would never have to try to figure out how to keep the ruler a secret. Once you're worth a couple hundred million, you can start playing the stock market carefully.

Ruler, based on the page of characters in front of me, change to a length that corresponds to the first character of tomorrow's top performing publicly traded stock...

After that, well, it's time to start asking questions about real unknowns, like codifying a system to determine if there is alien life, where it is, how smart are they, are they dangerous, etc.

Somehow, I doubt the ruler's capable of divination though.
