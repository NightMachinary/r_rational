There's no limit on how quickly you can say a command word. So it can be arbitrarily short, as long as there's enough energy to be around 60dB (but no requirement to be discernible).

Apply the rule and hourglass to the head of a piston, put a speaker within 10 feet of it, have the speaker repeat the command words at a high rate. Hook up to a generator, and there's free energy.

How do these work at the atomic level? Are more atoms added/removed? What if you grew something, changed one atom, and shrunk it again? Would it return to normal? There's probably something you can do to get free energy/matter.
