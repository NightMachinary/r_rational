*Science!*

Enlarge/shrink something that is made up of atoms. See what scientists can do with it (especially the LHC or someone with an electron microscope). Repeat with the cloth-like material.

Enlarge/shrink something larger than three Planck lengths. See what scientists can do with the edges of it, which change positions at FTL speeds.

Check whether cloth-like things are affected by normal processes. If not, it would be good for storing medical isotopes, blood/organs (or organ donors)/forensic evidence, food, antimatter, volatile chemicals, hazardous waste, or pretty much anything else.

What does an alloy of shrunken and normal metal act like after you cancel the spell? (and the same for an alloy with Enlarged metal)

See if it breaks the square-cube law. If so, start building out of enlarged materials.

*Build Stuff*

Make a reactionless(?) drive for a spaceship. Start with the item at the front of the ship, and enlarge it. Launch it at the back of the ship, which requires that a (large) opposite force pushes the ship forward. While the object is still going towards the rear of the ship, shrink it. Catch it at the back, absorbing the (small) amount of momentum it has. Launch it to the front again, slightly slowing the ship. Enlarge it, and catch it at the front, absorbing a large amount of momentum and speeding up the ship a lot. Repeat as needed.

Enlarge a factory one piece at a time (including the inputs). Use it to build very precise computer parts and other stuff. Optionally, shrink the stuff coming out the end. The stuff could be precise to a fraction of an atom-width.

*Check /all/ the definitions*

Check out what the definition of "weighs" is (for pi/4 oz.). Is it calibrated for the buoyancy caused by Air (only)? For any fluid that it is in? Do centrifuges cause it to press against the outsides with more force? What about an accelerating car? What if the committee that decides these things changes the definition of an "ounce"?

Check what the definition of "volume" is. If you cast it on a (very large) piece of flat cardboard and then fold it into a 2001 cubic foot box, does it still work? What about casting it on the box then flattening it? Does casting IEI on an item that is currently Shrunk check its normal volume or its current volume?

Check what the definition of "item" is, both at casting time and throughout its life. From other answers, it looks like an object is defined by the matter that makes it up after the moment of casting, but what about when it is cast? Can you select a chip bag (but not the chips), or one board, but not the other one it's nailed to? What about if they are glued together as strong as plywood, or just sitting on each other, or two pieces of metal welded together?

Check what the definition of "speech" is. Is an MP3 player included? What about SIRI, text-to-speech programs, or phone calls? Do homophones trigger it? What about if the speaker has a strong accent?

*other*

Abuse the hardness-negating properties of Adamantium. A 2-inch thick iron door has 60 HP, meaning that a normal commoner could break completely through it in about 10-20 hits with an improvised weapon like the Rule.
