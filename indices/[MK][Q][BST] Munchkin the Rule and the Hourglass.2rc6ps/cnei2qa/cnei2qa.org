Here's a couple interesting ideas for the Rule. Cast ISI on radioactive waste, cast ISI on cargo to make transportation easier (can be used to help out the space program), and you can probably discover some new laws of physics through some investigation.

Can you cast IEI on food without harming people, since they will have pooped it out of their bodies by the time the magic wears off? Or will they absorb the materials into their bodies and die when the magic wears off causing their bodies to expand in lethal ways? Remember kids. Professor McGonagall says to never transmutate anything into food!

P.S. Can we use the Rule on the Hourglass and/or vice versa?
