Yes. By the effect of the spell.

Normal Object. + Shrink item = Shruken Object. Object can be 'expanded' (returned to normal object). Doing so ends the spell. If the spell is made permanent, the item can be expanded (returned to normal object) and Shrunk (back to Shrunken object) an indefinite number of times, instead of /once./ That's what that line means.

Your confusion comes from the fact that you think the RAW rules mean 'have the shrink item spell applied' when it says 'shrunk' and 'have the expand item spell applied' when it says expand.

This is impossible, because the expand item spell does not exist. It was created out of whole cloth by Jake in his wish for the rule of size. It does not exist by RAW, and thus could not possibly be referred to by RAW.

Also, you are selectively quoting RAW, which is a big nono. More important than that is the sentence at the beginning which reads:"You are able to shrink one *nonmagical* item"

An item with an active, permanent spell effect is not nonmagical, any more than an Animated Object is non-magical.
