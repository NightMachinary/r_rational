  the problem comes with distribution and its cost
#+end_quote

the reason that food scarcity exists isn't because it's /impossible/, it's because it's /not incentivized/. if an agent (the rule owner) no longer has to compete, they are free from incentive structures and can do as many selfless things as they wish (because /there are no longer any selfish options/)

#+begin_quote
  enchant a Bouillon cube sized piece of food and send it through fedex with the enlarging word to be used once before cutting.
#+end_quote

the problem with this is scaling. you simply can't say enough words to feed the entire impoverished populace with this method. better to leave the distribution to the unpowered, while focusing the magic on things that require it.

(good small-scale ideas, though. maybe for quick disaster relief before duplication mechanism is set up)
