You'd need the Hourglass otherwise after 1000 days all the items made with your generated materials and food consumed (and subsequently processed by the body) would shrink back to it's original size. There's no clear definition of what happens to say a chunk of brass made made of 50% Zinc and 50% IEI'd copper speck, but all the scenarios aren't very good. Sudden structural failure of everything made with /just/ Rule multiplied materials is a given.

The same problem happens when the Soylent that's been magically produced shrinks back to it's original mass as well, sudden rupturing of cell walls, proteins falling apart of completely disappearing depending on how much of a person's diet is soylent. The only parts that would survive this process are cells or structures that don't get replaced very often, which would probably be bones and some form of neurons (not sure about these surviving it mainly depends on their replacement rate and if their structure is also largely permanent or is replaced with new materials).

TL;DR: Without the hourglass the civilization built on replicated materials would suffer collapse in ~2.75 years when everything starts to fall apart.
