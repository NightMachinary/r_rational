Feh. That would kinda cause an issue, wouldn't it?

Ok, assume that the magic somehow makes it so that the direct act of shrinking / enlarging something doesn't kill you. You can still die from secondary effects later -- put a shrunken car on your head, enlarge it, you'll be squished. But while you are actually in the process of using the Rule you are protected from the effects of that use.
