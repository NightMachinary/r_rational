Let's see. Double the radius of Earth whenever we want to launch anything into orbit. Doubling the radius of Earth and keeping the composition the same yields an 8x multiple of mass. 8x the mass with double the radius creates a planet with roughly 2g surface gravity.

So, increase planet size, then toss whatever we want into the air, and shrink the planet again.

Of course, I'm not entirely certain what would happen after the entire atmosphere of Earth is pushed into orbit at 6378km
