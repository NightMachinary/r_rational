Just throwing it up wouldn't get it into orbit, orbits aren't that easy. It'd just be @ 1 earth radius with just the upwards velocity of your throw. To orbit you need sideways velocity, in the case of this orbit at 6371 km (3959 miles), ie 1 Earth radius away from the surface, you need 5592 meters per second (or 12510 miles per hour) /parallel/ to the surface.
