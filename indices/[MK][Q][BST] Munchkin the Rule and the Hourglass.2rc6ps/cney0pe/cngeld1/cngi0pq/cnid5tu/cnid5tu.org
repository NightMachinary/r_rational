If you were able to grow the Earth to 2x radius, launch, then shrink the Earth again it would reduce the launch fuel required. You'd still need a lot of deltaV to get to a stable orbit.

There's an additional problem with that though, the expansion of the Earth would completely destroy anything not affected by the IEI when the surface expands 3.6k km in an instant. There might be interesting affects with the gravity waves as well because of speed of light propagation. At the very least it'd be a smooth but fast transition from 1G to 2G of gravity as the amount of Earth attracting you expanded at the speed of light.
