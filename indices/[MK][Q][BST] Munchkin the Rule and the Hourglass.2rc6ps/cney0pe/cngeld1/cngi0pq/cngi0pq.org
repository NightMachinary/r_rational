You're definitely right, but giving anything a 6371km boost out of Earth's gravity well would be a rather big boost, even if you did have to add on some delta-v to keep it all from falling back to Earth again.

To get it into a stable orbit, it would probably just be easier to boost the payload into a geosynchronous orbit from there, rather than accelerating parallel to Earth's rotation. Not going to do the math for it though :)
