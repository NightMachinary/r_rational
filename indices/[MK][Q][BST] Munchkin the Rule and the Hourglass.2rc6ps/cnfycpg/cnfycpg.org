*Medicine*

Well, multipliying precious elements were suggested already, but we're forgetting about chemistry (most important, medical chemistry). If a liquid in an open container counts as an object, you can IEI/Perma it. If it doesn't, you need to IEI/Perma crystallized forms. Some technology may need to be developed, but you have several billions by the time and can afford to hire best of the best, especially if it's for saving alot of people.

*Science*

By the way, there is THE question as to how exactly does IEI/ISI work at microlevel. It's important, because it can't just create 8 atoms in place of 1 - otherwise anything but pure elements, and for sure anything organic would transform into something (probably white and amorphous). Also, if it just multiplies subatomic particles, then we'll immediately be left with heavy elements (and IEIng anything heavier than Magnesium would surely result in explosive nuclear fission).

This question is important because it shows that IEI uses some arbitrary level at which is starts multiplication. For example, if IEI can enlarge corpses without turning them into biomass, then it's surely able to multiply cells. If we can figure out this "illusion of common sense", we would be able to, for example, IEI large complex of detachable apartments (built specifically for this purpose with our billions) to produce not rooms for giants, but more rooms for humans (because this is already happening with cells in corpses, which aren't fundamentally different from our rooms). Actually, we can start to multiply literally anything. IEI big organized storage facility, setting level of multiplication accordingly - get octuple it's contents. Assume smart automatization and exponential multiplication - we're going into post-scarcity pretty fast.

*Safety*

If you trust your goverment to have a better judgement on what to do with Rule and Hourglass (and if making people lives better is in your high priorities), you should probably give these items to them as fast as possible. If at least one of those statements are false, you'll need tohave some safety precautions against secret agents and sniper bullets, because even insane goverments would recognize immediate existencial threat.

So, you'll need to work some security features. "IEI the Earth if you try to take the Rule from me or if i die" could be a nice idea, but may not stop some radical group. You'll need some life detector on yourself as well. Good security personnel is a given, still may not help against combined effort of a large goverment. Perhaps showing them that you're serious may help - doubling some deserted island, or maybe some major construction (yes, i'm looking at you, Great Chinese Wall) is the most decent idea i have atm.
