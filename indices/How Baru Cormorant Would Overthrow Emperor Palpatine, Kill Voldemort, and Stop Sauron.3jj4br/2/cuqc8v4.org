This is awesome! His tips to Ripley are the only ones I question, though. If you try to ransom the coordinates to the company, what's to stop them from quietly capturing and torturing you? Or sabotaging you in some other way, and demanding the coordinates in exchange for backing off? You can't hide a bully's lunchbox and say "Be my friend and I'll tell you where it is."

But, this is all in the fun of thinking about rational characters. I realize he didn't write this article to be his final word on these plots. The rest is quite awesome :)
