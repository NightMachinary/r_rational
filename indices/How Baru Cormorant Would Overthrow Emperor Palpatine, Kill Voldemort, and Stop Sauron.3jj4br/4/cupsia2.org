I recently finished reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] and, based on this fictional Q&A, Baru reminds me a lot of said fanfic's main character (minus a few slices of ham)

EDIT: The story isn't complete. I say finish to mean I read it from beginning to its current point, which I would approximate at around 55 chapters (forum posts)
