Oh, my sense of visceral horror isn't unthinking it's that a marketing analyst smart enough to presumably understand the concepts of and massage the data of a neural network, and thus falling into the mental bin of potential in-tribe members, is believable depicted as a wire-header.

If your argument about status quo extends to wire-heading, I'd direct you to the Prime intelligence series.
