Having just seen 'it' happen in episode 20, I've got to say it was everything I could have hoped.

Like some people said above it seems to slow down a bit between episodes 10 to 20, but to me it just seems to vary its tone instead of losing momentum. Sometimes it's more of characters muchkining their way through their reality(in exceptionally awesome ways), other times it's political manuvering interspecced with character moments interactions which revolve a lot around self-improvement and achieving their objectives through strategy and work.

It's quite a bit of a slow burner through 'big' events, but I sometimes find myself so entranced by the verbal joust in the dialogues that the 20 minutes of the episode just fly by.
