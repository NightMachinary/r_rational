This. Season 1 (I watched the show and read book 1): Kirito is the object of all the ladies' affection, yeah, but it's not played poorly, at least not as poorly as it could be, and Asuna is a BAMF for the most part.

Season 2: it's the kind of plot that makes me want to watch it just so the bad guy gets punched in the face. Asuna does things that hardly matter--some exceptions--and in the end has to be saved. Like that hasn't been done before.
