Because there is such a thing as character agency?

And using a romantic partner held hostage for character motivation is hardly original/interesting/romantic/anything-whatsoever-in-a-positive-term?

Like I said, I found the first book passable as nothing too engaging(and yes, romances can be engaging, when they have fully fleshed out characters, stories and concepts to support themselves) and I did finish it and started the next book.

But then that was such an awful development that it pretty much shattered any suspension of disbelief. It marked the story as ending any possibility of being a romance story with equal partners, to being some kind of fantasy of the main character rescuing the imprisioned girl while she dangles over a precipice of threats.

And if you're not seeing any problem with the statistical over-representation of that same trope in entertainment past then I really don't see how I can continue this conversation?
