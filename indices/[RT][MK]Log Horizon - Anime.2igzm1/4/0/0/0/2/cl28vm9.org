  Because there is such a thing as character agency?
#+end_quote

...Being kidnapped/imprisoned eliminates character agency? Since when?

#+begin_quote
  And using a romantic partner held hostage for character motivation is hardly original/interesting/romantic/anything-whatsoever-in-a-positive-term?
#+end_quote

Bullshit. Its a cliche precisely because it's romantic and a power motivator for a hero. I'd certainly agree, however, that it isn't at all original. But then again, so few hero-motivations are.

#+begin_quote
  Like I said, I found the first book passable as nothing too engaging(and yes, romances can be engaging, when they have fully fleshed out characters, stories and concepts to support themselves) and I did finish it and started the next book.
#+end_quote

I can agree with that.

#+begin_quote
  But then that was such an awful development that it pretty much shattered any suspension of disbelief.
#+end_quote

What? How exactly did that shatter your SoD?

#+begin_quote
  It marked the story as ending any possibility of being a romance story with equal partners, to being some kind of fantasy of the main character rescuing the imprisioned girl while she dangles over a precipice of threats.
#+end_quote

What? She escapes at numerous points and helps undue what amounts to a mass slavery scheme.

As well, why do romantic partnerships need to be equal in game? Why is it such a terrible thing for one partner to be more important, because they're the primary protagonist?

#+begin_quote
  And if you're not seeing any problem with the statistical over-representation of that same trope in entertainment past then I really don't see how I can continue this conversation?
#+end_quote

No, I really don't see an ethical problem with it, if that's what you mean. I'd agree that it gets boring after awhile, but it certainly doesn't warrant the word "disgusting."

Just curious, would you have had such a major problem with it if it was Kirito who got kidnapped, and the plot played out in exactly the same way except gender swapped?
