  Being kidnapped/imprisoned eliminates character agency? Since when?

In this case, it turns a character who, at least for her first few appearances, actually did things which were fairly impressive - was second in command of the largest guild, ran raids, helped Kirito basically duo kill the first boss, is generally known as a terror in her own right with a nickname and everything - into a whining completely ineffectual damsel in distress, whose only escape attempt exists primarily to set up a tentacle scene.

Yes it's bad writing, but it is even more damning because before the romance arc started around episode 8/9/10 ish, Asuna actually seemed to have a lot of agency for a main female in shounen.
