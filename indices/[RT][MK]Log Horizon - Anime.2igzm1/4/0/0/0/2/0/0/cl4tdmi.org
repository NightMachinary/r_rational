  Asuna actually seemed to have a lot of agency for a main female in shounen.

I've seen a lot of shonen and SAO is definitely one of the worse ones when it comes to character agency, even before ALO started. Naruto is another bad example, yet most of the female characters are independent and fight their own battles.

When Asuna wanted to leave the guild for a while, it was Kirito who had to fight the guild master for her right to do that. We are told she is amazing, but we never actually /see/ that past the second episode. The only thing the anime insists on showing us is how good she is at /cooking/, of all things.

Furthermore, the only contribution Asuna had to the 'final' battle was when she broke the game mechanics using "the power of her love" (and just how she did this was never explained), just to die a moment later, serving as nothing more than a device to motivate Kirito.
