It has the same simple premise: "real worl people stuck in an RPG".

But while I wouldn't say it is 100% rational, it goes in a much more satisfying way in exploring the setting:

-The characters strive to improve themselves and the world they are in, instead of just going along with the usual game motions.

-They work around and through the game's mechanics to exploit them to their advantage.

-There is a big emphasys on explaining details to the viewer, from episodes which are pretty much only about battle tactics to short bits at the beginning explaining mechanics like the economy of the game or mob spawning behaviour.

-When it deals with characters and personal drama it seems to strive to make sure that it deals with the politics of characters interacting more than just stumbling into situations brought on by external events.

And many more small things that make it much more enjoyable to me.
