So wait, it's the exact plot of SAO? That's a bit strange.

I did just finish up the first SAO, I think there's more offshoots of it or something, but is this one better? More rational?

SAO did fairly good at setting up the rules but then the characters just started breaking the rules like they were in the Matrix when it was convenient for the plot...
