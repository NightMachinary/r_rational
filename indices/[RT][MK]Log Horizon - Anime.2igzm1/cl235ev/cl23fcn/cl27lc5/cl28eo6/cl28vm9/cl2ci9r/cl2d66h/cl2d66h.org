Everything everyone does is to show how awesome Kirito is. He's about as Gary Stu as anime protagonists get. That's not a gender problem it's a writing problem.

The fan service was indeed annoying, but again I wouldn't call it ethically wrong or disgusting.

Fyi I don't think SAO is a good show. It was ok and it totally had some awesome moments. I just didn't understand the disgust.
