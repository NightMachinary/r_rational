  Bullshit. Its a cliche precisely because it's romantic and a power motivator for a hero.

That's the problem. Everything girls do is SAO is to show how awesome Kirito is. And while a self-aware show could pull something like that off with generous application of parody, SAO fails to.

It occasionally has better moments, the recent GGO arc wasn't that bad, but SAO was really hard to watch.

And then there's the tentacle rape scene. Which had no point at all, other than pandering to a certain demographic.
