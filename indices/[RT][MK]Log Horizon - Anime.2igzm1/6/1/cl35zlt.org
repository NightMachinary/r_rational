I hated SAO, mostly because it seemed like it was a waste of a perfectly good premise. The first episode seemed to promise so much, and then the actual series fell flat on its face. The fact that they just seemed to be making up rules as they went made it that much worse. It seemed like it was going to be a psychological character study, and then it ended up being a power fantasy.
