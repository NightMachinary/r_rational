I agree 100% with this recommendation.

You should watch the first episode of the second season.

It's even more economics.

"So, we need some money."

"How much?"

"More than exists."

"Don't worry, it isn't actually a problem."

Also, episode.. 20ish? Where the reveal in episode 10 finally comes to fruition is...

Really good.

You'll know it when it happens. There is a big beam of light and everything. It is munchkinism at its finest.
