okay I'm enjoying it but i have one major issue that just keeps bugging me. in the episode Shiroe stumbles and trips multiple times citing that his height is off. I thought that was a nice touch, then we get to a cat person who has the body control of a freakin acrobat.

other than that though I've enjoyed it a lot.
