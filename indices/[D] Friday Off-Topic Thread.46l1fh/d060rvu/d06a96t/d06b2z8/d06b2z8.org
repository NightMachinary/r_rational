There are a bunch of different approaches, and they're all generally highly dependent on what javascript you're using.

If you were using react.js it would be easy, but that comes with a whole bunch of other stuff.

I don't think it's really feasible to make one that isn't coded for a specific website.

My general approach (using django and jquery, both pretty boring choices) is this.

--------------

Have two templates. One renders the entire page, another renders /just/ the content in the list.

Check for a querystring that says something like "justTheList=True" (or a better named variable).

If the request asks for just the list, return just the html for list with none of your other website stuff. No menu or anything.

When a user scrolls to near the end of a page, request the next page using jquery. But request just the list. Insert that list into the end of your list div.

--------------

Does that make sense? It's one approach out of many. I could give more specific advice if I knew more specifics, like what language you're using.

This one is "hacky" but it tends to be pretty cheap and quick to implement on top of your normal pagination.
