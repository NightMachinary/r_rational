It's not something I specifically need, but is there some way to write an infinite scroller which isn't hand-coded for a specific website?

I want to learn how to code something like how the way Twitter will load more tweets when you get to the bottom of the screen, but I can't find a clear explanation for how to make an infinite scroller.

A tutorial would be perfect.

Just a suggestion if you want try it.
