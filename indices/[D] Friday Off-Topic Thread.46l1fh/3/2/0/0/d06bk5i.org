Ah! This is perfect. I wanted something that I could use as a modification of my pagination, but I didn't quite realize that there was a way where I could just show the list without redrawing the entire page. I was wondering how the heck people was loading the next list item without reloading the entire page.

I am actually using jquery, but I was just flopping all over the place because I wasn't sure where to start with something like this, but I think I have a better idea now.
