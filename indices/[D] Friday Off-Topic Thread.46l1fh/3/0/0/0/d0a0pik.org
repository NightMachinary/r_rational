Tried [[/u/captain_duck]]'s [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0sBhCMFBvPlF7wG7OH-NFQKMeCQiS8aM][tutorial series]]? They're in the sidebar as the classic tutorial series, and there's plenty of other content there if it's not working.

Also check out the stickied questions thread for literally any question you have about the game, and don't worry - it took me three or four attempts too!
