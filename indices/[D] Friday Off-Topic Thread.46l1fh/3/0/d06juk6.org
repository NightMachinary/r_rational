Any preferred language? I've got a raft of projects that the community at [[/r/dwarffortress]] would love to see, and can more-or-less guarantee 10K+ users.

- [[https://bitbucket.org/Pidgeot/python-lnp][PyLNP]] - a Python launcher for Dwarf Fortress. Open requests for code include:

  - import/export functionality for settings and content
  - improved mod merging (n-way structured text; parsers exist but integration needed)
  - GUI improvements and terminal spawning

- [[https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack][DFHack]] - a Dwarf Fortress memory access library with plugins and scripts to do almost anything. Pick an issue, and go for it - C++, Lua, Ruby, (developer) documentation, etc.

And if none of that appeals, let me know what you're interested in and I'll find something to suit!
