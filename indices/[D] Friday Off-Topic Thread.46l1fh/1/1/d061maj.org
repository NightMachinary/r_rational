The audio and visual components are surprisingly separate, and should both be done as well as possible, but there are ways around this.

I saw this in a major way relatively recently. [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episode-5-a-price-for-this-cursed-sword-692401][In Episode 5 of /God's Blessing on this Wonderful World/]] (warning: mediocre anime), the gang goes to purify a lake of monsters. The protagonist, trying to mitigate the general uselessness of his party members, concocts a plan which requires minimum risk and effort. The monsters in the lake start to attack, but there's no great increase in animation. Many of the shots are directly reused, or only have slight changes. The entire scene is carried on the performance of the goddess's voice actress, and its such a good performance you could probably change tabs and loose nothing.

Stellar voice acting is language independent, but for me I give bad voice acting a pass since I don't actually speak Japanese. If I knew the language well enough to judge its quality then bad voice acting could very well jar me out of any scene, no matter how good the animation was. They're just separate in that way, and can't quite cover for each other. A lavish animation budget could smooth over poor shot composition, but not so for sound and visuals.

Bad animation (or minimal animation) has to be used cleverly to keep the audience's interest, since they will eventually fall asleep if you only pan over static scenery. This means you need a nice [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dbi4N6NGn4][aesthetic]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6iOVhw6mQ][style]] to get away with not a lot of drawing.

I can't think of many cases of both good animation but bad sound; usually the staff has corresponding competence. More likely is passable voice acting but sub-par environmental sound effects, and not just footsteps. Footsteps are important because they ground characters, but rich sound work goes a long way to immerse me into a story.

To use a terrible metaphor: People talk about the five senses: Sight, Hearing, Touch, Taste, and Smell. In an animated medium, you only get to use Sight and Hearing. So you have to make up for the others in some thoughtful fashion. Personally I think the /Visual/ part of the animation gets Sight and Smell (think: steam rising from a bubbling pot of stew) while the /Audio/ gets Hearing, Taste and Touch (think: your mouth waters when you hear bacon sizzle, not when you watch it in a vacuum). Very high quality animation can suggest tactile sensation, but the level of detail required, say perhaps "fingers sewing pieces of fabric together" is enough to make me want to the sounds of thread instead.

So, to answer your question: animation and voice acting both make characters come alive, but the directing is the most important.
