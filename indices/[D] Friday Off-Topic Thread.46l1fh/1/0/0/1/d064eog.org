I'd say second my second pacing is one of the more important aspects. Even when the entire point is a rather 'terrible' style such as doctor catz and home movies they play to their strengths and don't stretch the style. Bad animation is so terrible that people literally will not watch it unless they want to revel in how terrible it is and your better off using still images with voice over.
