  Well /The Artist/ is a live-action film. The actors still have to do all the acting you normally do in a good movie, you just record without a mic.

My point is that, in an animation with subtitles replacing voice actors, the characters' emotions would be communicated /entirely/ by the writers and the animators, rather than being supplemented by the voice-actors.

To address the original question: I think the voice-acting is much more important. In my opinion, bad animation is much less immersion-breaking than bad voice-acting--compare, e.g., /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam][Mobile Suit Gundam]]/ (bad animation, bad English dub) with /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders][Spider Riders]]/ (good animation, terrible English dub).
