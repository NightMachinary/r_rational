Hmm... What about animation with /no voice-acting at all,/ and only subtitles to replace it? I think that would be interesting to see--and the money saved on actors could go to the animators. Certainly, I found the recent silent movie /The Artist/ ([[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655442][IMDb]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArtist][TV Tropes]]) to be absolutely exquisite.
