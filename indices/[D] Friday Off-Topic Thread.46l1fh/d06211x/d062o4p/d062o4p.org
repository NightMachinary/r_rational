I assume that downloading a copy of every story on FanFiction.net would be as simple as the following process:\\
1. Check each "Chapter 1" link, of the form =https://www.fanfiction.net/s/########= (starting at story 1)\\
2. For each working "Chapter 1" link, check every corresponding chapter link, of the form =https://www.fanfiction.net/s/########/####= (starting at chapter 2), until you get a "Chapter Not Found" page\\
3. Continue until you reach the chosen endpoint

If you look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/j/0/0/0/][the "Just In" section]], the most-recently-published stories have ID numbers approaching twelve million. That averages out to around twenty stories per second over the course of seven days--but many of those stories would be deleted or have only a few chapters, and FanFiction.net would presumably lift whatever automatic IP-blocking procedures it has if it knew that it was about to be deleted.
