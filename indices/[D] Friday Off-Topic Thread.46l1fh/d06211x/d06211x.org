A scenario:

Let's say the worst possible outcome happens and fanfiction is made illegal. Fanfiction.net and every single story on its servers will be deleted at the end of the week. How feasible is it to save and archive everything before it goes up in flames?

I know [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download][Wikipedia distributes their complete archives]], but as I far as I know /only/ Wikipedia does this. I've seen a few .epub versions of stories or what-have-you but never a completely redundant version of a website.

I do feel a hint of genuine anxiety that, although the web is probably more robust and longer lasting than most other forms of media storage (these books won't suddenly get wet and rot) the threats they do face are far faster and more fatal. *rm -rf*. I know it's silly, but that little bit of paranoia wants me to have a complete copy of a number of large websites for my personal safekeeping.
