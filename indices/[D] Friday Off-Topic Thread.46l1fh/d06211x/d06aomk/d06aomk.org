If that happens, I would make my copies available online. Virtually every web-based story that has been mentioned or recommended here, I've made copies of. Yes, including web-serials.

So in that circumstance you'd be able to recover some of the best stories as well as a lot of the good non-rational fanfiction.

I have roughly 300 fanfiction stories saved, and since I don't usually like one-shots, almost all of the them are multi-chapter stories.

I wouldn't worry overly much about great fan-fictions going missing, because fans would save a lot of them and recompile them into a new website.

If you are still worried, do what I do.

I use [[https://ficsave.com/][FicSave]] to download pdfs of my favorite stories and [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]]'s plug-in [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/FAQs][FanFicFare]] to download epub and mobi copies.
