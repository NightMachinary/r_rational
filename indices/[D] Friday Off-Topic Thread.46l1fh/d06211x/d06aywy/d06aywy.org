    [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/3p6mex/i_archived_almost_all_of_fanfictionnet_and_heres/][I archived almost all of Fanfiction.net, and here's the uncompressed torrent]]

    It would actually be a lot easier to grab the 100gb compressed torrent. Here's the magnet link for it "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:3E2HBHI4P4N7E3MCM4MIATPF66STOV64&dn=Fanfiction.tar.gz&tr=udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80" [..] The compressed one is still good, though and pretty well seeded. I think there may be some programs to browse stupidly huge archive files, but I'm not sure.
