So if I, an individual, have an idea for a project, which will need help from some (reasonably small number of) friends, and this project will generate money, which I want to split with my friends in some prearranged way, do I need to start some form of for-profit corporation? If yes, that seems awfully oppressive given that all the money will be taxed twice for, AFAICT, no justifiable reason. If no, why do for-profit corporations even exist? Further, am I legally required to pay people for their contributions up-front, rather than as a share of relevant profits? If yes, that seems to discourage the organization of profitable projects by people with little starting capital.

Basically our government's obsession with proving its dominance makes setting up an Internet cartoon show a weirdly daunting task, I think. And some of the friends are from other countries, ruling out an LLC. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
