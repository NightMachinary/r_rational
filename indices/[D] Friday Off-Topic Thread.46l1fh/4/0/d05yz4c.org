No, you don't need to start a for-profit corporation. The big reason to form a corporation is that you want to limit your personal liability or payout shareholders with actual capital. If you just want a formalized arrangement with friends, you don't need any of that and it's likely too much burden to be worthwhile. Making a corporation would mostly be for your legal protection.

  Further, am I legally required to pay people for their contributions up-front, rather than as a share of relevant profits? If yes, that seems to discourage the organization of profitable projects by people with little starting capital.

No, you're not required to pay people up front. You're not actually required to pay people /at all/, so long as you tell them that you're not going to pay them (and you're not running up against minimum wage laws, which probably don't apply).

How you want to structure your business really depends on how much you want to protect yourself from any potential legal issues and how much legal stuff your partners require to make sure they're not being screwed out of money. But while you might want to file as a business with your local authorities, there's almost certainly no point in doing much more than grabbing some boilerplate and filling in the blanks (depending on intended scale).

(I've helped a few people set up small businesses before.)
