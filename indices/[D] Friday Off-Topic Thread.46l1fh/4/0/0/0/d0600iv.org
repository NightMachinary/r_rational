Yeah, just grab something like [[http://www.alllaw.com/forms/business/partnership/partnership_agreemen][this boilerplate partnership contract]]. That's assuming that your starting capital is low enough that you don't want to pay a lawyer to draft something for you. Really, this only comes into play if you have legal issues down the road (internal or external law suits). A full-on corporation is overkill though.
