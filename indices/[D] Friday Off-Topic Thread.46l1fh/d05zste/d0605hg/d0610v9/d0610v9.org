What does truly terrible animation mean? I know that good animation doesn't need to be objectivist, or even try to replicate reality exactly ([[http://xkcd.com/][xkcd]], [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4171032/][World of Tomorrow]]), but what kinds of animation decisions are bad?

My first thought is consistency: if your characters constantly change shape in ways that don't make sense, it becomes hard to recognize them, and they can even be off-putting (e.g. [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/poohadventures/images/a/a6/GTS6jrFy.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20150519012658][DoodleBob]]). Anything else?
