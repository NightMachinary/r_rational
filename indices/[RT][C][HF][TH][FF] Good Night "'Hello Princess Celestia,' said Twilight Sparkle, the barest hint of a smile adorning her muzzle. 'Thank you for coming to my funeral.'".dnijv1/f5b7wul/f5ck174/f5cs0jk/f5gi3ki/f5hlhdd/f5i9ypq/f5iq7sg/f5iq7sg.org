  (unless, obviously, you highly value empathy)

I was positive that was what you were referring to.

#+begin_quote
  If the only example of uplifting that you've come across resulted in massively distorted values, would you really be so eager to go that route?
#+end_quote

I'd at least look into it, especially since there's only one data point and the outcome wasn't a paperclipper.

#+begin_quote
  You could be really lucky and it's a Tok'ra Goa'uld, and what will happen is a "blending" of your personality and this other being's, but, in your experience, most Goa'uld aren't Tok'ra, and the personality of the host tends to be brutally suppressed.
#+end_quote

I have to say this is a false analogy. Again, one data point. You can't really say that most ascensions result in brutal suppression, or even that it's /likely/. All we know is that is /happened./

#+begin_quote
  Valuing the preservation of your self/consciousness/memories/body over that self's integrity/personality/values is a perfectly legitimate choice. But so is the other choice. And neither is more "stupid" than the other.
#+end_quote

That's not what I'm saying is stupid. What is /stupid/ is never even trying to investigate a way to perform an uplift while still holding your previous values. Luna has already demonstrated that she is a massive deviation from the norm---she became /Nightmare Moon/. Perhaps she just never valued others and was just pretending, and ascending allowed her to admit that to herself and just blast off.
