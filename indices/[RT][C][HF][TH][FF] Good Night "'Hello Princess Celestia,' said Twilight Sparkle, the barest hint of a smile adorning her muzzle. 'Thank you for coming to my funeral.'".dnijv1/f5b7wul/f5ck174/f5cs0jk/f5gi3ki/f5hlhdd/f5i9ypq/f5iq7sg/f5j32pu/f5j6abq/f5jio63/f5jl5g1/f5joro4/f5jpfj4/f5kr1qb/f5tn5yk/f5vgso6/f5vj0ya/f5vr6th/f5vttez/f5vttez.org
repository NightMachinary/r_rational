  The latter isn't "but" anything when compared to the former.
#+end_quote

You're free to disagree, but you have to make a counterclaim if you want to be correct.

#+begin_quote
  Generally, when people ask to be buried or cremated, their relatives don't donate their bodies to science; that is seen as disrespectful.
#+end_quote

So the wishes of a dead person trump the wellbeing of those still alive?

#+begin_quote
  If you're "stuck in a cage" and have received a point-blank GSW to the head, you'll almost certainly be dead (from exsanguination, if nothing else) before you can be rushed to a hospital to be resuscitated.
#+end_quote

Imagine a high-tech society where the premise is possible.

#+begin_quote
  it is assumed that they have granted consent for you to assist them. So, given that a GSW would almost certainly render you unconscious, yes, your motives are irrelevant.
#+end_quote

Do you not see the parallels between this situation and Cadance's?

#+begin_quote
  You need more than one (more than two, actually).
#+end_quote

Not if that scientist has been practicing her craft for actual millennia. A single person can do good science, given enough time and resources. Twilight has all the time, and all the resources.

#+begin_quote
  Which includes such concepts as "independent replication." "Peer review." "Blinded studies."
#+end_quote

Simulate things such as independent replication by changing labs and waiting a while, if you want. Else, make more people.

#+begin_quote
  I can't see it safely accomplished without at least a team of dozens, all fully trained, with a support structure in place.
#+end_quote

Try using your imagination if you can't see it.

#+begin_quote
  Well, no, not literally
#+end_quote

[[https://psychcentral.com/news/2010/07/21/decreased-perception-of-color-in-depression/15826.html][Yes, literally]].

#+begin_quote
  That is not true for all kinds of depression.
#+end_quote

Pray tell, what other type of depression do you think Twilight may be laboring under that matches the symptoms?

#+begin_quote
  About... anhedonia being irrational? Do you have a citation about that? I can't comprehend the idea that a lack of emotional reaction to stimulus can be irrational. Especially as emotional reaction isn't a rational thing in the first place
#+end_quote

Yes. There is a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational][Sequence article]] about it.

#+begin_quote
  When people think of “emotion” and “rationality” as opposed, I suspect that they are really thinking of System 1 and System 2 ... Conversely, an emotion that is evoked by correct beliefs or truth-conducive thinking is a “rational emotion”; and this has the advantage of letting us regard calm as an emotional state, rather than a privileged default.

  you can't assume that Twilight is representative of the most common form of depression, either.
#+end_quote

Yes you can. With Luna, we have one data point and the only basis we could use for the most common form of how intelligence increases would be how the majority of species had their intelligence emerge. There is no reason to suspect Luna went this route and has the most common form of result from increasing intelligence. This isn't the case for Twilight's depression.

#+begin_quote
  rejected because artificially induced hedonism to counter anhedonia is deemed to be on a slippery slope to Cadence's condition.
#+end_quote

Do not equate artificially induced hedonism with curing depression. They are not equivalent. That is indeed /very/ fallacious, and I submit that Twilight's mental state is not in the right place to judge that.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sorry, can you offer evidence to your claim that people don't get increasingly bored spending decades doing exactly the same job?
#+end_quote

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9g0ssn/redditors_who_have_opted_out_of_a_standard/e60oiey/][Yes]].

#+begin_quote
  Twilight, who is, again, in a better position to observe Celestia than we are, claims that Celestia is experiencing the same problem Twilight is, only to a lesser extent and/or is hiding it better. Celestia does not contradict this statement.
#+end_quote

Twilight is likely depressed, and depression colors your perceptions of everything. Celestia isn't going to be feeling the best because she's at the part in the cycle where literally everything except immortal beings are dead.

#+begin_quote
  What are the other options? That they are forced to take a cure against their will (a violation of all medical ethics) or to endure suffering eternally?
#+end_quote

The first one. You forcibly put people in their right mind, give them some time to think, and /then/ let them decide.

#+begin_quote
  Value judgement.
#+end_quote

If you are arguing that death is not bad then we are disagreeing /fundamentally/ and I honestly think you're either brainwashed by a toxic ideology or arguing in bad faith.

#+begin_quote
  it's not a coin flip (two endpoints, equally probable, with one being exactly as good as the other is bad). There are two endpoints, but the one data point you have is showing the good ending to very possibly be a lot less likely than the bad solution, and either ending gets exponentially worse the longer you try for the good ending.
#+end_quote

You're right. Death ends in nothing. The other is infinity experiencing everything. The second option is well worth the time.

#+begin_quote
  no matter how new and exciting we try to make it
#+end_quote

This does not at all imply mass Alicornification.

#+begin_quote
  "I don't want to edit away my capacity to be bored
#+end_quote

This does not at all imply a cure for depression.

#+begin_quote
  If you want to write about your characters trying and failing to storm a castle, you have to write a hundred-page treatise on siege tactics in medieval warfare.
#+end_quote

Three. Three alternatives. A grand total of /zero/ were brought up.

#+begin_quote
  Again, they've tried novel versions of Equestria
#+end_quote

Have they /really/? They say more interesting, but no examples have been given. I think the author just didn't give these alternatives any thought, because you can make things /really/ interesting if you try, especially with the power of an Alicorn.

#+begin_quote
  she herself seems to think that novelty will fix her issue (or that's how she describes the path of intelligence augmentation
#+end_quote

And yet she doesn't know what magic Luna used to get to the stars, she doesn't know how to instantly fix her depression, she doesn't know how brains work, she doesn't know ... a lot of things, really. How much has she tried and how much is depression talking?

The premise of the story is flawed, really. It's yet another author who hasn't thought of the alternatives to boredom. People don't work that way. I've put thousands of hours into Factorio and still haven't gotten bored. That's a game with a very small number of moving parts, especially when compared to real life. When you're not depressed, small variations on a routine seem novel. People have been playing a single instrument their entire lives and still haven't gotten bored with that.
