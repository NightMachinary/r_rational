Alright, there are a lot of claims here and we could easily go back and forth for eternity. I could go point by point disagreeing with nearly everything you've said here in some way or another, but by now this has gotten really boring and I'd rather not. I believe you're wrong, you believe I'm wrong, and if we see each other outside this conversation we can pick up this argument again.
