  You're free to disagree, but you have to make a counterclaim if you want to be correct.
#+end_quote

The evolutionary acquisition of intelligence and the artificial, unfettered self-imposition of the same are /not/ equivalent. On the one hand, evolution optimizes itself towards survival and/or reproduction in a given environment. It is limited by the duration of a generation and the number of changes which can propagate from one generation to the next. Harmful variants (evolutionary dead-ends, behaviours which benefit individuals but harm the species, etc.) can be weeded out by natural selection or by other members of the community. The harm which can be done is limited.

By contrast, with a self-improving process, what you're optimizing towards can change /radically/ based on how you change yourself. There are no limits except for the laws of physics.

Nature has produced untold numbers of killers --- diseases, predators, sociopaths, dictators --- over the ages, appearing seemingly from nowhere, killing at will, until stopped by their own failures, or through intervention, or by sheer luck.

And Twilight doesn't even need to proceed /that far/ for "ascension" to be unwise: she just needs to become unrecognizable to herself, in terms of personality and values.

#+begin_quote
  So the wishes of a dead person trump the wellbeing of those still alive?
#+end_quote

In terms of the disposition of their own body? Unless they present a clear danger (e.g. plague), absolutely. Why shouldn't they?

#+begin_quote
  Do you not see the parallels between this situation and Cadance's?
#+end_quote

Not really. The parallel would be to bring Cadence out of the pleasure loop /as herself/ (imagine a high-magic society where the premise is possible), not to pour someone new into her body.

#+begin_quote
  Not if that scientist has been practicing her craft for actual millennia. A single person can do good science, given enough time and resources. Twilight has all the time, and all the resources.
#+end_quote

Give me an example of a scientist who has refined their craft to the point where they are immune to bias and I'll believe you.

#+begin_quote
  Simulate things such as independent replication by changing labs and waiting a while, if you want.
#+end_quote

"Independent" generally includes independence of /researcher/ (i.e. it's replicated not only /on/ different people but /by/ different people).

#+begin_quote
  Else, make more people.
#+end_quote

Which Twilight, for the umpteenth time, explicitly doesn't want to do.

#+begin_quote
  Try using your imagination if you can't see it.
#+end_quote

You're free to disagree, but you have to make a counterclaim if you want to be correct.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, literally.
#+end_quote

I withdraw the objection to the word choice, but now I don't see the pertinence of the example.

#+begin_quote
  Pray tell, what other type of depression do you think Twilight may be laboring under that matches the symptoms?
#+end_quote

"[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholic_depression][Melancholic depression]]." The kind that messes with your thoughts is more commonly "Depression with anxious distress" (although you can have both).

#+begin_quote
  Yes. There is a Sequence article about it.
#+end_quote

That article says that /experiencing/ emotions isn't necessarily irrational. It says that emotions /can/ (and often are) be based on rational reactions to the world. It /doesn't/ say that /not/ experiencing emotions is an irrational state.

#+begin_quote
  the only basis we could use for the most common form of how intelligence increases would be how the majority of species had their intelligence emerge.
#+end_quote

See the top of my post for why I don't think that's a good example.

#+begin_quote
  There is no reason to suspect Luna went this route and has the most common form of result from increasing intelligence.
#+end_quote

You're not suggesting that Twilight go through the most common route of intelligence increase either (generations of evolution).

#+begin_quote
  Do not equate artificially induced hedonism with curing depression. They are not equivalent.
#+end_quote

I didn't; the story did.

#+begin_quote
  I submit that Twilight's mental state is not in the right place to judge that.
#+end_quote

Depression does not necessarily make you stupid.

#+begin_quote
  Yes.
#+end_quote

The singular of data is not "anecdote."

#+begin_quote
  Celestia isn't going to be feeling the best
#+end_quote

Are you arguing that /she's/ stupid, too?

#+begin_quote
  The first one.
#+end_quote

If you're arguing that people shouldn't have the ability to refuse medical treatment (that is, to decide what people do to their own body and self), I think I agree with your point coming up that we disagree fundamentally, in a way that can't be reconciled.

Speaking of which...

#+begin_quote
  If you are arguing that death is not bad
#+end_quote

Going [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dnijv1/rtchfthff_good_night_hello_princess_celestia_said/f5joro4/][way back in our conversation]], I've already covered this (emphasis mine-then, not mine-now):

#+begin_quote
  You consider her death evil. Which, okay, that's your value judgement. But you're imposing /your/ values on /her./ *Values are not universal constants.* If her values are such that, after many, many lifetimes of rational consideration, she has concluded that it is time for her life to end, I think that is her choice to make. /Her/ values should decide what becomes of /her/ body and /her/ consciousness (just as Cadence's values, a preference that her happiness should be maximized, determined what happened to her).
#+end_quote

My position hasn't changed one iota from there; if you think that's evidence that I'm "brainwashed by a toxic ideology or arguing in bad faith", then you should have stopped arguing with me four days ago.

I'm not arguing that death /isn't/ bad. Nor am I arguing that it /is/ bad. I'm arguing that "death is bad" is a /value judgement,/ a /human construct/ (as the very ideas of "good" and bad" are), and I'd bet if I polled all 8,000,000,000 humans, I'd get a lot more nuance beyond “death is bad,” from the Dumbledorian “death gives meaning to life,” to the Malthusian “death is necessary to prevent overpopulation,” to the historical “if people didn't die, America would still be governed by the Founding Fathers' viewpoint on slavery,” and that's not even bringing the religious/spiritual beliefs into the equation.

#+begin_quote
  You're right. Death ends in nothing. The other is infinity experiencing everything. The second option is well worth the time.
#+end_quote

And if "everything" turns out to be nothing but an eternity of boredom, as all evidence in the story itself suggests it will? Would you still say it's "worth the time?"

#+begin_quote
  no matter how new and exciting we try to make it

  This does not at all imply mass Alicornification.
#+end_quote

It implies maximum new and exciting, which /absolutely does/ imply mass Alifornication (that was a typo, but I'm leaving it because I find it amusing).

#+begin_quote
  "I don't want to edit away my capacity to be bored

  This does not at all imply a cure for depression.
#+end_quote

If being bored is the source of her depression, then it /absolutely does/ imply a cure for her depression.

#+begin_quote
  Three. Three alternatives. A grand total of /zero/ were brought up.
#+end_quote

Once again, a considerable chunk of the story is already about alternatives to dying. Let's say the start and the end remain the same, and the part after "I'm open to alternatives" and before "I suppose your decision is made, then" is expanded to your satisfaction. That's currently over one-third of the story; what percentage of the story would have to be devoted to exploring alternatives before you would be satisfied with Twilight's decision to die?

#+begin_quote
  Have they really? They say more interesting, but no examples have been given.
#+end_quote

See above.

#+begin_quote
  she doesn't know ... a lot of things, really. How much has she tried
#+end_quote

We don't know. You are insistent upon the assumption that she /hasn't/ tried sufficiently, even though she has been alive at least a hundred thousand years.

#+begin_quote
  The premise of the story is flawed, really.
#+end_quote

You're welcome to that opinion.

#+begin_quote
  People don't work that way. I've put thousands of hours into Factorio and still haven't gotten bored.
#+end_quote

Thousands, yes. Hundreds of millions? More to the point, /all/ of your hours?

#+begin_quote
  When you're not depressed, small variations on a routine seem novel.
#+end_quote

For some people, that may be true. However, if that were universally the case, boredom wouldn't exist outside of depression (spoiler: it does).

#+begin_quote
  People have been playing a single instrument their entire lives and still haven't gotten bored with that.
#+end_quote

Again, for the comparison to be apt, they would both have to be putting /all/ of their time into playing that instrument, for a thousand lifetimes. I'm pretty sure that, after two or three lifetimes at most, they'd want to at least learn a different instrument.
