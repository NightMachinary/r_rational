And how much deviation from "really you, for sure" is acceptable is a /value choice/. Retaining "yourself" is a lot more about retaining your values than it is about retaining empathy (unless, obviously, you highly value empathy).

If the only example of uplifting that you've come across resulted in massively distorted values, would you really be so eager to go that route?

Or, to put it a different way: let's say you exist in the Stargate: SG1 universe, and a Goa'uld symbiont attaches itself to your brainstem. You don't know the moral alignment of this creature; you do know that it will inhabit your body and possess all of your memories, that it will grant your body long life and health, and a wealth of knowledge. You could be /really/ lucky and it's a Tok'ra Goa'uld, and what will happen is a "blending" of your personality and this other being's, but, in your experience, most Goa'uld aren't Tok'ra, and the personality of the host tends to be brutally suppressed.

Would you choose, in this moment before the choice is taken from you, to end your life, or would you leave your body's future actions and the use of your memories at the whims of this being you don't know?

Valuing the preservation of your self/consciousness/memories/body over that self's integrity/personality/values is a /perfectly legitimate choice/. But so is the other choice. And neither is more "stupid" than the other.
