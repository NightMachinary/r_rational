#+begin_quote
  if there is additional information to suggest that data point is not reflective of the base rate.
#+end_quote

There is. How did intelligence naturally rise? We have another data point in every intelligent being, of which, in Equestria, there are many species.

#+begin_quote
  Neither Celestia nor Twilight are behaving as such.
#+end_quote

There is a body writhing right there. You're going to treat the twitching corpse of a friend with respect whether or not you believe it's dead.

#+begin_quote
  Celestia teleported her to the funeral. I doubt a few million km would have made much of a difference.
#+end_quote

Teleportation has a range limit.

#+begin_quote
  Cadence's were to be stimulated into bliss for eternity.
#+end_quote

Explicitly, or are we just guessing? It seems as if she did it for lack of anything else to do.

#+begin_quote
  There are no other survivors, besides the three in this story. Celestia isn't volunteering, and neither is Cadence, and even if both did and both ascended while maintaining their values, that still only brings the base rate down to one in three, which aren't very good odds.
#+end_quote

Solution: create new beings. Discord can do it with the snap of his fingers. Or talons.

#+begin_quote
  if you limit a mind more complex than yours to only thoughts you can understand, the mind doesn't actually end up any more complex than yours?
#+end_quote

It is my sincere belief that there is nothing we cannot understand given sufficient time and analysis. The root consciousness would be able to effectively freeze time while it analyzes the changes.

#+begin_quote
  Longer, even: they don't have a civilization at the moment to conduct this research in. Admittedly, it might take less time with the experience Celestia has, but humans have been building their civilization for what, twenty thousand years, and aren't at the point Twilight would need yet.
#+end_quote

Solution: summon Discord. What is usually a coin flip that ends in more harm than good becomes essentially risk-free. There are only three more beings he can torment, two of which don't or can't care, and one of which is used to his antics. Either he creates more beings, or he gets bored and goes away again.

#+begin_quote
  I'm ignoring alternative routes of research because they'd take too long.
#+end_quote

Pre-ascension Twilight can create life out of nothing. This objection is nonsensical.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, this isn't physical, lack of sleep tired, which acts like you describe; this is more akin to depression. Which isn't "stupid" so much as "hopeless."
#+end_quote

Depression makes you stupid. I speak from experience.

#+begin_quote
  Imagine you're being tortured. You're in agony, all the time, and yet you never get accustomed to it.
#+end_quote

I will stop you here. This is not what is happening. Twilight is an Alicorn at peak physical health. This analogy is very, very off-base.

#+begin_quote
  All we know is that she's reached the conclusion that she would find going through another iteration of Equestria to be unbearable. That she's already stopped forming bonds with new ponies.
#+end_quote

Indeed. Which is not even close to torture. Ennui, perhaps. You're also forgetting that there is no jailer. She can end herself at any time.

#+begin_quote
  You keep insisting that she's stupid for not wanting to go through something unbearable for the possibility of a prize at the end which makes things bearable.
#+end_quote

I have said no such thing. She's stupid for not considering alternatives. It is understandable stupidity, but still stupidity. Here's one: make everyone an Alicorn. Simple, free of AI risk, creates novelty and new social situations that simply can't happen with people that aren't even a century old. Another: mirror pool.

#+begin_quote
  But, for the same reason, I don't think there's enough there to assume that her decision is "stupid," either.
#+end_quote

It is unquestionably stupid, but it's also understandable.
