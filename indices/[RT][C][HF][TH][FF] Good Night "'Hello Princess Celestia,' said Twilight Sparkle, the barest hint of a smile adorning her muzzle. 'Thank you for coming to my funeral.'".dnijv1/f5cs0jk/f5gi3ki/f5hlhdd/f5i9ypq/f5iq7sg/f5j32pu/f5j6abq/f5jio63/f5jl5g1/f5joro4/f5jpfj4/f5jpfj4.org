  If you have some in-universe information to suggest that Twilight should know that the base rate of value drift when ascending is low enough to be worth the risk, I'm happy to hear it.
#+end_quote

That's the thing, you're working off of one data point. There /is/ no information.

#+begin_quote
  Okay, you've taken a decided turn towards the evil here. Creating new minds to be subjected to experimentation is one thing, but going against the express wishes of a friend as to the disposal of her body/consciousness?
#+end_quote

She's effectively dead. If she didn't want to be found, she should've launched herself into space. I think she'd have been happy to know her body would be used to help her friend after her semi-death.

#+begin_quote
  Because that's what she's making her decision based upon (and she can't really obtain more data on this, because Luna has already left). And yes, there's only one data point, but one data point is still a data point. All you have to weigh against that data point is supposition.
#+end_quote

What do you do when you're lacking data? It's not give up and assume the worst. You /get more data/. If she is just tired and doesn't want to go to the trouble she could admit it and that'd be that, but she didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Any mind that you can't emulate, you can't predict.
#+end_quote

My mistake, definitional issues got in the way. I see what you mean by emulate. This isn't a slow thinking processor. It's a fast one that you would put in charge as the root personality. It would in fact be faster, if less complex, than the evolving consciousness a level above it. It would also have complete access to all thoughts, so if the ascending consciousness thinks “hmm that emulation that is at the core of who I am is annoying,” said emulation shuts it all down and restarts. You get more intelligence and thus more experiences without any Luna-related costs.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, and, by your own admission, she'd have to continue as she is in order to do the research necessary to safely continue as something else. Which, as you also admit, she doesn't want to do.
#+end_quote

Look at the above scenario. Other alternatives include volunteers, as already suggested. I believe here you are using motivated reasoning to simply not think about alternatives routes of research because these are obvious.

#+begin_quote
  "tired" is not "stupid."
#+end_quote

It is slower and more prone to bias and stopping at the first palatable conclusion. So yes, tired is stupid.

#+begin_quote
  And now we're back to values. You consider her death evil.
#+end_quote

Not what I meant. She's asking why not without considering the /reasons/ why not. Guide in a new civilization if immortals to grow with her, perhaps. Now you don't have to worry about the risks of ascension, because the social game evolves with the ages.
