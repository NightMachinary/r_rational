But this isn't a choice between abandoning her core values and death---it's a choice between /potentially/ abandoning her core values in a way that would result in her fucking off to the stars somewhere without harming anyone else and death. There's no switch that goes straight from "really you, for sure" to "towering alien abomination of intellect." That it happened with Luna suggests that the scale between those two possibilities is a lot easier to go down than picking a point between them, but it's just one data point. And then there's the fact that psychopathy and intelligence are not necessarily intertwined. It's possible to retain empathy while increasing intelligence, or at least /simulate/ empathy to a significant enough degree that the end result looks enough like the real thing that it doesn't matter whether it /really/ is or not. This isn't just my opinion. Enough researchers are working on FAI to suggest that FAI is possible.
