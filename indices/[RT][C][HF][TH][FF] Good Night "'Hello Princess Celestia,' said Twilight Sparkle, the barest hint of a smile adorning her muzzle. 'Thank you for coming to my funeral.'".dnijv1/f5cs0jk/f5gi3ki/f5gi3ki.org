That's not fair.

She has a different value system than you do: she values integrity of personality over existence.

Since value systems can only be defined rationally /to a point/, and beyond that point are based off of irrational preferences (there's no law of physics encoding any concept of "better"), it's not "stupid" to value wanting to end your life being recognizably the same person you are now, rather than thinking it's "better" to continue life as something fundamentally different.

It's a value choice. And, while choosing to do something which /won't/ fulfill your core values is irrational, no set of core values can be inherently more rational than another, because none of a person's deepest values come from a place of reason in the first place.

Personally, if I were to be offered immortality, I'd only accept if I were given an escape clause. I would prefer, for example, /not/ to persist in a state of perpetual asphyxia, starvation, dehydration, and solitude, after the heat death of the universe. And that may not be a /rational/ choice (and certainly wouldn't seem so to someone who valued continued existence above all else), but as someone with my core values, I wouldn't consider it a "stupid" one either.
