  One type of base rate fallacy is the false positive paradox, where false positive tests are more probable than true positive tests, occurring when the overall population has a low incidence of a condition and the incidence rate is lower than the false positive rate. The probability of a positive test result is determined not only by the accuracy of the test but by the characteristics of the sampled population. When the incidence, the proportion of those who have a given condition, is lower than the test's false positive rate, even tests that have a very low chance of giving a false positive in an individual case will give more false than true positives overall. So, in a society with very few infected people---fewer proportionately than the test gives false positives---there will actually be more who test positive for a disease incorrectly and don't have it than those who test positive accurately and do. The paradox has surprised many.

  It is especially counter-intuitive when interpreting a positive result in a test on a low-incidence population after having dealt with positive results drawn from a high-incidence population. If the false positive rate of the test is higher than the proportion of the new population with the condition, then a test administrator whose experience has been drawn from testing in a high-incidence population may conclude from experience that a positive test result usually indicates a positive subject, when in fact a false positive is far more likely to have occurred.

Excellent. Wipe it clean and start over.

  The "oppressive being" is the new, "ascended" person you're creating. If they take your memories and personality, and become a person with different values, then they've successfully suppressed your personality.
#+end_quote

Not so. The original would have simply updated with access to new information. If you want, you can think of the original personality as the utility function. Someone who just honestly doesn't care about people has to interact with them, so at normal intelligence might put on a smile and pretend. This is the stage of a paperclipper's life in which it cooperates with humans. Then the person ascends, and realizes that she was deluding herself all along and she doesn't really want friends---what she really desires is the ability to play out there in the stars with no one else around to disturb her. It's an assumption of course, but it works off the available data. Of which we have /one single data point./

  And yet the people who actually know her are convinced that she's experienced a value shift.
#+end_quote

Well, of course they are. After all, they know her. If someone close to you suddenly changes, and they recently started taking a new medicine, it can be tempting to blame that change on the medicine.

  But have any of these entities been shown to be able to protect the universe beyond Equestria? (Edit to add: I'm also not sure that any of these entities even exist anymore, as Celestia is described as "last intelligent being on the planet" after Twilight's passing).

Discord can rip holes in reality and travel between universes, so there's evidence that they can. And the avatar of chaos is immortal. He might be banished, or frozen, or just slumbering like some Lovecraftian god, but he can't /die/. Since the Elements, which are not an intelligent being, can target him (assuming the reason he didn't flee the friendship beam was because he couldn't rather than because he's an idiot) it stands to reason that he couldn't just flee to an alternate plane of existence, and thus they too can defend against universe level threats.

  Well, you can pretty much achieve that with the extra processing power
#+end_quote

You can certainly imagine ways to use processing power to emulate this, yes, but you're not engaging with the core point I was making. There are ways we can imagine that modify how we think and that are beneficial.

#+end_quote

Perhaps I failed to convey the point. Copy consciousness. Place it at root, with root access. Set emulation speed at many times higher than the secondary consciousness.

  That is, "Why not?" Twilight has told you why not. In fact, I've told you why Twilight has told you why not (emphasis mine-now, not mine-then):
#+end_quote

Wrong angle. These are two questions. Why not die, and why not live. She has answered why she doesn't want to continue /as she is/ and has failed to adequately consider alternatives because she is tired. She has then defaulted to why not die. She has defaulted to the position of evil.
