  That's the thing, you're working off of one data point. There is no information.
#+end_quote

There /is/ information. There is exactly one data point. Basing your decisions off of that data point is only a base rate fallacy /if there is additional information to suggest that data point is not reflective of the base rate/.

Otherwise, if you try something for a first time, the result you get that first time is likely to be a likely result of doing what you did, unlikely to be an unlikely result, and very unlikely to be a very unlikely result.

  She's effectively dead.
#+end_quote

Neither Celestia nor Twilight are behaving as such.

#+begin_quote
  If she didn't want to be found, she should've launched herself into space.
#+end_quote

Celestia /teleported/ her to the funeral. I doubt a few million km would have made much of a difference.

#+begin_quote
  I think she'd have been happy to know her body would be used to help her friend after her semi-death.
#+end_quote

Perhaps, but that's why people leave last wills and testaments, so that we know what their wishes are. Cadence's were to be stimulated into bliss for eternity. It's a violation of those expressed wishes to experiment upon her.

#+begin_quote
  What do you do when you're lacking data? It's not give up and assume the worst. You get more data.
#+end_quote

There's /no more data to get/. There are no other survivors, besides the three in this story. Celestia isn't volunteering, and neither is Cadence, and even if both did and both ascended while maintaining their values, that still only brings the base rate down to one in three, which aren't very good odds.

#+begin_quote
  It would in fact be faster, if less complex, than the evolving consciousness a level above it.
#+end_quote

And what makes you think that this isn't the "play nice with the humans" phase of the paperclipper, given that, if you limit a mind more complex than yours to only thoughts you can understand, the mind doesn't actually end up any more complex than yours?

#+begin_quote
  Look at the above scenario. Other alternatives include volunteers, as already suggested.
#+end_quote

Which would still require her to continue in her current state until the ascension process is perfected, /which could take thousands of years/. Longer, even: they don't have a /civilization/ at the moment to conduct this research /in./ Admittedly, it might take less time with the experience Celestia has, but humans have been building their civilization for what, twenty thousand years, and aren't at the point Twilight would need yet.

Twenty /thousand/ more years of ennui, perhaps, for the ephemeral possibility of a reward that may not exist.

#+begin_quote
  I believe here you are using motivated reasoning to simply not think about alternatives routes of research because these are obvious.
#+end_quote

I am trying to simulate the mind of someone trapped in depression and ennui, with a fear that I'm already losing my true personality to value decay. I'm ignoring alternative routes of research because /they'd take too long/.

#+begin_quote
  It is slower and more prone to bias and stopping at the first palatable conclusion.
#+end_quote

Slower, yes, but what is speed to someone who has been considering this for years, if not decades, or centuries, it longer? More prone to bias, perhaps, but that's why you have someone else check your results, and Celestia didn't argue too hard that she was wrong. "Stopping at the first palatable conclusion," certainly not, as, again, it seems to have been an extended period since she started thinking about this, after the fall of the last Equestria and the ascension of Luna.

Besides, this isn't physical, lack of sleep tired, which acts like you describe; this is more akin to depression. Which isn't "stupid" so much as "hopeless."

#+begin_quote
  Not what I meant. She's asking why not without considering the reasons why not. Guide in a new civilization if immortals to grow with her, perhaps.
#+end_quote

Imagine you're being tortured. You're in agony, /all the time/, and yet you never get accustomed to it. You can feel your sanity slipping away, to the point where even if the torture stops, you'll still be a traumatized shell of your former self. And the slippage seems to be accelerating. Now, imagine that your torturer gives you a choice: you can end the suffering now, or you can trust them when they say that they'll let you out in a year's time, by which point you think you'll have been reduced to a drooling, gibbering shell of your former self.

Now, /maybe/ that's not a good analogy for the state Twilight is in. But we /don't know/ the thought process that led her to this point. All we know is that she's reached the conclusion that she would find going through another iteration of Equestria to be unbearable. That she's already stopped forming bonds with new ponies.

You keep insisting that she's stupid for not wanting to go through something unbearable for the /possibility/ of a prize at the end which makes things bearable.

I can't say whether she's making a reasonable decision, because I'm not privy to the entirety of the years (or perhaps /lifetimes/) she's spent coming to that decision. But, for the same reason, I don't think there's enough there to assume that her decision is "stupid," either.
