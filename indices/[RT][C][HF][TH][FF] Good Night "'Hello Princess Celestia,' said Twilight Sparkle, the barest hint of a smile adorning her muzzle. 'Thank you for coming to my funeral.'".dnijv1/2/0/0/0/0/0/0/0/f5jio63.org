  People value empathy.

Yes, but that's not /all/ they value.

  You've stumbled straight into the base rate fallacy there.
#+end_quote

From Wikipedia (emphasis mine): The base rate fallacy, also called base rate neglect or base rate bias, is a fallacy. *If presented with related base rate information (i.e. generic, general information)* and specific information (information pertaining only to a certain case), the mind tends to ignore the former and focus on the latter."

Can you, perhaps, let me know where the base rate has been provided, to make this a base rate fallacy?

I'll get to the "make new ponies" when it comes up again, but, for now:

  Or, hell, experiment on Cadance. I'm sure she won't mind.
#+end_quote

Because she /no longer has a mind/. She's a [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/happy-3][429-particle happiness engine]] with a few octillion extra particles.

  We haven't heard of anyone encountering one of these supposed oppressive beings,
#+end_quote

The "oppressive being" is the new, "ascended" person you're creating. If they take your memories and personality, and become a person with different values, then they've successfully suppressed your personality.

#+begin_quote
  the only person who did self-modify was already predisposed to introversion, megalomania, and depression.
#+end_quote

...And yet the people who actually /know/ her are convinced that she's experienced a value shift.

  The first AI will have all the power. So far that's Luna, and she doesn't care enough to harm anyone. But assume that the second attempt turns into a genocidal maniac. In story we have Discord, Tirek, and the Elements, all of which could conceivably deal with such a threat.
#+end_quote

To protect Equestria, sure (as much as a place without a population can be said to be "protected"). But have any of these entities been shown to be able to protect the universe /beyond/ Equestria? /(Edit to add: I'm also not sure that any of these entities even exist anymore, as Celestia is described as "last intelligent being on the planet" after Twilight's passing)./

#+begin_quote
  False. So long as you understand how exactly this person deviates, you can definitely predict how they'd think. But what if this person, say, thinks twice as fast and has the ability to instantly make themselves devoted to any task. You can predict how they'd think, and you can see how you can't just become that person without modifying your brain.
#+end_quote

Well, you can pretty much achieve that with the extra processing power ("instantly devoted to a task" is pretty trivial to achieve, and also wouldn't seem to relieve ennui all that well - any task that's sufficiently interesting would probably rate devotion from a superlatively bored person like Twilight even without extra focus, and any insufficiently interesting task won't do anything to alleviate the boredom).

#+begin_quote
  You don't just need a boost in processing power and memory, but in the ability to modify. In the story, Luna continually modified herself until she became an alien. Just set, say, a max of three modifications per year, with unlimited ability to reverse. Or build a guidance consciousness that reverses any changes she finds abhorrent that polices the process.

You're asking the person designing the upgrade process to build a system that the person /subjected to/ the upgrade process (who will be much smarter than the person designing the process) won't have the ability to subvert. That doesn't strike you as a problem? Heck, some of the smartest people in the world work in computer security, and their efforts are routinely circumvented by amateur hackers. As dead-simple (and computationally secure) as the math behind many cryptographic algorithms is, people are still told not to implement them themselves, because it's so easy for even smart, experienced programmers to make errors that are trivial for hackers to exploit. To [[https://www.xkcd.com/2030/][quote Randall Monroe]]: "Our entire field [of software engineers] is bad at what we do, and if you rely on us, everyone will die." And that's in a comic about /voting software/, not /constraining a superintelligence/.

#+begin_quote
  Remember what evil would say if you asked it why it did what it did.
#+end_quote

That is, "Why not?" Twilight has /told you/ why not. In fact, *I've* told you why /Twilight/ has told you why not (emphasis mine-now, not mine-then):

#+begin_quote
  Twilight (who already seems to be experiencing value decay) /doesn't want to go through that again./
