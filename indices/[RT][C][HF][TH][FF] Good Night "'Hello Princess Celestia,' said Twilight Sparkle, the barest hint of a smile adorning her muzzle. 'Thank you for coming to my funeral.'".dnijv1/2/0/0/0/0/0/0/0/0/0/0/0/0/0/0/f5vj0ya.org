  Beings which are not capable of exponential self-improvement. There is only one data point in terms of beings which are.
#+end_quote

The latter is but a subset of the former.

  I find it hard to reconcile "treat the twitching corpse of a friend with respect" with "Wipe it clean and start over."
#+end_quote

People donate their bodies to science, which is not seen as disrespectful.

  I don't see how her motives are relevant to the fact that this is how she has chosen to spend eternity.
#+end_quote

Let's say I'm stuck in a cage. I shoot myself in the head. Are my motives irrelevant when considering whether to attempt resuscitation on my now brain-damaged body?

#+begin_quote
  But a fully-trained scientist, specializing in artificial intelligence, and the infrastructure that person would need to support the research required to definitively determine how to safely upgrade someone?
#+end_quote

If Twilight is not a fully-trained scientist than how has she gotten bored of living? She can also conjure inanimate matter, for the record, and living begins are much more complex so it stands to reason she can make whatever she needs.

#+begin_quote
  That seems like an excellent way to pressure the researchers to come down on the side of, "Yes, safe upgrading is possible" (Celestia), or "No, it's not possible, end it already" (Twilight), even if some data has to be massaged to get that result.
#+end_quote

That is why they would use the scientific method, which has gotten us such theories as evolution even with the bias of many God-fearing scientists.

#+begin_quote
  It can, yes. It doesn't necessarily, and I am also speaking from experience. Heck, take a look at all of the creative individuals who have suffered through depression and yet created masterpieces of intellectual and creative accomplishment.
#+end_quote

Depression literally makes the world less colorful. It has a massive impact on the thought process, one which promotes unhelpful trains of thought and sluggishness.

#+begin_quote
  which has nothing whatsoever to do with intelligence or rationality
#+end_quote

Yes it does. Enormous debates have been had on the matter.

#+begin_quote
  the only thing they all have in common is that someone is experiencing a prolonged state of a depressed mood.
#+end_quote

While accurate, this is not precise. You're ignoring how common each type is.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional health? Mental health?
#+end_quote

Subset of modifications, suggesting safe cures for depression or unsafe one if the ennui surges. If she does not know enough to perform this it is strong evidence for her possessing a type of depression which promotes stupidity. Mentally healthy people have jobs. Extrapolating the ability of the average individual to experience decades of routine with no noticeable increases in the average level of ennui suggests this trend occurs in the future and that Twilight does indeed suffer from some form of depression stemming from mental unwellness. Contrast her with Celestia for further evidence. Should mentally unwell people be allowed to commit suicide when there is a cure for the cause of their suffering?

#+begin_quote
  If the goal is achievable, why not end herself when the goal is at its furthest? If it's not, why not end it before she goes through all of the hassle proving that it isn't?
#+end_quote

Very well. Suggested binary: working toward goal either will or will not result in cure of ennui. Implication: at no stage other than the end will she gain any idea of the probability of success. At one end is death. That is bad. At the other is life and happiness for eternity. That is good. Premise: coin flip, or similar. This is not Pascal's Wager. Conclusion: experiment until answer is reached.

#+begin_quote
  SHE HAS HAD CENTURIES TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES
#+end_quote

And yet not one of these alternatives were brought up. Perhaps it was because she was too deep in depression to think of them.

#+begin_quote
  The fact that a prolonged introspection about all the possible alternatives isn't happening on-page does not mean it didn't happen.
#+end_quote

Yes it does. That is a rule of writing: unless a possibility that the characters could have taken to resolve a conflict was explicitly mentioned and discarded, its existence can only mean either a plot hole or stupidity on the case of the character who didn't think of it.

#+begin_quote
  How does any of that help with "I just don't care about any new ponies I meet?"
#+end_quote

Because all of them live less than a century and Celestia has fallen into old patterns that don't bring novelty. Perhaps you are suggesting that she is too depressed for even novelty to fix her ennui, in which case she suffers from depression and should attempt to cure it.
