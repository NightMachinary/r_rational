This.

But it isn't just about the characters not fitting well with rationalist fiction. The world doesn't make sense, either -- the basic background isn't rational /itself/. This means you'll have to do a lot of handwaving, and early on.

It is full of religious references that are never answered, prophecies that are never challenged but apparently work, and technology that is as bad as any Star Trek technobabble (if not worse). I'm not sure why one would want to bother, as the characters, background, technology, and driving plot elements would all have to have significant overhauls.

Why not just write a new story in the spirit of NGE? Someone presenting such a story would instantly get my eyeballs by simply saying, "Elevator pitch: NGE meets rationalist fiction in an original, post failed technological singularity world."

I love fanfic, but I don't think this is the right take on the source material at all.
