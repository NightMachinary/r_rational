To do this you'd have to drop or modify a lot of Eva's core assumptions. Fundamentally, as presented in canon it don't really make a great deal of sense for a happy and well adjusted individual to be an Eva Pilot - robots were creating forcefields powered by the social insecurity that prevents us from being fully honest with the people around us, etc. And a lot of the best part of NGE was exploring a bunch of messed up protagonist characters, and making them happy and well-adjusted seems sort of pointless - why not just pick one of the (many) happier or less messed up mecha animes instead of creating yet another Shinji in Name Only? If I wanted to portray really awesome characters who tend way more toward well-adjustedness, but inserting rationality for irrationality in the fic, I would consider rewrite TTGL but instead of guts and gar and kicking reason to the curb substitute in using reason and logic in a spiraling out of control recursive fashion (we didn't rise above the other animals in reality because of our super guts and gar but instead by endurance and intellect).

The robots in NGE were portrayed dramatically differently in different parts of canon - it seems vaguely OK to have robots which are basically legged WW2-style tanks, or robots which are basically pro wrestling with each other, but mixing and matching the two doesn't make a whole lot of sense usually.

The nearest thing to a different outlook and bizzarely awesome and (more) well adjusted characters in current NGE fanfic is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5579457/1/NGE-Nobody-Dies][Nobody Dies]]. It has some good ideas, but it is extremely long (slightly longer than HPMOR, and less actual stuff happens) and it loses sight of the plot thread hard after a while and starts to really like alternate/parallel universe clones/doubles/etc far too much in an excessive fashion that is difficult to follow if you aren't actually taking notes about what's going on. Nonetheless, it has a bunch of 'more AI stuff' and 'characters being awesome and generally well adjusted instead of complicated and malajusted' and so forth.
