I read through to chapter 40 or so (the then-current ending). As it went, it got worse and worse - if you gave up because of quality deteriorating, I wouldn't retry it, the writing did not pull out of the downward spiral.

As far as WH40k crosses go, I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji][Thousand Shinji]] more, even though it was more mary-sue-ish than SAWH40k. The sequel to Thousand Shinji, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4320933/1/The-Open-Door][The Open Door]] starts off sort of OK, rapidly deteriorates into Mary Sue wanking, and then manages to actually pull out of a downward spiral into something halfway readable with the Forgotten Realms etc. segments, at which point just having reached something interesting the fic promptly dies, abandoned forever, leaving me with extremely mixed feelings.
