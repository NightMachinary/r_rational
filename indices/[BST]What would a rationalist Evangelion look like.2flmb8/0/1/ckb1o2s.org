  The nearest thing to a different outlook and bizzarely awesome and (more) well adjusted characters in current NGE fanfic is probably Nobody Dies .

For completeness, the other NGE fanfics that have been discussed in this sub: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2b8r0b/iq_evangelion_by_sunshine_temple_and_if_that_dont/][And If That Don't Work?]] and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/27iqqt/rthsf_human_immortality_project_rationalist/][Human Immortality Project]].

And of course /Shinji and Warhammer 40k/. About that one... is there somebody here who has read this till the end? I stopped reading at chapter 25 because it seemed the author had run out of ideas. (Shinji traveling to a monastery in the mountains to train telekinesis?) So is the second half of the story as good as the first?
