That said your idea of rebooting into a less nonsensical universe is one worth looking at. Though, then there comes the why question for the rampaging Kajui of the week. I personally would recommend anyone planning on tackling this look at some of the applications thought up in Shinji and WArhammer40k in building mega projects and maybe Aeon Entelechy Evangelion's setting for ideas. Nobody dies is probably a good source for ideas as stated above.
