Seems like the idea of changing the POV character is a wise one. If a core aim of rational!fic is to take an irrational universe and, by placing a rational character into the mix, showing that it can be solved, then keeping the defining features of the world as close to canon as possible would seem ideal. And since Shinji is very much central to what makes Eva the world/work it is, keeping his personality and flaws intact seems wise. After all: wouldn't we all like to see some sense driven into Shinji? And if that's to happen, our protagonist should be someone else.

Personally, I think it'd be best to have Kaji as our protagonist, since his aims are already closely aligned with trying to oppose SEELE. Or perhaps even Kaworu, who was arguably the most insightful character in the series: if instead of practically trying to get killed, he strove to avert tragedy, it would be a far more interesting show.

I'm not too keen on Gendo himself being the protagonist, for the reasons I stated above; however, even he /could/ be a good choice, if instead of just striving for his own version of instrumentality, his aim was true transhumanism: not a hive-mind-soup, but truly ressurrecting Yui and stopping death. Still, I'd much rather see him be an antagonist, at least to start with: that way I'd get to see him converted to sanity, and feel the catharsis that would come with him overcoming his flaws from the original work. So my pick would be a Kaworu or a Kaji that actually manages to put things right.

And given the many continuities of the show, combined with the fact that at least some of them imply all continuities to exist within past/future timelines/other dimensions in the show's multiverse, it'd be great to see a fic that asserts itself as the "true/good" ending of the entire multiverse: the solution that all the other incarnations of Eva were destined to culminate in, since eventually, rationality /will/ win out. Even if it takes multiple life cycles of the universe itself.
