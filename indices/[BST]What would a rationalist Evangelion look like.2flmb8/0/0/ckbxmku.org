  Fundamentally, as presented in canon it don't really make a great deal of sense for a happy and well adjusted individual to be an Eva Pilot... a lot of the best part of NGE was exploring a bunch of messed up protagonist characters...

Quick counterpoint: What if it was written entirely from Gendo's perspective? Up to and including him justifying his neglect and abuse of his son for the good of humanity. Perhaps another perspective on the Human Instrumentality Project. Plotting with/against SEELE. [[#s][]]

Others in this thread seem to be pointing out that it'd be next to impossible to write rationalfic set in this universe due to all the supernatural elements, but... isn't that exactly what HPMOR did?
