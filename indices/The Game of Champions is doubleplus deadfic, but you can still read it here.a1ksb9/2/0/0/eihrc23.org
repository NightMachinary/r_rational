There's a couple good ones I have really enjoyed reading. The Heptagonal Ring is an excellent read, Pokemon only and decent in length. A couple others that are not quite as well written, yet I very much enjoyed are The Path of Destiny, and The Surprising Adventures of a Glaceon in Unova.

Now, you want a Great read? The Thinking Man's Guide to Destroying the World. That story should have been sold in hardback. Writing; great. Characters; great. Plot twists; ya won't see 'em coming.

Currently I'm looking for something more in the style of Path of Destiny, where Pokemon are very obviously sapient, and their decisions and feeling are just as relevant as the human characters. If anyone's got any suggestions, hmu.
