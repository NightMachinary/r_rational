No problem. Rest assured that if any thing else like this happens for a fic I have read, my response will be the same.

However, since you and I are different people with different tastes, here's what you need to take matters into your own hands:

Install Calibre (availible for win, mac, lin, etc) and its plugin fanficfare. Then, just copy a story URL and give it to FanficFare, which will autocreate a epub for you. Copy the Epub into an archive folder - this is necessary because while an author deleting a fic will not destroy the epub, if they overwrite the chapters with blank files, FanficFare will update the epub to a blank slate.
