It's really a shame, because when I started Origin of Species I got a lot of recommendations to read a lot of Pokemon fanfic, and Game of Champions was the only one I really enjoyed. I'd hoped to see where he took his story when he picked it up again for more cross-contamination of ideas, but looks like I'm going it alone.

A more recent story, Pokemon: The Line, was good too, but even shorter and also unfinished. It anyone else has others to recommend (not Sun Soul or Traveler, I tried but couldn't get into them) that are similar, feel free to share.
