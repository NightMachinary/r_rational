Bless you [[/u/Lovepoint33]]. There have been a few other fics that come close, but GoC still stands at the pinnacle of fanfiction in my mind. It's a shame that it's confirmed dead now and that Lamora doesn't see the worth in it that so many others do, but it would be a true waste for it to disappear entirely. Thanks for keeping it alive!
