Funnily enough, if L. Lamora is a handle, he is following the path of his namesakes author.

The guy who wrote the lies of Locke lamora was destroyed by the divorce of his wife, stopped writing for years, abandoned several projects, and when he was finally pushed to release the novel he had already been paid an advance on (that last clause is supposition) it was notably below the standards of his previous writing.
