To be clear, I wish the man only the best. I think he's a great writer with a talent few if any could replicate, I just also think that he loved his wife very much and hasn't recovered from her leaving him. My name is Oliver Horsey, and once I finally realised that the Lies of Locke Lamora was essentially Oliver Twist Fan-fiction (and appreciated that my name shares the same number of syllables as Locke's original name) I have really appreciated Jean Tannen saying ~'shit, I would've changed my name too'
