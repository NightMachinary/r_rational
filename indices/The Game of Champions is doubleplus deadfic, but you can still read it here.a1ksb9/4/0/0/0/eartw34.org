Just off the top of my head, /Fargo/ for PMMM (complete, with a sequel currently in progress) on FF.net, /Hammered Down/ for Bleach (also complete on FF.net, with a sporadically updating sequel), /Maybe I'm a Lion/, a Kara no Kyoukai/Prototype crossover on Beast's Lair (abandoned, but with an enormous amount of enjoyable content), and /Weaver Nine/ for Worm (likely abandoned, but at the conclusion of a gripping arc).
