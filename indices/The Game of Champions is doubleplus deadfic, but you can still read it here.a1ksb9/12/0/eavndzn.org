So, I don't think he does fanfiction anymore. I found him on an old forum awhile back, and honestly? It seems like his writing has still gotten progressively stronger over time. He has a mastery over powerful and evocative speech, and it's only gotten better.

His story is a cynical, angsty view of a world, but its so damn solid that he could get a book deal with it, if he got the confidence back.
