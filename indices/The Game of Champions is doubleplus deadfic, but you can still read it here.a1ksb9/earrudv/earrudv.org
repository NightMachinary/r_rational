Well, this is a bit of a swift kick in the nuts. I can empathize with thinking one's writing is poor, as can anybody who's ever put words to paper. But /The Game of Champions/, removed because of qualms about quality? That's not an explanation, it's the punchline of a joke, and not a particularly funny one. TGoC was a strong contender for my favorite fic of all time, certainly in the top ten. I don't even know what to say.  

Nothing to be done but archive everything, I suppose, and put it in with Post's /Manifest Destiny/ and other assorted stories that have vanished from the internet. DLP's work by author subforum still has the text for a few of Lamora's works, if anyone else wants to nab them, though hastily saved HTML files don't make for the best reading experience. Still, I managed to acquire: /By The Victors, The Legend Yet Grew, The Last Son of Fire,/ and /The Gravehand of Morrighan'nan/. According to the Wayback Machine, nothing but his Skyrim and Pok√©mon fics were ever uploaded to FF.net anyway, so I don't think I'm missing anything...
