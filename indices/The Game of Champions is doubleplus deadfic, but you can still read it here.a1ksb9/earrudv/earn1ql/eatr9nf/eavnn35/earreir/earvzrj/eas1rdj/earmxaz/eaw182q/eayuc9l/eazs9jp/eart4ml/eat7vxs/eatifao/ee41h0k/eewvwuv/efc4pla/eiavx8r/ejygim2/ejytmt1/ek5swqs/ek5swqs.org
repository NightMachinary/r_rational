Hell, I have a story that's been on hiatus since 2010 due to my own ongoing shit. It's just awesome that you're doing it to begin with. If you're not adverse, I'd like to typeset your proofread version with the other chapters and make an pro-quality final release. After investigating, it seems like L.Lamora's had a rough time of it, and maybe it won't change his opinion of his works - but even if he think's we're boorish for liking it, I hope that knowing that he had enough of an impact to have that done gratis might give him a reason to smile a bit.
