The format of the story makes the ending a cliff regardless of where your stop. It's so damn insanely good that it's worth it anyway. More than being a good fanfic, TGoC is one of the best /stories/ that I've ever read, period.

In brief, it's a loose retelling of the RGBY games, with FR/LG elements also appearing.
