By the way, this site has a pretty large archive of fanfiction.net fics, including The Game of Champions. I think it just archives everything anyone has downloaded using the site. Useful for finding stuff that's been taken down. Unfortunately it only covers FF, not AO3. Not necessary for now since you posted the mega link, but this could be handy in the future if you are looking for something else.
