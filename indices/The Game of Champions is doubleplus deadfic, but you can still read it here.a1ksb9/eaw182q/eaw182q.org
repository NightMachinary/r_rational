I wish people wouldn't delete writing they think is trash. Partly, because they're sometimes wrong, but also because I think that making bad fiction publicly available is a public good. In English classes, you're only ever exposed to exemplary works (at least in theory). There's never any time dedicated to examining bad works to look at them to try and figure out why they're bad, or mediocre works to see what stopped them from becoming great. One of the reasons I like reading amateur fiction and fanfiction is that I can often see the seams of the craftsmanship, and getting to examine them makes me a better reader and writer generally.
