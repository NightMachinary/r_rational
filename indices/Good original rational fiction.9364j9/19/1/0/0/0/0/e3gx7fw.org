I'm not sure what you refer to here when talking about deeper layers. I think perhaps the issue is, different people have a different feeling of what constitutes 'depth', depending on how much certain aspects jump to their eye. HPMOR wears its thematic heart very much on its sleeve - in fact, if anything, it occasionally spells it out a bit too much. Rational!Harry is very vocal about his ethics and principles. Of course, there's also a lot of undercurrents about how Harry isn't ALWAYS right - while none of that is usually said out loud (or at least it only partially is, usually through McGonagall, Dumbledore, Quirrell or Hermione) it's still pretty transparent. There's plenty of references to real theories and science one can go read up on, of course, and there's plenty to do if you want to crack the story as a puzzle and try to figure out what's going to happen beforehand (that was probably more natural for those who read it as it came out, and now you have to purposefully slow down the pace of your reading for it). But ultimately, there's not that much concealment about the /meaning/ of the story; and the prose is certainly easy to read and straightforward. So yeah, in a scale from JK Rowling to James Joyce, I consider it a light read. But that's probably me, because I usually don't really feel any effort following even a dense story as long as it's written in a straightforward manner. While literary prose (especially English one, since I'm not mothertongue) can get far more challenging for me.
