Imo, it's still the author making things happen just because he said so. Rather than deciding what the thing is himself, he rolled dice, but he still decided arbitrarily what the outcome was going to be and then contrived a plot that ended up in that outcome. That for me isn't rational.

I'm being pretty picky there, but basically the events with dice rolling only occured because the author rolled the dice, not because it made logical sense for it to happen.
