I also have reservation on reading fanfiction. What's mattered is not about our knowledge of the fandom, but our general feeling toward the original works. An original works that is greatly written will discourage me reading its fanfic. In a way that anything offered inside fanfic will never hope to be canon. The original was already great after all.

An original works that is disappointing in one way or another will also discourage me reading its fanfic, but in different way. This time, bothering with them became questionable. After all, the original work already sullied the setting, character, plot, or whatever; improving upon them will only amount to excuse. This is what I feel about HPMOR. It's a good piece of fiction, but in the end it only amount to its author doing an exercise. I believe it would have been better if Eliezer Y used original's characters only as cameo instead of revising them. But it would have been GREAT if Eli creates new setting entirely instead of borrowing Rowling's.

That means, the greatest fanfiction is fanfiction of works that I knew nothing about. Without fore-knowledge or expectation, I suppose they will virtually be an original work.
