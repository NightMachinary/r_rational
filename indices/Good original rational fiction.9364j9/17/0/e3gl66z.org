I've read quite a bit of this, and I lean toward "no, it's not particularly rational, let alone rationalist." Figuring out how to exploit the variety of powers is nice, but seems to happen with an ease and speed that just isn't realistic at all, and the way that character after character is overwhelmed by the amazing awesomeness of Roland's territory tends to strain belief.

It's an interesting fantasy read, but little to do with rationality IMO.
