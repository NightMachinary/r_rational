I'm curious: why specifically do you want original works?

If it's just to explore a new setting, then there are probably fanfics worth reading where you aren't familiar with canon. Or where they're really far diverged from canon (there's not a whole lot of the original Harry Potter left in Following the Phoenix, for example).
