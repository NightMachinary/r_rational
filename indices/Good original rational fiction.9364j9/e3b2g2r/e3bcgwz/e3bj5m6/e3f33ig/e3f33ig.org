Among other things, the entire reason that the world is the way it is is because everyone with powers has a space worm in their head that makes them punch people instead of doing anything useful. The protagonist could have saved billions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives if she had used her insect-control powers to pollinate plants efficiently and eliminate disease vectors such as ticks, rats, etc. Instead, she punched people with spiders. As far as I'm aware, she didn't even have the Protectorate set her up with a massive farm of millions of spiders so that she could weave those awesome spider-silk uniforms and cables for everyone.

Then there's the Endbringers, super-kaiju who keep society from making progress by occasionally showing up to destroy random cities. No nation on earth ever makes a serious effort at destroying these things; their only answer is "let's get all the super-powered types we can find into one place and punch the kaiju until they go away". There's a story called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/weaver-nine-worm-fanfic-au.289395/][Weaver 9]] in which someone actually tries to come up with real solutions to the Endbringers, all of which are much more sensible than those in canon.

Then there's the fact that society allows supervillains to rampage around instead of saying hello with a sniper rifle. (Or equivalent for the tougher supers.) If you do enough bad stuff then they will capture you and put you in prison (the Birdcage), but they don't really make that a priority; it's shown in canon that Alexandria is able to locate and capture random villains in a huge city within minutes, but she can't be bothered to bring in Lung, the Butcher, the Slaughterhouse 9, Kaiser, or any of the other supers who are running gangs or killing for fun. Yes, an argument could be made that this is because she is a member of Cauldron and they want lots of killing and death so there will be lots of triggers so there will be lots of capes to fight the Endbringers. This is a poor argument since Cauldron has a way to mass-produce powers. It's not reliable or safe and the powers that it produces may or may not be quite as strong as the 'natural' ones (it's unclear), but it exists, and it's a much better road to creating superHEROES than hoping someone will have an insanely traumatic experience and come out of it with a positive and prosocial attitude.

I could go on, but that's a reasonable list.
