It makes perfect sense. But the problem is not whether it makes sense or not. The problem is, that "law" is presented after reader is exposed to fantastic powers, without any indication of such law existence until it's reveal. It sounds like excuse that way.

If you want to reveal a law after the fact, it's best to do it Chekov style. Consider the trope 'Chekov Gun,' A (or some) clue is planted early in the story. A character bothered by it in the middle. Taking action is not necessary, because the point is to bring this problem up to readers' attention. By the end of the story, the "law" revealed. This way, the "law" will not sound like an info dump excuse, but an integrate part of the story.
