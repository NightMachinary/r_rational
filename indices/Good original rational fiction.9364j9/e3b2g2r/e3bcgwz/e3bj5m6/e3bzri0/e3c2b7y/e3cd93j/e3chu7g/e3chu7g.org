(Not Alex, but interesting question) Doc Future also has levers being pulled to bring about that world, in the form of various forms of probability manipulation. More elegant levers, but still, not subtle ones.

Uhm. Lets see.. Richard Roberts "do not tell my parents" series has a superhero setting that makes sense without outside forces bending everyones minds into pretzels, but it is also a world where superheroes and villains both are very aware they are being silly buggers and it is a centuries old game with very firm rules to limit lethality and collateral damage. It is also a very silly series of books. Recommend for that, but not as rational fic.

April Daniels Dreadnaught and Sovereign is a world where 95% of the powered do just take up being a flying courier, tunnel builder or whatever their powerset lends itself to, it just also focuses on characters who are in the 5% and why the heck they would do that.
