People keep saying those thigs without justifying themselves. Just saying "because ziz" is a non answer, and I see several mentions of the conflict drive disqualifying the story somehow, when the concensus is that the level of ifluence on a person is exagerated to say the least. Even then, parasitic powers manipulating people is not an irrational justification of why the world is the way it is, which is the point of rational fiction, trying to make a universe make sense
