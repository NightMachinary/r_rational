Then you slowly acclimated to it like the nominative frog in the pot.

Worm starts out with the /pro/tagonist nearly suffocating someone to death by clogging their orfices with insects. It proceeds through ever-increasing horrors: she befriends a group that includes someone who can turn you into a puppet in your own body. That happy group takes on all manner of SCP-grade horrors, becoming greater and greater horrors themselves, until an entire multiverse of humanity is briefly enslaved and billions upon billions die.
