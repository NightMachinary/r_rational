We had an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67ebij/how_old_are_the_members_of_the_rrational/][age survey]] some time ago. Light googling didn't turn up anything else recently.

Lesswrong used to periodically have surveys. The rationalist [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/03/ssc-survey-results-2018/][SSC community]] has had much more extensive surveys, conducted more recently; the demographics there were heavily white male, but stood out from the norm in other ways (for example - between 6x and 12x the rate of trans people compared to the general population).
