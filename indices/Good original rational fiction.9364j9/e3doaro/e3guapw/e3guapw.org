I just finished reading Unsong and that was literally what I thought. Like, ok, [[#s][spoilers]].

Anyway it was a really compelling read, and made me think back to Umberto Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum". There was a character in there who was too into kabbalah and even went as far as considering using a computer to try all permutations of the letters in the Bible to find the True Name of God (sadly, that book was set in the 80s so this was even more ludicrously out of reach for their machines than it is now).

Also now I have that verse, "they enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin", stuck into my head. First time I run into a /poetry/ earworm. But that sentence's rhythm is so damn catchy.
