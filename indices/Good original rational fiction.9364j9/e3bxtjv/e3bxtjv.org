[[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] by Peter Watts. It's a sci fi book that delves deeply into questions of conscience and sentience, eventually taking on a bit of a horror tone. An excellent example of a dystopia that isn't immediately identifiable as one as first. The book, originally published physically, is free to read online. It was part of this sub's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7yb64q/monthly_book_club_february_2017_book_discussion/][monthly book club]] (which I think is dead now??). Read it, it's excellent.
