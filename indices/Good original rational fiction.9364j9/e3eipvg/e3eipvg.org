"Release That Witch!" is a story about an engineer who is transported to a medieval society with witches and body swaps with a prince. He uses his modern knowledge to transform lives for the better and exploit witch powers with science for maximum efficiency.

Not written to be rationalist, but I say it qualifies since it teaches real science within the story. Also if you wanted a ruler protagonist, this story fits that niche nicely imo.
