Ok, I know I said hpmor earlier, and that was stupid and a result of reading poorly. Know what you should go read. UNSONG!!

It's....weird, but very very compelling. It's about a world that is ruled and governed by a gross mishmash of biblical metaphors and magics derived from kabalah. I am a staunch non believer, anti-theist, and I loved every word of it.
