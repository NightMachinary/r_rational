If it isn't super tacky to rec my own work, I'll do so ( I guess I did so even if it is tacky).

The Fifth Defiance: People got superpowers, they wrecked the world, and nowadays a tyrant rules over the rubble. Our protagonists work from within her regime in an attempt to rise up and fix the world.

Obviously it'd be super biased for me to say if it was good or not, but one thing I can say is that it is pretty long, so if you can tolerate this you can kill an afternoon or two crunching through my archives.
