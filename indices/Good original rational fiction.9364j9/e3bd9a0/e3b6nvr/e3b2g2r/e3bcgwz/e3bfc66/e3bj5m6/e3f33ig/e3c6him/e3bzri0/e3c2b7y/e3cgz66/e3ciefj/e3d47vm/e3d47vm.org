  Even then, parasitic powers manipulating people is not an irrational justification of why the world is the way it is, which is the point of rational fiction, trying to make a universe make sense

If the story premise was 'what if superheroes were all driven to conflict', then sure.

But instead it's 'what if powers deliberately seek out bad and broken people and manipulate them to seek out conflict, and also the world is low-key run by a group that thinks listening to the suggestions of one of these powers is a good idea, and also there are multiple sentient natural disasters that show up occasionally to destroy major population centers to stir up more conflict and then only pretend to be driven off because ha-ha fuck you they were just playing around the whole time, and one of those natural disasters is also psychic and precognitive so everything always goes wrong and she destroys spaceships humanity can't even escape the planet'.

That's okay! Not all rational fic is good and not all good fic is rational. It can still be a good and engaging story! And the characters can still show originality and cleverness! But at that point it sure sounds like wilbur wanted to write some grimdark spandex action and didn't care so much about exploring the plausible worldbuilding around a cool premise, or investigating how characters might overcome the limitations of that premise.
