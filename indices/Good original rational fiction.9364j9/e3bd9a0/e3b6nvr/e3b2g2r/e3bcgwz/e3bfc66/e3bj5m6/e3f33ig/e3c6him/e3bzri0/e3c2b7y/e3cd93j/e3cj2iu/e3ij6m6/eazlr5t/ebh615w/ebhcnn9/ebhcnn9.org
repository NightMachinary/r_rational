The Chekov's Guns are placed down in the very first arc, when Taylor encounters Lung. She actually wonders how he can breathe when he's covered in fire, as he shouldn't be able to get any oxygen. It's established from the beginning of the story that powers will sometimes break physics to keep the powered person alive when otherwise they wouldn't.

Thus, when the reason for powers is finally revealed, it not only makes perfect sense but also explains all the little clues raised throughout the entire story.
