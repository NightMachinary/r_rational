hmm...yeah i suppose (for me) it would depend on when and how the dice were rolled. i imagined that wildbow gave everyone hitpoints and rolled to assign damage from various attacks as they progressed. the less fine-grained the rolling, the less rational it is. so if it's a "taylor wins the fight only on a natural 20" sort of deal, then creates the winning fight post-hoc, it would be less rational, even if the odds of her winning were appropriately allocated.
