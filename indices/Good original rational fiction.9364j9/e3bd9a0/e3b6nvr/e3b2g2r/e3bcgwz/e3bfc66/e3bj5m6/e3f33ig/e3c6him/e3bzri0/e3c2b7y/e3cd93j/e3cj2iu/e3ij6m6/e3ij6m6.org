Isn't there some kind of physic defying limitation for power or something in Worm? Something like 'you can phase the wall but the ground will still let you stand instead of falling.' This is one example of author think the power first and think the excuses so that 'the power works as intended' next.

Frankly, this thread alone rife with example of the author trying to fit the setting into the characters, contrary to rationalfic criterium, which is the characters make do with what the setting allowed them to.
