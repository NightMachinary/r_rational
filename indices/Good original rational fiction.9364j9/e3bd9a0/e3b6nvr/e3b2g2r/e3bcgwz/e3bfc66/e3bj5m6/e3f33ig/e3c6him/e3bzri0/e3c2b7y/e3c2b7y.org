That's a very uncharitable view.

To me, Worm is more "rational adjacent" for two primary reasons:

- Worm is not primarily about people thinking, it's primarily about characterization and relationships. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but it's not generally what people come to this subreddit for, and any work which is more about characterization than thought will lean away from what I mean when I say "rational fiction".
- The world of Worm exists as it does through multiple attempts at justifying a setting with superheros and super-villains. Every way that this paradigm breaks is given a patch, and there are sometimes patches /to/ the patches so that the patches themselves don't break things. To me, this says that Worm cared more about pastiche than it did about following the consequences of the rules it made (especially since some of the rules are, IMO, really inelegant and over-fitted to creation of the setting).

These are both matters of opinion.
