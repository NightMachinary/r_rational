Because the author leaned way too hard on the scales to get people in costumes punching each other. And to get the grim-dark. Neither of those are logical outcomes of just the powers.

Also.. Taylors powers would make her very rich, or a very nearly perfect spy/panopticon, but what she actually uses them for is combat.

That is a general problem - Non-costume non-combat rogues ought to have made up nearly the entire meta population, because "Make money" is not the hyper-rationalist response to getting powers, it is the first impulse of anyone raised in capitalism.

And combat ought to have gotten her killed, because hard-countering bugs when you know months and weeks in advance you are going to be fighting a bug controller is just not that difficult. This never happens.
