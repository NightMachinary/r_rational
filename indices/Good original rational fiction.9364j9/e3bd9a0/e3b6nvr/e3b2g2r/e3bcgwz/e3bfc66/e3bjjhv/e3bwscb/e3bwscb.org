Pact is without a doubt darker than Worm, to me. It's all the escalation and greyness in Worm but there's even less down time and the victories are even more Pyrrhic.

In contrast, I find Worm relatively optimistic. People might treat some fights as lost, like the Endbringers, and it's very up front about how utterly the system can fail, but in the midst of it you can see the characters striving for something better, each in their own way. Some may be naive or counterproductive about it, and others strive to destroy instead, but there's enough desire to do better, enough hope for a better world even if just on a few frontiers, that I can't see the world as a whole as grimdark.
