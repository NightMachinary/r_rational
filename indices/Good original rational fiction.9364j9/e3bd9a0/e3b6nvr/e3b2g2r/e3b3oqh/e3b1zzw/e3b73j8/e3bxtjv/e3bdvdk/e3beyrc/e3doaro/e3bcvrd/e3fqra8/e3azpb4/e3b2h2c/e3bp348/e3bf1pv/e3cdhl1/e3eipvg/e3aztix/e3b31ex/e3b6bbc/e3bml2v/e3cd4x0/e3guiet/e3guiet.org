I find HPMOR to be a pretty light read, in the sense that while there's certainly a lot of scheming and strategizing it also is all pretty straightforward - it's strongly plot-driven, full of humour and light moments, there's a main conflict, a clear hero, plot twists, all that stuff. I'd say for me a book that's more character-driven, has difficult prose or heavy symbolism, is more metaphoric etc. tends to be a far more challenging read. HPMOR is the sort of read you breeze through, and it would last very little if it wasn't so long.
