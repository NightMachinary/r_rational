Well, you /can/ just read through it and enjoy the story, but you're really just skimming the surface if you do that.

Which you're quite at liberty to do, but since those deeper layers are very much there, and are kind of the point of the whole thing, I don't think that the original 'action movie "turn your brain off"' comment is accurate.
