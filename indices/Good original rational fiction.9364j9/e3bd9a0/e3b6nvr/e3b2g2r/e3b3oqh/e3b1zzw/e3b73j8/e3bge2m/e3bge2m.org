As someone who is not the author, I also really recommend the The Fifth Defiance. It's an excellent piece of speculative fiction, though admittedly the theme of "What if the equivalent of Superman was evil?" is one of my favorites.

The whole sequence of events after Prevailer went on her rampage is excellent. Strong writing and characters overall as well.

On the subject of superhero Rational fiction, the other two good I've read are [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]], which you've probably read about. Excellent writing and conflict, but the world constantly fucks everyone you even barely start to care about in a fashion and frequency that would make George R.R. Martin shudder. By the end, I'd given up and was rooting for [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][everyone to die]], pretty much.

+Lastly, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With This Ring]] is also a very good piece of superhero fiction, a lot more hopeful and lighter than the two above. It's basically uplift fiction, with the protagonist starting to use the countless pieces of technology and magic available in the DC universe to bring about a new age, while also being a normal (though a bit overpowered, later on) superhero on the side. Notable for also following an alternate reality version of the protagonist who is a lot less nice, like a videogame presenting you with "nice" and "harsh" choices. Extremely long, but an easy read+. Scratch that, forgot about the non-fanfiction bit.
