I don't know if PGtE is a rational fic as much as rational-adjacent but at some point that depends more on personal semantic differences in the definition of such than anything else. And FWIW for the proofreading it's only maybe a couple words a chapter, which isn't bad since if I remember correctly English isn't erraticerrata's first language.

I definitely second the recommendation, especially of the world. The lore and structure around Names and Roles admttedly ticks my boxes very well, but the world is just very deep in general. Multiple books could be made and would sell just as well as the actual series from the tales implied by the quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Hell, from those quotes we have characters that have become fan favorites without ever having an appearance or interacting with anyone actually in the story.
