Of the list in the wiki, these are not fanfiction:

- Three Worlds Collide
- Shadows of the Limelight
- The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant
- Mother of Learning
- The Last Christmas
- Worm
- Ra
- The Fall of Doc Future and sequels
- The Two Year Emperor
- Ted Chiang's stories
- A Hero's War
- Worth the Candle
- Sufficiently Advanced Magic
- On the Shoulders of Titans

Not on that list that I read are:

- Practical Guide to Evil
- Set in Stone ([[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/]])
- Unsong
- The Last Angel; The Last Angel: Ascension
- Pact (by Wildbow)
- Twig (by Wildbow)

Not rational per se but I still like: * The Gods are Bastards * Super Powereds: Year 1 (by Drew Hayes)

And, just to recommend them because they're good: * Codex Alera by Jim Butcher * Walkaway by Cory Doctorow

BTW, Walkaway may be my new #1 fiction.
