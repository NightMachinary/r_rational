I reckon I don't want to see the hunter exams again. I didn't think they were rational in the original series:

- Too many deaths, which isn't a problem when your mc has plot armor, but not so fantastic in a real system
- Information is weirdly distributed. Rather than promoting 'hunting for information', it would actually create a class of people 'in the know'.

Maybe if you come up with a different system it can be good, but the HxH world is full of other interesting things. People can learn nen without becoming hunters, so you could always insert the hunter exam in later.

I like the magic system a lot, and would love to see interesting uses. I'd prefer if you don't use 'special' types much. I get the impression they're just a cop-out from the author to let him put in abilities that don't actually work in his system. Kurapika's special ability actually fits with the system, which I like. Kurapika's restrictions to improve his power are also really cool. The original series had interesting ways of balancing OP abilities, and that would be cool to see. I particularly like ones based on physical limitations (eg. an invisible person still needs to see, so they will leave a small shadow where their eyes absorb light)

It'd be nice if you build an underlying system that keeps track on how the powers work and how powerful they should be - so no unreasonable power levels, and there is a clear distinction of what powers are theoretically copyable, and which are unique to the user.

[more personal opinions]

I prefer lighter stories and light rational stories are surprisingly few.

Please don't make the MC the only rational character! On that note, I like team strategy+battles more than individuals, so a support-based MC could be cool.
