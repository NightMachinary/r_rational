Here's my attempt at the bones of it:

The Hunter Association is a mix between the Justice League and a sort of platonic protection racket.

Superhumans are basically everywhere in this setting. Ordinary people have essentially no recourse against them. So desperate countries flocked to the Hunter Association. The rules are simple. Being a Hunter comes with incredible privileges, prestige, and freedom.

And a few very basic restrictions. They are usually things like, "don't kill anyone who didn't have it coming", "avoid wanton destruction of property", and "don't start a revolution". The Hunters like the amazing lifestyle provided to them, so they at least try to police themselves.

Receiving a Hunter's license is society acknowledging that you're strong enough to take whatever you want, so society is going to avoid all that mess by giving you a really nice life for free.

Starred hunters are a little different. Getting stars means you're basically a feudal lord. You have a flipping ton of privileges, but it comes with responsibilities. You have to respond to dangers. Ging Freecss is a double star ruin hunter. Which means that if he wants a ruin that he found below your building, he can just declare immanent domain and take it, paying you what the Hunter Association thinks is fair.

But if anything comes out of a ruin and attacks you, he is required to neutralize the threat. He can refuse, but your country can threaten to revoke the rights of Hunters if they think he's being overly negligent.

They are also required to stop rogue superhumans.

The lethality of the exam is mostly due to pressure from the nations supporting the Hunter Association. They want only enough hunters to keep the disasters in check, and don't really like funding them.

On the flip side, the general populace /loves/ hunters. Most are peaceful, they tend to go dangerous places and fight bad things, and they spend money like water.

Meteor City refuses to support the Hunter Association. It is protected (owned?) by the Phantom Troupe, who are classified as terrorists internationally.

Various shady cities try to discretely support them, viewing them as one of the only hard checks on the Hunter Association's power.

Oh, and the dark continent is space.
