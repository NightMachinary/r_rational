My only knowledge about Hunter x Hunter are a few random and out of context episodes I've seen. So I know it is Shonen and different people have different powers, but not from birth or by consuming a power up. I don't even know what Hunters hunt.

So whatever you want to write, all I would personally care about is how well your story stands on its own feet. I'll probably have the wiki open in parallel (like I do for most fanfics I read), but if I don't need prior knowledge to enjoy your fanfic and at the same time it scratches the fandom itch of the actual fans then that's perfect for me.
