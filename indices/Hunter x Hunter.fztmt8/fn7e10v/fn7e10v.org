Not sure if ditching the characters is a good idea. The great thing about fanfic is that you can more or less skip the lenghty introduction about who is who, what is their background and what is their purpose.

Instead, what I would like to see is a story centered on (for example) kurapika and his goal of killing the spiders. AFAIK a group as an antagonist as not been widely explored in a rational setting. This could lead to interesting interactions.

Also, if you plan to do the hunter exam, maybe changing some of the stages since the first two were pretty boring (they were meant for the character intro) and not very ''rationalisable''.

I will follow this closely.
