The most glaring flaw in HxH I felt was that the baseline of the setting isn't really well defined which is what I usually gripe about in fantasy stories. If getting a hunter licence is just worth a lot of money and prestige then the hunter exams would naturally attract the desperate rather than the capable. Kurapika mentions hidden opportunities but until Nen gets introduced there is no context for this at all and later who knows what about it and most importantly why is left really unclear. It feels like it was written like this for the sake of having more big reveals in the story.
