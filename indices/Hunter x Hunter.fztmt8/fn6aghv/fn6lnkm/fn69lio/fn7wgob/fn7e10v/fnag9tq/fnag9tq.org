I had a long conversation with my wife about how this universe setting is very difficult to rationalize.

Hunters seem to have this insane amount of immunity and power. What government is cool with all of these essentially uncontrolled vigilantes running around? Who enforces the sovereignty of Hunters, did everyone just get together one day and decide to be super cool about letting Hunters do what they want?

Who is pouring these vast resources into the exam just to sort out the strong guys? Wouldn't it be better for the Hunters to use the peons as labor with opportunity for promotion instead of just failing them out of the exam?

And don't get me started on the fight tower. It's literally the size of a city, and you can get Insanely Rich just by being a decent fighter. You can make a living wage fighting without even being very good. It's like if, in our world, being a junior varsity high school wrestler was enough to get you an apartment and disposable income.

It's a fun universe, but the politics and resource allocation doesn't follow any sort of pattern. It is pretty much just a series of hand waves so that you van have a universe where everyone expects you to constantly fight and no one is upset about it. Expect to bend a lot of the setting if you want to make it make objective sense.
