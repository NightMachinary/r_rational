So, if the Twilight Road is established and functions as intended, does this mean the seven princes (minus the dead one) can get back to Salia fast enough to fuck over Cordelias plans for succession? The law stating that they have to show up in person was supposed to allow her to put puppets in place and become a de facto tyrant of Procer.

Also, the Twilight Road needs to be added to Mario Kart as a twisted, mirror-realm version of Rainbow Road.
