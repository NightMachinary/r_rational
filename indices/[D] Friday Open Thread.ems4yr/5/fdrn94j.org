I saw/participated in Black Mirror's Bandersnatch last week. It's an interactive CYOA-style episode with a ton of interesting decisions. It introduces the mechanics well and has a ton of metastory elements. I won't spoil much, other than to say that I highly recommend it to anyone on this sub, and it isn't as pessimistic of technology as Black Mirror's usual stories.
