I'm a student studying a Masters in Engineering. My latest assignment is within my Engineering in history module and I have been tasked with creating a poster on something that interest me. I have chosen to create my poster on the human life span, planning to go through historical changes on the human life span and quality of life and ending on transhumanism, singularityand the possibility of living forever. I've had a look at Eliezer Yudkowskys website for inspiration and references.

Are there any interesting conclusions I can make, or further reading anyone could suggest. Or any good ideas for a title. I am also looking for good infographics related to the topic, or potentially survey results I can use to create my own. TIA
