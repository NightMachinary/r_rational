Because I'm getting a lot of people asking me if I'm OK with the fires in Australia, don't worry, they aren't affecting me whatsoever. If it weren't for the media I wouldn't know about them; my region is having a normal fire season (which is to say, I know of two big fires nearby, but they're regular big fires not apocalyptic big fires). It is still a very big deal and people in my region are doing what they can to help.

Also, I am planning on being in LA, SF, and Vegas between the ~1st and ~18th of Feb. Planning on catching up with [[/u/callmesalticidae]] but if anyone else wants to say hi, would be pleased to arrange it.
