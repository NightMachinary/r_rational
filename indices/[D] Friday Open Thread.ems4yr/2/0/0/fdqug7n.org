I did! But with no success. This was also on the very first day of the quarter (so there's no real rapport built yet), and I'm not actually entirely certain a student swiped it, just that it wasn't in my bag when I left as I'd assumed, and I'm usually very thorough about triple checking my area to make sure I've not left anything. When I noticed it was missing an ~hour later I returned to the lecture hall at the end of the following class and it wasn't there.

There's a chance I just left it there in my haste to not impose on the next instructor's class time (there were lots of questions!), so I hung out and harassed the next class / instructor during the Thursday meeting but nobody claimed to have seen anything left behind. Nothing's turned up in any of the local lost and founds either. It's also pretty distinctive with lots of stickers etc. so it seems unlikely to have been picked up by accident. And I had location services / find my mac enabled but I guess it got turned off during some OS update or something. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Nothing mission critical was on it given both local and remote backups (it's also used almost exclusively for teaching, rather than research), but it's still pretty obnoxious to lose a ~$600 device! (esp. since I only make ~$20k / y). And my friend's replacement is actually a bit better in some respects (it's a refresh older, but with higher specs). So it's no catastrophe, at least.
