Lots of green fire doing things fire doesn't generally do. Personal forcefields which look like I'm closely covered in flame, waves of flame moving objects around and assembling more complicated machines, transmuting objects from flame, etc.

Though I'd honestly make a more powerful orange, yellow, or red lantern. No telling whether any of those would go horribly wrong in my hands, but they'd have a lot more to work with.
