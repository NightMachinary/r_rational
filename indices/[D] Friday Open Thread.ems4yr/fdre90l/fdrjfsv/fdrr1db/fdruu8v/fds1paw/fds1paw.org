Ok, I'd place that in very weak evidence in favor, and although it increases the chances of your hypothesis, I would think it more likely that someone who refers to prestige would only punish someone if they directly insulted someone or something with prestige, rather than introducing an arbitrary new idea. It's not enough to combat all the factors working against the hypothesis here. Things such as better things to get angry about, basic apathy (potentially caused by being overworked, having many projects to grade, wanting to get back to research (good old publish or perish), etc.), and human decency (even in a population selected for deference, I would predict people still being kind to one another, and not dishing out arbitrary punishments).
