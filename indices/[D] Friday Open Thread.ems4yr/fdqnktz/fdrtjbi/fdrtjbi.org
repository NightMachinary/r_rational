I had an old 'essay', [[https://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2020/01/narrativism-vs-simulationism.html][Narrativism vs Simulationism]], that goes into that division somewhat, but I think that's only one axis to divide fiction on, and not necessarily the one that best gets at rational fiction. After all, a reader doesn't necessarily know whether or not a text is a result of narrative or simulation, and it would be perfectly possible for the text itself to never give you enough clues. A work can be "rules-based" in the sense that it's based on rules, but if those rules aren't exposed to (or discoverable by) the reader, then it's all kind of moot. To give an example:

/Star Trek/ writers pretty famously put in "(TECH)" into draft scripts when they needed technology to work some certain way, which would then get filled in by someone else later and never held up to any scrutiny. Pretend for a moment that someone goes through all the work to make some set of episodes incredibly grounded from a technical perspective, with explanations for every bit of technobabble and a coherent science bible ... and then /doesn't actually do anything with it./ What's shown to the reader/viewer is all the same, and the work of making everything internally consistent is left on a hard drive somewhere.

Now, the generation method in both cases is one that I would term "narrativist" and you would term "directed", but given that they're (hypothetically) the exact same text, I wouldn't actually say that one is rational fiction and the other isn't. Now, if you added in and exposed a bunch of the technical bible, that would (to me) push it more in the direction of rational fiction, even if the method of generation was still narrative/directed. It's that exposure of deep thought on cause and effect, science, engineering, etc. that helps something to be rational fiction, because it makes it more 'thinky' and substantially changes the focus.

I've been idly working on an essay that delves into narrative focus and the way that two stories which contain the same events can be really variable in how 'rational' they are, but I really need a good test case, which I've been having trouble finding. There are stories where the engineering is just magic that happens off-screen after the engineer declares that he's had a brilliant insight, and there are stories where we follow the brilliant insight and have it shown to the reader, and it seems to me that this is largely about where the camera is pointed, rather than what's going on at the object level.
