[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/][Baba is you]] is pretty great.

It's a puzzle game where the environment has a number of statements, statements like =baba is you= or =wall is stop=. There statements are defined by objects in the environment, and you can push those objects around. For example, with those two statements above you could do =wall is you= and become all the walls in a level.

It can be very difficult at times, many levels seem genuinely impossible to start with. It's amazing at getting you to verify your assumptions.
