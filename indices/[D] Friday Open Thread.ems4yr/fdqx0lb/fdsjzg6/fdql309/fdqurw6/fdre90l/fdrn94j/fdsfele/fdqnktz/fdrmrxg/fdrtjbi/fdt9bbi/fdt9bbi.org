That rather reminds me of [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/][Noita]], a roguelite with a sophisticated physics engine, procedurally generated world and extremely customizable weapons. The physics is exceptional, along the same lines as powder toy and you can do a lot with it. A perfectly reasonable solution to lakes is just drinking them, all the generic explosive barrels have actual oil or gunpowder in them and you can drink your enemies blood (if you have the vampire perk) to regain health.

The difficulty is such that you're required to exploit the wand mechanics to get to the 'end' and win. Another thing about the game is that while it appears to be linear, all the areas in the game are actually part of one huge world with repeating parallel universes to the left and right and sky dimensions on the top and bottom.
