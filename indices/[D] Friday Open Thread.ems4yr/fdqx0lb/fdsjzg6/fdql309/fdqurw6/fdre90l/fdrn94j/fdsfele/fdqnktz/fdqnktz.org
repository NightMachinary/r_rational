(Let's dust off /this/ ol' argument, it's been a while!)

In the past [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=drivesdk][I've written]] about what it would mean to make a "rational game" in the same sense as rational fiction. As a term it's ill-fitting, but the same is true of "rational fiction" so I didn't pay it much mind. Some time after writing, I was exposed to the term "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpAAX9CkIc][systemic]] [[https://youtu.be/9RvbIP4yDvU][game]]", which almost completely encompasses everything I associated with "rational games", independently converging on the same idea.

A game being "systemic" could be contrasted with a game being "directed". Events in directed games are scripted: a house burning down is triggered only after a particular event, such as a cinematic or after the player does something specific like "press X to interact with candle". A house burning down in a systemic game, however, is handled by the designer crafting rules that permit for houses burning down: things made of [WOOD] react a certain way when exposed to [SPARK] or [FLAME]. A specific NPC interaction might still result in a candle getting tipped over at a time decided by the designer, but it's /also/ pertinent when the player swings his torch in the closet, or when a lightning strike occurs, or when a ricocheting bullet hits a [METAL] item.

The designer still gets a burned down house in the end, but the difference is that in a systemic game a set of general /rules/ have been decided on, and the player is invited to explore those rules and use or abuse them as much as possible.

Sound familiar?

We've tread (and re-tread) the argument about what "rational fiction" means in the past, and it's always been brought up by various parties that "rational fiction" is a bad name before continuing on to ignore the label and discuss what it is we actually mean by the term.

Would "systemic fiction" work as an adequate replacement for the term "rational fiction"?

I do not think that "systemic fiction" covers literally everything that the term "rational fiction" today covers, but that is partially because the term "rational" is stretched to cover various associated-but-not-necessarily-similar aspects, and partially because there are differing opinions on what, exactly, deserves to have emphasis.

"Systemic" also does not imply the "thinkiness" aspects described in the current sidebar, has nothing to do with "rationalist" motives, and while it enables munchkinry it does not suggest it. Nevertheless, having a (neutral!) term to cover specifically a work that has consistent, logical, and plausible magic rules, worldbuilding, interpersonal interaction, and faction conflict seems to me to be a beneficial increment over what we have now.

Thoughts?
