In that case, systemic fiction does not work as an approximation to rational fiction, in my view. Rather, a work's position on the systemic/directed axis has /nothing/ to do with its placement on the rational/irrational axis.

The reasoning is as follows. Systemic/directed is a statement about the world - how it moves along to reach its goal. Rational/irrational is a statement about the protagonists, and how they react to the world in which they find themselves. You can have rational characters in a directed world, irrational characters in a systemic world, or any other such combination.
