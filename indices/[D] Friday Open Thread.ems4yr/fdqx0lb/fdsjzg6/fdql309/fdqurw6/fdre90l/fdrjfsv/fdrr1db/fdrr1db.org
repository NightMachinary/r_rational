Why are you so pessimistic about the outcome? My priors would be in favor of the teacher caring just as much as they'd care about any other project given equal quality over them punishing [[/u/TheFlameTest2]]. Punishment would require that the teacher both will think negatively of the project /and/ be a teacher that'd punish a student for disagreeing with them. Although people like this do exist, in my experience they tend to be in the minority, and although (I think) it is even more unlikely that the teacher rewards [[/u/TheFlameTest2]], the reaction proportional to quality of work hypothesis still dominates.
