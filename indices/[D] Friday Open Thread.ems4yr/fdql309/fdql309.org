This week I learned how utterly trivial it is to gain access to a user account on a computer without knowing the password! After a medium-large lecture with 100+ students I was answering questions and floating around, during which time my macbook pro mysteriously disappeared from my desk (the nerve!) as my back was turned. A friend offered to give me one of his old MBPs as a replacement, only he's out of town currently and would need to return in order to play around with different passwords. A quick google and terminal command in recovery mode later -- literally 2 minutes, including search -- and I had complete access to all unencrypted data. No need to remove the SSD even! Looks like there are equivalent steps to take with Linux and Windows systems.
