Without getting into spoilers, there is this long extended dreary section that keeps going and going, and it feels mostly about getting past environmental obstacles in excruciatingly slow detail.

It didn't help that at that point of the story, the plot is a bit mysterious and it feels like Bina is just sorta fumbling blindly through with no real understanding of what is happening or why.

I can't exactly remember when I started getting engaged with it, but it was the section I described above that was frustrating enough to see me bounce of it multiple times, despite being rather intrigued.

After that, there was plenty that shined to the point where I can safely say that it ranks among some of my favorite things I've read online.
