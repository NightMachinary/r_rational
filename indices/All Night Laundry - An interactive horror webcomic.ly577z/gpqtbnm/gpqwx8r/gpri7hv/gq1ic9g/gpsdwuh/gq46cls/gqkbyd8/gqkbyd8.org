I tried to read this story, and I enjoyed it at first. A new character was introduced later on, and Bina and her companion were really annoying together, their sense of humor was just...ugh. It was a slog to get through those chapters and I eventually dropped it.

I'm still not entirely sure why Bina alone was likable, but Bina + companion was annoying. Weird, but I'm probably the only one who felt that way, lol.
