It's really impossible to understate how well written this multimedia webcomic is. Its just so damn cool, the art is great, and the plot is tight as hell. It's also the only piece of fiction I've read with time travel where a)the time travel is done well b) the rules of time travel are consistent and well explained and c) the time travel shenanigans don't become incredibly tiresome.

Also, the webcomic makes use of the website format to do some really unique interactive things that I can't honestly say I've seen anywhere else.
