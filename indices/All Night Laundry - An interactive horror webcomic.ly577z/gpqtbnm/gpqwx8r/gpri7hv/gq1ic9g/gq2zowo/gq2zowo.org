This is a bit hard to respond to without getting into spoilers.

It'd be like talking about complaints about worm with someone who dropped it or was midway through the story, while not willing to talk about the Entities.

Even addressing that spoilers exist that might push against these points is a bit of a spoiler in and of itself, but I feel obligated to say /something/ having finished the story.

I've been staring at the screen for a while now, and erased a couple of attempts, but I can't think of a way to address your points without talking awkwardly around spoilers.

I dunno, maybe others who have also finished the story can chime in and agree or disagree with me that I feel like these issues are addressed by the end of the story.
