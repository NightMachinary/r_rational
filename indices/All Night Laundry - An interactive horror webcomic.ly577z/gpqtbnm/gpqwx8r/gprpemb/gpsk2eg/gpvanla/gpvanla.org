How far did you get before you started getting into it? I've tried it a couple times, and while I want to like it, it always just kind of drags on and I eventually put it aside and then don't end up going back.

I slogged my way through all of Homestuck, so I'm not sure why I lose focus with this, but I do for some reason.
