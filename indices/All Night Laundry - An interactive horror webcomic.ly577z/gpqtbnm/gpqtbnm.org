I once posted this comic to here when it was finished, and 8 months later, the epilogues have just been posted. So here I am again reposting it to here.

It's a comic about time travel, eldritch monsters, clones, and lots of investigating and deduction to figure out confusing rules behind reality. Some romance and competency in dealing with emotions as well for those who are interested in that sort of thing.

Jack is planning to clean up and edit grammar errors as well as missing pictures, so if you want to wait a few more weeks, the quality should be improved, but it'll be minor stuff. The plot is set and there's no way he'll be rewriting anything into a second draft.
