All Night Laundry is great. Someone recommended it here as it was wrapping up and I devoured it all in like a fortnight or something. A simple comparison would be its like Homestuck if 80% of the content was cut out, and thus not a giant clusterfuck and instead a much more digestible and engaging story about (similarly to Homestuck) averting a time travel related apocalypse from an innocuous beginning point, puzzling out everyone else's motivations and goals, and also hitting on notes of relationships, identity, family, dreams, and ambition. Please read it.

Also the intentional changing and evolution of the art and aesthetics over time is neat too.
