I've read a bit more than a third of the way through and I don't think I will be continuing.

I haven't found it to be particularly "rational". The mysteries are vaguely science themed, and they talk about pop quantum physics things like Schrodinger's cat and the double slit experiment, but that does not make a "rational" story.

The biggest sin is that a large number of scenes, perhaps even an actual majority of scenes (in what I've read so far), can be described as "character(s) are trapped while scary monster slowly approaches, then a deus ex machina rescues them after they suffer some severe injury". That's almost the polar opposite of "rational fiction".

Plus the characters are unrealistically psychologically resilient, but that's par for the course for horror.
