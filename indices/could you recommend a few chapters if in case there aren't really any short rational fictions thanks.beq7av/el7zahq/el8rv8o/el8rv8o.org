How about [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/130698.Ted_Chiang][Ted Chiang]]? He writes only short stories and the [[https://freesfonline.de/authors/Ted_Chiang.html][stories]] he has written tend to be a good fit for this subreddit. I recommend [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/][Exhalation]] as the best story for this community.

Note that I just linked to a collection of some of his stories, but not all of his works are included.

If you want to get all of them, he has two collections on Amazon: [[https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ted+chiang&qid=1555647513&s=digital-text&sr=1-3][Stories of Your Life and Others]] and [[https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ted+chiang&qid=1555647513&s=digital-text&sr=1-2][Exhalation: Stories]].
