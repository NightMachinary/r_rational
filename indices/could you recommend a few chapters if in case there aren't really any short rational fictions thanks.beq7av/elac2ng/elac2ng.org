From K J Parker "A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong" ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092350/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2011/fiction_a_small_price_to_pay_for_birdsong_by_k._j._parker/]] )

can recommend his other works as well (The Folding Knife is short and really well done). Former Discussion about K J Parker : [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/92mv36/k_j_parker/]]

Also "The Dark Wizard of Donkerk" by Alexander Wales is often recommended and fairly short : [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html]]
