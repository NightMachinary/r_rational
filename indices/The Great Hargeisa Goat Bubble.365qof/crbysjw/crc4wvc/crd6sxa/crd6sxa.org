Planescrape: Torment, the story of a man who cannot die and is repeatedly run over by a jet. Played as a farce.

That said: what the Goat Fund did was replace itself, to where previously the Fund was the main source of dollars, now it's entirely speculators that fund the system. Instead of being backed by the UN, the price goes up because the price will go up. The self-fuelling nature is what truly made it a bubble. (Before, it was merely irresponsible fiscal policy from the UN.)
