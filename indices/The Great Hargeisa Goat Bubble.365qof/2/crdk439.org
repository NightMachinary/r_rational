  "Alternatively, the slaughter and personal consumption of the goat, while keeping one alive in the short term, would lead in the medium term to having no goat, and no money. In the long term, with neither assets nor capital nor cashflow, death would inevitably ensue. Luckily, my PhD had been devoted to aspects of arbitrage; the exploitation of price discrepancies in imperfect markets. I thus resolved to apply my knowledge of temporary market inefficiencies to my Goat.".

  Soon the shortage of actual goats led to a booming market in goat futures, goat options and increasingly arcane goat derivative products.

  True, the UNICEF budget for Somalia was paying out increasingly large compensation fees to the owners of dead goats, but one of the first moves by the UNICEF Official with Special Responsibility For Goats was to make the goat compensation fund self-funding by hedging much of it in goat futures.
