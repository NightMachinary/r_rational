I'd agree Cat's reply and leadership so far points to the far being loyal.

Cat accepted the oath in the spirit it was given and has been training the wild hunt one consumed digit after another that she expects her will to be acted on wether or not she is there. If the hunt is aware Cat still has power to enforce her will on it then it's members if it's learned are carrying out her will and delighting in the freedom it gives them in the mortal world subject only to her dictates. If they are not there may be more autocannabalism.
