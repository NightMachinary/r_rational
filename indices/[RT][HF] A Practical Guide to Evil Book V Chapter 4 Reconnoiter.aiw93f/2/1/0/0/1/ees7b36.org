Yes but they were sworn to Catherine specifically in her capacity as the "sovereign of moonless night", which is a thing that's been mucked about with before. It's been spotlighted as a potential plot point, and I don't think that Akua taking over her body for a moment there was really adequate climax for that buildup.

Plus, the last time she took a nap during a battle they stuck their thumbs firmly up their asses and refused to help at all.

What I'm saying is that even if she ordered the hunt to obey Thief's commands or whatever, that might not still hold since their oaths are probably sworn to Sve Noc now.
