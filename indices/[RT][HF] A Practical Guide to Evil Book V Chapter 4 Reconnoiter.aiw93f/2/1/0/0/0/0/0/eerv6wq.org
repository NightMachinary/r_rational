Not so sure about that, since Winter was absorbed/combined/somethinged with the Night, and so it's a farfetched assumption to make that the old title survived.

  “We swear to your service, Queen of the Hunt,” the fae said. “Queen of Air and Darkness, Sovereign of Moonless Nights. We swear ‘til the day of last ruin, ‘til all debts are paid. We would ride beneath your banner, in this world and every other.”

  The Queen of Callow rose to her feet, as bright and terrible as any of them, and softly laughed.

  “What clever foxes you are,” she said. “Your oaths I accept, in the spirit they were given.”

they swore to the "Sovereign of Moonless Nights" and since Catherine put a shitton of safeguards into that title... it might be relevant later... nothing is clear yet though.

Edit: I just realized, Larat's debt of 7 crowns or something that he made, it hasn't been repaid yet. So you're probably right.
