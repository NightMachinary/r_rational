How is the Army of Callow in Iserre? The Vales were collapsed and would take the army months to open up if Callow was so inclined to spend so much manpower on it when their economic situation is weak. The Staircase is far to the North and the Army would have to have fought through half of Procer to get to Iserre.

My only thought is that Maesgo got back to Callow and proceeded to blow the Vales up to open a path to Black. Rescuing Black would make sense since he's the only family he's got left outside of the Woe.
