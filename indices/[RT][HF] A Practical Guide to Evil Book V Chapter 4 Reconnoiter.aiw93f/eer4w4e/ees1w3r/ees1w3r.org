It strikes me as far more likely that Anaxares walked into the Waning Woods in the desperate hope that "his" army weren't suicidal enough to follow. Of course, the Tyrant gave zero fucks about all that, and so the armies of the League of Free Cities followed their Heirarch into the valley of the shadow of death, and emerged unscathed. Rather than losing them, Anaxares merely cemented their absolute faith in his leadership.

Blah blah blah foreign despots, something something Will of the People.
