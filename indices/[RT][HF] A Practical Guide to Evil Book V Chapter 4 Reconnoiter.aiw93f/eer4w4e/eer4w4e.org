Do we know any of the Hierarch's aspects yet? It's probably the reason he was able to lead his army through the Waning Woods and march much faster than normal. Considering what he believes in, I'd expect that one of his aspects will be to turn everyone under him into his "equals", i.e. Named, kinda like how Rider from Fate Zero can turn his followers into low level Servants with his Noble Phantasm.
