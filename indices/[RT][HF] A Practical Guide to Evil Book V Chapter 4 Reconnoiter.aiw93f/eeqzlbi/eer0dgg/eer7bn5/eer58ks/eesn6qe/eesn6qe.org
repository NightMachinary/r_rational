Cat as Iskaral Pust. Not sure if awesome or terrifying. I've commented before that APGtE borrows from the Malazan books, but if that happened... Cat should definitely watch out for winged monkeys.

(For those who don't know Pust was the Magus and High Priest of Shadow in the Malazan books, a job he got when Shadowthrone, being kind of lazy, let Pust write the holy book. Pust promptly gave himself the roles, along with adding some other useful bits like the High Priest getting to have two wives).
