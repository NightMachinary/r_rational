  It strikes me as far more likely that Anaxares walked into the Waning Woods in the desperate hope that "his" army weren't suicidal enough to follow. Of course, the Tyrant gave zero fucks about all that, and so the armies of the League of Free Cities followed their Heirarch into the valley of the shadow of death, and emerged unscathed.

I bet Erratic wishes he thought of that.

Edit: But no, they quite clearly declared war on Procer back in Hierarchy, during Second Liesse.
