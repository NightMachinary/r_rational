Nobody wants to spend months recovering after being shot, but you don't incorporate that into an FPS because it would ruin the fun.

A game should be balanced and enjoyable for all players. Including that type of realism sounds great on paper, but the end result is people having shitty experiences and not wanting to play anymore, and the game gets shelved.
