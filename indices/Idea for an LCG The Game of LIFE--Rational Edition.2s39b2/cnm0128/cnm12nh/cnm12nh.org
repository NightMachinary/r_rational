Well, I think that depends on the scenario, and on what yours and the other players' objectives are throughout the game. If you're playing with a time limit or a turn-limit, and enough players have conflicting objectives, that could be a problem. I think it might also be a good idea to have ways of gaining more edges and hindrances. Like say, if you gain 2 levels in solving puzzles or riddles, it could give you an edge that adds +2 to intelligence rolls before multiplying the roll by your base intelligence stat, or something like that, to determine whether your character successfully solves a riddle or puzzle, and maybe +1 for success in endeavors similar to riddle or puzzle solving.

For some scenarios, that kind of disadvantage could present a fun challenge, though.
