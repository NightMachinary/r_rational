Um. Maybe? Not sure how virtual resources would work in this game. Like if your character liked to play roleplaying games, and wanted to trade money for a virtual item in the game within the game, with one of their objective cards being related to that roleplaying game in the game. But there will have to be some way of conducting "metagames"? "Minigames"? Not sure what to call them. Minigames are as good as any name.

And if one of your objectives is to be a math professor, and after reaching that objective you drew a new objective card that said, "Increase the number of students who pass your class to at least X%, where X is determined by the standards of the college you teach at (roll a D20 for that when you are first about to get a job as a math professor), and you drew a resource card named "Conway's game of Life", I suppose that could be a resource with the "data" subtype.

I suppose the main types of resources could be objects, concepts, and connections? Data resources could be considered concepts that must be attached to object resources rather than directly to a character.

Of course, then there's the issue of cards that produce more copies of themselves or other cards. Like if you taught another player's character the knowledge of "Conway's Game of Life" the card couldn't just disappear from your own resource pool, you'd have to use a connection resource like "Learning/Teaching" to represent the knowledge that has been copied to another character's resource pool.

And of course, connection resource cards would have to be double sided, so they can be used to connect resources and/or characters under more than one player's control.
