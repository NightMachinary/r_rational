I think stickies are by their nature invisible, I don't know why but I presume most viewers imagine stickies to be unchanging and so look at them once on a new subreddit (and perhaps not even then) and then never again. Doesn't seem to be a good solution though because you don't want it for fall off the page. Maybe something like posting a 24 hour challenge notice thread, posting the challenge, stickying it after 24 hours, then posting a separate thread for a 24 hour voting period would have worked better. This could prompt everyone to read the thread.

This carries over into here I suppose, maybe those without forum experience don't feel the same way.

Quite understand re:lack of time.
