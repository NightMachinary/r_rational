I actually used to post, wait 24 hours, then sticky, but it wasn't clear to me whether it was making any difference in visibility, even if it definitely should have in theory. There's a bunch of noise involved with trying to figure out why people care or don't care about things, especially since it can vary seasonally (especially with the ebb and flow of the school year), which makes it had to do any analysis on what's working and what isn't.
