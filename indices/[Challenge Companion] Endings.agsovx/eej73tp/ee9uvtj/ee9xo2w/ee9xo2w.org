Fixed the typo. The Google Docs spreadsheet pretty much never got updated, and the wiki wasn't updated by me (though I may go through the effort to get it in order in the next few days).

I probably won't be doing a post mortem, but yes, it's a combination of a lack of interest and (for me) a lack of time. I found myself spending effort on the challenges that would better be spent on something else, and I think part of the problem is that it became "invisible" on the subreddit, something that people would just scroll past. (That might also be related to this sub shifting its focus more toward long-form web serials.)
