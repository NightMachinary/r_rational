  The challenge list is archived here. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, they're posted them on the wiki.

They are posted them? Shouldn't it be they are posted on the wiki.

Also the Google Docs hasn't been updated in a long time, and the Wiki equally updated.

Presumably this lack of interest is why the challenges are coming to an end? Will there be a post mortem on them?
