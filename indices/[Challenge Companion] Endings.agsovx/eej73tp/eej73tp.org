I remember really enjoying these for quite a while. I used to read a lot of the entrants, regardless of winner, and I entered a number of times myself (5 time champion, woohoo!)

As time went on, my priorities shifted and I sort of naturally started spending less and less time on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. I think it was a combination of my growing apart from it but also the sub growing in a direction that didn't appeal to me as much. Not to say it grew "badly"; it just became something I found myself not interested in.

Like even now, this is the first time I've been here in a few months, as I just have most story updates getting sent to my email anyway. I'm sad to see the challenges ending (I remember when they first started and they were weekly; what a rush :P) but I understand why they would.

Overall you've done a really good job [[/u/alexanderwales]] and, even though I'm not around anymore, I still really respect what you do for this community. Thanks for all of your contribution over the years.
