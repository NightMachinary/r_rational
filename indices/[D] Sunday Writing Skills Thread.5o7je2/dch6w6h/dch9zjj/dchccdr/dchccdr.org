Here's how I've handled them. Pretty much in line with your recommendation I'd say...

  At the appointed time, an automobile parked out the front of their cottage, and five people walked out; Lucia, two young men, a young lady and someone who could only be Elodia. She was dressed in a fine seafoam ballgown, covered in shimmering jewels. Her attendants wore more modern attire; the gentlemen in suits similar to Red's, and the ladies in gowns that were more practical and less extravagant.

  So he was doing as he was told, and escorted the party to the room that had been organised for them. The attendants, who seemed almost weak from the effort of walking up the stairs, eagerly stripped and climbed into the warm, comfortable beds. Lucia closed the door behind them and gave Red a small smile.

(the next day, and their "biggest appearance". Janissary basically means a human servant)

  The cottage's small kitchen was a hive of activity; a male and female janissary were getting dressed in the most odd clothing Red had ever seen. It was decidedly Victorian - as seemed to be the theme of this whole visit, judging by William and Elodia's clothes today being as old-fashioned as yesterday's, though somewhat less formal. However, this outfit was like nothing any self-respecting dressmaker would let out of his workshop. It was made out of a rich green material embroided with gold, a shapeless tube with long sleeves and pantlegs; the cut identical for both sexes, hiding the natural curves and form of both bodies. The tube extended above the shoulders, moving up to cover the face, stopping just below the eye. Most striking were the two-inch wide oval cutouts in the fabric, heavily outlined with the gold thread, located on the neck, wrists and inner thigh. The outfits had clearly been designed for a different sort of sensibility.

  The two other janissaries sitting by the stove, bandages around their wrists from where they had made their contribution to the ritual. Lucia explained she was keeping the temperature of both the warm and cold blood within a certain range, and how to test it on the inside of the wrist. It seemed like a lot to keep track of, but Lucia handled it with a comfortable smile. It was clear she had done this a great many times before. As Lucia poured her blood into the teacups, Red mentally recited which order they needed to be placed and at which angle to orient the handles when he brought them out.

  As Red was beginning to work up the nerve to run into William's arms despite the potential for further scandal that may bring, Elodia reappeared. Her four janissaries were in tow, the ridiculous green costumes that two of them wore being replaced with more ordinary attire. She stood in front of William, met his gaze, and once again spoke rapidly. William responded in kind and then, with a dramatic turn, she escorted her entourage out of the house.
