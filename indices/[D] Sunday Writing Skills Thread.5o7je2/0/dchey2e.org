Do you guys tend to write chapters in order?

My usual writing process is this: plan out loose sketch of events in Ch1, repeat for 2-4, sit down to start actually writing ch1, get inspired for ch2 instead and write that whole thing out, then start writing ch1, but halfway through realize that while I can hook up events such that the end of ch1 leads into ch2, it will feel really clunky and like I'm railroading the characters and forcing them to act in a way that doesn't feel like them. ERROR: UNABLE TO LINK CHAPTER 1 TO CHAPTER 2. Uuuhhh... I'll come back to this later. Repeat for chapters 3 & 4, 5 & 6 etc. Should I just get chapters 1&2 to connect and rewrite the end of 1 over and over until it both feels right and goes where I want? Or should I just go "welp, that chapter is doomed" and rewrite chapter 2?
