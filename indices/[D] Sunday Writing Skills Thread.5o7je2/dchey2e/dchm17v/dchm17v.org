Because [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com][Heroes Save the World]] deals with multiple characters and points of view over the course of a thirteen-chapter sequence, at least some of which aren't directly leading off from other chapters, it's easy for me to get stuck on one chapter and jump ahead to do a few other ones.

This has often led me to feeling secure about my six- or eight-chapter buffer, only to realize with a panic that I may have a lot of chapters written but the one that's coming up Right Freaking Now is still unfinished.
