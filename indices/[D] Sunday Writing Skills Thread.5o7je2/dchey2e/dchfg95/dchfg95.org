I think processes are different for everyone, and if you find that works (more or less) then you should stick with it. I also think in general, if your characters are doing things that surprise you, that's /excellent/ because it means you have a good sense of their voice / personality / etc, which means they're a proper character.

I do find I jump around a bit, but that's mostly because I'm not sure what happens in e.g. chapter 5, but I know what happens in chapter 7. Then I get inspired for chapter 5 and can go back and fill that in.

I think the fact that I've spelled out my entire plot already, including all the major beats, helps. I know what happens in each part of the story and how it happens, so there's no need to worry about the characters doing the wrong thing.

In your specific case, you'll either need to throw chapter 1 out and get a chapter 1 that flows into chapter 2 better, or just edit the heck out of both until they meet. I do know that a lot of the time when my characters get into a deep conversation that is completely pointless to the plot, or gives an impression I don't want the plot to give, I just suck it up and delete it. And either start over, or realise that you don't actually need that scene at all. It really hurts because often those things you put in like that are things you realy like, or little implications you really want to explore, but if they don't help thes tory they have to go.
