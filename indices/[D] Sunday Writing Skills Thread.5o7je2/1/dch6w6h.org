(I noticed this wasn't here and had a question so took the liberty of putting it up...)

Question:

A vampire in my story has 5 human servants, one named major character and 4 minor characters who basically have no impact on the plot (basically they're mobile blood storage units).

How do you balance between "all characters need names because they represent people who have you know dignity" and "I don't want to make the reader think they need to keep track of these four characters, when they impact the plot only as a group, and appear in two scenes, with no dialogue"?

It seems clunky and unnecessary to introduce them, you know, "and so she introduced them as Adam and Beatrice and Charlie and Diane, and sent them into the spare bedroom for the rest of the visit". But it seems weird not to give them names.
