Does any one else think a monthly or biweekly recommendation thread is a good idea to implement? A huge thread where everyone recommends stuff they think is cool.

I love almost everything recommended in this sub. As an example, someone mentioned the [[http://geeklyinc.com/sayer-episode-1-while-you-are-still-paralyzed/][Sayer]] podcast a few weeks ago and I can't stop listening to it. But there's so few recommendations on this sub and I guess I'm one of the few who doesn't really enjoy the BST threads.
