I sort of feel the same about this that I do about weight loss.

Weight loss is about calories in and calories out. But maybe more than that, it's about the mental aspects. The solution to losing weight is /much more/ about managing the mental aspects than it is about strictly calories. So to lose weight, you need to say, "Okay, what's the path of least /mental/ resistance to reducing net calories?"

Similarly for policy debate, there's a very necessary component to "optimal" which is "what will people actually go for". If your idea of optimal doesn't include the question of how the typical brain is going to react, then I would argue that's a bad definition of optimal (and I also think that this is one of the main failure modes for people who call themselves rational).
