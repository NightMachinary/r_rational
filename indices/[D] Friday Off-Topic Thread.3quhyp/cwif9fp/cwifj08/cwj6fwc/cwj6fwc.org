I haven't built a /new/ pc in -- gosh, maybe easily a decade. Yikes. But I've opened up a couple of Dells with the wires clamped down to the case in that way, and good gosh were they annoying. Couldn't get the cables out easily while plugged in, couldn't apply force effectively to unplug with the almost-nonexistant slack.

Not as bad as a rats' nest. (Probably.) But still irksome.
