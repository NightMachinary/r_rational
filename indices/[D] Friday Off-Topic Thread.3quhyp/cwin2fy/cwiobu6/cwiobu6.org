In the books? No. In the fandom and canon-by-fiat Pottermore stuff, sure probably, HPMOR does a good job of making Draco's beliefs feel organic and like something a real person would actually think.

Rowling's depiction of blood purism is more subtle that she usually gets credit for. There are hateful assholes like Lucius Malfoy, but also dumb bigots like Aunt Muriel who simply won't be seen with "those people." Constantly contrasted in the books are conformist upper-class conservatives or those who wish to be seen as such like the Dursleys, Malfoys, Muriel, the sort of person who reads the Daily Prophet for information and not entertainment, and so on vs fun, open, tolerant, free-spirited people like most of the Weasleys, Tonks, H'mione, etc. The former sort allow themselves to be manipulated by the likes of Malfoy and Voldemort because they are more concerned with their social standing and how others perceive them than truth and common sense.

I don't think there's any reason why British Wizarding bigotry should have much in common with American Muggle bigotry beyond the bigotry part. At any rate the books won't tell you that history because it would be long and boring. The stereotypes and hateful attitudes already existed, and Rowling's point, aside from Bigotry is Bad, is that people go along with these hateful views out of concern for how others view them. The Dursleys for example are more worried about their neighbors thinking they are weird than holy crap, magic exists, ahhh Voldemort, what luck potions are you for real that's just BS. The sort of people who gleefully read Rita Skeeter so they have someone to whisper knowingly about at the next dinner party. They're the real problem with the world, they and super magically powerful immortal Dark Lords.
