Do you prefer the shape of Australia or of Britain (the islands, not the countries)?

--------------

I think I prefer Australia's shape, myself. The rectangular outlines of its western coast, the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the "Top End" (in addition to the amazingly-triangular Cape York Peninsula) look particularly nice to me, while its other coasts are pleasingly smooth in their curves (with the rather glaring exceptions of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St. Vincent in the south...).

On the other hand, Britain looks far more irregular and haphazard. Elongated southwestern England and vaguely-rectangular Wales and northernmost Scotland are fairly interesting to look at, as is rounded East Anglia--but the zig-zag in southern Scotland, and the fragmented nature of Scotland's western coast ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Isles][Kingdom of the Isles]]" indeed!), definitely put me off.
