I feel like if you want to make a steel-manned version of bigotry, you need something more than just "Draco only believes this because his father believes it" or "Draco only believes this because it allows him to fit in".

As a non-American example, it would be easy to say that Hitler just hated Jews because that was the cool thing to be doing. But if you were talking to Hitler (or just reading /Mein Kampf/) that's not what you would get. Some of it is intentional agitation, some of it is rhetoric, but I think that when he talks about the process of becoming an anti-Semite he's being mostly truthful about what he felt -- and it was an /intellectual/ conversion rather than a /social/ one, however flawed that process was. It was about class war and communism, and the events of the first World War. If you just gut all that stuff out, you're getting further from actually understanding the bigotry (and from writing a convincing Hitler).

(I would expect British Wizarding bigotry to have quite a bit in common with real-world bigotry, if only for Doyalist reasons.)
