I'm hoping that someone with better Harry Potter knowledge can help me: what are some examples of historical racism by wizards?

I've been sort of idly writing a Hermione/Draco fic that's mostly about race relations. My problem is that the discussion of racism in the actual Harry Potter series is a little bit shallow; it's aping the real world but not including any of the complexity that causes all that surface stuff. As one example, here's how the Harry Potter series would do it:

#+begin_quote
  "Mudbloods are stupid."\\
  "No they're not, muggleborn have every bit as much magical talent. You're just saying that because you're hateful."
#+end_quote

And here's how I would do it:

#+begin_quote
  "Mudbloods perform much worse on their OWLs and NEWTs than purebloods and are therefore stupid."\\
  "Of course they underperform. Muggleborn are at a distinct academic disadvantage. The age restrictions are poorly enforced, which means that by the time a pureblood gets to Hogwarts they've already had a wide exposure to magic as its practiced, even if their parents haven't set out to teach them anything. Muggleborn enter Hogwarts having learned that magic exists only a month or so prior. Additionally, when muggleborn go home for the summer, they have no access to magic and no one to help them study or practice, which means that they experience more of an atrophy effect. It would be weird if their scores /weren't/ lower on average. However, once you correct for the home environment and wealth, ..."
#+end_quote

And so on.

In the real world, there's a whole lot to unpack; colonialism, slavery, Jim Crow laws, institutionalized racism, etc. I don't think that you get a good picture just by assuming that it's all a matter of what's happening in the moment. But I'm having trouble finding out whether the same is true of the wizarding world. Were there "bad old days" that echoed forward into the present? Does more casual racism exist outside of the Death Eater circles? The Death Eaters are basically the Klu Klux Klan mixed with the Nazis; is there a less fanatical version of that?
