I'm a fan of setup/question structure, myself. It allows for cleaner grammar and therefore easier reasoning. Maybe something like this:

There is a person named Bob who has [descriptive traits]. I suspect he is behind the construction of a secret mutant army and a simulacrum of the current king. There is a location X which has GPS coordinates. If Bob is dead, then X has the coordinates -1,-1. If Bob is alive, then X has the coordinates that I can reach in the minimum time that would, in the moment I reached them, put me within 2 meters of Bob. My divination question is: what are the coordinates of X?"

EDIT: typos.
