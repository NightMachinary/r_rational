A good case will have cable guiding holes that let you put most of the cabling tightly together at the edge of the case. This minimises the need for twist ties.

Though I personally don't really care much for cable management, in fact all my sata ones are loose so I can easily swap components ;p

Otherwise, it's not that hard. Make sure the pins on the cpu are straight, you have to use some force to seat it - more than you would think but don't try to hammer it in, it should go in with just constant pressure. Don't forget thermal paste. Everything eles is hard to fuck up.
