I strongly suspect that to make that setting non-munchkinable, you'd pretty much have to have some sort of godlike entity working behind the scenes to keep it from being munchkined. You could maybe pull it off if you have the entire setting be the product of an especially weird singularity gone wrong, but that's probably not the type of story you are looking for.

Alternatively, maybe it would work for either the capability to perform magic, or exposure to it, to have an impact on brain function that makes someone in a position to munchkin it most likely incapable of doing so?That might explain quite a bit about the setting, actually.
