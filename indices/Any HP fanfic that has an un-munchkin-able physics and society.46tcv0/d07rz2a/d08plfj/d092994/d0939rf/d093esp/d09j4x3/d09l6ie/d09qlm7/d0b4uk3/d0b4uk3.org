I forgot to write down this argument earlier, but Felix Felicis is strong but not necessarily OP. If it were as strong as some people think, then Harry would have wandered off campus and accidentally destroyed Voldemort and all his Horcruxes midway through book six.

I think it's interesting, although probably not very accurate, if we choose to interpret the apparent strength of Felix Felicis as the result of Harry being a biased narrator. Although he felt as though he were magically guided to persuade Slughorn in a foolproof way, perhaps he had the beginnings of a similar plan already in his mind, or benefited from a more conventional form of luck in addition to the benefits of the potion. If the feeling of omnipotence he experienced after consuming the potion was unjustified, then it's easier to see why the potion might be considered dangerous and not worth using by many.
