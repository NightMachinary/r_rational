True, but on the other hand, water is simple, grey goo is complex. Animals could be copying extant diagrams.

it's entirely possible the wizarding world is /less/ munchkinable than it looks, or at the very least some of the clever ideas, like the accio one eaglejarl proposed, wouldn't work, though certain items are straightforward game-breakers, or at least highly potent:

-Time turners (pretend they don't exist, if possible) -any food/water transfiguration, if it doesn't take nutrients from you. Gamp's law implies it gets them from somewhere, but it could well be consuming nearby rocks, granting general starvation immunity in most locales. -Feliz Felicitis, which is either common enough, or, more likely, slughorn has the money to not need to sell it, that it can be offered as a class prize. There being limitations still make sense, though- note horace only took it twice. Presumably, taking too much is harmful. Still OP, but it's hard to get your hands on and has drawbacks, so low-level, not high level, gamebreaker relative to its plausible costs. note that this didn't end the war, so it's clearly capped, and lower than you'd think. -Free energy spells. OFC, this is only large-scale broken.
