We don't know anything about how the Fidelius works. It might be extremely difficult to use, and might not work in public places. It's only used twice in canon, and is mentioned as an extremely rare and difficult piece of magic.

Dumbledore noticeably struggles to lift and shape a large ball of water. I don't think it's fair to assume that it would be trivial to transfigure grey goo or poisons. Your point about transfiguring robes is interesting. I think it would be a trivial patch to say that robes are enchanted to be spell resistant, however. Even if you didn't choose this option, allowing people to use transfigurations like that in combat does not seem horribly overpowered to me.

The AK stops when it comes into contact with stone, or walls. Remember when Harry hides behind gravestones in book 4?

The Philosopher's Stone was created only once ever. The Elder Wand is OP, but if you put it in the hands of the bad guys rather than the good guys then it causes your story few problems.

There are some ways in which canon could be exploited, but it's not as trivial as we're discussing here. In book six, Fudge says to the other minister that "the trouble is, the other side has magic too", which is something that people who are overeager to munchkin HP's magic system often forget.
