Your point about the economy is valid and very important. Remus Lupin struggles to find wearable clothes, and yet it seems like he could easily make his own if he had a spare afternoon. The Weasleys struggle to afford even crucial school supplies, even though it seems like those are very cheap and valuable investment that they presumably are prioritizing. That puts them at near subsistence farming income levels.

Maybe we can postulate that the economy is highly specialized and learning how to sew one's own robes, grow one's own food, etc. is beyond anyone's capability. Adding strict intellectual property laws or cultures of secrecy surrounding knowledge would also be helpful. Other frictions on proper market operation are the intense bigotry of their society, the Statute of Secrecy, and possibly the goblin control of currency. If using magic is extremely difficult, it makes more sense that poverty exists despite it. Even all of this seems inadequate to entirely explain away the story's economic problems, however.

So, in the sense that its economics are absurd, I agree that the HP universe is highly munchkinable. Good argument, thank you for it. I was missing your point earlier, and thinking mainly about combat.
