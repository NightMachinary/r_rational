What do you mean fidelius is low utility?

What if in the next goblin rebellion they fidelius gringotts? Hell, what if I fidelius gringotts? That's even assuming it only works on locations too lol.

So why doesn't Dumbledore transfigure grey goo or botulism or anything else? Why in combat doesn't he transfigure his opponents robes into metal or his own into Kevlar or unicorn hair? That's assuming you can't transfigure your opponents, say, hair, or bones, or heart...

Why doesn't any given maniac spam AK downward through the earth, or at Hogwarts or the ministry? Even in canon no shield blocks it.

Canon is messed up lol. Let's not even talk about the Philosopher's stone, or Hallows...
