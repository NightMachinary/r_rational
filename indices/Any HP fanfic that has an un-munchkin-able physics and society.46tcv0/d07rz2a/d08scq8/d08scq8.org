How do you feel about the /Effulgence/ treatment of D&D: a land where things /look/ broken, but where the world keeps going because some Alien God (i.e. "the DM") smites anyone who so much as looks at the power curve funny?

The equivalent would be, say, a really shoddily-coded website, put up on the public Internet, but with a perfect, magical Intrusion Detection System in front of it that triggers a satellite laser to blow up a hacker's house the moment they get in.
