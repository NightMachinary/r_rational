Even Voldemort relies mostly on social engineering tactics in My Immortal. He'd rather lead a group to impersonate celebrities and launch a surprise attack, or attempt to blackmail a student to smuggle a Muggle weapon into Hogwarts, than risk a direct magical assault. MI magic confirmed unmunchkinable.

MI canon personalities, on the other hand, confirmed infinitely exploitable.
