Uh... all he has to do to escape the time loop is become immortal and the philosopher's stone is literally right there.

Munchkined!

After a few near-immortal loops he will surely figure out how to make /everyone/ immortal, and they can all hang out until heat death.

Boom, immortal humanity forever, we even beat heat death. "Unmunchkinable", hmph.
