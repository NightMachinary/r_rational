You can /always/ munchkin. Even if one has concluded that one cannot fight and win against the malevolent entity depicted, there are still ways to improve one's lot.

You can try to "kill" yourself in a way that propagates back to the beginning of the loop. Alternatively if the malevolent entity forbids that, you can memory charm away the past so as to end the subjective torture. Dumbledore has already established that memory charming works and does not disturb the malevolent entity's goals.
