Free transfiguration takes Dumbledore skill levels and doesn't result in an automatic win. Unbreakable Vows are OP, I agree. The Fidelius seems limited utility. Conjuration seems limited utility. AK seems powerful but not so powerful that it needs to be changed. Unicorn blood is not worth the cost. Unbreakable Vows are the only important thing you've mentioned, in my opinion. Given their consequences, it's reasonable that almost no one would ever be willing to enter one. I think the fandom exaggerates the brokenness of canon often.
