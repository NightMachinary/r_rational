Can you be more specific about some of the ways to abuse the HP magic system? I think most munchkinish fics I've seen interpret the rules in ways that are biased toward munchkinry that could easily have been interpreted otherwise. Free energy is the main trivial path to victory in HP that I see.

Everyone in here is taking it for granted that canon HP is trivially munchkinable, without any discussion at all of specifics. This sends up alarms.
