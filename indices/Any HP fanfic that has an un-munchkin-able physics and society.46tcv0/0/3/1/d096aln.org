All spells taken from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spells_in_Harry_Potter][Wikipedia.]]

Aguamenti creates water, meaning that it creates hydroelectric power.

Accio] can summon (apparently) absolutely anything. How about writing down 'P=NP' and 'P != NP' on two sheets of paper and then saying "Accio piece of paper with true statement on it!"

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Felix_Felicis][Felix Felicitis]] gives you incredible luck. From the wiki: "Horace Slughorn claimed that he used the potion twice in his life: once when he was 24 years old, and again when he was 57, each resulting in a perfect day." Okay, how about running some very difficult scientific experiment while under the influence? Or brute-forcing a code -- the one password that you happen to guess will be the right one.

Avis creates living animals (birds). Infinite food.

Confringo: Causes explosions. Free energy.

I put this list together in about two minutes, and I only made it to 'C' in the spell list.

I explored all this in more detail in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11107471/1/Squiring-the-Phoenix][Squiring the Phoenix]] if you have interest.
