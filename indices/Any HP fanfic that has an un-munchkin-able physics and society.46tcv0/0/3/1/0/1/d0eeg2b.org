  Felix Felicis is strong, but doesn't seem story breaking to me. It is not an instant win, as otherwise Harry would have wandered off and killed Voldemort in year six.

It seems to have a fairly local effect: it's not going to drag Voldemort to you, but if Voldemort is already there, the day's not going to end well for him. So it's all a matter of giving yourself the maximum amount of leverage before you drink the potion.

  Also, it could hypothetically be used by both sides.

Sure, like most munchkinry.

A rational world where Felix Felicis exists should look something like what the /Mistborn/ series does with Atium. A huge part of the power game is to control production and distribution. And to find the right moments to use it, while tricking your enemies into wasting their reserves.
