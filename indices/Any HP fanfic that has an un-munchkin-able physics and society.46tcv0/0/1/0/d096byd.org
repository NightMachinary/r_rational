  How do you feel about the Effulgence treatment of D&D: a land where things look broken, but where the world keeps going because some Alien God (i.e. "the DM") smites anyone who so much as looks at the power curve funny?

I think that that is not Harry Potter, but is the only way you could keep something that looks like HP remotely in check. It's also the system I used in [[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Two Year Emperor]] because it's the only way I see to keep the D&D magic system anything like sane.
