You can treat spells as contracts with invisible spirits of nature and/or magic (something like Wildbow's Pact) Munchkining would be against the /spirit/ of the contract and as such punished punished by spirits, may be indirectly (bad luck, alliances forming against offender spontaneously, super lucky enemy etc). In fact HP story could be considers as such punishment for Tom Riddle attempt to munchkin horcruxes.
