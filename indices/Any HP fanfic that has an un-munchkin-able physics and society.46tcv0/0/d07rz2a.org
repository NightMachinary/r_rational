Harry Potter fanfic but not abusable? No, there isn't. The HP magic system is completely broken, and trying to fix it would require so many patches it would be not-HP before you were done.

The general answer to this question is also probably "it depends on your definition of abuse." When does it stop being sensible use and start being abuse?
