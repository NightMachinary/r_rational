I'm glad some people enjoyed it! Thanks for posting.

Here are some books I haven't read, but might fit the bill: (synopsis stolen from elsewhere)

*"Household Gods", by Harry Turtledove and some other author. An American woman sick of bumping against the glass ceiling dropped into Rome in 2nd century AD. Sounds very similar to me. Turtledove writes a lot of alternate history books.

*Zelazny's "Roadmarks". Protagonist is traveling down the Road of Time with a pickup truck full of automatic weapons to help the Greeks beat the Persians at Marathon. (apparently he has adventures along the Road). This doesn't sound quite the same, but Zelazny has a dry wit I think the folks here would like.
