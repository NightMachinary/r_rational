[[#s][Re: Ending Spoilers]] I suppose things sort of start going his way by the end of the book and he ends up a little sue-ish; that's fair. To give a brutally honest review: the story itself isn't a great page-turner - it's a decent concept with good execution at the start, with a mediocre end that ties up the loose ends and gives the story a satisfactory conclusion but not much else. It is the best "rational" take on modern-man-in-ancient-times I've seen, I'm quite glad I read it, and if that's what you're looking for, I think you (the prospective reader who visits [[/r/rational]]) will enjoy it too.
