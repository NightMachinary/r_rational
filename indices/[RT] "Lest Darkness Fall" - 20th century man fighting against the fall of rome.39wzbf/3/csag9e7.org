I just read through the whole book and I must say that while it shows lots of promise, stays interesting enough throughout and made me smile often enough it is pretty lacking in any kind of emotion or really human seeming interaction with the environment. To be honest I would say that after [[#s][]] it all reads a bit like less than awesome SI fanfiction of the "problem-fixing" kind.
