You mention that it is available for free. Do you just mean the scribd version? Because that makes for a pretty bad reading experience, what with all the clutter everywhere. I also neither have a kindle nor do I prefer print (or the shipping cost larger than the actual price that would be attached to it) so if you found a plain PDF version that'd be great.

Edit: Never mind. Found a way to remove anything that was bothering me.
