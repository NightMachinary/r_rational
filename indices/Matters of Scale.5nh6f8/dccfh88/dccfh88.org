In regards to the Uchiha, there's a simple explanation for how their role in the village would work even if they're smaller in numbers: S-rank ninja are a BIG DEAL. A village's ability to produce S-rank ninja is the most important factor in their ability to be successful in war/conflict against other villages. One S-rank ninja is enough to change the course of a war, and 10 are enough to fight against the entire world by themselves for a while. But to be an S-rank ninja, you either need to have a bloodline (or similar inherent advantage) that can be advanced to an S-rank level of power, or you need to be a genius that is able to innovate your way to S-rank. The latter variety is not reliable, and the former is difficult because bloodlines are rare, and some of them aren't even powerful enough to be S-rank on their own even at their peak. The Sharingan bloodline reliably produces about 1-2 ninja with S-rank potential every generation, which is an amazing asset.

With this in mind, there are some simple reasons to explain the coup situation. First of all, it's possible that the Uchiha didn't originally intend for the situation to become outright violent - they thought that they would have enough clout to get their way just by threatening to leave, or recalling their ninja from active duty or something. Then Danzo/Tobi/etc stirred the pot and took the situation beyond the point of no return.

It's also possible that the Uchiha were under the impression that they would have backing from some additional force, such as another village. This might have been real, or a ploy cooked up by Tobi.

Finally, it's also possible that their plan was to assassinate the Hokage (presumably with Itachi's help, which Fugaku would have assumed he would have), and assume control using genjutsu: either to force the Konoha council to "legally" appoint an Uchiha successor, or to have someone impersonate the Hokage and have that person choose an Uchiha successor. In that scenario, total force doesn't really matter, as long as they can pull off the assassination and transfer of power without getting caught.
