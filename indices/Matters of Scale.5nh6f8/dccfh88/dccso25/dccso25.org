That is a very intriguing angle. I hadn't considered it from that perspective; the Uchiha are awesome because of the reliability of obscene power houses.

I'm not sure how likely it is about a bloodless (or mostly so) coup though. The Uchiha are often framed as kind of power mad and megalomaniacal; I would be more likely to /assume/ their plan was more subtle, but it wouldn't /surprise/ me to find out they thought they could get away with just openly declaring themselves the rulers of the village.

On a side note: We only see a little bit of Uchiha Fugaku in the manga, but he comes off as being a very level headed sort of guy. I can see him being very unhappy with the current state of affairs, but not enough to push for something as insane as a coup. Which suggests the Elders of the clan had a lot of sway on clan policy, even though it is never suggested that they could interfere in the line of succession.
