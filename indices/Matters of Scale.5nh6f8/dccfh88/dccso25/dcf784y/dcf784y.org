  In the manga, Tobi stated Fugaku organised and planned the coup d'Ã©tat. In the anime, however, it was stated that he did not plan it, but as the representative of the whole Uchiha Clan, he had no choice but to go along with their decision. However, he opted for an option that would satisfy the Uchiha Clan and lead to the least bloodshed. To this end, he asked Itachi to help him take over the seat of Hokage by force.

The Uchiha are popularly considered so violent likely because they were directly opposed to the Senju prior to the founding of Konoha, Madara eventually came to disagree with the First Hokage, and obviously, Itachi's "senseless massacre." There's not much actual evidence that the clan as a whole was actually any more power hungry or bloodthirsty than average. Plus, their politics were directly being manipulated by Madara/Obito/Zetsu.
