Yea, ninjas are great at peak power, but not long distance speedsters. They likely are traveling no faster then non-ninja sprinting, because they need to be paying attention to where they are going, and don't have smooth even modern roads to run on. Usain Bolt peaks at 44 kph, so I'd estimate 30 to 40 kph for a normal traveling ninja.
