Expanding on the exam, we have a few pieces of information that tells us how quickly ninjas are created and how fast they are supposed to rank up into chunin. The public tournament was scheduled to have eight or nine fights (depending on if the expected Ino/Sakura to fight), with nine or ten participants. Considering that prior to this, each examinee had to pass with their three-man team intact, it was likely meant to be three teams, or nine total participants.

Anko states that her stage has, at a minimum, a 50% fail rate, with an observed rate of 75% (of the 26 teams that passed stage one, seven passed stage two), with an expected rate of 90% (since she was expecting the number of ninja to pass her stage to be in the single digits, or three or less teams). Since Anko was surprised that 26 teams made it through the first stage, 3 passing teams and the 30 teams to start stage two that a 90% attrition rate would imply is too many. Anko was likely expecting 2 teams to pass stage two, and therefore 20 teams to pass stage one, for an expected attrition rate of 60% in stage one. 95% of the teams entered into the exam were not expected to reach the finals.

Together with the information about Kabuto has failed the test 7 times, which is surprising to Hiruzen, and that the tests are biannual according to Kabuto and this is his fourth year taking the exams, we can say that the majority of genin take the chunin exam somewhere less than that many times. Additionally, while the rookie teams being nominated is surprising, Guy's team is not surprising while being only a year older. So, most of the 51 teams have been genin for somewhere between one to five years.

While other villages may have sent limited numbers of team, it's likely that all the Konoha genin teams that thought they had a chance to become chunin participate. The breakdown of the 51 teams was 19 teams from Konoha, 10 from Suna, 7 from Ame, 2 each from Kusa and Taki, and a single team from Oto. 19 teams across 5 years is approximately 3 new teams a year. Additionally, Konoha is less than 100 years old, so even if we double the number of teams produced because of the losses incurred by the Kyubi's Rampage and the Uchiha Massacre, that's an upper bound of 900 ninjas ever produced by Konoha.

However, if we look at Kakashi's bell test and Kakashi's statement that only 9 of the 27 graduates become genin, with the rest sent back to the academy, there are some 16 people every year who have almost genin level skills and a ninja registration number. That's some 1600 people over the Konoha's history that have enough training to do very basic ninja work, but are not considered even low level ninjas.

Personally, I expect genin-chunin-jonin to be roughly equivalent to apprentice-journeyman-master, and that most ninjas are expected to reach chunin, with some percent (probably a third or less) becoming jonin, with something like 1 out of every 30 students eventually going on to become jonin.
