Many rationalizing fics just assume Naruto media are unreliable narrators. For example Root operatives did most of killing while ANBU held perimeter. Inconsistent technology development require reworking anyway, and comparing to that any warping of numbers is insignificant. If author reinterpret radio headsets into magical devices (fuinjutsu etc) all economy can be remade into magic based as well, and that makes any numerical estimates completely arbitrary.
