The Allied Shinobi force is the biggest inconsistency in Naruto. Ignore that and take the personal power of S-rank seriously and you get a kind of logarithmic scale.

Village has:

2-5 Kage/S-class: beginning of series Konoha has the 3rd Hokage, Jiraiya, and on the weaker end at the beginning of the series Kakashi and Gai. plus Tsunade though it's questionable if she's considered part of the village. Danzo is S-rank but really only with his magic Izanagi arm and he's covert so it's questionable.

15-30 A-rank which are Jounin or Tobeketsu Jounin: Asuma, Kurenai, Tenzo, Gemma, Fugaku, Inoichi, Shikaku, Chouza, Anko, Torune, Fu, some of the better ANBU.

~60-150 Chuunin

~500-750 Genin

This produces near 1000 ninja per village, which seems more sensible to me. Ninja villages are basically military bases + family + support staff (always way bigger than actual combatants) though using military metaphors doesn't work well...Naruto!Villages aren't really military at all.

This also makes class sizes and Chuunin Exams make a bit more sense, and makes ninja have huge differences in personal power, which in turn makes the nonmilitary and informal nature of the village make sense since ninja aren't (mostly) interchangeable like soldiers in RL are.
