Honestly Land of Fire as big as USA seems too much. It is just too big for a medieval fighting wizards setting. I would reduce the running pace (they are genin after all) to 30 km/h. Also I would suggest to nerf S ranks a lot. Worldbuilding you are goign to do would matter a lot less if everything is decided with power balance between 20 individuals.
