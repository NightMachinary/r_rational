Yes, that is how squaring numbers works. But honestly none of /that/ is really the issue.

Are there lots of ninja? If yes, how do things stay the way they are? Who pays them? What rank spread are they? What clans do they come from?

Are there not many ninja? If yes, why aren't there more? Why does it seem like there should be more? How do the villages remain financially solvent? What rank spread are they?

There is a lot of evidence to support either conclusion. Like the Chunin exam, which is apparently /designed/ to promote a maximum of 10 or so Genin at a time.
