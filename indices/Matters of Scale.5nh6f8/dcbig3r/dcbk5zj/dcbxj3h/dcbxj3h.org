From what I remember of the Manga, the ninja population was tiny. As in, maybe 50 members per clan with perhaps a few hundred per ninja village. Even the largest fight I remember might have had less than a thousand ninja all together.

As for your other questions, they pretty much fall apart in the story. There is no focus on it, what with being a simple shonen. Speculation leads me to say: Things stay the way they are because the ninja mostly occupy themselves with each other and are largely independent from the mundane population, while at the same time not wanting to directly rule them (excepting Nagato or what he was called). Rank spread is pretty unknown, but most adult professional ninja seem to be of the Jonin rank, so that seems to be where they end up. What do you mean which clans do they come from? There are not many ninjas because a) It is mostly family business. b) It takes a lot of resources to train someone. c) Not everyone has the talent for it. d) Ninjas roughly kill each others as fast as they grow. It doesn't seem like there should be more to me. They remain solvent because they have learned to exchange services for goods. Their services are very valuabe (even small teams are capable of changing the fate of nations). Again, professional adults seem to be around Jonin rank, which seems to encompass quite a spectrum of capabilities.

The exam is one of the few pieces of hard evidence you actually have and you seem to pretty much throw it out of the window. I think field promotions are a thing, but other than that the exam should give a good picture about how many ninjas there are.

Anyway. The source is not very detailed and any details it gives do not have to make sense. Keep in mind that the author created information cards on the characters one time and pretty much everyone was dangerously underweight. The only one not underweight was Chouji or something like that.
