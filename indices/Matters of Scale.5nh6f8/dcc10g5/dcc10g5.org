A good rule of thumb is that whenever a story throws out a number that's way too big, you should just assume they misspoke and it's actually something more reasonable.

ex: "I went into a dimension where time slowed down and trained for the equivalent of 10,000 years so I could beat this villain." No. No you did not, you would forget or dull the vast majority of your memories, your personality would have changed completely as your mental age increases over that vast time period, and you would likely go insane from isolation and boredom. You trained for 1 year at most.
