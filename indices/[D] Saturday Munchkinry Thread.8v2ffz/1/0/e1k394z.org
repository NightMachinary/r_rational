You can superheat blocks of metal - since they're conducting, a modest potential difference creates an enormous flow of electrons. Wikipedia says a 1 cm^{3} block of silver has a resistance of a microohm, which gives you a megawatt of power dissipated. This keeps going up until your conductor melts.

EDIT: For a current of one amp, the principle is the same, except you should now use it on an insulator, which gives you an enormous potential difference and therefore an enormous power dissipation. I think this keeps going until your insulator's electrons dissociate, at which point you get a conducting plasma. This happens at about 10,000 K.
