Checkpoints aren't shared. The world resets at your checkpoint when you die, and at the antagonist's checkpoint when he dies, should that ever happen.

  Why would immortality prevent your reset?
#+end_quote

Because you can't die (and don't /want/ to dieâ”€that's part of the value drift inherent to immortality), and it only triggers on death.

  If you can save/restore another's mind state, teaching a divinity to a subordinate preserves your values.
#+end_quote

You can save/restore minds with strong enough mind magic, but that's extremely rare. The subordinate only preserves your values if they end up fixing your mind, but for that scenario to happen you need to have a divine mind mage subordinate to you but able to use their magic on you against your will. That sounds difficult.

E: I think I misread. Are you saying you would teach the divinity to the subordinate, and copy that mind of theirs from one loop to another? Then you can exploit their abilities without suffering the drawbacks yourself. That does make sense.

  The antagonist might still value that which one can have a lackey sacrifice without rendering him uncontainable.

  Rhetoric divinity appears to win one's future maxspeed cone. Assuming he hasn't won, even he must shy away from the corresponding sacrifice.

I'm struggling to parse these sentences, sorry.
