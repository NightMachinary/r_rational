  However, on such time scales, virtually everything that could theoretically harm you should be considered a threat --- the antagonist isn't /special/, from this perspective
#+end_quote

It kind'a feels special; I would think it risky to spend a couple of days around this guy, never mind megayears. Very few things have comparable impact.

#+begin_quote
  Oh my. That... wait, that actually makes it way easier. Mindrape one of his instances, upload yourself into him, loop him, download yourself into the past. Find an older instance, mindrape him, upload yourself, loop him, download yourself. Repeat until the oldest instance is enslaved.
#+end_quote

Do you realize that after the first assault he would catch on? Somehow I don't expect he'd go "oh no, my newly created clone standing right next to me has been mindraped, maybe I should talk to it."

#+begin_quote
  Hell, you could try to figure out what his oldest instance is, and focus all your manipulation efforts on him from the beginning. It's so comparatively easy I feel like I missed something.
#+end_quote

And how do you expect to convince this oldest instance that you are seeking him out for purely altruistic purposes? I'm not even convinced you can minimax this with the merely same level of risk as minimaxing in person, which is saying something.

  1. Preparation. Make sure you're actually able to successfully act against the antagonist.

  2. Information-gathering. Figure out the enemy's powers and personality.

  3. Learn how to manipulate the antagonist. Then do so.

  4. Find a way to use the antagonist's loop to send yourself into the past.

  5. Repeat 3-4 until you've dealt with all of his instances.
#+end_quote

Being able to summarise a complicated under-specified plan in "only" five bullet points by eliding almost all of the details does not really strike me of evidence of simplicity.

#+begin_quote
  Find one of the antagonist's instances, assault him mentally. With a time loop to save-scum and your mind mages for help, you should win.
#+end_quote

This doesn't work; much like you can't exceed the speed of light by shining a torch from a moving train, you can't beat a divine with just a numerical advantage.
