  I would think it risky to spend a couple of days around this guy, never mind megayears

Because the antagonist's modus operandi is to... make everyone who annoys him immortal?^{1} Once you're a divine mind mage, that is the only danger the antagonist presents^{2} --- and even then only if you let it slip that you're in a time loop, /and/ don't realize it immediately, /and/ the antagonist decides you're a threat to him. I could certainly see him killing you on a whim a number of times, but him granting you immortality despite your efforts in avoiding exactly this strikes me as unlikely enough.

Your own value-drift over megayears of life is likely a bigger threat.

  Do you realize that after the first assault he would catch on?

How? Have the mindraped clone play his part for a time, then separate from his creator and consult you for further instructions. There's no need to make his older instance aware that anything strange has happened.

That said... I imagined further loops would be easier, since you would begin them with one instance of the antagonist already enslaved. He would be as powerful as any of his other instances, /and/ have a multi-divine mage in your form for help --- I thought it would be sufficient to ensure your victory in any given engagement. If that's not true... Well, it's still not impossibly hard.

  And how do you expect to convince this oldest instance that you are seeking him out for purely altruistic purposes?
#+end_quote

Whyever would you make him aware that you're seeking him? Have a proxy approach a random instance, become his known acquaintance. At some point, casually inquire about the antagonist's self-replication abilities, try to steer the conversation towards his "personal" age and his closest "fork". Maybe phrase it as a philosophical discussion about continuity of consciousness, or whatever is context-appropriate.

It does heavily depend on the antagonist's personality and the context of his interactions with the protagonist, I'll admit. How did they meet? How frequently does the antagonist interact with other humans? What form do these interaction take?

  Being able to summarise a complicated under-specified plan in "only" five bullet points by elliding almost all of the details does not really strike me of evidence of simplicity.
#+end_quote

What would you consider a sufficiently simple plan? I don't think mine has that many moving parts.

Becoming divine in mind magic is possible. Having an enslaved person save and restore your mind is possible. Spending extraordinary amounts of time near the antagonist is less risky in these circumstances, since the correct method of derailing your plans is pretty counter-intuitive; it could be ameliorated even further by usage of proxies. Most of all, time loops are nearly /peerless/ among information-gathering tools.

The only real problem lies in attempting to manipulate one of his instances into slavery, but it's not /that/ hard given all the advantages you would have: a time loop, borderline-inhuman deception/manipulation abilities backed up by divine mind magic insights, and extensive knowledge of the antagonist's personality and behavioural patterns.

The /core/ of the plan is to become the antagonist's friend, backstab him the moment he lets down his guard, then hijack his time loops to get rid of his clones. All complexity arises from the need to circumvent his various abilities. Is that still too complicated?

^{1. Despite the way I phrased it, it /is/ a honest question. Is the antagonist's behaviour particularly unstable/unhinged?}

^{2. As far as I know in the context of this exercise, anyway.}
