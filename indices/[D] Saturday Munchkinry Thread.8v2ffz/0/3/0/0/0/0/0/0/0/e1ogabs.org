  What would you consider a sufficiently simple plan? I don't think mine has that many moving parts.
#+end_quote

Without spoiling anything, mine goes roughly: you show up, he goes "oh shit", you try to avoid getting taken by surprise from his desperate attempts to get out of this mess.

It's still more complicated than I'd like, but it's a start.

  Because the antagonist's modus operandi is to... make everyone who annoys him immortal?^{1} Once you're a divine mind mage, that is the only danger the antagonist presents^{2} --- and even then only if you let it slip that you're in a time loop, /and/ don't realize it immediately, /and/ the antagonist decides you're a threat to him.
#+end_quote

That was a joke he made when he was laughing at your feeble attempts to threaten him. By no means is it his only option here. Let me turn this one around on you: what would /you/ do if you were the adversary and suspected the shockingly-convincing mind mage was a looper?

(Background info for probability estimates: there are more loopers than there are divine mind mages.)

  How? Have the mindraped clone play his part for a time, then separate from his creator and consult you for further instructions. There's no need to make his older instance aware that anything strange has happened.
#+end_quote

He loops back to the instant he was created, and has no a priori reason to prevent himself from being mind read by his creator at that time. That in itself confers a high probability of instant disqualification.

Relying on convincingly acting out your own actions from hundreds of years ago, not being observed when you go off-script and repeating the whole convoluted plan is another large risk on top.

  It does heavily depend on the antagonist's personality and the context of his interactions with the protagonist, I'll admit. How did they meet? How frequently does the antagonist interact with other humans? What form do these interaction take?
#+end_quote

The antagonist is largely uninvolved in society, though does a few things with high impact to them. Most of the instances are out of physical reach unless you're a shapeshifter or fire elemental. Only a handful of people know he isn't actually the creator of all existence.
