As you gave it, it was conditional on being wrong about him not looping with you, which is a long odds bet. If you merely mean it in the sense of threatening to end the universe altogether, that's unlikely to work since the reset is transparent to you: effectively you end up living in a frozen universe looping the same fraction of a second until some future point where your checkpoint is disabled. Unless you can guarantee that you'll never disable your checkpoint in an arbitrarily long timeframe of boredom, /and/ convey this scheme in such a way as to blackmail him without allowing him to counteract it, /and/ are willing to risk the negative-infinite utility of having to actually go through with it if you fail to convince him... then it's probably not going to work.
