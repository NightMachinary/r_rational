Oh. You can disable your time loop. I thought that once you brought your time loop starting point to right before your death, you were screwed forever and unable to escape the loop either. Is there any way to disable your ability to disable your time loop then? Because it would be hard to convince the old mage that you wouldn't break mid-loop, but much easier to convince the old mage that you're crazed/emotional/irrational enough to trigger an inescapable loop that effectively ends the universe.

Now you probably wouldn't be able to say blackmail him over little things like demanding money/power or you end the universe. But it does grant you leverage in some ways. By informing the old mage of this threat, you let him know that if he pushes you too far or tries to erase you, you /will/ trigger the inescapable loop in a fit of rage/spite, damn the consequences.
