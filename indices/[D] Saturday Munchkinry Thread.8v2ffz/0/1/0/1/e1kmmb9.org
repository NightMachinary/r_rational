Timelooping working that way seems very poorly thought out. That's literally the most powerful magic possible. It instantly and overwhelmingly overwrites everything everywhere. At that point, why bother with other magic? The only important magic is figuring out how your time loop does that, and how you can adjust it to say, reset only /part/ of the world.

I assume that there are magic attacks and defenses, except it sounds like this super special time loop power effortlessly cuts through all of them.

IMO, change the base mechanic that time loops work on rather than actually physically altering the world: Precognition, quantum immortality, alternate dimensions, etc..
