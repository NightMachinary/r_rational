How exactly does your time loop work? Does it really kill everybody else? Including the old mage? If so, doesn't triggering your time loop already kill him and replace him with another version of himself? That's a pretty effective threat right there.

You just need to keep yourself on the verge of death 24/7, so you can commit suicide faster than the old mage, meaning he can't trigger his time loop to erase you before you erase him.

Alternatively, if it turns out that your belief is wrong and that the old mage actually loops with you whenever you restart, the above strategy still works. That's because you can threaten mutually assured destruction by bringing your time loop starting point to just before the moment of your death, effectively creating an infinitesimally short time loop that the old mage can never escape from since there's no time for him to kill himself to escape via his own time loop. So you'll both eventually go insane from the never ending unchanging repetition.
