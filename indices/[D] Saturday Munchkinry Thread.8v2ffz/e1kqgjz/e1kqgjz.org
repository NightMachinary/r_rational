You secrete a substance that can allow you to animate, control, see, and hear through objects coated by it. "Animate" allows objects to move within their normal range of flexibility and then some. For example: if you animate a marble, it can roll at walking speed; if you animate a stick, it can bend slightly to crawl like a caterpillar; if you animate a suit of armor, it can get up and walk and fight clumsily. Your control is roughly equivalent to Skitter's control of bugs in Worm; that is, pretty much absolute. It also grants the appropriate level of multitasking ability - you can act simultaneously from as many controlled objects as you like. Your secretion is permanent.

Limitations: Simple soap and water can remove your control-substance from almost anything. Control and flexibility weaken the larger the ratio of mass-to-secretion; a drop of secretion can only viably control about 100 grams of object. You get more fine control with more secretion, but diminishing returns apply. The best control you can expect is to be able to move e.g. a mostly-coated suit of armor as if you were wearing it. You cannot control living things (but you can control their clothing). If a non-coated piece is cut away from a coated object, you lose control of the non-coated part. Stiff objects move slowly, if at all; supple objects like cloth have plenty of motion but are relatively weak. Small objects also move slowly.

Circumstances: For further "creative narrowing," munchkin within these constraints. Assume no technology higher than medieval (no gunpowder). You are trying to defend a castle against humanoid invaders. You have years of prep time if you need it - long enough to coat just about everything needed, but not enough to generate pools of the secretion (not that you'd want to). Your attackers know your power, but haven't seen you use it. The spying applications of this power are trivial to abuse; I am interested in the combat applications.

Full disclosure: am GM in a homebrew Pathfinder campaign, looking for ideas I haven't already come up with for screwing with players. They're high level, they can take it. I have tweaked the circumstances somewhat.
