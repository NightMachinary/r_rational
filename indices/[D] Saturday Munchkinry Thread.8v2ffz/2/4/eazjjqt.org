Make a stick figure out of rope and coat it with goop. Wrap each piece of rope with cloth that has been covered with more goop. Repeat this a number of times until you have something the size and shape of a grown human, with each layer gooped. Put this inside a suit of armour that has been gooped inside and out. You should now have an armoured golem with more strength, weight and durability than a gooped empty suit of armour.

Golem-spiders spread around would act as spies.

Coating arrows in goop would let archers fire volleys of guided missiles, ensuring that all arrows are concentrated where they can deal the most damage.

Coating a ship with goop would essentially let you sail it by itself, and wooden planks connected by strips of leather would serve as crude oars (though not as strong as regular rowers). Obviously you would need to stick several layers of materials together with goop and then lacquer the outside wherever possible.

A wooden skeleton wrapped in leather and sealed airtight with a number of metal legs would be heavy enough to sink, and with enough legs you could walk it across the bottom of the ocean, maybe transport troops for a surprise attack across a river or bay. The challenge would be opening/closing without flooding (probably from underneath) and not running out of air.
