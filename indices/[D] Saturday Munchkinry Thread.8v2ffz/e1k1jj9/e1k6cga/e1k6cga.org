Well, the first thing you need to do is figure out how exactly you are "creating" an electric current. Are you spawning electrons out of thin air? Or are you pushing electrons around? If it is the former, what happens if you try to spawn electrons inside other matter? If it is the latter, what happens if you try to create electric currents where there are no electrons? Do you start pushing protons instead? Can you push protons out of atoms? All these questions have potentially fun nuclear consequences.
