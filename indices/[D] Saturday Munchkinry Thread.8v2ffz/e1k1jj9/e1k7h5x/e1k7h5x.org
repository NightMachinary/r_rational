Can I take a transformer and change the voltage? And power my cell phone with it?

Where does the energy come from? I assume limited energy but more energy than should be possible.

Is it possible to built a power suit that is powered with my power? I would get a huge advantage, cause I didn't need a battery.

Maybe built a coil gun.

Okay, away from superhero cliche. I could get an electric car. Or plane. And save on fuel costs.

Well if I could use 2 volt by creating two currents via line of sight and touch, I could create Hydrogen gas from water.

Well that all depends on circumventing the 1 volt limit. I fear I don't know if 1 volt could be felt. If it can, I use it to pretend to be a prophet, except super powers should be known. Or if super powers are known, act like I have another power, like telling the truth and people tested by me feel it. And mess with heads of states.

Well if I can go really ridiculous I could try to mess with the body chemistry. And with studying and many experiments kill people with a look, hours or weeks after meeting. Or change data on a computer... How much voltage does a computer need to change zeroes and ones... googled 3.3 Volt as the lowest number, so nope...

Well, I guess I would ignore my power and try to take over the world the old fashioned way. Becoming a populist and tell people what they want to hear. Train my own brainwashed elite soldiers, and take over one country with voting (not necessarily legal or fair votes). Make me ruler for life, attack other countries under false pretense (Maybe dispose of other dictators). Let my countries spies fight an underground war and spread propaganda abound me and tell them bad stuff (not always lies) about their leaders. And promise better conditions under my rule.

Maybe start some unions (EU, NATO, UN) and take that over.

My power would help only in some minor ways, like pretending to be a prophet or able to tell lies.

EDIT: Of course I would try to get other people with minor super powers on my site, or get rid of them without pissing them off.
