  If mind magic doesn't allow decoy minds, can you use ~biology divinity to implant yourself a fake brain, and ~space divinity to fold your actual brain into a pocket dimension, or something?
#+end_quote

There's no space divinity because there's no relativity, but the idea is interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Well, the premise is quite risky to begin with. Be very, very careful, and hair-trigger suicidal?
#+end_quote

I would buy this over short durations, but when you're throwing numbers like googol around I just don't think it's plausible. (Your Will-bought luck would help if he didn't have that too.)

#+begin_quote
  Or communicate with the antagonist only through proxies/mind-clones who honestly believe they're whatever role you're playing this loop.
#+end_quote

This is possible.

#+begin_quote
  The antagonist is singular at the start of his loop (no clones), or at least murderably-plural.
#+end_quote

You suspect that his instances all have independent loops. Each clone would get their loop set to the point they were made. You're probably not talking to the original, so you probably don't have access to the original loop.

#+begin_quote
  All instances of the antagonist could be messaged to.
#+end_quote

He very likely has some kind of sensory divinity, so all of his instances can observe all of the others should they be paying attention.

#+begin_quote
  After he loops, he will rewrite the mind of the person closest to him with your mind.
#+end_quote

Minor issue: Assume he copies your mind, and kills himself a minute later. The "real" you half a minute after he has copied the past you is no longer copied, so would die when he loops. You end up being your own adversary!

I don't think your plan survives these clarifications.

--------------

I didn't think it would be relevant, but some context is important here. The antagonist originally wasn't going to fill the "final boss" role; he played his part in the story but for a while I didn't expect there was a clean way to force his hand on anything important. And this holds here too: not contesting him is a reasonable, if suboptimal, alternative. If your best plan involves burning down the earth, getting yourself time-erased, or spending a googol years hoping your reflexes are fast enough that you don't once trip up, maybe it's a game more risky than it's worth.

Stepping back to the meta-level, generally the reason I'm not hot on your plan is that you have a lot of conjunctions. Eliezer's post [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Yq6aA4M3JKWaQepPJ/burdensome-details][Burdensome Details]] expresses my feelings here quite well. If you can simplify things to something a little more likely to survive contact with the enemy, it'd be much more likely to work.
