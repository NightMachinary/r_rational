  I would buy this over short durations, but when you're throwing numbers like googol around I just don't think it's plausible
#+end_quote

A valid point. However, on such time scales, virtually everything that could theoretically harm you should be considered a threat --- the antagonist isn't /special/, from this perspective, you'd need to figure out how to protect yourself against black swans anyway. I think there are some ways to do it, but I'm not sure.

  You suspect that his instances all have independent loops
#+end_quote

Oh my. That... wait, that actually makes it way easier. Mindrape one of his instances, upload yourself into him, loop him, download yourself into the past. Find an older instance, mindrape him, upload yourself, loop him, download yourself. Repeat until the oldest instance is enslaved.

No need for the complicated self-destruction gambit^{1}.

Hell, you could try to figure out what his oldest instance is, and focus all your manipulation efforts on him from the beginning. It's so comparatively easy I feel like I missed something.

  The "real" you half a minute after he has copied the past you is no longer copied, so would die when he loops
#+end_quote

Meh. I'm inclined to agree with the antagonist here: as long as one instance survives, it could be assumed that my self survived as well. Unless this setting contains a more explicit seat of consciousness?

I suppose you could try to make a destructive upload, i. e., have slave!antagonist gradually erase your mind in the process of copying it --- this should ensure the doomed you doesn't develop any independent memories. Or do it while asleep, or in a (magical/) coma...

Well, I simplified in the light of the new information. I don't think it's that complicated at its core? It basically consist of the following steps:

1. Preparation. Make sure you're actually /able/ to successfully act against the antagonist.

2. Information-gathering. Figure out the enemy's powers and personality.

3. Learn how to manipulate the antagonist. Then do so.

4. Find a way to use the antagonist's loop to send yourself into the past.

5. Repeat 3-4 until you've dealt with all of his instances.

Given the flexibility of the abilities (time travel, mind magic, clones) and the power levels involved, I think it's simple enough.

*Edit:*

I could try to make it even simpler, though riskier in some ways:

- Become a divine mind mage. Help several loyal people ascend to divine mind magic as well, and preserve them from loop to loop as per [[/u/Gurkenglas][u/Gurkenglas]]' suggestion.

- Find one of the antagonist's instances, assault him mentally. With a time loop to save-scum and your mind mages for help, you should win. Enslave him.

- Proceed with the iterative looping gambit.
