  (From a totally Doyolist perspective, how would such a scene even be written? :P)
#+end_quote

I don't know, in a way such that it evokes a feeling of hollowness? It would be a story about someone who spent geological eras learning, studying, and manipulating, and the pinnacle of his achievements is mindraping a man into a vegetable. It seems sad.

#+begin_quote
  it does seem more a job for a superintelligence
#+end_quote

I think quantitative superintelligence would be more than sufficient --- as in, something that could methodically perform an inhuman amount of complex calculations over time. You'd need, as I said, infinite patience, and perhaps perfect (or at least very good) memory, both of which could be solved to an extent by either mind magic or mundane exercises. Time loop covers the rest.

#+begin_quote
  spending a thousands of centuries around someone who can maybe forcibly make you immortal is a lot of risk, especially as being unreadable makes you much more of a perceived risk than when you were a transparent book
#+end_quote

Well, the premise is quite risky to begin with. Be very, very careful, and hair-trigger suicidal?

Regarding readability, is it at all possible to fake it? If mind magic doesn't allow decoy minds, can you use ~biology divinity to implant yourself a fake brain, and ~space divinity to fold your actual brain into a pocket dimension, or something? Or communicate with the antagonist only through proxies/mind-clones who honestly believe they're whatever role you're playing this loop.

#+begin_quote
  What if there are clones of him?
#+end_quote

Well, then instead of erasing the mind of your enslaved instance of him, have him loop--- Ah, damn. It wouldn't work unless all of his instances are dead, would it?

Okay. I considered doing something like this at the end of my initial idea, but decided it was superfluous. Apparently not.

Enslave an instance of the antagonist as per above. If there's a "hierarchy" of instances, try to get one as high up the chain as possible.

With his help, engineer circumstances best solvable by time travel. Burn the whole planet down, fake an invasion of cosmic horrors, create grey goo, crash the simulation, pretend to be a /more/ powerful god with 30+ divinities but no Will divinity, whatever. Target and destroy something the antagonist cares about, or present an insurmountable threat that could be easily solved with a century's forewarning.

Upload your mind into slave!antagonist's mind. Depending on how the Will timeloop works, either rewrite his mind with yours entirely, or add a "memory packet" with a snapshot of your mind (as high-fidelity as possible).

Use slave!antagonist to send messages to his other instances, informing them about the threat/disaster, and strongly advising them to kill themselves. Wait an undefined amount of time, until you're pretty sure all of them received the message and killed themselves. Order slave!antagonist to kill himself. After he loops, he will rewrite the mind of the person closest to him with your mind. Now you're at the dawn of time, where life was (presumably) simpler.

Assumptions:

- There are circumstances in which the antagonist would consider using his time-loop a rational course of actions.

- The antagonist is singular at the start of his loop (no clones), or at least murderably-plural.

- Time loops for the instance of the antagonist that dies last; the rest get erased.

- All instances of the antagonist could be messaged to.

At which point this would fail?
