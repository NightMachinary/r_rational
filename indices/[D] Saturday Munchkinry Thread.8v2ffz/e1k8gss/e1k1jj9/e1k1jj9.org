In a world of minor super powers, you can create an electric current that is always 1 volt, directed away from you. You need either A. Line of sight B. Direct physical contact or C. An in depth understanding of where everything is situated in order to direct your power. The current is limited to a maximum of an 8 foot radius, centered on whichever body part is creating the current. How do you take over the world?

*edit*: Oops, the power was supposed to be creating a current of 1 Amp, not volts. I had the units switched in my head.
