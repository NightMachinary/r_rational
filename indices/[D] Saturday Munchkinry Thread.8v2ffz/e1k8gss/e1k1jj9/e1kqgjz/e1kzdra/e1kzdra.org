Coating trebuchets and Catapults to out siege the siegers

Golems wielding un-secreted swords, or simply replacing the armored gauntlets with blades.

Depending on how complex you can build, some wheeled/spiked "car" to either transport the golems or act as a highly mobile "tank", that is, it just tries to steamroll/roadkill invaders. That also works for inside the castle too, like a piston on wheels version of the indiana jones stone ball.

Inside the castle, cloth whips could make a good impression of those half life [[http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Barnacle][Barnacles]]

Crossbows that are covered in secretion could maybe reload faster than humans, so if repeating crossbows are a thing yet, then more golems with crossbows.

If your secretion can be protected with varnish or paint to protect it from rain, then that would certainly be a good idea.

I expect as far as golems go, you could probably roll with some ...creative... designs. Much like how dark souls has wheeled skeletons, the physical design of your secretion-minions can be all over the place.

Muderholes filled with extending secretion controlled spikes would be a good idea, too. Place a carpet over it?

Secretion on the hinges of doors, so they can slam open or shut as needed?
