Can scrolls or magic items controlled by this substance cast themselves /expend charges?

Could make the wizard's spell book eat itself. (snap open and shut all night until the pages are destroyed)

Use the substance to control more of the substance for long distance fuckery

The villain knows all the heroes plans if he chooses to listen to them by hiding a drop in someone's hair or shoe

Some clever use of magic or even a mundane bellows might be enough to effectively (though not technically) aerosolize an amount of the substance, creating areas full of the stuff in the air until it settles - which could cause trouble for someone who walks through the space

Or control the shoes of heroes who step in it, creating difficult terrain that your ambush party automatically ignores

Mix with something that doesn't wash off as easily and keeps the soap from taking your substance with it for a nasty surprise when the heroes have learned to wash everything they encounter before getting close.
