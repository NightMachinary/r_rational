As WilyCoyotee mentioned, whips and flails are good. I would harvest and weave spider silk instead of leather -- it's much lighter and stronger. I would need to do the math, but you may be able to make a spider silk chain for some bolos thin enough to cut anyone unarmored. Also make some thick self tangling nets to launch. Add arrows trailing threads of spider silk to increase annoyance.

Special weapons for catapults: - Strong sealed containers (made of two layers of oilled cloth with an inner layer of clay). These serve as guidance with an external payload than can contain an flammable/poisonous/acid that can roll to the Target after being launched. - Guided missiles/bombs. Add stearing fins, bend fins to steer. - Air burst weapons - Fill canisters with some area denial weapon, trigger release above ground to get good spread. Note that combining guided airburst shots containing dry finely milled flour with a single fire arrow can result in a nice explosion, though you may want to prepare the target with oil first for maximum effect.

The goop could probably run a good pumping infrastructure so water traps are possible (such as a staircase with 3ft of water moving down it constantly).

The usual fake walls/ceilings/floors (thin stone veneer over goop covered traps) that come alive to attack (whips and nets from the ceiling, bolos and arrows from the sides, floor has thin threads that grab at their feet). Caltrops that move underfoot (lightly mixed with regular ones).
