How much do you secrete over time? Power in numbers. Small, high-damage weapons en mass are likely the best bet. Some early thoughts, nothing gamebreaking:

- I suspect that armies of bows effectively maximises firepower.
- Traps can be controlled with small quantities of secretion, since you only need the lever to be active. They can also be autonomous.
- Having an automated factory is probably extremely useful.
- Threads with poisoned needles on could be deadly en mass, since they can crawl under armor, and jab weak points directly. They should probably be fired from the aforementioned bows.
- If you're alone, your castle does not need entrances or stairs, since you don't need to support a population; fill those with rubble and get a rope to let you up when you come and go. Put contraptions around the top of walls to knock off ladders. Grow masses of thorns around the castle.
- Typical defenses like boiling oil and whatnot still make sense, even if they aren't magnified.
- Your greatest risk seems to be enemy siege weapons; coating them with your secretion (either from a projectile or through pre-placed mobile traps down below) allows you to sabotage them.
