1 amp through a large x-ray tube would make for a reasonably effective weapon.

But since we're talking take-over-the-world, how about some classic rules lawyer munchkinery?

1) A sustained electric current is always a loop, since electron density can't go below zero

2) The power produces a current with a hard distance limit of 8 feet, so no outwardly directed current extends beyond the 8 foot limit.

3) The return current must therefore also have the same distance limit.

4) By basic geometry, the closer we get to the 8 feet limit the tighter the turns return current paths have to make

Enter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung][Braking Radiation]]! Electrons making turns emit electromagnetic radiation, with frequency (and energy) a function of the the acceleration involved. So as the turn gets tighter the radiation will go from radio waves to visible light, ultraviolet, right up to X-rays and gamma rays.

Gamma rays can be ridiculously energetic, and by pushing the current to /juuuuuust/ under 8 feet we can make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_gamma_ray][ultra high energy gamma rays]] even more powerful than the most energetic cosmic rays. In principle each photon could have the power of an artillery shell.

This should work without any special equipment but will be most effective when the turn is made in a vacuum so the electrons can travel faster. I.e. an X-ray tube without a conventional anode.

The neat thing about this is that if the electrons are fast enough the radiation will be directed away from you, so with some shielding against backscatter it might even be possible to survive the experience.

Pushing this to the limit, you could hold a country to ransom with a few milliamps and a "surrender or I will irradiate your largest city" speech. Either do that until the world surrenders or take over US/Russia/China/other space-faring country and threaten thousands of square kilometers at once from orbit.

tl;dr: Abuse the hell out of the specific wording to make a synchrotron death cannon.
