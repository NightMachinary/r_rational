How about the final boss of the story I'm never going to write? This is a reverse munchkin scenario turned up to 11. Hopefully I can just dump a ton of the relevant worldbuilding, since I don't think anyone could figure this out without the background.

*Setting*

You're in a world where, rather than magic being a feature patch on top of physics, physics is fundamentally a result of magic. Things work differently here; eyes work by sensing objects directly, not through transfer of light; there is neither air nor air resistance, but there is a fundamental speed cap that some things hit, like missile weapons and people specialized in the magic; and nigh every aspect of the universe can be molded at will by sufficiently skillful mages: if a property varies, there is doubtlessly a magic that affects it directly.

Magics are rather mechanistic in nature, more science than sport, but the personal benefits from being a skilled mage and the very un-Earth-like nature of their reproduction─one literally builds the child out of their own torn flesh, and donates to it some substance of one's own mind and magic─results in guilds and lineages taking strong precedence over prototypical scientific establishments. Most mages specialize in a few specific fields, because the art is difficult and power scaling is very nonlinear; the downside is that specialism in a branch of magic results in increasing value drift towards exploitation of that ability. This world's natural disasters happen when somebody achieves too much in the wrong thing. Much of the society's resources are keeping at bay the many shapeless extensions and copies of the first (and only) divine shapeshifter, who figured out how to perform mitosis and transform himself arbitrarily─nearly all of the world's natural fauna and flora has been replaced by thick forests of his mindless lovecraftian mass.

*The protagonist and antagonist*

Your primary claim to power is your divinity in Will, the magic that affects the inherent randomness effusing the universe to achieve your outcomes, a kind of "luck", if you will. The divinity placed you in a Groundhog-esque time loop, starting at a given point─currently locked at the moment you gained your divinity, but you can bring it forward permanently if you so need─and ending at the point of your death. As a result of value drift, your place no particular ethical weight on the continuity of others' lives, so it does not bother you that restarting the loop kills everybody else, except inasmuch as you valued those people in particular. Since your are simulating this character, you should keep this in mind. Having a divinity in Will gives you effectively limitless time to learn any other magic to any degree of proficiency, though keep in mind that certain kinds of value drift make certain skills dangerous to learn beyond a certain point.

Most people think your adversary is god, but you now know that he's actually "just" an old mage from many generations back that acheived through some means, as best you can tell, all the known divinities. Of note, he has maximum strength, and is unaffected by physical forces, poisons, or fire. He can move at the speed cap and split into multiples; not the unrefined trees of flesh that have invaded the world's borders, but a clean, idealized reproduction. Mind magic doesn't affect him, just like the other properties, since a divine can at worst draw in their own field. Even if you could bypass these, he has an immortal's regeneration, and should you somehow kill him even then, his time loop almost certainly precedes yours, wiping you out of the equation and doing little to him. Most powers you can learn would only allow you to tank his blows, rather than vice versa; having a divinity in strength would make you immune to his punches, but do nothing to stop him being immune to yours (I suppose you could headlock him, if not for him being able to shapeshift, burn you to death, move much faster than you, and mindrape you into compliance if those all fail).

The first time you spoke with him you threatened to loop on him; he laughed and said that if he was worried about that he would have just made you immortal. You don't know whether he could actually do that. When you spoke to him in later loops, he seemed as though he followed you through. You now believe he was just reading your mind and acting as if he knew about them all along. In all, he would almost certainly be afraid of true death, but which particular instance of him is the living one seems to be unimportant.

You want some form of leverage over him. You don't need to actually hurt him, but you do need something that threatens him. At present you have nothing. You should have at least enough here to find my solution, but I'd be interested to see what others can find.
