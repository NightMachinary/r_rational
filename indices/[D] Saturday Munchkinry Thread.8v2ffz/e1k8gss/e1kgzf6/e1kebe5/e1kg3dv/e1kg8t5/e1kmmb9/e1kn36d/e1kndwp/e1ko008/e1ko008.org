You should roughly treat divinities as hitting the level cap; there is fundamentally no next level of time looping. Plus asking for a stronger power is generally a narratively unsatisfying way to solve problems.

The Watsonian reason for this is that magical proficiency works by exploiting levers in reality, rather than it being an agent in and of itself. Time loops have access to that part of reality which defines =t=, not the whole state evaluation function.
