It seems like a straightforward victory condition is to figure out a way to use the time loop partially.

Either edit it so it triggers and kills just the antagonist everywhere. Or edit it so that the next time it triggers it restores everything except the antagonist.

The time loop is literal omnipotence in the current mechanics.
