Why would immortality prevent your reset? Anyone's immortality preventing everyone's reset seems to contradict his words.

A simple way for him to permanently calm his fear of death is to send a copy out at maximum speed, then permanently advance the checkpoint to just after that in case someone convinces him from his ways in the future.

This value drift appears to simplify. Conjecture: Magic's primitives/divinities correspond one-to-one with the components of the human value system.

If you can save/restore another's mind state, teaching a divinity to a subordinate preserves your values. The antagonist might still value that which one can have a lackey sacrifice without rendering him uncontainable.

Rhetoric divinity appears to win one's future maxspeed cone. Assuming he hasn't won, even he must shy away from the corresponding sacrifice.
