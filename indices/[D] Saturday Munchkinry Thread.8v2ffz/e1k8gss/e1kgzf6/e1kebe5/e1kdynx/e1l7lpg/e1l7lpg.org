The first step is to achieve proficiency in deception and broad-optimization magics.

By "deception" I mean improving yourself until you can reliably fool the enemy into not realizing the existence of your time loop. Achieve divinity in mind magic (mind shields? decoy minds?) first. If there are related social magics (e. g., an actual "deception" magic?), master them too; if there aren't, become the best actor a human could ever be.

By "broad-optimization magics" I mean magics akin to Will, which seems to globally optimize events according to your utility function. What others are there? The Enemy has all of them, and they're likely to foil any plan against him if you don't have a symmetric advantage. If further improvement after achieving divinity is at all possible, try to /surpass/ the antagonist in them; spend several googols of years on it if necessary (modify yourself to have infinite patience if necessary).

Once those are achieved, the preparations are complete: you're at least as "lucky" as the enemy, and you have an information advantage in that you know he is in a time loop, while he doesn't know about yours. That information advantage can grow.

Use your time loop to carefully mine his instances for information. The full extent of his powers, his personality, his contingencies, why he made the crucial mistake of allowing the world to remain in such a state that someone with your power was able to appear, et cetera. Use the standard timeloop precaution of killing yourself the moment something surprising happens, obviously.

Eventually, you will have a complete picture of what he is. Use it to manipulate him.

He can't be mindraped or killed, but I assume he can change as a person^{1}. Since you have a timeloop advantage over him, that means you can manipulate him into anything.

Spend some time (a decade? a century?) learning how to get him to develop a minor habit (e. g., a preference for certain speech patterns). Then how to cultivate a major habit. Then an opinion. A belief. A different belief. Two beliefs. A set of beliefs.

Use however much time you need. Thousands of century-long loops for a minor habit is acceptable.

Once proficiency in manipulating him is achieved, shape his personality into whatever form you find convenient, over the course of an arbitrarily long loop. Optionally, get him to not resist while you use mind magic to erase his mind.

A global victory.

^{1. This is actually a major assumption, now that I think about it. If he has divinity in every magic, he has value-drift from every magic. Is he, in fact, still a "person", or just a collection of magics trying to use itself? Perhaps people who call him god are more right. Or perhaps he has a meta-divinity in suppressing value drift, or uses mind magic to do so?}
