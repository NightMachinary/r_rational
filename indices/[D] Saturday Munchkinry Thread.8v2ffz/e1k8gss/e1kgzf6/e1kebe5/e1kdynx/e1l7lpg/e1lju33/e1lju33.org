FYI there aren't a ton of magic disciplines, probably in the mid 20s, not all of which are known.

  This is actually a major assumption, now that I think about it. If he has divinity in every magic, he has value-drift from every magic. Is he, in fact, still a "person", or just a collection of magics trying to use itself? Perhaps people who call him god are more right.

Just highlighting this because it's insightful.

There is a major issue with your plan: spending a thousands of centuries around someone who can maybe forcibly make you immortal is a lot of risk, especially as being unreadable makes you much more of a perceived risk than when you were a transparent book.

I won't rule out the possibility that you could erase his mind this way (it does seem more a job for a superintelligence, but I'm probably underestimating what you can do with megayears of experience), but what if there are clones of him? I think the end goal would have to be more sophisticated than that.

(From a totally Doyolist perspective, how would such a scene even be written? :P)
