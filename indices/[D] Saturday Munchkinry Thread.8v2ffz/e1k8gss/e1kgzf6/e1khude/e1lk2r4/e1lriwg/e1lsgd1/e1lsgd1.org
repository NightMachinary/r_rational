Well the guy isn't short of ways to coerce you into not holding his happiness hostage. I do get your point, but if he finds out before there are sunk costs he's probably not going to cooperate. Even if he can't force you to play nice (say if you're a divine mind mage), he might be able to circumvent you entirelyâ”€he can clone himself, and he claims he can give you immortality so other giving other people other divinities isn't out of the question.
