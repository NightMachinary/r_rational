Get a divinity in mind magic first as a matter of course so you can't be mind controlled.

This dude has got to be pretty bored. Spend a few loops coming up with a really interesting game with a ridiculous amount of depth, then a few more loops getting ridiculously good at it. Offer to play with him, and iterate on design until you find something he likes, then play regularly until it's an established part of his life that he enjoys.

If he ever does anything you don't like, heavily cut back game time. If he tries to force you to play suicide. If he works out a way to force you to play anyway play badly. Ideally none of that ever comes up and now both of you have something interesting to do as down time.

Try not to get more attached to the game than he is, just in case.
