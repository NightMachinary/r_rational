Apologies, I thought I'd mentioned they can be disabled. There is the other escape clause from gaining divinities until you escape that fate; living with a rock lodged in your head is a good─if painful─way to practice recovery magics until you're an immortal. It's hard to figure out what kind of things don't happen over arbitrarily long timeframes to be honest.

Maybe if you got a mind mage to fry your brain beforehand, but they'd need to leave you in a state that didn't count as killing you (else you'd loop on them, which wouldn't be stable), which means you need at least some useful faculties left.

I'll think about this, maybe I'm being overly pessimistic about it.
