If you want something on audible, I would recommend Vlad Taltos. I found it in a Rec thread on here. Vlad is a Homo Sapiens in a world where the thoroughly alien Dragaerans are dominant. While the Dragaerans refer to themselves as human, earth Humans are second class citizens, lower than the dusty peasant class.

Vlad grew up hard, raised by a father he despised as a collaborator, hotheaded and fallible in the way that people with rough upbringings often are.

With that said, Vlad and all the characters around him are intelligent, capable of intricate planning and interpersonal relationships.

The action is fast and furious, the dialogue is pithy and sharp, and the Worldbuilding is deep and wide.

The audiobook itself is very entertaining and well-spoken. There are a lot of books, released out of chronological order. I follow the release order but you may not prefer to.
