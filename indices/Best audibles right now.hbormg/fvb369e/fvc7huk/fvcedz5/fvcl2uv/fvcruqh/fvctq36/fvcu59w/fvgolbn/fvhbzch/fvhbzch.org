  So the characters asexual not to bring something to story but to rather appeal to asexual people who read it?
#+end_quote

No, that's a false dichotomy. I determined that writing Corin as asexual was a natural fit for his character, which improved the overall story of the whole - and not just for asexual readers.

  Not a good approach for a book imo, well it good to get readers but it's flawed way.
#+end_quote

I do not market my book specifically to asexual readers. I write what I feel makes a good story and diverse representation is a part of that.
