There's nothing random about it. Not everyone is straight. Corin happens to asexual (but not aromantic) - people like that exist, and representation is important.

You don't read female protagonists. You apparently won't read male/male relationships, either. Can't you imagine that there are other people out there that might want someone that they can relate to?

Just to be clear, I'm not trying to encourage you to read my books - just trying to make it clear that non-straight people exist, and it's okay to have them in books, too.
