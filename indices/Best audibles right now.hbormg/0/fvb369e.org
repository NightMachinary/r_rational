If you like Unsouled, you might also like:

- *Street Cultivation* by Sarah Lin, which is an urban fantasy cultivation novel. Think Cradle meets Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.
- *Mage Errant* by John Bierce. Magical academy, ala Mother of Learning. Short and fast paced like Cradle.
- My own books. *Arcane Ascension* is a JRPGsih magical school and dungeon crawling series with lots of magic system detail. *War of Broken Mirrors* is darker, more political and traditional fantasy. *Weapons & Wielders* is lighthearted JRPGish adventuring with more comedy than the other options. *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* is more of a LitRPG and parody.
