That doesn't answer the question at all...

Going from your answer, the question could be : do you insist on protagonists wanting to play with hotwheels rather than barbie dolls ?

Can't you read a story where the protagonist is female ?\\
Do the protagonist have to share your other values, or tastes in esthetics or food ?

"This character likes pears, that's a no go for me. Nope."
