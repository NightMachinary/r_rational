Based solely on one chapter of this fic I've managed to read, I can't stand this crossover. Instead of enriching the setting of Code Geass, the elements of Jojo clash with it horribly. With one stroke the deliciously manipulative geas of Lelouch is replaced with boring gimped invisibility and my favourite partnership with CC is tossed right out. I simply lost interest at that point.
