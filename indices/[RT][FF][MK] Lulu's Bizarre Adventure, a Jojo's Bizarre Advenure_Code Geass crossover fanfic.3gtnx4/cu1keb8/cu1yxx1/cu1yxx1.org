Yep! I didn't expect it, but the author puts in tons of Jojo, which changes the original Code Grass story in major ways. Also, I feel like the story really nails the feeling of Jojo fights, which is a major positive in my book.

Though you may be lost on some things, admittedly. The story assumes you know a basicaly amount of Code Geass. So maybe just watch the first few episodes of the show?
