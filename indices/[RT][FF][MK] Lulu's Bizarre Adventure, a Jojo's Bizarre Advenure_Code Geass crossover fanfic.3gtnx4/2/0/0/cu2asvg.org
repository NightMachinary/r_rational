Yes, I did predict that he would find creative uses for the power. Lelouch would probably find creative uses for a flying brick superpower as well, but that does not make such a power thematically appropriate for him. In my mind Lelouch and his geas go together in a unique way. Unless his stand has a major mental component that he exploits later on, it's just not the same. Fucking with people's minds is simply more interesting and more in line with his character than playing with shadows.

As for CC, I somehow doubt that she will be as interested in Lelouch as she was in canon. The geas played a major role in their relationship. Without it, canon CC would not have much interest at all. If she does in this fic, then, most likely, the author diverged enough from her character that she might as well be an OC.

For all I know, this fic is the most awesome piece of literature on earth. I just don't have any motivation to read it after the author tossed out 50% of what I like in Code Geass.
