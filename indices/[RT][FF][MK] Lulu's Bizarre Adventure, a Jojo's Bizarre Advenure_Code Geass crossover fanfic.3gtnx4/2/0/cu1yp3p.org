Well, at the risk of spoiling, you're wrong on both counts!

At first I was also disappointed by Lelouch's power, but the author finds an amazingly surprising amount of creative uses for it that I never would have thought of. Thus the [MK] tag. And he's just as manipulative as the original, he just has to do his manipulating the hard way now. And while CC leaves in the first chapter, she does come back.
