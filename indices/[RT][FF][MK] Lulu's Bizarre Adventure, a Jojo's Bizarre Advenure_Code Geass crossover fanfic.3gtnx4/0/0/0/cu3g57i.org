Somewhat. Joseph's grenade trick is probably one of my favorite moments in JJBA besides the third return of the robo-Nazi. The entire show is about being surprisingly over-the-top in terms of action. It remains surprisingly over the top even to people who know it's over the top. It remains surprisingly over the top even to people who know it remains surprisingly over the top even to people who know it's over the top. Effectively, there is no level of effort that can actually prepare you for JJBA.

That being said, I'd say it takes some time to grow on you. I have good patience so I watched the anime series, which has some pacing issues but is much more filled out. They remastered the anime into a series of 3 movies which cut out a lot of the less interesting stuff.

Anime series starts here: [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure/episode-1-dio-the-invader-652081][Crunchyroll]]

Movie series (recommended for most viewers) starts here: [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure/episode-1-part-1-phantom-blood-653409][Crunchyroll]]

There are three stories in JJBA. There's Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency, and Stardust Crusaders. The stuff I've linked covers Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, which starts in the 1880s and goes up through the 1930s and the beginnings of WWII. Stardust Crusaders is set in the 1970s and is significantly different than the previous two stories, though I haven't watched it.

In general, JJBA is old and is a trope maker for a lot of stuff in action anime/manga. The art is excellent and reminds me of an era when characters in anime are drawn as adults and not as children. In fact, almost none of the story is about children. Or people being unable to express their emotions. Or angst, except for super manly angst.

In this way, it is great. There are two categories of characters in this story: people who weigh under 200 lbs, and adult men. If you weigh under 200 lbs, and you're a character in JJBA, you don't fight (with one or two exceptions). If you show up to a fight, you will literally wet yourself in fear at the manliness of the battle. This happens.

On the other hand... don't expect a lot in the way of rational explanations for things. Every single decision made in this story was made with the goal of making things as awesome as possible. All was sacrificed on that altar, for better or for worse.
