It's rational, in that most of the characters take rational actions, given the 'bizarre' ruleset of their world, that advance their goals.

And for the differences between Jojo and Lulu, Lulu isn't really the Jojo of this story. He's more of a protagonist Dio, in a way. The 'Jojo' of this story is...well, let's just say I didn't see it coming.

You'll be pleased to hear that there's some deliciously over the top moments. Like I said in another comment, I feel like it really captures the feel of Jojo battles and Jojo's overall style, while being pretty original.
