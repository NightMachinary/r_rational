Superb show, be warned that the pacing is pretty slow so it takes 5-6 episodes to get into it. Then you're not going to be doing anything else for a while.

Does anyone know what the mechanics are for the ship lasers? The beams don't seem to spread out enough to explain why they only work at a relatively short range, and not understanding the mechanics that meant I didn't get some of the battle tactics (there's lots of space battles).
