If you want to try it out without the intimidation factor of starting up a 100+ episode show, start with the prequel film [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/3014/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu:_Waga_Yuku_wa_Hoshi_no_Taikai][My Conquest is the Sea of Stars]], which more or less establishes the tone you can expect for the rest of the run. If you like it, the prologue film to the main series, [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/3016/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu:_Arata_Naru_Tatakai_no_Overture][Overture to a New War]] sets things up nicely.
