I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30309/descendants-of-a-dead-earth][/Descendants of a Dead Earth/]] and I'd give it a cautious recommend. It's been out for awhile, and the author's on their third book of the series - 110 chapter written so far, updates are every 1-2 days.

  In the future, Man has traveled the Cosmos.

  In the future, Man has discovered many other races.

  In the future...Man has no home.

  200 years after the great war that destroyed Earth, humanity struggles to survive; fractured, divided, wanted by no one.

  Until Maggie, of the Tinker Clan, makes a discovery, setting in motion a chain of events that could change /everything/.

The style is okay. There are a few parts where dialogue is a bit off, and character interactions are exaggerated, but that just might be my preferences. No grammatical mistakes (that I can remember). Worldbuilding is pretty good, with a focus on the MC overcoming adversity using her skills, knowledge, and limited resources.

e: After finishing the first book, I have to revise this review a bit: the dialogue between the ships crew just isn't great. It seems that characters mainly have two settings: angry and smug. It just doesn't feel genuine.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42433/peculiar-soul][/Peculiar Soul/]] by TMarkos (who wrote /Grand Design/ and /Inheritors of Eschaton/, which are two other really good stories) is a new story that came out a month ago. It only has 6 chapter up and updates weekly, but what I've read so far is really interesting.

  Not everyone gets a soul. The rise of industry and mechanization has sent the world's population booming upward, striving relentlessly for the fixed handful of souls that level armies and steer the fate of nations. The remnants of a crumbled empire fight in a grinding, bloody war against their ancient enemy.

  Not everyone gets a soul, but Michael must - for he is the scion of a lord, and the soulless cannot hold such a title. For five years he has tried to tempt one of the souls freed by its vessel's death. Five years of pain and failure, earning only his father's contempt. At last, one more opportunity to earn his soul has come.

It's well-written, the characters and story are interesting, the author does a good job of examining character and motivation, but the focus on worldbuilding is what I like best. It feels really fleshed out (or as much as it can be given the few chapters), not just the setting but the history and political climate, and how that feeds into the MC's story.
