[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dread-our-wrath-asoiaf-si.870076/][Dread Our Wrath]] is a pretty good ASoIaF SI, with with an mc that awakens the heir of a newly lorded sellsword approximately a decade and a half before the Conquest of Dorne under Daeron I Targaryen. No literal kingdom building (being set in ASoIaF), but plenty of small agriculture, building structure, etc. that make life increasingly better in his fief.
