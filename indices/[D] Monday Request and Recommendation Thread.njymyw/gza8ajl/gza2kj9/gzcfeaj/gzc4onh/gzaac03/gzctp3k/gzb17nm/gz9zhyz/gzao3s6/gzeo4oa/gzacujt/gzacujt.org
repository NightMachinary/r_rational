Predestination. Not specifically about scientific or social progress, but definitely about saving lives using time travel.

Overall an absolutely fantastic movie. Certainly the best movie about time travel to go in blind, not knowing anything about it, not even that it's about time travel. I wish I'd done that, but I was interested in it specifically because I'm a fan of the original story it's based on (all you zombies by Heinlein).
