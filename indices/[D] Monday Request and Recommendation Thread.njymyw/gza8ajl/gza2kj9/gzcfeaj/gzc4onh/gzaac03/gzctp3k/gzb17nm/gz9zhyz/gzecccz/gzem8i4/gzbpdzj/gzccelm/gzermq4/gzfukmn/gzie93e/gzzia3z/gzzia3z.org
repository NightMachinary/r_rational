  The Legend of Korra
#+END_QUOTE

Uh. I'd recommend the original AtLA over that any time. Neither is exactly rational, but for AtLA it's a matter of stylistic choices and for Korra it's just bad writing. Also Korra is a pretty insufferable protagonist, especially in Season 2, which is the one where everyone in the writing room seems to have lost their goddamn mind.
