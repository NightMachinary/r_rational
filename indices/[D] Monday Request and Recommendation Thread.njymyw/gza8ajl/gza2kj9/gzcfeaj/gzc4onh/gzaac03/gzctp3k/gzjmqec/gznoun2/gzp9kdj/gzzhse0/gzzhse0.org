Three Body Problem for me was a victim of "I made up a story in my head that was a lot more compelling than what I actually got" (at least the first book). See, when I started having the combination of physicists committing suicide, science experiments seemingly coming to a halt, and the whole strange simulation in the unstable star system, my thought was that the simulation was a metaphor for what was really happening, and that the reveal was that the lowest layer of the universe's law was purely chaotic; there were rules, but they interacted in such a way as to be incomputable, and so scientific advancement beyond a certain point was all but impossible.

Then the later two books do indeed deal with some pretty grandiose and fascinating concepts, but they're also full of really dumb stuff. I can't get over the whole part where that guy imagines the perfect girlfriend, then has someone locate a woman that's actually like that and bring her to him, that was offensively idiotic. It's like someone who has never gotten laid and has the understanding of romance of a 12 year old went OK NOW PAUSE THE PLOT, IT'S WISH FULFILMENT TIME!
