pretty much everything Lois McMaster Bujold has written falls into one of those two categories, and all of it is super top notch. (well, OK, the Sharing Knife series is an exception.) For the SF, you can start with either Falling Free (heroic engineers! a dramatic take-the-thing-apart-and-put-it-back-together scene!) or Cordelia's Honor (romance! adventure! interstellar politics! the correct gift to come back from the rebelling city with!). For the fantasy, you start with Curse of Chalion.
