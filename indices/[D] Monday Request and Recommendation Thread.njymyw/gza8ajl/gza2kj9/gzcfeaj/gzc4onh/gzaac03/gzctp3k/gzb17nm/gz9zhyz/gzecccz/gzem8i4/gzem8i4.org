A couple days ago I watched "Freaks" (Canada, 2018 - to avoid confusion with the German 2020 movie of the same name) on Netflix. It was a very gripping take on a pretty classic setup (I'm not even going to mention /which/ setup since finding out is part of the fun - though I would say it should become clear very early to anyone familiar with the tropes of the genre. Which genre? You'll realise soon enough). It's actually kinda hard to give any specific information since the movie starts with the premise of a little girl being kept at home by an overly protective, seemingly paranoid father, and moves from there as we discover and understand the situation following the child's own perspective. It's nothing groundbreaking, but makes for a really engaging watch, with some clever visual storytelling.
