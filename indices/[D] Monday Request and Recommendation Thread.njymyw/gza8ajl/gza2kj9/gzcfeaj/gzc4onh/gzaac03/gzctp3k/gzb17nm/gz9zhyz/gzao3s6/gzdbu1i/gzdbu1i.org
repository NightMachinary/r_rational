For those who wonder: that's barely a spoiler. It's revealed in the first few chapters of the first book (IIRC).

That said, not knowing anything about a work before you get into it can be wonderful. I saw [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)][/Let the Right One In/]] without knowing that it's a vampire movie. (If you read pretty much anything about the movie, that will not be a spoiler.)

I like the Merchant Princes series a lot, and I've read it a few times. The final book should be coming out [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2021/01/a-quick-infomercial.html][September 28, 2021]].
