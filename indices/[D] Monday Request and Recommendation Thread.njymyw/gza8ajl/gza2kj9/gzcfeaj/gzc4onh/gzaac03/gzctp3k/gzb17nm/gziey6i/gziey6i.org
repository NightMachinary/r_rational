[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne][Demense]] - more settlers/homesteading than kingdom building. Lots of focus on trying not to die to the elements/hunger/dragons.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record][A Young Woman's Political Record]] - A Youjo Senki fanfic that follows the MC's post-war career as she enters politics and tries to find a cushy job (and avert WW2). You might want to read the original Youjo Senki (or the manga) since, while it's not crucial to the story, it helps with the background info.
