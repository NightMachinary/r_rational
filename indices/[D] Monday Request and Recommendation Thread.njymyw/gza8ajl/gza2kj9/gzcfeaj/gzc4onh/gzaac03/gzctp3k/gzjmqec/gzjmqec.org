Hard sci-fi:

Reynold's /Revelation Space/ and sequels. I'm working through the second now. A grimy, used future civilization has one question: why have they only found the ruins of alien civilizations?

/The Three body problem/ by cixin Liu. Series begins 20 minutes into the future but gets weird, especially in the second book. Occupies a weird space between hard and soft sci fi. Very focused on rationalist topics like x-risk and game theory.

---------

Low fantasy:

Glen Cook's /Black Company./ Mercenaries end up working for less than savory employers. Magic shows up but it is rare, focused on trickery for anyone who isn't top tier in firepower, and tends towards the macabre. This series founded a lot of tropes in later fantasy like Malazan.

/The darkness that comes before,/ first in R Scott Bakker's /Prince of Nothing/ series: incredibly dark low fantasy. The pope calls for a holy war, and the faithful answer. But one character has other plans, and given that he is basically a Dune Mentat, the world is not ready to deny him. Setting loosely echoes crusades-era Byzantium and Middle East, but is founded on some very different history and metaphysics, with sorcery and...other things. Definitely rational-adjacent. Again, extremely bleak and messed up.
