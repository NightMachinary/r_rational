Beneath the Dragon Eye Moons - A healer in a vaguely Roman fantasy litRPG.

Beware of Chicken - At the same time the best Xianxia web serial and also the best satire/sendup of Xianxia.

Only Villains Do That - antisocial dude transported to fantasy world as Dark Lord. Shenanigans, and character growth, ensue.

The Daily Grind - Office job turns far more interesting when it turns out to contain a portal into a dungeon. Increases of skill and radical anarchistic politics ensue.
