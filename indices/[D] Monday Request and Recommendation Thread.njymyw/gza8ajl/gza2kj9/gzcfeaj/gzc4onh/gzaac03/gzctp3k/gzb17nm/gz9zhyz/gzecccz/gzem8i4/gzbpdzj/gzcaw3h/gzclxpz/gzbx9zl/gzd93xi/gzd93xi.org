[[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/m7a3jl/web_novels_of_similar_quality_to_guide_but/grc5gbp/][Here's a rec list]] I wrote two months back. The last one on the list is the only one not on Royalroad. Other changes would be sticking Vigor Mortis on the list (I think that cropped up a few times in rec threads last month so check those recommendations out, personally I'm torn 50/50 on if it goes in the "Very Strong Recommendations" group or not), sticking Dear Spellbook on that list (basically "Mother of Learning but in a DND-esque world and about a 7/10 instead of a 9.5/10"), and sticking Only Villains Do That on the list (which someone else replied to this same comment with). Also Dead Tired is on hiatus right now, I guess the author is focusing on their other stuff, maybe skip it for now.
