I guess I meant outside of recommendation posts! More like it's not elevated to the level of "broadly accepted fic people make top level posts about".

I'll also admit that it isn't really /rationalist/ so much as it is well thought out, the world has an appearance of being well developed and of appropriate scale, and the characters do often honestly pursue their goals, even if they are pretty stupid sometimes (though they often get called on it by other characters).
