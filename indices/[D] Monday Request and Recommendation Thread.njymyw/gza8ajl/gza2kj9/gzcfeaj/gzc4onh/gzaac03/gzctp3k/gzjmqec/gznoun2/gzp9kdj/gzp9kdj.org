I was mixed on putting that statement for 3 body. It's got a lot of rationalist themes--humanity coming together to solve a problem, game theory, xeno-intelligence, xeno-game theory, cryonics, exotic modes of computing, and a lot more I'm sure I'm forgetting.

And then it's just...not presented rationally? I think it's more in the plotting than in the reasoning. Characters do stuff that /feels/ arbitrary, even if they can talk through a "rational" reason for it. Worldbuilding-wise a bunch of elements feel like they're in there for show (I sawed this cruise ship in half!), which is odd as the first book starts very similar to our reality. The plot is suffused with this weird sort of techno-authoritarianism that informs most of the evolution of the setting. Charismatic leaders draw together factions bound by philosophy instead of material interest, and when they fall, their ideology withers with them.

It's fresh, it's strange, it deals in rationalist themes. I have to give it credit.

also, re: prince of nothing. I haven't gotten around to reading past the first trilogy yet, but I was made aware of the big metaphysics reveal about damnation being real. It's a fascinating way to do it.
