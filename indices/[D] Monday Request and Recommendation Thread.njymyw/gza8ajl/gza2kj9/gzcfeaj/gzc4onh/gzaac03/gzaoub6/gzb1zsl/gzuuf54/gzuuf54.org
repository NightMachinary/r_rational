Heads up to other readers: I'm pretty sure the first too books are intended to be read as back-to-back. If I were to do it over again I would get /Hyperion/ and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77565.The_Fall_of_Hyperion][/The Fall of Hyperion/]] at the same time.

That said, I don't mind the cliffhanger at the end of the first book too much, maybe because the structure of the book implies that it ends where it does.
