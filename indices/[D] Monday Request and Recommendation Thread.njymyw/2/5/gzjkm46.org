Worm also has the chapters with the facial agnosia plague, where characters can remember their relation to others but not tell whether the person they are seeing is the person they are thinking of. Don't swear!

To answer your question, I think you've hit the main ones I'm aware of. I seem to recall HP fanfic playing with canon's memory charms---I'll see if I can find any links later when I'm off work.

Arguably a similar effect can be achieved through messing with time. JoJo has season 4's time reset when certain information becomes known, and of course King Crimson. Though it's anime and not rationalfic, so I don't think it's applied all that consistently. Worth the Candle has some of this flavor as well via Unicorns and the Infinite Library.
