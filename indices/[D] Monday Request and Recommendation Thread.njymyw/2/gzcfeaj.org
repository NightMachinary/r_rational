Anyone have stories similar to [[https://www.amazon.com/There-No-Antimemetics-Division-qntm-ebook/dp/B08FHHQRM2][There is no Antimemetics Division]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][CORDYCEPS]], where the viewpoint characters have to deal with memetic (and/or antimemetic) hazards?

Other examples of what I'm looking for:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/][Nowhere Land]]: pseudo-SCP story where the main character is stuck in a malfunctioning jumpchain anomaly. He eventually finds out that he wiped most of his own memory of working for his group with amnestics. Unfortunately +dead+ on hiatus, but I really enjoyed what was there.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst/][Ar'Kendrythist]] (sorta): Usually doesn't focus on this sort of thing, but very occasionally /does/. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst/chapter/452792/068-jane][Chapter 68]] in particular was exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for.

[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] (sorta): has traces of this, especially the parts involving the abstract demon Ur. Nobody knows much about it, or how much damage it's done, since it retroactively erases the history of anything it encounters.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] (kinda sorta): has /very minor/ traces of this, primarily involving the character Imp.
