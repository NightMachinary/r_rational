I mean, the amount of existential mindfuckery implied simply by the fact that you can travel to the past /and change it/ is enough to make those implications far less than clear. Either:

- time loops are a thing, the past is unchangeable and self-consistent, and therefore if you try you know you /will/ fail, aka probably get killed, or,

- a multiverse of timelines exists, in which case, sure, go ahead, improve this one, there's still untold trillions out there in which everyone is suffering the worst possible fates imaginable, also that awaits you too in the future because quantum immortality, have fun, or,

- there's only one timeline and you can change it, which means that even by improving the lives of those in the time you've arrived in, you're virtually killing everyone who was ever born /after/ it and up to your own time. Including all your family and friends. And it's unclear how do /you/ even exist at all.
