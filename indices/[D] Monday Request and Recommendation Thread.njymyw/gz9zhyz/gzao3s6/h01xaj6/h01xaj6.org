I started this and it's clear that the author put a lot of thought into making the world self-consistent. My main complaint is that MC is really passive, and the first time she takes independent initiative after the plot has been laid out it's to fuck Roland without really being clear on how that would help their position. And that first initiative happens halfway through the book. What's up with that? Is it a repeated pattern throughout the series that MC is exclusively passive except in that type of situation?
