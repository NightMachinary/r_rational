You might like the Destiny's Crucible series. It's effectively time travel, but instead it's a Phd candidate chemist taken to a early iron age civilization on another planet after a UFO crashes with a flight to an academic conference there is some nice balances between trying to not be the nail that sticks out, trying to do the right thing, and societies you don't understand having real reasons for why they do things in the way they do them (mostly though some items may just be authorial fiat, or may eventually be explained in the setting).
