I find it to be adequately rational. The characters are consistent, consistently put in the level of munchkinry and preparation you'd expect out of them, and the worldbuilding is ... well, I mean, not realistic, there are magical dungeons, but well-thought-through.

But I totally get that it's not everyone's thing, for one reason or another.

(And it's definitely not rational/ist/ fiction.)
