I mean, a lot of the popular rationalist fiction around here is on royal road: Worth the Candle, Delve, Elemental Arena.

I haven't read Blessed Time, so I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for.

Personally I think Ar'Kendrithyst is one of the better written magic crafting novels on Royal Road that isn't regularly mentioned around here.
