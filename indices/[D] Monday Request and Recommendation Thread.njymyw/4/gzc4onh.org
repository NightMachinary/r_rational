I read the latest Bujold novel, a Penric one. The Assassin of Thasalos.

It was very good! It's certainly not rationalist fiction, but the worldbuilding is far more real-feeling (to me, at least) than the vast majority of stuff I read. She has a real talent at... well, at everything. She's Bujold.

Penric remains one of my favorite protagonists, though he's not nearly at Ista's level (the protagonist of Paladin of Souls, book two in the Chalion duology, by Bujold as well). Desdemona remains the best demon ever to ride shotgun in a POV character's head, and the Bastard is pretty great.

As always, I adore Byzantine politics, and our return to Thasalos does not disappoint in its delivery.

Highly recommended, read the whole series, it's an absolute delight.
