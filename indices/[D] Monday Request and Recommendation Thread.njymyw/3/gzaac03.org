I'm interested in far-future sci-fi stories set in deep space and centred around weird metaphysical/religious/supernatural bullshit. Ideally horror, ideally hard sci-fi.

Examples:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/48484][/Blindsight/]] /mostly/ fits.\\
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hollow-hill-archives-teletubbies.69481/][/hollow hill archives/]], a /Teletubbies/ fanfiction (sic).\\
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_(film)][/Event Horizon/]], a movie.\\
- [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/628670/Hellpoint/][/Hellpoint/]], a video game.

I recommend the first two, and don't recommend the last two, they're only here to serve as references.
