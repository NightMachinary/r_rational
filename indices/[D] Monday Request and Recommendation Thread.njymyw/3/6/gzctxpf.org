Its definitely not hard sci-fi, but there's /Space Runaway Ideon/, which I think is essentially Lovecraftian horror. Particularly the two films /A Contact/ (which is an improved retelling of the series) and /Be Invoked/ (which is a continuation/ending and the more interesting of the two). Skip the series unless you have a lot of patience- though I think its been unfairly mocked. Many of Tomino's works could be called pseudo-horror metaphysical weirdness, like that ending of /Zeta Gundam/.

/Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri/? I was pretty freaked out when the planet literally talked to me incoherently. There's some stuff about "transcendence" that I never played long enough to get to but the writing is top notch. I suppose its not exactly horror.
