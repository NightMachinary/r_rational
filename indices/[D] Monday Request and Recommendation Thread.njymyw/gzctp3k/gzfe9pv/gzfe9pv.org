/The First Law/ seems like it would probably appeal to you. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "Low Fantasy", but it's a low-magic gritty-to-grimdark setting. /The Traitor Baru Cormorant/ might also be up your alley. /A Deepness in the Sky/ isn't quite hard SciFi (and it's a prequel to /A Fire Upon the Deep/ which definitely isn't), but I recommend it highly to anyone reading SciFi. It stands alone well, thought there are definitely things you'll get better if you've read /Fire/.
