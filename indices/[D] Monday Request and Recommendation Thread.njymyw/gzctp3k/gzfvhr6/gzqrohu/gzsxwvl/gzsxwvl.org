This subreddit's Wiki lists [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]] as one of "great and highly recommended stories that have a lot of qualities of rational/rationalist fiction". Which I mostly agree with except I'd like to add that the Wiki's content warning -- "Contains torture and mind rape" -- /really/ needs to be taken seriously.

One could argue that adding brainwashing, mind rape, etc to an infinite time loop story is one of the very few ways to introduce meaningful conflict to an environment where death just means an instant restart. However, the implementation was so brutal and visceral that it was something of a shock.

The /Daniel Black/ series is different. It's more of a "base building" game with an added harem. I thought that the base building part was OK if unexceptional while the harem part felt seriously off. (/Time Braid/ also had harem elements, but they were overshadowed by the mind rape subplot.)
