To be fair, I'd argue she made the correct decision wrt what she knew at the time. Preventing genocide is generally considered a good thing to try and do, even if looking back later there were better paths. For what she did know, the risk of The Quileute Tribe be killed as soon as Aro remembered werewolves was huge.

There's also the fact that hidding the existance of werewolves would likely have been justification enough for the imperial coven to capture the vampires for power bottling as they did anyways.
