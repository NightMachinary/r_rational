A decent way into Metaworld chronicles, the protagonist uses earth knowledge about venture capital and margin trading to start a very successful business. It's one of the few examples of what you're talking about that I find believable because it isn't "common sense" so much as a good idea someone once had that built on other good ideas that eventually led to the world we have today. But if you would have tried to introduce someone to it from the 1700s, they would say you're crazy.

It usually feels like the rest of the world is holding the idiot ball if it's a simple idea that nobody else has thought of (to me).

Just fair warning though, Metaworld Chronicles has a bit of a Mary Sue for a protagonist. The first 100 or so pages are like reading a kids power fantasy, but then it very suddenly picks up. Still a Mary Sue though.
