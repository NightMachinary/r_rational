I've always liked stories where the protagonist wins by using common sense or unusual solutions that obviously never occurred to others but seem more obvious in retrospect. Anyone have any recommendations for stories or media where the protagonist wins or changes the story through some outside the box tactic or common sense solution that others have never tried or thought of?
