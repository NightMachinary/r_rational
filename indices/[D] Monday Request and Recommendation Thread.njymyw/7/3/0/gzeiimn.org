Very enjoyable. I remember reading a few blog posts or the like mentioning dath ilan, but I hadn't thought of it as a story setting and the crossover's really interesting. Do you have any other dath ilan-related fics to recommend?

The glowfic format is odd but not bad; I'm used to playing RPGs over IRC, and it feels a bit like watching one unfold.
