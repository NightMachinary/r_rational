- [[https://glowfic.com/posts/212][/Silmaril/]] is very long, but also complete... as much as glowfic ever gets, anyway. A personal favorite with lovely worldbuilding which turned into a glowfic template setting.\\
  When Loki is banished she lands in Arda while the Noldor are crossing the HelcaraxÃ«; many decades of grim war and magical research and bad-news escalation follow.
- [[https://glowfic.com/posts/4497][/shift from hell/]] is set almost entirely in an ICU (and written by an ICU nurse!). Knowing nothing about the setting two characters originate from (Valdemar) is fine, since nobody else does either. Incomplete but I like it a lot.
- /The Erogamer/ is neither SFW nor /strictly/ glowfic, but it has a lot of the same sensibilities.

Of [[https://glowfic.com/users/366][Iarwain]]'s other work, [[https://glowfic.com/posts/4508][/but hurting people is wrong/]] also stars Thellim; and [[https://glowfic.com/posts/3866][/Team Tyler's Van/]] looks a lot like a fun/deconstucted portal-power-fantasy. (It's actually a stealth crossoverish thing between HPMOR and Luminosity, double-spoiler /by their respective authors/)
