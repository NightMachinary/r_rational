Guh. I'd forgotten about that latter one. I only remembered the part where he becomes literally ill by drinking booze dredged up from the bottom of the ocean, just because it was expensive and rare I don't think it's ever even plot relevant again. It's like there's supposed to be a metaphor there but the author forgot to actually add it, so we're just left with the techno-authoritarian "I guess we have to have a Science Czar."

As for the simulation, I liked that it mapped directly to the alien's home system and circumstances, but I remember being somewhat disappointed that the "solution" was just doing a big enough Monte Carlo sim. That's a matter of computing power rather than a novel insight, unless I'm forgetting something. Contrast OSC's /Xenocide/, which for all its faults, solves the main plot thread with a revelation about the in-universe metaphysics (the philotic "soul" enabling true FTL travel over the ansible network). Imagine if Ender and company had instead said "Of course! Have we tried sticking /more/ engines on the spacecraft?

The direction you mentioned does sound more compelling than what we got, though it would be pretty incompatible with the rest of the series.

Also, I have picked up the habit of chanting "re-hy-drate. re-hy-drate." when I go downstairs to get a glass of water thanks to the VR game, so clearly that part stuck with me.
