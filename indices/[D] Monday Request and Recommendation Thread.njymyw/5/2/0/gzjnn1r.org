Seconding Baru Cormorant as a rational take on why you shouldn't piss off an accountant. Really quite a good book.

I loved a fire upon the deep, which is in a weird place between high SciFi and fantasy, and low medieval fantasy. The neat part is that it's actually justified in universe why this would be the case. It also does more to explore different modes of intelligence than any other single book I've read.
