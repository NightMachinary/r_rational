The Dresden Files -- urban fantasy about a hardboiled wizard detective, lots of fun, only vaguely rational but moreso than a lot of fantasy.

Perilous Waif -- medium-hard scifi, lots of handwaving but no magic disguised as tech, trashy but fun

Player of Games -- medium-hard scifi again, lots of other books in the same universe if you like it

Crystal Society -- pretty hard scifi, extra rational

Name of the Wind -- debatable whether it's low or high fantasy, but a big favorite among rational fiction fans.

The Martian and/or Project Hail Mary -- probably already heard of these, but just in case, they're both excellent near-future hard scifi
