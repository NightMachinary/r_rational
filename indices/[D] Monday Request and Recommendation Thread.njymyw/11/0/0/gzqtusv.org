I really like LDR too, but calling Life Hutch rational is a pretty big stretch. I mean...

- A malfunction which causes a repair robot to suddenly become a killer robot is pretty unlikely
- Said malfunction causes the robot to act like a Jurassic Park t-rex is even more unlikely
- Even if the robot is somehow thrown into a backup "combat mode", having it simply stomp on and smash anything that moves would be stupid, because it's very likely that it would break something that causes second-order movements and thus escalate the robot into a never-ending cycle of smashing things.
- The robot uses lidar or a similar technique to "see" as evidenced by its vision being a depth-map. It would not be distracted by a light source because light projected onto a surfaces is 2d and has no depth.
