The thing I hate about /Alpha Centauri/ is that it sounds like such a cool game, but I never got into it in its time, and now its looks only make my eyes bleed. I'm in no way a graphics snob, I love pixel art, there's SNES era games that still look amazing, but there's also some kind of uncanny valley during the 1990s in which games started growing really complex and ambitious while also still lacking the full technical means to properly conveying that complexity visually and the result is a lot of very terrible looking interfaces.

BTW speaking of transcendence and such, /Stellaris/ does a lot of things along those lines. Almost all end game events tend to be really terrifying shit, like extragalactic all-devouring aliens arrive or mysterious entities bleed out of hyperspace after you performed one too many jumps. And then there's the event where after getting in touch with beings from other dimensions, one of them offers you a Faustian bargain in which your civilisation gets a short amount of enormous power, and after that's run out the entity simply kills everyone and leaves you only with one planet and a few pops . That one's fun.
