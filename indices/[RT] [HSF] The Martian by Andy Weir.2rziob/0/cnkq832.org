I liked this book very much. It's one of the very few I literally didn't want to take a break from (you see this hyperbole everywhere in reviews, but this doesn't happen to me with most books). It has a lot of clever solutions, pragmatism and snarky humor.

Of the complaints I've read that I think are justified to some degree:

- Too many Diabolus Ex Machina with pulled punches (many bad things happen out of the blue, but the damage is limited, so the hero can recover);
- The hero is too unfazed and lighthearted given the situation. I personally liked it much better than /Gravity/ with the heroine unstable to the extreeme;
- The writing is stylized for a modern blog, and tries too hard to be funny. I liked the style, but I see from where the dislike may be coming from.
