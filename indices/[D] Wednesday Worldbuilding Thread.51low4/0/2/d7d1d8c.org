There's a setting I briefly worked on a long time ago where the Cold War featured an arms race of kaiju in addition to nuclear weapons, and only children properly maintain the link, so you also have the kids in later years getting mentored by adults who had previously wielded such-and-such kaiju.

Not sure where I'd go with it nowadays. Originally I was planning for it to be a series that took place over a span of years, with kids growing up, losing their links, and mentoring their replacements. Kaiju would be used semiregularly in this case, like tactical nukes.

Alternately, we could just set it in the modern day: kaiju are not used, except for one or two horrific occasions in the past, but research on bigger and badder kaiju continues. Over the course of the story there's an increase in international tension, and much of the latter part of the story is about kids being ordered to, essentially, carry out nuclear strikes, probably with mixed results.

And then maybe a post-apocalyptic follow-up, where depending on how much infrastructure is intact one of the biggest problems might be that there are still kaiju out there, whose kids need replacing as they age out, but it's getting harder and harder to perform the necessary procedures for new kids.
