That's a good premise that circumvents the biggest issue with YA protagonists, the "adults are useless" trope. Outside of "chosen one" stories, anything kids can do adults should be able to do better, which kind of ruins the point of making kids the heroes, which puts writers in an awkward place.

I think shows like Young Justice and Hunter x Hunter do the best job of dealing with this: the kids are strong, and they can sometimes deal with major threats, but their stories are usually just part of a wider narrative that allows them to be useful and compelling without being unreasonably powerful.
