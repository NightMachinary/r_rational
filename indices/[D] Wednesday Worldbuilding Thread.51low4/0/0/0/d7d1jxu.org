I think I created a similar situation as in the Young Wizards books, where adults are mostly relegated to an advisory role for the kids because they're just more powerful. Here though, the children have an entire support structure for their adventures, so there's plenty of room for worldbuilding now that the accepted fact have been established.

I wanted to write this since there's been a surge in the popularity of entertainment targeted toward children. There's something to be said for stories that are intellectually simple enough for kids to understand while being emotionally mature enough for adults to enjoy. I'm late to the party myself, but so far Young Justice has become one of my favorite tv shows.
