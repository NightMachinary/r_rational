If you want more of a fantasy flavor than sci-fi, replace the AI with a group of wizards who say the barriers between our universe and others are breaking down, so any aspiring evil overlord can make their way to Earth. In some ways this might work better to justify tropes related to the powers and villains, and also leaves openings for situations like creatures randomly falling in our world and the government trying to explore and establish ties with other worlds.
