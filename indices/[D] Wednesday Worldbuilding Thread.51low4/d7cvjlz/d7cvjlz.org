One common trope that has always been difficult to play straight in rational fiction is the child/teen hero. We always try to explore the horrifying implications of putting minors in a position that could, and by all rights should, be filled by an adult. However, there are a ton of great stories about young heroes fighting evil and I think we should be able to tell those if we want to. So, here is the world I've created to rationalize it.

An alien probe lands on Earth and is recovered by the government, only for the on-board AI to warn us of upcoming incursions by villainous extraterrestrials. The AI offers us Sufficiently Advanced Technology that grants people superpowers, but the neural interface can only be used safely and effectively by minors due to their neuroplasticity. If an adult tries to use it, even if they've used it as minor, they are guaranteed to develop psychological disorders.

I'm intentionally leaving the specifics of the setting vague so you can tell whatever story you want to. The minimum and maximum age for the interface should be up to you. The kids could be kept at a school to learn their powers, or allowed to remain at home until needed if the tech does most of the work for them. The program to give these children powers could be a secret, provide the kids with heroic personas, or be publicly known. I personally envision this as a sentai or magical girl story, but that's just me.
