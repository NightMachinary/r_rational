An idea that I played around in my head for the transformation was that magic could create a pocket dimension/astral world that keeps things in stasis. It was only accessible by magic to put matter/energy in and take it back out. A magical group could create one and then dump extra mass and energy into it to share.

If you changed into a cat the extra mass is dumped into the pocket dimension. Someone changing into a larger creature would pull that mass out to change themselves. If there was not enough available mass to change you couldn't do it.

Werewolves would use a ritual to put a wolf (or other animal) into a pocket dimension and than use that for their changes.

The big questions in this system come from reshaping mass, where does the mind go, and do you have matter to energy conversions? Or is everything put into the pocket world was converted to pure energy and then used as the desired energy/mass when pulled out it plays very differently than if the energy/matter keeps a type.

The most scientific/technically inclined method is the pocket dimension is not in stasis, it is just cut off. All of the matter and energy would interact while in storage. Dump enough stuff in and you could make a little pocket world. Dumping your body in a pocket and than large amounts of heat, would cook your body. Have one dimension where specific chemicals are dumped to under go a reaction. But that is not so useful for the turn into a cat magic.
