Denser mass/ pocket dimension is the general answer I've seen for # 2.

As for 1, nowadays, I would do one of those reverse mortgages, but one that goes until death ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html][Like this guy]]) on a bunch of houses. Back then? Maybe some high-stakes wagers regarding things that should kill you, but dont (if you mean that kind of immortal).
