  As for 1, nowadays, I would do one of those reverse mortgages, but one that goes until death (Like this guy) on a bunch of houses.

That would get too much unwanted attention towards your person though. At best, it would be articles like the one you linked to and science groups contacting you and requesting to participate in some tests and safe experiments. At worst, people would try to kidnap you (governments, dictators, rich sheikhs, etc) or kill you (people who suddenly found themselves to essentially be your contractually bound slaves, their families, etc).
