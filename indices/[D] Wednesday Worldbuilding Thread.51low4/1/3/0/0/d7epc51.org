Yeah any solution without mass conservation requires energy violation due to E^{2} = (Mc^{2} ))^{2} + (Pc)^{2} at least with regards to a four dimensional space time.

This requires the existence of other dimensions and break in symmetry via Noether's theorem. That has so many implications that it is kinda scary but I think the easiest approach would be to develop some new force(likely tied to the worlds magical system or whatever) that explicitly allows for energy violation similar to how the weak force is able to violate parity conservation.
