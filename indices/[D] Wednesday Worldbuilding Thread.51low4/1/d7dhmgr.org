Need some input for rationalising some common fantasy tropes, if anyone is feeling helpful:

- If you were immortal and had no other special powers, how would you make your money without holding an actual job or resorting to a life of crime? Selling antiques basically requires you to be a hoarder and, well, antiques haven't always been valuable, investments require a complicated series of fake IDs, etc. Let's say you were born circa 500 CE in Europe.

- Where does extra mass from a transformation come from / go to? e.g. if a witch transforms into a cat, or a werewolf transforms from human to wolf.
