I like the theory a way to make things a bit more interesting if you wanted to have some degree of speration iis to have say different dimensional frequencies (i.e. two mages depending on the spell could be pulling from two different pocket dimensions if you wanted to go to a high metaphysical level you could even have the world where the story takes place be left as an open question as to whether it itself is a pocket dimension for another high dimensionality.

At least that is what that would seem to imply to me if taking things to their inevitable outcome. It also accounts for summoning (i.e. taking a creature from another dimension according to whatever specifications were encoded into the spell.

The missing mass could also be exchanged with energy or free atoms if one wanted to be a "green" mage and try and avoid some of the worse philosophical implications (as one could literally steal from other dimensions) their could also be an interesting inherit risk with dimensional storage depending on where in that "pocket" dimension you store something. So many fascinating implications!

Definitely try and develop something out of this! You could technically still have frozen "space time magic but only if a spell formation was placed in the pocket dimension to provide that ad the objects were stashed in that formation... (which could in theory be externally broken to steal said items. Multi dimensional thieves/heists man
