With regards to transformations My rational has always been that mass is conserved and the transformation is required to handle density changes if a 70 Kg witch were to transform into a cat the cat would have to weigh the same amount(thus be far more dense than a cat ought to be with potential health risks). Moreover they would be a very risky endeavor limiting how many transformations a caster can have as they must develop a spell construct that guides everything into its new place. attempting to perform a poorly developed transformation (or over stressing the construct/organisms mass to size ratio) could lead to very horrible ends (i.e. heavily deformed bodies beyond both medical and magical hope of reversal ) Personally My ideas require polymorphic magic to be absurdly high level biomancy or magic of manipulating living creatures flesh bones blood and DNA (with a very slippery slope to necromancy decided usually by soul manipulation) as well as healing all coming from the same school of magic

By necessity given the schools conditions it would heavily affect the way healers viewed among the populace considering how easy a great doctor can turn to the darker side of the art...

Seriously why is no connection made between the various arts that all require a high level of understanding about a given organisms anatomy?
