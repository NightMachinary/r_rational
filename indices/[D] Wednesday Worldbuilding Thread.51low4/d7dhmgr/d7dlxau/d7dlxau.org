- Well, how would a normal person get money without a job or crime? The main thing that comes to mind is investing. I suppose a 1500-year-old immortal would have enough insite and education to game the stock market pretty effectively. Selling things would basically be the same thing, except the objective would be to game what resources would be valuable in 100 years vs. what companies will be valuable in 6 months.

- If you want to violate the conservation of mass (not necessarily a bad move imo) then it obviously doesn't matter. Otherwise, your solution is either to 1: put that mass somewhere else (hammer-space, alternate dimension, etc.) or 2: claim that the mass really does go nowhere, and the witch simply becomes an otherwise-normal 130 lb cat. I believe this is the same rule applied to X-Men's Mystique, though I'm not an expert.
