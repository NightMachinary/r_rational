No, they're just cynical. I don't think poor management is about sociopaths or limiting damage. Poor management is a failure to recognize that management is its own separate skill.

People are promoted because they have been at the company a long time, or because they have been responsible for positive change, or because they butter up the right people in charge. NONE OF THESE THINGS GUARANTEE MANAGEMENT SKILL.

In an attempt to attract people with management skill, management positions pay more than non-management positions... therefore people without management positions (who may even be excellent at their original jobs) try to get promoted to management in order to make more money. In a situation like that - not unusual one by any measure - management is (at best) well-informed, but lacking the people and organizational skills necessary to maintain quality teamwork. They get resented as terrible bosses.

Other companies separate their management track from their implementation track entirely and wind up with a bunch of excellent leaders and motivators with almost zero idea how their employees do their jobs. They get resented as clueless bosses.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but it's more enjoyable to rant about failures than to dissect successes. Confirmation bias and negativity bias run rampant.

Fun article, though.
