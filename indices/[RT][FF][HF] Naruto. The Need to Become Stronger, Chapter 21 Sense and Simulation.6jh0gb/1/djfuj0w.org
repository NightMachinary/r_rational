Faithful reader checking in!

Was just wondering if you were doing some sneaky foreshadowing with this, but is that telepathy thing Ao was doing something Naruto could/would learn later on (or soon?).

Cuz I was just reading through parts of the story again, and I started wondering if the fact that the Kyubi in this incarnation seems to be nine minds working in concert contributes to how 'flexible' Naruto's mind is, and the ease with which he uses shadow clones. And then I read this chapter and I realized that if Naruto found some way for him and his clones to communicate mind-to-mind, the parallels would get even stronger. Of course he couldn't be able to 'receive' from too many clones at once, as that would be way too over-powered, but even if he could, at best, receive from 8 other clones simultaneously, he could essentially start functioning as a baby-Kyubi on that battlefield, and that would be awesome.

Plus I think that clone-group-think would be an awesome way to mesh action scenes with thinking scenes without risking boring readers from cutting away from the fighting.
