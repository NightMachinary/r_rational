Hi! Cheers for the feedback. Yeah, act 2 was slow to start with - the problem I struggled with was that I Needed to build up the arc so the side-characters weren't 2-dimensional, but at the same time everyone had read the wave arc tons of times already so it made it feel less interesting/exciting to read I expect. Tricky situation.

Fortunately, the next chapter should be almost pure action - and there will be tons more this arc.
