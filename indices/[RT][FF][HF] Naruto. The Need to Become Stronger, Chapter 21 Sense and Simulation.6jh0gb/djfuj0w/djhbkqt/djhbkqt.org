  the fact that the Kyubi in this incarnation seems to be nine minds working in concert contributes to how 'flexible' Naruto's mind

I, ah, don't want to confirm or deny any fan theories, but I certainly don't think that one's ever confirmed as a fact. Are you sure you're not thinking of Yudkowsky's "9-brained fox" omake? Or confusing it with Velorien's story?

Instant communication does sound pretty powerful, but I'm not sure he really needs it: He can already create a kind of hive mind by creating clones and then dispelling them, as you saw with him getting instant feedback from Sakura while he was Haku. And of course he can take his time to think while his clones are fighting, so meshing action scenes with analysis works too.
