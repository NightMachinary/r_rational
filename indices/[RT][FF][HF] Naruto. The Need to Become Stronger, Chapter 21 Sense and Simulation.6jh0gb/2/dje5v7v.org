Hmm, it seems that my filler is less popular than the actual story. In a way that's reassuring: I would've hated for crack that takes a day to write to be preferred over the stuff that requires actual work. And really, this wouldn't be a proper Naruto story without some pointless filler that people skip past to get to the good stuff. :p

Looking at this chapter again, I have a vague sense that the beginning is too fast - like it needs more descriptions and less dialogue at the start to set the mood. Does anyone else get that impression, or am I just imagining things again?
