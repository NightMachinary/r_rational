SB is a place where munchkins and worldbuilding addicts gather, which made it a natural home for Worm fans. Once a platform reaches critical mass for fandom, it becomes very hard to move off it, since you want to be where the fans are to participate in the community. So Worm fans post their content on SB, which perpetuates the assumption that SB is the place for Worm fans. A loop is born.
