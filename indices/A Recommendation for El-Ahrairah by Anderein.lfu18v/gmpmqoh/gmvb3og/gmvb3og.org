Taylor is a psycho too, just not one with a career as distinguished as Jack's; Weaver 9 worked for a reason. Wildbow's writing hides it somewhat, because she doesn't see /herself/ as a psycho, but she terrifies everyone around her. So yes, they're comparing her to the scariest known monster that /definitely/ was born human (well, except Sleeper). Because she is /fucking scary/.

And the thing where she was permanently tarred as Jack Slash 2 was Jack's idea, and part of his price for not cheating in their endgame. She arranged the Vegas duel to prove she should scare villains everywhere; he decided part of his price for 'fighting fair' was to leave her marked as a continuation of his story, since he was all about narrative.
