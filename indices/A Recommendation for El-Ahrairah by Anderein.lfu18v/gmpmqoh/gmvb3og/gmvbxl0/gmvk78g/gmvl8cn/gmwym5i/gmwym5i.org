No, it's not a different type at all. People's reactions to Administrator are largely "I'm glad I'm not in her way", because she gives off the - accurate - vibe that if you /are/ in her way very bad things will happen to you. And no one is really sure that 'very bad things' will actually stay north of Jack Slash (probably not even her). She's terrifying, not because she has /Administration: Coordination, Control-Locked/, but because /she is the kind of person who would be given that/. She is psychologically a baby Catastrophe, and only Contessa's direct recruitment preserved the 'baby' part. And that is a trait canon Taylor shares: she gets a powerful shard because psychologically, she can be relied upon to wreak havoc with whatever power (super- or mundane) she has available.

Jack Slash is not the only other Catastrophe in the world. But in America, he's the one people know. (Most also know Nilbog, probably Sleeper, and maybe the Machine Army guy, though in that case not by name. But everyone knows Jack Slash.)
