FFF is great. Free and open source, and /highly/ configurable so if you're picky about ebooks like I am you can spend a bit of time and all future ebooks will be exactly what you want. Sites like fichub are fine enough if I want to download something from my phone, but I'll always prefer FFF.

Though I feel I should pont out that it's also available as a standalone program, ran from the command line. I've only used the Calibre version so I can't speak to the standalone version, but I have to imagine it's pretty much the same.
