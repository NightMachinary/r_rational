You're obviously very emotional that insulted a work you like got called cringe, at that point you're not arguing for debates sake.

There's no making up anything, its literal opinion and you're getting emotional someone doesn't share the same sentiment? You're butthurt and hostile, and you continue to be, you just weaken your argument when you show you can't even argue intelligently. But no , go on replying all upset, that's /very/ constructive. I think it's cringe, and now you're cringe too dude, stop getting mad over an internet strangers opinion lmao.

/Thread. Cry if you want, I'm good. You stay mad, good day sir. You lost the argument as soon as you didn't understand what opinion is, but keep responding all salty, I'm expecting it already lmao. I'm here if you want to debate like a sensible person about again, opinions.
