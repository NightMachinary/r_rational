Yeah that would be the case but that was not the tone taken in this fanfiction. They openly and forcibly (she hadn't done anything comparable to JS at that point in story) compare her to Jack Slash who commits so many known atrocities, some beyond what another human being could literally physically do to another. You take into account what Jack Slash means and all the really really bad stuff he's done against other heros and their family? Not to mention kids? It's as if I complimented someone for their ability to lead and said they're alot like Charles Manson or Hitler. It's ridiculous, unrealistic and cringey
