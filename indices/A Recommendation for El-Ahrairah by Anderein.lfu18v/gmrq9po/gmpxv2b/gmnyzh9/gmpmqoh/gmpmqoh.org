I was trying to get into but it was making me cringe how hard they were trying to make the protagonist into jack Slash v2. Like why would they all come to that conclusion? Feels so forced too

They even joked around calling her Jacqueline Cut as if this guy isn't a torturous psychopath killer that's probably killed and tortured everything from children to old people. Like what? Why would they even do that, that's like me attributing someone to Richard ramirez or Ted Bundy because they're charismatic. In universe it's a really bad decision for them to make, legit someone worse than Hitler
