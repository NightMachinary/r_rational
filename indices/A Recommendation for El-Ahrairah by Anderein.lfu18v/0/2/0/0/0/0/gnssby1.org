Not a native speaker! I was going to use "torture", then remembered an argument I had with a Christian who seemed to imply it was a big deal God was /tormenting/ people in hell and not /torturing/ which made it okay, so I thought it was a softer word and used it. But just now I googled and apparently they are synonyms ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
