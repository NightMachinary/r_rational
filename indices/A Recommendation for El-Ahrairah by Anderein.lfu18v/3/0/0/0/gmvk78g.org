Yes it was? Everyone was scared of Administrator, except Cauldron. She's powerful and utterly ruthless, and doesn't try to hide it. Even the /Triumvirate/ found her unnerving. The fear starts well before anyone makes the comparison. She scares /Glaistig Uaine/ a little, for hell's sake (and then more than a little, when she sends her Jack as a present, but that's neither here nor there).
