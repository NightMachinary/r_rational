Haha and you responded back ðŸ˜­ you already lost the argument, you just keep proving you're still mad by responding.

Anyways I'm done, your insults don't mean anything and neither did your hostile opinion. You were proven wrong and you got hostile, GG kid. I'm blocking you since I know that will irate you even more as you seek to redeem yourself for whatever reason. You're the only one throwing insults because you didn't have your opinion validated.

I'm afflicted with chronic and very painful genetic conditions, you're really gonna have to up your insults to hurt me lmao . Not to mention I'm mourning over someone I lost to a brain aneurysm recently . You immediately call me a coward and an asshole despite not knowing my personal situation. Sorry I got your so mad though buddy, sorry I don't have the energy to argue with someone I proved wrong and got angry about it. But no [[/u/Auroch-][u/Auroch-]] you're the ass. Keep insulting me though over an opinion on a cringey book scene.
