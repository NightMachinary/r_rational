I'd say it seems like the Lugals are making the best of a bad situation but they are also monarchist nobility who obviously don't give two shits about normal people. It seems a little different from historical nobility in that they are facing off against extinction level threats which makes their rule slightly more defensible, but still they obviously aren't following any value system or philosophy of government we'd consider valid. Ram seems to be set up to be a sort of peasant/upper-class revolutionary?
