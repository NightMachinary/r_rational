Yeah, it does get better. The character progression is a little more erratic than, say, a story by AW or EE, but that has more to do with this being the author's first major story than anything else. Also, some of it is because the main character starts out pretty much completely in the dark about what is going on, and with such a unique setting it leaves the readers in the dark for a long while as well

But it does improve. 9 arcs in and I'm still reading it when it comes out, so... yeah :)
