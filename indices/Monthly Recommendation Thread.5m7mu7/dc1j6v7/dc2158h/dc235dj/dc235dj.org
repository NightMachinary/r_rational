(spoilers)

If I can wax poetic for a moment, I feel like feminist superheroes like this just about always have a massive blinking /MISSING THE POINT/ sign over their heads, and this one is no exception. If a male superhero's power source was an abstract virtue, it'd be something like "justice" or "honor." What abstract virtue does Winged Justice draw power from? Feminism.

It's a recurring theme in so many female heroes. The writer sets out to create a female hero, and winds up creating a female-/themed/ hero, which isn't unlike the difference between a pirate and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney Land. It's horrifically ironic, since it's every bit the token-y, women do their own thing while men resolve the actual plot bullshit that these characters are supposed to be a protest against. If having Wonder Woman fighting Captain Chauvinism and opening a women's shelter isn't quite as bad as having her be the secretary for the Justice League, it's not much better, either. Because while Lady Woman of Womantopia III is stuck being a feminist mascot, she's neatly trapped in a box that prevents her from saving the world from anything other than male chauvinism, fighting for any agenda other than feminism, and otherwise prevented from helping to offset the incredibly male-dominated world of superheroism.

And the cycle continues.

I don't know, maybe there was a cunning subversion coming in Issue #8. There were certainly satirical elements, and the story seemed self-aware, but it still rubbed me the wrong way.
