Piggybacking on this to recommend [[http://www.readcomics.tv/astro-city/chapter-7][my favorite Astro City story arc]]. It's about a Wonder Woman-esque superheroine who runs a franchise of women's shelters dealing with an attack on her image as she questions herself and her role as an icon. It does an amazing job at exploring themes of feminism, power, abuse, adversity, and the questions we ask ourselves about the choices we make in our response to them.
