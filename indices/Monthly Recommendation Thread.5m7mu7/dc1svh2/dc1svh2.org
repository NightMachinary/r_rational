I don't think I've officially done so after finishing it, but here to recommend [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]] by wildbow to anyone who enjoys modern-supernatural / urban-fantasy stories. It has a very World of Darkness feel to it, particularly the demons and fae, which were particularly well done (I'm a huge fan of the fae in general).

I don't know if I enjoyed it more than Worm, but I love the genre and it was definitely an engrossing read, and it gave me an idea for a new story to boot, so thought I'd mention it. I'm waiting for Twig to be done before I start reading that, but I'm glad Worm wasn't a one-hit-wonder, since Wildbow is just a fantastic writer.
