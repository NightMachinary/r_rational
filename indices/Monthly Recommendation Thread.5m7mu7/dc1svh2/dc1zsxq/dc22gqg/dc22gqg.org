The tone of Worm is one where each success Taylor achieves is hard won. Sometimes they're undone trivially by people who don't care about her, but she still /wins/ sometimes. She makes progress, and the reader gets the feeling that if she just keeps moving forward she'll get there, that it'll be okay in the end.

Pact is relentlessly dark in comparison. For Blake, there was only Pyrrhic victory and loss. I almost never felt hopeless reading Worm. The setbacks she faced, no matter how large, seemed like something to be faced and overcome.

In Worm, the world sucks because making a good world is hard and their are powerful people who's goals don't correspond with a good world.

In Pact, the world sucks because it is /mathematically impossible/ for it not to. In the past it was maximally good, each new day is a new worst day ever, and the /universe literally hates you./
