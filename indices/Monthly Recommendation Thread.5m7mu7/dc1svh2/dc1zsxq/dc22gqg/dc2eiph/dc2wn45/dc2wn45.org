I know, right? Sure, I love engaging characters and good worldbuilding, but the main reason I read fiction is often escapism. I don't want to feel like it's all pointless and that there is no reason even trying. Reality gives me that feeling often enough, thank you very much.

I loved Pacts characters and world, even more so than Worm, but the feeling that Blake was trying to stem the rising tide with nothing but his bare hands weighed heavily on me at times.

I just want to feel like a semblance of a happy ending is still achievable, I guess.
