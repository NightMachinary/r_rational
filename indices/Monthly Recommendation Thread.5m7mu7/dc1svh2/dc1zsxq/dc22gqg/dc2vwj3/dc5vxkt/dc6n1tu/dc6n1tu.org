I quit after arc 14, but I've had future events and the mythology spoiled for me and it doesn't sound like I'd enjoy them. My issue with Worm was that I wanted it to be a dark superhero story, but after Leviathan it became more of a survival horror story that doesn't even horrify me.

I was already pushing my way through the arcs with the Slaughterhouse 9, so I'm not willing to push any further. The story had just become too unpleasant for me to continue and I haven't heard any reason to expect it to get any more enjoyable. I like cosmic horror, but not in a superhero story.
