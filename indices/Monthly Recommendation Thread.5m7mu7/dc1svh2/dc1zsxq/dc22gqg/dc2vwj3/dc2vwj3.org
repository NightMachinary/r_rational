Speaking as someone who found Worm too depressing to finish (though I loved it before Leviathan showed up), I actually think I'd like Pact. For some reason I really like Cosmic Horror, but have never enjoyed stories where the monster is just an asshole human. Maybe it's because I've been dealing with mental disorders my whole life so seeing the mere fact of my existence screw me over feels familiar and somewhat comfortable, while still being scary at a personal level.

When the threat is human, however, they frustrate me rather than frighten. I just want to see the suffering they inflict end as soon as possible, which might be one of the reasons I like superhero stories and why Worm disappointed me by the standards I have for that genre. It could be because I have depression, but there's just a point where I face so many setbacks that I give up. Taylor kept going long past that, so her unyielding determination started to come across as foolhardy rather than inspirational.
