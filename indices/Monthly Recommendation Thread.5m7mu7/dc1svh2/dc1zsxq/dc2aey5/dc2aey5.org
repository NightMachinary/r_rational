Agree with [[/u/Kylinger]]. I think Pact is far darker in the sense that the main character is beset by forces beyond his comprehension from the very beginning, and even as he gets stronger, he's constantly hanging on by the skin of his teeth, clawing his way up inch by bloody inch, against relentless forces that want to kill him or screw him over. Even his allies are almost all under suspicion and with potentially sinister motives.

Worm on the other hand, I didn't actually feel like was "grimdark" while reading it at all. No matter how bad things got, the main character was relentlessly focused on what to do next, on how she can overcome her problems and win. She was beacon of light in the darkness around her, and I knew she would never, ever give up, and her successes made it seem like she could really rise to the challenge. Her enemies become exponentially stronger as she improves, but she eventually makes real allies and friends that make things feel less hopeless.
