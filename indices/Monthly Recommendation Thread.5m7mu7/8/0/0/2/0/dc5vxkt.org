What arc did you stop at? Based on the little context you gave I think you would like the rest of Worm, and that you quit at the lowest point for you. Trying not to spoil much, but Taylor starts to feel the same frustration you are that human conflict is getting in the way of stopping S class threats, and acts on it directly later on in a way I found very satisfying.

It's an intended reaction that has a lot of payoffs later and and I think it just hit you a little too hard, and I think you'll REALLY like the ending arcs if you push through arcs 14-16.
