I've been reading Floating Point by Stephan Gagne which can be found at [[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint]]

I'm not sure if it meets all the criteria for rational fiction but it seams fairly rational to me.

It's a story about a civilization of emergent AIs in the computer of a space satelite, with parellels to internet culture. The main characters are programs, the descendants of apps, and it starts out with Spark and Tracer Winder trying to find the killer of their childhood teacher/mentor. Then it picks up from there.

It has just updated recently and is up to the third book in the trilogy. I like the justification for the programs resembling 21st century humans, especially why knives and weapons work the way they do in reality (they use the physics collision software to target the program's data in memory and kill/erase them.)

In short, It's story follows humanist principles more as it goes along and the characters seem rational while most of the story takes place in a computer simulation. I like it.
