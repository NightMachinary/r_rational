It does subvert it. Winged Victory's character arc is all about her examining herself and her actions, realizing what she's don't right and where she went wrong that allowed the attacks on her character to succeed. It's one of my favorite feminist stories because it's about pursing social justice without discriminating yourself. The story even explicitly addresses the token nature of her character and why she became one.
