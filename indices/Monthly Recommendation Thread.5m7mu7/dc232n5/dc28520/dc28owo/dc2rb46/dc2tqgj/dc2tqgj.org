Not for me. I found that film incredibly boring and didn't care about the characters at all. I don't understand why people like it, especially since the plot basically accomplishes nothing. I mean, I guess you could say the same thing about Totoro or Spirited Away, but those films have buckets of charm and at least gave you something cool to look at.
