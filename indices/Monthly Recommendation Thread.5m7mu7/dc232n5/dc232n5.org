[[http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Bakemono-no-Ko-Dub][The Boy and The Beast]] is a anime film released last year that I'm proud to count as one of the few movies I've loved after watching. It comes from the same director who gave us Summer Wars and Wolf Children, and has similarly amazing animation. It's about a boy who runs away from home and arrives in a world of anthropomorphic animals where he becomes an apprentice to a swordsman/martial artist with an extremely rough personality and demeanor that nobody likes.

It sounds straightforward, and it is, but I normally don't enjoy stories like these. Something about these two and their relationship made me fall in love with them despite the fact that I normally write characters like them off as assholes who refuse to communicate properly. Here, though, it somehow really works and seeing them learn and grow together over the course of the movie was a joy to behold. Even the conflict that drives them apart later in the film feels completely natural as does how they resolve it. The plot doesn't break any new ground, but even though I knew exactly what was going to happen next I still wanted to see it and loved what I saw.

Even the genuine flaws the film has don't bother me in the least. The threat in the climax isn't properly built up (and even then I saw the reveal coming from miles away) and the final act has pacing issues, but I didn't even notice and still don't care. There's a female character who is arguably shoehorned into the story halfway through, but I really liked her even though she didn't do that much. The few supernatural elements of the world aren't well explained, but they worked so well as emotional metaphors that I didn't mind.

Also, I'm talking about the dubbed version. The voice acting is fantastic and perfectly fits the characters and scenes. This is Ghibli-level production values, with beautiful colors and expressive characters. There's even an interesting twist in the story I haven't seen in any other of this type that won't spoil, though will undoubtedly appeal to fans of rational fiction. Even if you don't like the movie as much as I did, it's well worth your time to watch and your children's too. If I haven't persuaded you, watch [[https://youtu.be/_DEH6vuJ7FM][this 5-min review that sold me on it.]]
