That makes sense. I guess I just got a subjective impression of slowness and not enough time thinking about how to make more nano-forges or power generators relative to other things (especially after she built a new holding tank). When Uber joined, she should have had him get on building a new holding tank right away, since that's a non-nano part.

  As for tinkerfic recommendations, it's possible that Foundations will take a turn into that general category, though the author seems to keep their fics relatively short. Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything major outside of ACP and PWL.

Thanks, I'll check Foundations out.
