I guess it just seems weird to me that she could make extremely powerful stuff like the sonic gun and bulletproof shield early on, but months later (when she's running the shelter and so forth), she still has to loan out her old non-thrusting hover pack, and most of her inner circle doesn't have their own shields. The exponential growth factor doesn't seem to come into play, it seems more like a linear progression, at least in the parts of the fic that I've read so far (2/3 or so).

It is a good touch the way she used non-nano stuff as much as possible for things like the holding tank. But since she has such a nano-paste bottleneck, early on in the game she should be making new nano-forges until her power consumption is close to maxed, or building more power generators until the nano-forges are producing at the max rate, unless the holding tank is already full most of the time in which case she needs to cobble together a better one (which would be the first thing to do when Uber joins).
