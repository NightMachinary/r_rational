The actual answer is more simple than this: even if she had put /everything/ into upgrading her production, in the end it would have only made a very small difference in how fast her production rate ramps up.

You can see this in-story with numbers she quotes from time to time (production rate vs cost of her weapons/armor vs cost of more power/forges), and a few author's notes where he's explicitly used the in-story numbers to show this. In general, the equipment she makes is so much lighter than the cost of upgrading her production that it only makes a small dent in her ramp-up speed, and she /still/ is quite sparing in how she uses her nano-paste. Her equipment seems like very reasonable decisions to me.
