A very interesting part of the nature of Nuzlocke comics are that they're always based on a real playthrough of the author (at least, I haven't encountered a Nuzlocke that /wasn't/). Because of this, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie][Anyone Can Die]] is in full effect, as the author's successes and failures in the game can kill off even the most important or beloved of teammates from something as trivial as a random trainer who got a critical hit or had an unexpected super effective attack.

This is a blessing and a curse, though, since while the way no Pokemon is safe provides real tension and uncertainty in the fates of the characters, many authors write their stories as they play through their game, stopping after a major event to write an update covering that event. As a result, these deaths can often feel abrupt and unsatisfying. If your starter died to an unlucky crit in the middle of a route, and your last update described the route as peaceful and idyllic, it'd be really hard to give your starter the death scene it deserves without it feeling forced.

Were I of the mind and talent to make a comic of the Platinum Nuzlocke I once did, it would do my story a world of good to know that the lowly Gastrodon I caught would last to the end of the game, as well as be the only reason I even survived a devastating boss fight that killed most of the rest of my team, since I could give it a proper underdog storyline. At the same time, if I knew that Candice fight was going to be so devastating, I could make the updates before the fight build up to the fight appropriately, whether by wearing the team down or by raising them up to contrast the fall. If I knew my Sneasel was going to die in the very same room I'd find the item that'd let it evolve, I could fit in a scene about that evolution item and its importance to a Sneasel, or some other such scene as the context would permit.

This challenge in writing is something you'll see many Nuzlocke authors grapple, since the deaths are as shocking and abrupt to them as they are to you. They can even spend the majority of their journey building up a great plot only for a pivotal character to die, leaving the author to make that death fit into the plot and make the plot to continue anew. In spite of that challenge, though, and often because of it, the stories can carry that element of tension and uncertainty all the better.
