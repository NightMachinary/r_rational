I've been reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.3604/][A Cloudy Path]], which is a Worm fic based on a kind of similar premise to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/playing-with-legos-worm-supcom.377328/][Playing with Legos]] which has been recommended here before, where Taylor is given Tinker powers based on one of the factions in Supreme Commander.

I haven't actually played Supreme Commander, but it was interesting to see the different directions they took based on the same concept. In ACP, the protagonist uses something called nano-paste, which seems to be their main bottleneck for production. I'm not sure I'd call it rational, since she seems to spend her paste on stuff other than power generators and better nano-forges way too much, given how much she complains about not having enough.

I'm also not sure I like ACP quite as much as PWL, since it is slower paced and has more angst, but I did enjoy some of the development of various side characters such as Uber and Theo. It is a WIP and I am only a bit over halfway through so far. Anyway, I though people here would probably enjoy it.

Anyone have other wormfic recommendations, especially ones about tinkers bootstrapping their way to power with self replicating machinery?
