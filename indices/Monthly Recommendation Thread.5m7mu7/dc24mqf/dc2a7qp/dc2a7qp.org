  I'm not sure I'd call it rational, since she seems to spend her paste on stuff other than power generators and better nano-forges way too much, given how much she complains about not having enough.

The author's addressed this several times in the thread. I don't have time to find the actual post right now, but I remember him likening it to the actual game, where if you spent all your production time on getting better production equipment, you'd be killed by the very first wave of enemies.

That probably wasn't the entirety of his reasoning, but I remember finding it convincing at the time.

As for tinkerfic recommendations, it's /possible/ that [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/foundations-worm.474787/][Foundations]] will take a turn into that general category, though the author seems to keep their fics relatively short. Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything major outside of ACP and PWL.
