#+begin_quote
  The Golden Age is 10,000 years in the future in our solar system, an interplanetary utopian society filled with immortal humans.

  Phaethon (...) meets an old man who accuses him of being an imposter, and then a being from Neptune who claims to be an old friend. The Neptunian tells him that essential parts of his memory were removed and stored by the very government that Phaethon believes to be wholly honorable. It shakes his faith. Is he indeed an exile from himself?

This series starts slow - I think it took me three or four attempts to get through the first third of the first book. But once it picks up, it really goes - I've finished book 2 in half a day, and book 3 is only set aside because of work pressure.

The futuristic world is fairly well presented and consistent. While the series has a couple really weak chapters [[#s][minor spoiler]], they're spread around enough that they're tolerable. Other than such 'filler', the characters are both novel and believable, the plot points intriguing, and the setting interesting.

Again, if you try, don't give up at least until the actual mystery begins. The action is really slow at the very beginning, but if you slog through that (or if you're really into happy utopia descriptions), you'll find gold.

ETA: So, halfway through book 3 I kinda gave up. It gets /very/ ayn rand in space. Disappointing. First two books are still a good read, if you can stomach unfinished stories :P
