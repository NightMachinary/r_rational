So I have a bunch of pokemon nuzlocke comics. Among the best is definitely [[http://wasserbienchen.deviantart.com/art/IBAW-1-New-Beginnings-242570288][In Black and White]]. Another really good one is [[http://itsahardlife.smackjeeves.com/comics/2357688/chapter-12-page-68/][It's a Hard Life]]

For those not familiar, a nuzlock run is a playthrough where pokemon die instead of faint, and you can only catch one pokemon per route. What makes these two comics special is that they diverge significantly from the game storylines; they definitely take inspiration at some point, but they're functionally independent.

Unfortunately, I can't really give elevator pitches for fear of spoilers, but suffice to say, if you ever found yourself wishing pokemon was aimed towards the YA to late twenties population, you'll love these comics.
