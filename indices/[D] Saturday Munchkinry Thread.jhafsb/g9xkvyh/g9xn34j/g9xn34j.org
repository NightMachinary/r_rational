Any story where the parents of the protagonist are unknown and a major plot point would be significantly altered. Meet the Robinsons comes to mind, since the main character finding out the identity of his mother is his big motivation. Star Wars would have gone differently if Luke knew from the start that his father was responsible for overthrowing the Republic, that he had a sister named Leia, and who Obi Wan was. Harry Potter would have obviously been /very/ different.

The identity of the father could still be unknown, especially if the father isn't brought up in conversation around the baby, but unless the mother and those around her knew that this baby would remember everything, there would in general be no reason to avoid that particular topic.
