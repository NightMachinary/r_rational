  Listing an extremely rare animal might work, but it's hard to say, since there haven't been billion dollar budgets put to finding them. Giant squid come to mind for that, since we know they exist, but I don't think one has ever been captured alive, and there are very few sightings of them at all.

Giant squid seem close to ideal, because in addition to the difficulty in finding something that is absurdly rare in an enormous search area, there's the problem of actually capturing and moving such a large and dangerous animal. After looking it up, giant squid have been captured, but it seems like they're captured by accident in fishing nets rather than a specific search for them. There are only a handful of videos of adults in their natural habitat.
