Avoiding modern politics for now... There are any number of heads of state that you could list if the president doesn't fit the bill of people who would be extremely difficult to abduct or bribe. Or just other really rich people: listing Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos as the 'animal' you have to be killed by would give some pretty big problems for this eccentric billionaire.

Going more into the spirit of the question: there are various microscopic animal species that would be rather difficult to kill a human with, even if directly implanted into someone. Endangered or otherwise protected species would be rather difficult to acquire, but probably within the scope of a billion dollar budget. If the animal has to be living, you could list various extremeophiles that would present pretty serious problems in transporting to the surface (animals that live at the bottom of ocean trenches, for example). Listing an extremely rare animal might work, but it's hard to say, since there haven't been billion dollar budgets put to finding them. Giant squid come to mind for that, since we know they exist, but I don't think one has ever been captured alive, and there are very few sightings of them at all. Lastly, if the animal has to be alive, you could list some specific animal that will die before the billionaire could feasibly transport it to his island, contingent on you knowing of that animal in advance.
