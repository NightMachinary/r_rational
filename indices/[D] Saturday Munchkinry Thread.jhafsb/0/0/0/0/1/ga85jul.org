If a single microscopic animal won't work there isn't anything to say he can't just use a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand.

Even if they are tiny, a good chunk of them say, injected directly into your brain fluid should kill you dead just fine.

We also know pretty clearly the animal doesn't have to be living (as it lists killing you with its corpse), so he doesn't have to even try to capture one alive.

Which incidentally opens up another path for him to take for super rare animals: He can just grab the corpse of one already dead in a museum somewhere (and yes, they totally have giant squid corpses at a museum) and use /it/ to kill you. I will admit it is very much against the spirit of the question, but there isn't anything that says he can't take that path anyways.
