My first thought is one of those lobsters where it has a different rare coloration mutation on each half of the body, like albino/blue, except instead of picking a lobster pick some much rarer crustacean (I assume this is a general crustacean thing, not a lobster thing), with a long enough lifecycle that he can't just start breeding them. First thought there is a coconut crab, though I'm wary of that particular choice in the off chance that he does find one with the right coloration. Doesn't seem like a good way to die.
