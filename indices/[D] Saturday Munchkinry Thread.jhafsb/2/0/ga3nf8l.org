Do I have to spend it now? I'm also assuming property is out of the question unless it's just for fun.

A trip to the ISS will apparently cost tens of millions, so unfortunately that's out of the question.

State-of-the-art VR and VR peripherals could probably use at least $10k and I definitely want that. Probably $20k for a high end computers, software, peripherals, and games. A few thousand on books and movies too I guess. I'd rather wait a few years for better VR, but if I gotta spend it now it's fine.

I don't know much about making movies or musicals, but apparently the budget for ranges from several million to tens of millions (with some movies in the hundreds). So maybe feasible to fund an indie or short film, but that'd take up a significant portion of my funds and not have that high of a fun return.

I could probably spend $300k commissioning a game, and $100k commissioning a ton of mods for games that I already play. Hope making those public doesn't count as improving the world too much.

I'd definitely commission some art, not really sure what at the moment but I think I could manage to spend $100k that way. Some nice big landscape paintings for sure.

I've never been on a cruise but apparently a 2021 cruise is 40k per person for 3 months so maybe I'd spend a few months on a cruise with some friends, roughly 160k. I'd definitely try to book for 2022 though, try and be fully done with corona.

Apparently a personal chef is only like $25k a year for a family of 4 if they cook for you every week, so I could get that down to $15k-$20k and have a personal chef for the next 15 to 20 years with my remaining $300k. Gluttony and laziness counts as fun, right?

I'm not sure how else to spend the remaining money if I can't get a personal chef. Is gambling allowed? It's definitely the fastest way to spend money. Oh, and now that I clicked your link I would definitely buy some replica fossils, could spend like $100k on that.

Edit: just realized you probably meant entertaining for other people or an entertaining idea... in that case either a video game or a very big and whimsical Rube Goldberg machine respectively
