My immediate thought is a dust mite recovered from, like, a Pakistani CIA blacksite. The only thing I can figure which might be possible to do with one dust mite, assuming he could collect one from the blacksite at all, is somehow transform its body into some hyperpotent toxin, but doing that without introducing a significant fraction of contamination and "cheating" might not be possible with current technology.

If we find out the recent discovery of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere was caused by life, I would demand to be killed by any living thing from Venus. It wouldn't be possible for him to recover that in under a year.
