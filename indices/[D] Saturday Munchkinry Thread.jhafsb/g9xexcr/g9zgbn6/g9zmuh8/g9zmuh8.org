  does the billionaire have to PROVE that he has acquired the correct target?
#+end_quote

He's doing all this for sport. If you asked for the criminal behind unsolved case x he might accept that, though if he pours $5 million into solving a case and discovers to his own satisfaction that the criminal has died, he's going to come back and say good try, now pick something I can immediately confirm is still alive. He has integrity in that he will play 'fair' with you, but he doesn't feel obliged to prove things to /your/ satisfaction.

  I started googling people on nuclear submarines, because they would be damn hard for the billionaire to find and kidnap.
#+end_quote

He would accept that, if you could name someone. It wouldn't be easy for him to find their submarine and get them to the island, but it's something he could realistically try to achieve within a year.

  in January 2019, we could have chosen a fruit fly egg on the Chang'e 4's lunar lander.

This /would/ indeed have been an excellent pick. Double A+ on obscure knowledge gathering for that one.
