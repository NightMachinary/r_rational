A bored and reclusive billionaire has had you kidnapped and taken to his island. He informs you that you are to be killed. However, you are allowed to choose an animal. Either a species or a specific individual animal, but it has to be alive. He will kill you using this animal. Until he can get his hands on it you are allowed to live a life of luxury on the island, although you will not be able to leave or contact anyone. He will use his wealth to acquire the animal, but where possible will seek to play as important a part as possible in finding and acquiring it. For example, if you choose death by giraffe, he might get into a helicopter himself and scour the Savannah to find one, sedate it personally, etc.

If you choose an animal that could not normally kill a human he will get creative. He might just freeze it and beat you to death with its corpsicle, or he might have its corpse surgically implanted into your chest to rot.

If he cannot get his hands on it within a year, he will release you and give you a billion dollars.

What animal do you choose?
