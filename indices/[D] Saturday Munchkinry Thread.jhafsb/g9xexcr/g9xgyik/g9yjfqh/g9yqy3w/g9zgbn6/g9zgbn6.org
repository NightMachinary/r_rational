  he might have its corpse surgically implanted into your chest to rot.

This seems pretty strong? Whatever the animal is, as long as he can acquire it, he can just plant it in your brain and you are dead. Mostly because of the brain surgery, but technically still because of the animal.

So our best hope is to pick an animal that he can't acquire.

*Begins googling current animals in space and how hard it would be to bring them back to Earth.*

Gah, the requirements are so strict! If it just had to be a living thing, then we could choose a (bacterial) spore on the Voyager 1 (there almost certainly are some spores on it, and spores are quite durable so they could still be alive). If this question was in January 2019, we could have chosen a fruit fly egg on the Chang'e 4's lunar lander. Good luck getting that thing back from the far side of the Moon, but now its already dead.

And sadly, all astronauts are currently on earth or will almost certainly return from space in under a year, so we can't choose them either because they could be abducted on return and have their corpses beat you to death.

Edit: I started googling people on nuclear submarines, because they would be damn hard for the billionaire to find and kidnap. But I think this is going to put me on a list if I keep going >_>.

Edit2: Just thought of a different angle of attack: does the billionaire have to PROVE that he has acquired the correct target? So, can I pick the murderer of an unsolved murder case, and then the billionaire has to solve the case in order to get the murderer to kill me? Or do I have to prove that the target is currently alive first? Hmm...
