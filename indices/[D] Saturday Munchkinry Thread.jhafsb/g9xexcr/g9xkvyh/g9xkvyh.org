What story plots can you break or subvert by giving a main character the ability to retain their memories from when they were a baby/infant/toddler? Clear, well formed and organized memories from the moment of birth through childhood. To make it even easier, they instinctively avoid talking about their memories of being a baby when they first learn to talk.

Inspired by a main character from The Promised Neverland. I recently binged it on Netflix.
