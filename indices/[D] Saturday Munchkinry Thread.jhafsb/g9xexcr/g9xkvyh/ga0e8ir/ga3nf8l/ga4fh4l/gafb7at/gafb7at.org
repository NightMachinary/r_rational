Assuming Brewster's Millions rules, I'd just travel around the world staying at 5-star hotels, renting out museums for private tours, and eating & drinking copiously at the most expensive restaurants I could find. A bottle of Yamazaki 35 goes for about $140k, so even if I have a time limit of a month or whatever I could burn through a mill pretty quick.

If I'm allowed to keep stuff I buy so long as I don't make money off it, I'd probably spend a few hundred thousand on rare books + a climate-controlled reading room.
