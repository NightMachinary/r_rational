I think this refers to the fact that the frames are a movie. The creatures depicted are five dimensional, but like our own films represent three-dimensional life in two dimensions, these images are similarly limited. Not understanding this, overestimating the complexity of what is being communicated, Earth's theorists have interpreted the lost data in the "depth" dimensions of the resulting data as a physics asymmetry.
