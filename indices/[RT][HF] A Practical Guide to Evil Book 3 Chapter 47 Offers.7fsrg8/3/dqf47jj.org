If I'm understanding Still Water correctly, the citizens of Liesse are not yet dead, right? More like they're just a ritual away from becoming undead?

I'm really not sure what Cat can bring to bear here so far as "hard measures" go. She's got a ravaged army, warp portals through Arcadia, the power equivalent of a Fae Prince, four Named (besides herself), and... that's it. She's going up against a force with a flying city, a bunch of mages, a Named, a potential 100k strong undead horde, and an as-of-yet-unnamed WMD.

What could she do to help level the playing field?

1. Portal or fly (on Zombie 3.0) Thief to Liesse to have her Yoink! something shiny. Targets could include Diabolist's multi-dimensional scrying artifact, captive members of the Watch, the WMD (if it's an item), or part of the Still Water ritual (if it has physical components).

2. Kill Akua's dad. Removes a very powerful mage, and will wreak havoc on her emotional state. Maybe. Problems abound with this - he's safe in the city, he's a powerful caster, etc. No idea how this would happen unless Thief could Yoink! him too.

3. Figure out some way to kill the fae royalty that Akua has captured and powering her wards. Maybe that involves negotiating with the King and Queen? IIRC, that captive is powering Liesse's flight. At least taking the city down will help level the playing field.

4. Maybe Pickler's got some good siege schematics for downing a flying target. Mortars loaded with goblinfire?

5. It's a good time for Hierophant to make a miracle...

6. If Cat can get to Liesse, she could potentially use Break or Fall on the city to take it down.

Forces that likely can't be used:

- Malicia can provide advice, but no real support... unless she's fine with Cat using portals to bring more Legions from Praes to Callow. Huh. Maybe that WILL work.

- The Calamities are out of action for the time being - last we saw them, Black is seriously hurt, Captain is possibly dead, Warlock is exhausted, and Ranger was doing her own thing in Arcadia. Assassin is... MIA? I think? So the odds of them sweeping in is slim.

- Reinforcements from other cities in Callow are possible (especially with Arcadia portals), but they're less trained than the Legions and hate Praes. Even with Cat to act as a figurehead, I don't see additional Callowans being added to her ranks.

- Getting help from a Good aligned nation is pretty much impossible, as Still Water alone would launch a crusade. This needs to be taken care of in-house.

From where I'm sitting, grounding the flying city is probably the only way to even the playing field a bit. And by grounding I mean "knock it out of the sky." It removes a huge tactical advantage, will likely reduce Diabolist's forces (and that includes the almost-undead army), and lets Cat's forces choose the battlefield. But I have no idea how they'll do that.

Thoughts?
