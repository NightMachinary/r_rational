Cat uses *Fall* - it's super effective!

Names are huge power modifiers. Adjutant could potentially use *Find* to locate the flying fortress and even though we know *Fall* doesn't literally make things drop to the ground, aspects do develop according to the needs of the story.

In addition, Cat has Hierophant. If she wants the city to fall, it will fall. The question is - is she willing to kill a hundred thousand people in the process? And if she is, who's to say their deaths won't be used in some elaborate ritual concocted by the Diabolist? It's one thing to start a war, it's another thing altogether to be directly responsible for so much death.

I agree with most of your points however I think we're seeing a transition in power within the Empire and Malicia will heavily push for Cat to take charge of the rest of the Legions rather than being hands off. Cat is basically Black's replacement so it makes sense to promote her as much as possible. She will be the "muscle" of the Empire, so to speak. Besides, the Diabolist is Malicia's direct political enemy and a rallying banner for all the nobility. It's in her best interest to remove her as quickly as she can.
