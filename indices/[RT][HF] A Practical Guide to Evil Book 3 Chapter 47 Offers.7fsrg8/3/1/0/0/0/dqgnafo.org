Sure, I think it's entirely possible she might make that decision as a "lesser evil" thing. Personally murdering a city's worth of her own people for a tactical advantage, on the grounds that they're fucked anyway, would be a pretty dramatic character moment--a culmination of her slide toward rationalizing increasingly terrible acts, the kind of thing that might either shock her out of the path she's on or solidify her commitment to it. But that would probably be a last resort. I expect her to at least try to find a way to save them.
