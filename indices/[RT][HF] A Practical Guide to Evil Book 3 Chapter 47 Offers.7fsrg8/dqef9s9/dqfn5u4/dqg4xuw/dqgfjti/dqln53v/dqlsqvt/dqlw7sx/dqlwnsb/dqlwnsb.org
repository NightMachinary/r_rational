They aren't out of the woods yet. The state fracturing back into status quo is still very likely. Arcadia hijinks or not, if the key people (the Empress, Catherine and Black) fail and/or die the rest will almost certainly come crashing down. Akua intends to dethrone the Empress and neutralize Catherine, and Black is nearing the end of his story anyway. Praes and Callow need more time and pressure to truly unify in a more permanent manner.
