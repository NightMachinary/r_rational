Good point.

But then, I think Akua is forgetting that you do not die at the end of one's terrible â€˜journey.'

You only ever die in the now. When Catherine decides to punish you for your crimes, you will regret it in the now. You will feel incredible agony in the now. Your great accomplishments will be paling in the irrelevance of the last week as Cat flays you and turns your world into nothing but pain.

She has looked Contrition in the eye unflinchingly. She knows about inflicting it on others.
