Akua, you do not understand what drives the Carrion Lord and Malicia. You could not pass the ideological turing test.

You live in a story, up to and including the belief that there is any version of this that does not end with Catherine Foundling's hands around your throat.

Because Cat /knows/ this is a story, and she /knows/ how stories go. Good guys win, bad guys lose. And when it comes down to it, you, Akua, is not the good guy by any stretch of the imagination.
