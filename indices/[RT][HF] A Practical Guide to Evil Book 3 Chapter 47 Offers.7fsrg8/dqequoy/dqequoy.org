I wonder if it's going to be explained at some point /why/ Cat is the last scion of Winter and the Seasons!Fae in general.

Did Akua's bindings keep the other Princess/Prince of Summer in captivity through the Queen's call(maybe in a pocket dimension)? Thus there must be balance of a conveniently Prince strength as noted in this chapter?

Or is simply that the King of Winter granted Cat free will by restoring her heart and releasing her from vassalage /before/ the transformation of the Fae was complete.
