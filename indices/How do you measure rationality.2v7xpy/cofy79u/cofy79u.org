As pointed out, there isn't really something analogous to IQ. As it stands, any measure of rationality is going to be /domain specific/. You can see that in your examples. Being good at losing weight doesn't mean being good at playing chess and vice versa.

Instrumental rationality translates roughly to: results/resources, but measuring resources is almost impossible in most environments. I don't even think the people at CFAR (who are likely interested in questions like this) know how to even begin doing this.

Being able to measure cross-domain rationality is very, very hard. My current heuristic is: "How would this person fare as a witch on the discworld."
