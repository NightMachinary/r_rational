  Is a lottery winner a rationalist?
#+end_quote

Having money doesn't just somehow make you rational. That is absurd, and was nowhere implied.

However, using money (s/money/resources) to effectively achieve your goals /is/ an indicator of rational behavior. By proxy, using your time to effectively gain more resources and thus more optimization power, is /also/ an indicator of rational behavior.
