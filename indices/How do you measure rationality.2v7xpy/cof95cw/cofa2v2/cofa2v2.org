"Wouldn't that be biased in any number of ways? I mean, I read Scott Alexander's piece on weight loss not so long ago and it seems very plausible that weight loss could be differently difficult for different people; and furthermore, a number of people will have obvious low-hanging fruit to change in their behaviours, while others have already hit those low-hanging fruit. Further, your suggestion about having the difference in weight targets be the instrumental rationality score seems highly dubious, as I feel that people who get a lot accomplished that is meaningful to them in the rest of their lives and maintain within 5 lbs their desired weight are probably much better instrumental rationalists than someone who spends any sort of time and effort to obsessively track every gram of food and second of work exercised to the detriment of other actually important life goals to come within an ounce of their target weight in order to win at the 'instrumental rationality scoring game' for status-signaling reasons among the tiny population of people who think about this sort of thing."

So in other words instrumental rationality cannot be approximated by how well someone does in reaching any individual goal, but how well they do on all of their main goals overall? Maybe multiply that by the total difficulty of reaching all their main goals. And since difficulty is also very difficult to measure... Wow I see your point.
