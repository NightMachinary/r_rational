If someone is participating in an instrumental rationality contest and their course of action is 'tell my personal assistant to spend a couple millions of my multibillion-dollar inheritance that I was born into to hire the top 20 people whatever field of endeavour is under consideration to solve the problem optimally for me,' while other people being compared to them are limited to courses of action like "think about it and solve the problem myself in some way using only the far more resources I managed to accumulate and can afford to part with myself"... at that point, I am not seeing how whatever we're scoring would even tangentially look like what most people describe as 'instrumental rationality'.
