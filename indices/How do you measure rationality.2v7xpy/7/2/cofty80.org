I actually dislike the focus on money as a measure of rationality a lot. Sure, money might be a proxy for "winning" in certain aspects, but not in all situations. Money can do a lot and having lots of money is a pretty good deal, but not all goals align nicely with making a lot of money.

I also dislike it because it makes poor people feel bad about being poor, while being poor is very hard to get out of in the first place.
