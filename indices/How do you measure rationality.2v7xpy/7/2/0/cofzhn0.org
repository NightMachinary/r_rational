This smells like rationalization.

Also, I am not suggesting a metric by which to judge a global Person.Rationality statistic. I'm merely stating the obvious; that you would expect to observe someone behaving rationally to be effectively using their resources to steer towards their goals.

The contrapositive of that is "if you aren't effectively using your resources to steer towards your goals, you aren't being rational enough."
