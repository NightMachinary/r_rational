Humans aren't perfect rational beings. Even beisutsukai will make mistakes and have (some) irrational habits. There isn't a human capable of always using their resources to always steer towards their goals. Especially since, like human value, human goals are complex and sometimes weirdly contradictory.

Anyway, the reasons I dislike money as a measure of rationality:

- Money isn't the end-all of value.
- There are a bunch of things outside of the individual's control that strongly influence the ability to make money.
- People deserve to be happy. Jobs that maximize money aren't fun for everyone (which is actually a combination of the previous points, come to think of it).
- It makes poor aspiring rationalists feel bad about themselves.
- It's a bad way to measure optimization power: results/resources, because it only measures results.

I'm not saying money isn't important. I'm saying it's a very flawed way of measuring a "rationality quotient."
