I'm not espousing spending literally all your time maximizing your income. That is absurd; of course your time is also a resource.

On the other hand, I find it dubious at best (priors and all that) that you are using your time so effectively that any additional effort put towards increasing your income would only marginally or not at all increase your optimization power, which is what it sounds like you are trying to say.
