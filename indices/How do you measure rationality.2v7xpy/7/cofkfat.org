Money (or in general any resource with sufficient liquidity) is pretty much a universal instrumental goal. Having more of it means you can get more of the thing you actually want. Or you can give it to someone or some other organization that can more effectively use it to get what you want.

A supposed rationalist who doesn't try to get as much money as they can flowing towards satisfying their terminal goals isn't really trying all that hard to win.
