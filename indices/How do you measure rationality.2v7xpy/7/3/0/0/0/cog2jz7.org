Yes, we are in agreement.

On the hypothetical, I'm not sure if I'm parsing that right. If they share the same goals, one of the two people are definitely acting less rationally.

Assuming they have disparate goals, the one who decides not to profit from the patent is acting consistently with their goals if and only if they believe they can more effectively achieve those goals through idealized action (signaling some sort of virtue) than with money, or if the benefit to the public would outweigh what they could achieve with money, or something along those lines. Of course, the opposite is true for the one deciding to profit.

That said, my prior for choosing-not-to-profit-is-actually-goal-maximizing-behavior is very low, for a wide range of goal sets.
