It's an indicator, but not the be all and end all. hat sentence was somewhat flippant, but is intended to demonstrate that being rich does not demonstrate necessarily that someone has "earned" their wealth. Many inherit or win their wealth by good fortune. Also if I find two very smart people, one who has decided to not patent their amazing invention and thus now lives modestly, and one who did patent their amazing invention, and is incredibly rich, I don't think I'd necessarily assume that the latter is more rational than the former. This assumes that they share the same goals and desires.
