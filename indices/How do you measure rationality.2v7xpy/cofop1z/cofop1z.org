Human rationality isn't a thing, it's a description of a whole bunch of unrelated traits and skills grouped by having roughly the same uses. However, true rationality is exactly one thing - an optimal optimization process.

Those two thoughts are reconcilable if you instead view rationality as normal, and try to measure irrationality.

Irrationality is also not one thing - there are infinite reasons you could be wrong. Certain ones of those are particularly common among humans though - you can and people do study cognitive biases. Those, individually, can be measured.

With a suite of individually measured biases, we could go through and measure them by their impact on some common heuristic to create a total irrationality metric (average wealth delta compared to parents or something). Since at this point we'd be measuring well-defined traits instead of people, the terrible noise in irrationality vs life outcomes would be easier to cope with (but any better metric to calibrate with would certainly be welcome). Once there's a total, we can call the inverse "rationality" if that's desirable.

If that sounds like a lot of work, it's because it is. "Measure rationality" isn't a primitive action. I think it would be a great thing if someone did it though; more power to you if you take up that cause.
