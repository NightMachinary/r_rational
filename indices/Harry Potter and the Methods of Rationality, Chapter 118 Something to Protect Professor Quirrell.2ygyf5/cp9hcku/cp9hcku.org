Why do I get the feeling that we are just flat out not going to see or hear from a conscious Hermione before the absolute end?

There are so many unanswered questions there - what can normal wizards discern from the dark rituals used on her? Do they know about the Horcrux with Dumbledore gone?

Literal /weeks/ have gone by in universe, and Harry hasn't spoken to her?

I can't help but wonder.

We never did find out exactly what Voldemort did to Hermione when he revived her.

We know that he knows at least in part how to duplicate his mind state and impress it on others.

We know that he knows how to lose.

I can't help but be tensed up, waiting for the shoe to drop.
