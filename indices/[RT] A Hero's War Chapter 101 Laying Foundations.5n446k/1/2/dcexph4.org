How important do you think it is that magic, like oil, has inherent usefulness, much more than gold does? Ultimately, if everything goes pear-shaped and you actually cash in your notes for units of magic (or oil), you can do real work with them. You can power farm tools, or household appliances, or weapons. I think that this would mitigate the "sinking a magic well means printing money" angle, but I'm no expert.
