The main explanation is that Cato isn't an economist. He only knows fiat currency having grown up with it all his life, and he knows roughly how it works and how it fails (bank runs). But nothing like the familiarity he has for engineering.

Minmay has an emotional rejection of debt, viewing it as a tool of last resort (due to the implied Bad Things that happened to his wife's family). To have a currency defined by an undefined value is... not something he can accept.

Most of the citizenry might view fiat currency as suspicious too. After all, it was only half a year ago that legal tender became a concept at all.

Essentially, fiat currency not culturally acceptable because no one's used to the idea of anything other than coins with actual literal gold bits in them.
