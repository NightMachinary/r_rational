Hi all, I checked back a little late.

For further discussion: [[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=121192]]

Magic power backed currency has some differences with oil backed or electricity. Magic crystals are fungible, non-perishable and impossible to fake; they're basically just shiny rocks. Storing compressed magic is like storing compressed air, put the tanks out of the rain and sun and you're good. Plus, supply is limited only by your production capital.

Magic's also more flexible than raw electricity and more useful than oil. The military already keeps gigantic stockpiles lying around just in case they need it. In fact, since your life is more important than money, all prospective stockpiles of magic power will end up as military stockpiles.

Also, a modern economy's money supply is really really huge. On the other hand, huge military stockpiles are quite easy to justify to the citizens who don't want to die to monsters. Although getting into a huge battle would mean your backing value gets fired off as ammunition. Imagine a gold-backed currency when gold is also bullets.

Plus, to create that much magic would devalue magic itself (diminishing returns, once you have powered everything industrially useful, you start using it for elevators, personal cars, etc. lower value applications), hence also ruining your base of value.

It's a pretty unique situation with no true RL analog and I would appreciate discussion on this topic just in case it points out something I missed. (the next chapter is Elka focused)
