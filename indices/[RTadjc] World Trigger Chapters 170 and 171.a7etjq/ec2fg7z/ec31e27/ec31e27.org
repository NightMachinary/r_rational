Surprisingly well rated on bakabt. I watched the first episode of the anime, and read a couple of the manga chapters long ago but it didn't grip me. Mainly because I find governments using underage teenagers as their soldiers and world savers a bit silly, but it makes sense given their target audiences..

Your post on how it is ratdjacent and a few other points convinced me to give this another shot. Thank you ;P
