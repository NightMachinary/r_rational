I read Orthogonal a while back, did some time conversions (on the [[/r/gregegan]] subreddit, it's not popular so you can find the link easily if you really want to), and bought a few more books of his. I support the decision in Dichronauts to have the units, etc. just automatically translated to our terms, but the lack of diagrams/explanations only confused me. I think my favorite book of his is either Diaspora or Permutation City.

Also, a word of warning: *Orthogonal is filled with incest.* The alternate physics/biology of the Orthogonal series works has heritable traits being transmitted by the same method as illnesses. This, in practice, apparently works out to brother-sister pairs being each other's default partners. I imagine Egan's editor didn't pick up on this one; I certainly didn't until I'd already bought and read all three books.
