I think that's a little bit of an unfair claim, since the Orthogonal amoebamen's biology and reproductive nature is so different from our own that any downstream implications that our species has of the term incest don't apply to them at all.

However, to be honest, the main disappointment about orthogonal (which I otherwise REALLY loved) was that the gender politics (and even general psychological makeup) of these truly alien beings ended up being pretty similar to our own in ways I wouldn't expect them to be.
