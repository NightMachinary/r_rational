Well, it was a way to comment on our world, of course, so they had to be. I didn't think it was too weird. Sexism made sense, in-world, in fact more sense than it does in /ours/: if women die basically halfway through their life, and once the claim that their knowledge is somehow passed to their children is debunked, what's the point in giving them education, or allowing them to lead a fulfilling professional life? It's like the modern problem with companies not hiring women for fear they'll get pregnant and thus cost them money for maternity, except multiplied times 1000. There is a fundamental biological inequality and injustice that exists because Nature doesn't give a fuck, and the obvious way society deals with that is by rolling with it and trying to maximise efficiency instead of individual happiness. It's not weird they'd come to those conclusions. In fact the very assignment of who counts as a "woman" and who as a "man" in their species is completely arbitrary and basically done, for our convenience as human readers, to map with the social roles we experience every day. In the amoeba people, the "men" are for example traditionally the caregivers for the children. This is something that's perhaps not explored much but is a fundamental departure from our own experience as mammalians.
