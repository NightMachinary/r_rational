  Yeah...but scifi can be so much more then just social commentary.

Well, but in this case I think it is anyway - a lot of the situations are original, caused by the specific circumstances of the novels' setting, and half the books are simply centred around their very peculiar brand of physics.

I don't think the commentary itself feels out of place, but I agree it's not exactly /subtle/, and I guess one might find that aspect annoying. I didn't have a problem with it, except for what I consider to be a bit of a plot contrivance at the end of The Eternal Flame, namely [[#s][spoilers]].
