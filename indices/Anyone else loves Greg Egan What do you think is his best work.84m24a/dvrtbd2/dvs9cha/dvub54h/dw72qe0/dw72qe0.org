Yeah...but scifi can be so much more then just social commentary.

Its not that the sexism didn't make sense...it was that the narative seemed to have too many parrales around it.

Like I would expect the psychology to reflect their biology more. And like maybe not even call them men and women. Like you say its not really analogs. I guess I might feel better about it if the comment on our world was...insightful or didn't feel forced.
