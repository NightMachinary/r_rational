Well, yeah, this is going pretty OT I guess XD.

Dunno, I understand why when looking /under/ the hood a lot of this stuff can be horrifying - personally every time I try to get into the more modern trends in web development I feel like screaming considering how much shit people pile on top of each other (often writing pseudo-code that then gets compiled three or four times before becoming the final JS, complete madness). But with stuff like simple sites and blogs, default templates provided by things like WordPress are /the one/ thing I really appreciate. Spaced text, good font choices, sensible colour schemes. I mean, even something like Reddit is very simplistic in look but also very clear and readable. That site to me isn't very much.

Of course it's a matter of taste, still, I think one can conjugate simplicity and looks without falling into the trap of "just another library!" that web developers often seem victim of.
