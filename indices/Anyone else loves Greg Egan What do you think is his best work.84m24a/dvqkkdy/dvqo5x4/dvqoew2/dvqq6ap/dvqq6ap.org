Yeah, it's the design mostly. I don't have a problem with pure or minimalistic HTML. A lot of modern sites have bells and whistles, but I think simple is fine. Still, design isn't just about being pretty, it's also about readability, which is a practical need. As you mentioned, some colour schemes are horrible. Ditch the animated cubes in primary colours please. The font could be picked better, and there could just be more free space here and there. Just by organising the page better, giving the text a bit more breathing space, and picking a better colour scheme (all doable with very basic CSS), I think it'd improve by leaps and bounds.
