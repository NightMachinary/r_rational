I disagree ... it's a great website.

There's like two embedded files per page, one CSS, one JS, that's it. It's all in plain HTML, and can be trivially converted to plain text. It's practically the Platonic Ideal of what a website should be.

The only thing I would change is the light purple background on Orphanogenesis, it gives me a bit of fuchsia shock.
