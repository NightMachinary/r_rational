Quarantine and Permutation City. His later works kinda went anti-emotional and/or ran out of truly relevant interesting premises. Quarantine has no anti-humanism/hope/light, Permutation City has some but a powerful enough premise to make up for it and become one of the great peaks of SF, and then it starts heading downhill. "Could not cast a Patronus" summarizes a lot of the issue. Similar progression to Iain Banks; if you can still like /Excession/ you'll like late Egan too.
