I've designed my girlfriend's professional site and keep track of it with Google Analytics, and I can tell you, /a lot/ of people visits it by smartphone. Many more than do by PC. The audience here may be different of course, but I don't think mobile readability is a bad thing. Of course I'm not saying to use Bootstrap or some other sophisticated framework, if you keep the content simple (just text and images, basically) you can do that with pure CSS these days. In fact most sites will simply work well in mobile anyway if you don't go wild with content and formatting.

You can make a much better looking site with absolutely zero JS. Only HTML+CSS. JS is unnecessary altogether if you don't want any interactivity or some fancy resizing options.

I was talking about template, font and colour schemes, mostly. I'm not saying a good site needs to push cookies or have some super-hi-res hero banner that takes 5 seconds to load or some WebGL effect constantly playing while you visit it. That'll go down in history as the most annoying aspect of 2010s web design, like MIDI tunes that play automatically are for 1990s one.
