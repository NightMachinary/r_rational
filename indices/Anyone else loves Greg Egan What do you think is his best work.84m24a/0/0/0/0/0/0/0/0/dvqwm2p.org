I never tried on anything smaller than a tablet, and even then only for reading, not writing. It always suggests that I switch to the app though XD.

Anyway, well, I think it's possible. Not saying it's super easy though, I suppose. CSS selectors today can also be written to act differently depending on screen size. And stuff like the striped pattern in the background is ugly and really not necessary.
