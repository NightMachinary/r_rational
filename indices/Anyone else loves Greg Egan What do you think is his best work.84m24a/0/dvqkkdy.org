His best books for me are /Schild's Ladder/ and /Diaspora/. The first chapter of /Diaspora/ was originally published as a short story and is available online as [[http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html]["Orphanogenesis"]].

I would be careful about /Distress/, the first chapter was really disturbing and it doesn't lighten up all that much. It's really good, just, pushes boundaries about personhood and bodily integrity. And of course has an underpinning of weird physics, like always...

/Quarantine/ - there's like three or four stories in this one, all entangled together. The primary arc really plays wicked games with the Copenhagen Interpretation, taking it way literally.

[[http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html]["Riding the Crocodile"]] and /Incandescence/ take us to a galaxy that's as far beyond the world of /Schild's Ladder/ as they are beyond us, but where people are still people no matter how much of what defines us has become optional.

[[https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07_djvu.txt]["Dust"]] and /Permutation City/ combine strange physics and strange computational neurology in odd ways. A large part of the story involves an experiment that Egan later decided was horribly unethical, and he returns to it with a whole different viewpoint in [[http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/]["Crystal Nights"]].
