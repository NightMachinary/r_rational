Personally, I must disagree with the sentiments people are expressing. So far I find Egan's books to be... hollow. Lacking a soul. I've only read Permutation City and Diaspora, and although they were great bingeable hard sci-fi, the characters were morally empty. Where's the virtue? Where's the eudaimonia? Where's the humanism? Instead, everything is reduced to a checklist of meaningless hedonic experiences. Even the characters find the world soul-crushing: there is a disturbing trend of characters copying themselves and the copies committing suicide (this happens in /both/ Permutation City and Diaspora!).

Reading Egan books is both extremely fun and extremely draining. I'm drawn in by the hard sci-fi, but afterward I'm mildly depressed and need a drink.
