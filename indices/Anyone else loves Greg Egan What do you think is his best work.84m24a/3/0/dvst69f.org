I haven't read either of those. What I can say about the two (well, four, as Orthogonal is a trilogy) I /have/ read:

- in Zendegi, the story is very human, but it does indeed feature a situation similar to what you describe, of a character being sort-of copied and that ending not too well. He's not a great writer of characters, mind you - a lot of feelings are conveyed in really unsubtle manner. Still, I found the topic of that book - a man coping with the death of his wife and his own impending demise, and the wish to leave a trace of himself through his son - to be extremely human.

- Orthogonal features absolutely non-human characters, but is also the one that perhaps gave me the strongest emotions, mostly towards the women, who in this world undergo the horrifying fate of being able to reproduce only by dying (as they basically undergo mitosis). Again, the individual characters are perhaps relatively simple, but the overall portrayal of the emotions and social consequences of this mechanic is very vivid and believable.

I think in general Egan is a writer that shines when talking about science and society, and less about individuals. I think that's fine, not everyone can be talented at everything, and in fact I'd say that's a common thing among sci-fi authors. In fact at least his social analysis tends to be much more deep and thought out than what some others do. His characters are, mostly, means to an end - the end being advancing a plot that communicates its themes through collective, rather than individual, action. But he's surely no poet, yeah. His prose too is rather dry and, in itself, unremarkable.
