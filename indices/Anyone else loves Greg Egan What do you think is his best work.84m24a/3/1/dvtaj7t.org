If you want to be really depressed, try /Distress/.

In Permutation City, Paul Durham's copy tried to commit suicide but failed, and he had a good reason for trying... and Peer's original is the one who shut itself down after he learned that Kate left him. Thomas Reimann rewrote himself and his whole universe by rerunning his defining moment over and over again until he made the "right" decision... that can be seen as somewhat self-centered but on the other hand he did save his lover's life in the end.

In Diaspora, are you talking about Orlando's five-dimensional version? Or the final version of Orlando alone with Yatima?
