I only read "Permutation City", and it was very good, even though I don't usually enjoy very abstract sci-fi (and this book becomes VERY abstract indeed). I still (years later) sometimes think about the ideas from that book. I've tried something else by Greg, don't remember what it was, but I just couldn't keep reading because of the level of abstraction and the density of the ideas. I usually skip a lot of filler in the books I read, and with Egan's books you can't do that, or you don't know what half the words even mean.

His style reminds me a lot of Jacek Dukaj (only "The Old Axolotl" was translated to English, haven't read that one, but "Ice" and "Black Oceans" by him are very good).
