My favorite is Disapora. It reads more like paper outlining different possible futures for humans than a proper narrative. However, I really enjoyed it, in particular the birth of sentience in part one. My next favorite is Permutation city, followed closely by Distress. The Orthogonal series had too much physics for me to handle and not enough narrative to compensate.
