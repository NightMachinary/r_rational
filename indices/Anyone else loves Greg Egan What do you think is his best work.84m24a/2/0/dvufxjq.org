I agree, and while I generally enjoy humanistic works the most, I can also enjoy classic nihilistic Egan, in a different manner.

I don't like Orthogonal though, because it has too much physics with too thin characters, at least for a non-physicist reader, and its alien social narrative is profoundly unimaginative: aliens progress towards human 20th century liberalism. Along with Egan's rejection of superhuman intelligence this is too parochial for my tastes.
