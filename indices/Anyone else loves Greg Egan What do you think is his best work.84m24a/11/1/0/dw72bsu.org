Yeah, I found the physics way more interesting then the sociology. I also found the sort of solution of their problem being "lets make them more like humans" to be...boring?

The story of their science progressing is good, the too close gender politics and ..well society feels like amoebas wearing top-hats. And not really an exploration of what biology would be needed to produce the features we are introduced too.
