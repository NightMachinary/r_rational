  This man redefined what hard science fiction can mean.

Truly. I went into Poul Anderson's "Tau Zero" hearing from everyone how it was hard sci-fi and stuff, then rolled my eyes multiple times at the blatant nonsense that happens in that book (despite it being often entertaining nonsense).\\
Then I went into Egan's works and I realised if I wanted to pick anything he said apart I needed to sit down with a few textbooks, a computer and a stack of paper.
