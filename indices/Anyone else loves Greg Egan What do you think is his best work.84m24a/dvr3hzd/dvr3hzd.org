PERMUTATION MOTHERFUCKING CITY, AWW YEAAAH

:ahem: Sorry, I really love that book.

edit: For those who have read it and want /more/, did you know there's a Permutation City fanfic by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][our esteemed leader himself]]? Manages the rare feat of taking a Greg Egan book and making way more physical sense than the original.

edit: While being a mass fanfic crossover! Not since Blindsight has nonsense made /this much sense/.
