Durham was in a situation where Paul[0] was likely going to have to terminate or indefinitely hibernate Paul[1] anyway, because it was expensive to run a Copy, so they baled out before they had time to accumulate enough experience as a copy to feel attached to that version of themself.

Orlando was a one of a kind five-dimensional version of himself, there were never going to be any more 5d people, so he'd be alone forever. He could have made a snail-bot version of himself to go into the 5d world with, but he'd already done that, and didn't feel that was enough himself to saddle with a few more hours of 5d-humanoid versions of himself.

And it's really less than suicide when there's lots of other versions of you that you're within a few days or months of in memories, it'e more like losing some short-term memory than dying.
