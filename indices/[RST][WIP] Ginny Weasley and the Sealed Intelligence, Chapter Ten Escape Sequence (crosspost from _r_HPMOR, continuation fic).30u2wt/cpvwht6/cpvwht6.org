Taking the tales mostly at face value, "Timothy Quagmire" was killed and his death was used to power the construction of a Horcrux as an experiment. However, this was Horcrux 1.0, which works like a backup, rather than Horcrux 2.0, which works like RAID. This means that the instance of Voldie's personality that was burned into this Horcrux immediately desynced with his, which is why it was only useful as an object of study. Voldie moved on to make Horcrux 2.0, and the diary was no longer useful to him. The diary knows what it knows, things known only to Voldie, because it WAS Voldie, or was in his confidence, for quite a while.
