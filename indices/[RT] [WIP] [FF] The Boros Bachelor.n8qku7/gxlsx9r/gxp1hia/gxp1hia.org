Yes, the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (GGR) sourcebook released by Wizards of the Coast for D&D is canon! MTG and D&D are made by the same company, so their material is generally consistent throughout and they did a great job with the GGR.

We do our best to maintain consistency with the lore in our webnovel as well, and have good reasons for diverging when we do.

Ravnica is a super fun setting, I recommend it :)
