There's a difference between growth in energy use, and economic growth. But if we're going to hit some maximal limit of energy use in the universe, well, I'd rather humanity get there to have that 5th world problem than stagnate into agri-feudal bucolic fantasies on this measly rock. If you're going to tackle that in an AS re-write, I don't see any meaningful resolution aside from a brief "One more reason to make sure to teach our children to value physics, as if we needed any."
