Earth could hit that energy limit without space travel in about 400 years, which is why I think at least a discussion of space travel is needed. Energy consumption also ties into all the mistakes people were making in the 1950s*. They burned coal while a small handful people warned about the greenhouse effect and the need to switch to solar decades prior. They burned oil, a diminishing resource capable of being turned into all sorts of useful plastics.

By the way, did you read the linked fanfic, and if so, what were your thoughts?

*I see AS set not in the future, but in an alternate 1957. Technology has too far advanced and Communism has too far retreated for it to be a plausible dystopic future.
