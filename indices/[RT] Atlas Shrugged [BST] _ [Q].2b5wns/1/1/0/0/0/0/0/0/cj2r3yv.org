I agree. That kind of statement is generally called an axiom. Everything hinges on that one thing. It's not really something that can be debated using logic though. If that's one of the axioms you're using, then I could make appeals to emotion, or use any number of rhetorical tricks. But logic isn't really going to change your mind.

The big question is, "why choose that axiom". I think it's a bit of a stretch to go from it, to actually living well. Simply maximizing for continuing to stay alive...
