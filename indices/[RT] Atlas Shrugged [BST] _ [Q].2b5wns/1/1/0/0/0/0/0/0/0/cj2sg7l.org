It's more that it's a baseline minimum to valuing /anything/. You have to want to be alive before you can want to live well, you have to /be alive/ to be capable of valuing something. So, not the thing you're maximizing, but a minimum benchmark to meet (while still allowing for rare edge cases where you might value something more highly than your own continued survival, such as the survival of a child.)
