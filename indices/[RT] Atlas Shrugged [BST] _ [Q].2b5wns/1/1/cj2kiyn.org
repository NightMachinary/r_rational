I feel like this bears talking about. Have you skimmed through the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence][metaethics sequence]]? It's a bit of a prerequisite for talking about this kind of thing. Making sure we have enough common ground to eventually reach some kind of agreement.

Why do you think objectivism is good? Keeping in mind that I only have third hand experience with it, and am probably working off some negative stereotypes.
