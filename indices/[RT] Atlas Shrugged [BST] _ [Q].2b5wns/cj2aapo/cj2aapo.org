With the caveats that I really like the book and her philosophy and have no intention of taking up your cast gauntlet and have been drinking:

1. Limited growth potential is more of an imagination failure than the other way around. The most valuable resource is /design information/, which has at least near-umlimited scaling. There was just a recent article claiming that currently existing tech could feed another 3 billion people, on top of current population. There are /amazing/ advancements being made in indoor farming. And if a society ever did hit some hard limit on growth in things humans consider valuable, well, this is only one tiny rock in a vast expanse of resources... Honestly, the fetishizing of growth limits seems rather Ludditish, and Rand would certainly be harsher. And if you're going to extend the objection far enough to bring up entropy, that's rather like calling out the guy who figured out how fire works for not knocking off biological immortality too.

2. The novel was written and edited over something like 9 years. There are also no jets, and television only gets a little mention near the end.

3. That's a bit of an exaggeration. It was dirt cheap, super efficient energy, but that is still a far cry from actual post scarcity. An interesting take for a rational rewrite might be to devise a plausible-ish method to how it worked, and discuss the potential ramifications, sort of how wind power used on a vast enough scale could take enough kinetic energy out of the atmosphere to disrupt or shut down weather. Rand only ever really explains that it somehow draws static electricity out of the air (iirc), which I assumed to be somehow related to a proof my Advanced E&M professor once showed demonstrating that the atmosphere was functionally a kind of giant capacitor. (My apologies to anyone who actually completed their physics degree or superior autodictats if I'm misremembering, or horribly mangling.)

  Maybe even a purified Objectivist, with all of Rand's personal biases, foibles, and stupidities stripped away.

That could be interesting. I've always wondered just how the amphetamine use affected her. Making Galt seems less... statuesque is the only word that comes to mind... while keeping the ideas relatively hardline would be a difficult writing challenge.

  Maybe his understanding of the human utility function means that post-scarcity humans would fail to achieve eudaimonia, and that is more valuable to him

She valued eudamonia highly (so Galt would too), but the bigger issue is post-scarcity not being on the table, any more than moving from manual labor to combustion engines put it on the table. Eudamonia would still be viable even post-scarcity, though. The issue would be approaching your hobbies seriously, and actually making the effort to do your best. As an example, the only issue Rand ever had with motherhood was people who had babies as an emotional dalliance. She thought it should be approached with the same degree of seriousness and study as a difficult career.

I fully expect any effort at this to be even more anvilicious than Rand, but maybe the above might be of use to someone who cares enough to try.
