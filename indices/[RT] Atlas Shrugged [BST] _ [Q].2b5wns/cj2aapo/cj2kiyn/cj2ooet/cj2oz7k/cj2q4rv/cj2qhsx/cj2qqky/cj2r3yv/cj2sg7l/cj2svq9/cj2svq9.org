So what you're saying is that objectivism isn't really good, but it's attempting to be universal. At least universal among entities that plan on continuing to live, which is going to be most of them thanks to the anthropic principle.

But it doesn't maximize the overall amount of "goodness".

The baseline minimum isn't enough. We need to be better then that.

Which does bring us to the problem of defining "goodness". If we're going to maximize goodness, we need to know what is good. It's pretty easy to know what's good intuitively, but that ofter leads you astray.
