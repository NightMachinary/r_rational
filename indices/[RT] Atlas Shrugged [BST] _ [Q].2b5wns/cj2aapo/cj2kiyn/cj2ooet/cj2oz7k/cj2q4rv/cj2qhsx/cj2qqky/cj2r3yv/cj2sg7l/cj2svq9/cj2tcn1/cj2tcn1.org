I don't quite understand your point here, and that may be my fault. Maybe I should rephrase like this: I'm a human. What is right for me to do? Step 1 is stay alive. There are a lot of things that can be inferred from this like, "I should not murder, because that increases the chances that I will be murdered, but I should respond with lethal force against those who use or threaten me with lethal force", "I should not steal, because that increases the chances that I myself will be robbed of the necessities of sustaining my life".

From "I want to live and be as unencumbered as possible in attaining or keeping whatever else I choose to value" you can build up most or all of what are called "negative rights". As someone who is Objectiv/ish/, I would say that that lays the groundwork for maximizing goodness, since everyone will have their own conception of what is good in life.

As for universality, it's aiming for it among humans, though it could easily extend beyond. In those methaethics sequences there was a proposed hypothetical species that highly valued murder, and was barely constrained by a strong code of honor to keep the society from imploding. An objectivist would attempt to argue with a member of that species, that if it wanted to maximize it's own survival chances, it should attempt to get mutual anti-murder agreements with all other members of it's species, and limit it's cannibalism only to those who first violate the agreement. But that would only be accepted if that member valued it's own survival more than the pleasure of murder.
