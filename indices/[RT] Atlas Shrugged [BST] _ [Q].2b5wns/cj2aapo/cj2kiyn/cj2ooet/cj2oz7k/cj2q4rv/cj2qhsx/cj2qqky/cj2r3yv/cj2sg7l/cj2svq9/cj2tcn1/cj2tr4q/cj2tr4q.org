You're talking about the babyeaters? They've already survived childhood. There's not really, from what I can tell, any objectivist reason they shouldn't eat babies.

It's a non-trivial risk, going against the group. And it's not going to affect their future negatively if they continue to eat babies.

That's a pretty un-optimal thing, from a perspective of life in general. There are a lot of situations like that as a result of objectivism. Wherever there's any significant power differential really.

Take slaves as a very basic example. If you're not part of the easily identifiable salve caste (let's say black people), there isn't really any reason to try and help the slave caste. You're never going to become a slave. The safest/best route is to simply stand back. Don't gain any of their ire, but don't fight for them either.
