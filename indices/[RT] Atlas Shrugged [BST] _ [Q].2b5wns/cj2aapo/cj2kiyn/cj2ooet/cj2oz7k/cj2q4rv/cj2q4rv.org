  Then there's definitely a communication problem in that movement, and it's led to a pretty severe image problem. Something to think about fixing maybe.

You're not wrong. The choice of "selfish" in particular I don't think any native English speaker would have made. It's a problem stemming from both claimed Objectivists doing a disastrously bad job of explaining, or failing to note a need to explain, and detractors deliberately muddying the waters. Both are vexing, and while I think I can do a good job of explaining the difference in meaning, it's hard to do without a small wall of text.

  I'm not sure what to do with the term "pure arbitrariness".
#+end_quote

I'm just referring to claims made with no attempt at justification, inserted as self-evident. Moral intuition is at least /a/ justification, even if it's a crappy, uncompelling one, and the really arbitrary claims tend to just be based on embarrassed intuition.

  but with ethics you really need to build on some type of axiom.

Agreed, which is another point I like about Objectivism, which I actually considered bringing up in the last post. And even there, she defined axiom a bit differently, as a claim that cannot be rebutted without being presupposed. Her three were "existence exists", "consciousness (the state of being able to percieve existence) exists", and a last which is phrased in multiple ways. "A is A", "Existence is Identity", "To /be/ is to be /something in particular/". She tried to build up everything in her philosophy with those three as her bedrock, with the inclusion higher up the logical chain of "I want to live", which she called a "pre-rational choice".
