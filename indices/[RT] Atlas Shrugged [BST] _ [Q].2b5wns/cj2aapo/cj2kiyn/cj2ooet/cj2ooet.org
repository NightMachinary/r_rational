  Have you skimmed through the metaethics sequence?

I have been for the last while. I'm about a third of the way through. I'm honestly seeing quite a lot of similarity to Rand in it. In particular, the second one could have been a riff off of her scathing critique of Rawls, and the Subhan/Obert argument is quite near to one of her biggest claimed successes. I don't think there's near as vast a gap between EY and Rand as most Rand-haters hereabouts assume. I think he hits at topics more /precisely/ than she did, and think there's a solid chance I'll prefer him in the end, but the similarities are often startling.

  Why do you think objectivism is good?
#+end_quote

It attempts to give a full, coherent philosophy of human life without resorting to pure arbitrariness or moral intuitions (aka: I /feel/ that this is true, therefor it's true). People will often attack it as sociopathic, but that's misunderstanding it's great strength. It's a moral philosophy that would be /comprehensible/ to a sociopath. A sociopath could read Rand and come away thinking "Ok, so it's better for /me/, overall, to not go around harming and screwing over other people, /even if I think I could hide that I had done so/".

  Keeping in mind that I only have third hand experience with it, and am probably working off some negative stereotypes.

I don't mean to intend this as combative, but it's rather likely you have a near-complete misunderstanding. When I was in a similar position, I know I did. In particular, she uses a number of important terms, like selfish or altruism, to mean things that are not equivalent to their conversational meanings. Her detractors gleefully abuse that dichotomy to attack her, and that is the understanding that you'll pick up if your knowledge comes from, say, having observed internet arguments about Objectivism, or more commonly, just attacks directed at it.
