1. [[http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy/][There are some fairly hard limits on energy consumption,]] and consequently economic growth.

2. Technologies like rockets and atomic power were both in science fiction magazines as early in the 1930s but weren't really things until shortly after /Atlas Shrugged/ was published. I can't fault Rand for not including them, but John Galt had a degree in physics and it would be keeping in his character to know about them.

3. From what I've read, Galt's motor uses the Casimir effect in a sort of handwavy zero-point energy way. Thinking about it, you're right: automation technologies of the 1950s weren't enough to couple with the energy-crisis-averting motor to achieve post-scarcity. Maybe today, or in the next ten years, but that's neither here nor there.

  Making Galt seems less... statuesque is the only word that comes to mind... while keeping the ideas relatively hardline would be a difficult writing challenge.

I feel like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9514187/1/Breaking-Point][this fic]] gives him a more humanizing alternate character interpretation.
