  Earth could hit that energy limit without space travel in about 400 years, which is why I think at least a discussion of space travel is needed.

It could be worked in without too much fuss. Dwight Sanders seems like the most relevant character to do so. Research at the time was pointing towards building aircraft that could go higher and higher until they seamlessly transitioned into being spacecraft. That was cut off when Kennedy redirected all those minds into multi-billion dollar, PR one-shots.

The oil and coal bits seem more difficult to work in. I don't believe they were common/serious concerns at the time, and Galt's motor makes them both moot points. Which is why I suggested thinking of possible, similar downsides to widespread adoption of the motor.

  By the way, did you read the linked fanfic, and if so, what were your thoughts?

I've just read it. Musing on it now. It seems reliant on semantically waffling between Objectivist and conventional meanings of "selfless" and "sacrifice". It would make more sense if Galt's plans had him dying to ignite change, like [[#s][Mistborn spoilers]], but the actual plan had no risk to himself, just a long period of less than optimal fun while he worked on bringing the world into a state that would allow massively greater enjoyment/satisfaction. And I kind of suspect the author hadn't read the book closely, or at least recently. There's a line that seems too appropriate to not bring up, where Galt explicitly says what he'd do if Dagny were tortured. It's not scream "No, do me instead!", he'd just NOPE out of existence. If Breaking_Point!Toohey were correct, Galt's consideration for the effect his suicide would have on Dagny or his other friends ought to preclude that selfish (in both meanings) option. The bit about passion also seems rather ignorant. The lines from MoR regarding love being a measurable, physical phenomenon seem like a satisfactory rebuttal. Rand rejected a mind/body dichotomy like that. We're /reasoning/ animals, but we're still reasoning /animals/, if you will, and we can't rightly say what a human being /ought/ to do that violates what a human being /is/. It's proper for a rationalist to love and value some others extremely highly for the same reason it's proper for a lion to eat meat.
