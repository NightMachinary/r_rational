In that case, I have to argue that what you're saying is just very much YMMV. In my experience, all of Rand's premises and her full chain of logic is either stated or explicitly implied. There are definitely times when she doesn't connect all the dots for the reader--and also times when the dots are ridiculosly far apart. But she always gives all the information necessary to connect them ourselves. The problem I have is that her picture is often innaccurate, and that since we've put much of it together ourselves, it feels true without necessarily being so. But she certainly gives all the information we need in order to move from her premises to her conclusions...it's just that sometimes it takes several steps to get from stated point to stated point, going through implied ones along the way.
