True. And if you're saying that she's wrong, then I don't think I'd be able to give a good counter-argument. But just as far as explaining how she tries to bridge that gap: her view is that a person's ability to live in accord with their values requires them to be able to make any consensual, uncoerced contract with any individual/government that they like. And of course, one of those contracts might be (and often is): "Hey--I'll do x y and z for you if you'll give me permanent rights to use this thing over here however I like, provided I don't hurt anyone but me in the process."

In her view, capitalism is the ethical and political-economic system based on the sole and unapposed principle of freedom to consent or not consent to agreements. Private property, while an aspect of capitalism that sticks out to most who discuss it--including whoever named it--is of secondary importance in her view. It matters, but only because it's one of the implicit possible consequences of freedom in making contracts, which she considers the defining principle of the system.
