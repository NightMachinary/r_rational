Atlas Shrugged gets a lot of excessive flak because it isn't viewed in time it was presented. Rand IIRC, despite her flaws, was a refuge from communism alarmed at seeing it's potential to spread to the refuge she's found. I've skimmed some good critiques of the utility of capitalism, but to paraphrase Churchill it's the least worst system so far.

That said this is an interesting project but one I'll have to look at again in about 3-4 years.
