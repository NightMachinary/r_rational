Look, I'm not saying she didn't have some kind of trail-of-thought, that she was just somehow mad. I am saying that what she thought "fell out" as a necessary consequence of letting people live for their own values, to me... simply never enters the story as an /inherent logical consequence/. So her rantings about capitalism, government, etc just end up sounding like utter tosh, because she starts from a few legitimate-/sounding/ axioms (and we all know how legitimate axioms usually are...), proves a few things that sound somewhat reasonable, and then /spins off into strange other things for no apparent reason./
