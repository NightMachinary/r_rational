  Rand takes laissez-faire capitalism to mean the system where everyone can make whichever choices they deem best, insofar as they don't limit other people's ability to do the same.

That's nice, but it still doesn't explain the connection to /capitalism/, not actually-existing capitalism and not theoretical anarcho-capitalism /either/. You need to cross a vast gap to get from, "People should live for their own values and not enslave others" to "therefore the only acceptable ethical and political-economic system is one based on the sole and unopposed principle of private property."
