The fullest explanation I can find of her view on capitalism is here: [[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html]]

But to paraphrase as best I can: Rand takes laissez-faire capitalism to mean the system where everyone can make whichever choices they deem best, insofar as they don't limit other people's ability to do the same. Whether or not that's true of capitalism is a long and involved discussion that I'm frankly not qualified for. But her reason for advocating it was because she believed--having come out of early Soviet Russia, and seeing a lot of lives ruined by people who claimed to be "communists"--that "capitalism" was simply the name for the system wherein participants were free to make their own decisions.

It's probably important to note that her idea of capitalism bears little resemblance to our economic system, which we usually call capitalist. Again, I don't know which usage of the term is correct, though I'd bank on it not being hers, given her track record.

tl;dr: Because she often misuses words.
