Two disagreements. First: as was well stated above, "selfishness" as Rand uses the word roughly means "rational self-interest"--a terrible, confusing way of writing, but certainly not unique among philosophers. Second: in the case you're mentioning, Galt turns down dictatorship because it was offered conditionally: have all the power you like, so long as you allow us to remain irrational and evil. His entire mission is to deprive those who disagree with his values of his help in reinforcing their own; he's not against joint efforts (re:Galt's Gulch) but rather against helping those whose actions are, he believes, destructive. And he in no way assails them--he simply steps away and leaves them to their own devices.

Rand's work is hard to read, because of her insistently idiosyncratic language and ceaseless vitriol. She creates a world filled with impossibly incompetent/evil people, so that she can tear them down. Granted, she certainly had enough trauma in her life to explain her need for catharsis, but still--doesn't mean the book is thereby justified in its many, many faults. However, its roots are mostly good. Her key idea is: people should live by what's actually provably true and good, and should be free to determine their own values and lifestyles.

So whereas your points are good and accurate critiques of what Objectivism sounds like superficially--due to Rand being intentionally awful at explaining herself, to near-Nietzschean levels--they really don't accurately describe the book, or her views.
