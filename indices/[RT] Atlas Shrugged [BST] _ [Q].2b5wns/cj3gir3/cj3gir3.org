You cannot fixfic /Atlas Shrugged/.

  He's supposed to be the smartest man in the world, but he's not more insightful or imaginative than Ayn Rand. I can accept rational!Galt still being largely an Objectivist. Maybe even a purified Objectivist, with all of Rand's personal biases, foibles, and stupidities stripped away. I can accept him not going out to optimize the world. canon!Galt was basically offered a dictatorship of the world if he would fix it, and he turned it down.
#+end_quote

He turned it down because /selfishness/ is the whole point of Objectivism. It's an ideology holding that when someone offers you total dictatorship and world-optimization capacity, to create what you will, you /turn it down/ because that means getting involved with /other people/ in a context of government.

  Maybe his understanding of the human utility function means that post-scarcity humans would fail to achieve eudaimonia, and that is more valuable to him
#+end_quote

No, he just wants to do his own personal thing. He really does not want to be concerned with the larger world and its affairs.

  John Galt's engine could effectively produce free, limitless energy and end scarcity, but he instead cripples industrial civilization
#+end_quote

Yeah, because he and the author are immature children trying to Make a Point about how a selfish dick is the best thing you can be, even when "benevolent god-king" is on the menu.

  Sputnik was launched the same year as the novel was published, but there's no mention of space travel

Publication dates usually don't give you time to rewrite like that.

  the good industrialists live in a world that can support endless growth because the plot/her philosophy demands it

Welcome to Objectivism.
