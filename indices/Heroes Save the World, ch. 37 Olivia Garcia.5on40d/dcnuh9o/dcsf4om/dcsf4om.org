  Yep, should've known China would industrialize it right quick. Now that's what I call opsec.

The annoying thing is that I had already started to figure out personalities for a number of the Chinese kids before realizing that, given these factors and those factors, the government was just going to kill them before they had a chance to appear on-screen. It's probably going to be fun (and time-consuming) to list all the things that I /thought/ were going to happen until one tiny detail derailed everything and sent events down a drastically different path.

That's the price one pays for writing a story with so many characters, I suppose. >:]
