Ahhhhhhh, this makes me so happy. Thanks for your comments. And as it turns out, a China chapter should be getting posted in about half an hour, unless I messed up the schedule.

It's interesting that you put Not-Imp in the Good category but Ananya in Undecided, given that the primary thing that we know about her (unless you're analyzing the little details, which it sounds like you might be, which is fantastic) is that she's working with Ananya.

I'd also be interested to hear how you're defining "good" and "bad" since there are a number of value systems in play. I suspect a brand of utilitarianism, but feel free to prove me wrong.

Grace is not a phony! Especially not a retro one! >:P

Something about "pocket space" or "hammerspace" might be appropriate for Aadhya's power.

I'll go ahead and rank Hannah as a Striker 0. >:P

Thanks again for your comments. I'm not yet at the point where I can metabolize words, but i nearly live off of feedback even so.
