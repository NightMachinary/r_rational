You can rest assured that I will. My audience might be small right now, but it's bigger than I really expected it to be.

(the reaction to HSTW in general has been much better than I ever would have guessed, honestly. this started out as a sort of "Well, I need to start writing /something/ and I keep overthinking things and stopping projects because I'm overwhelmed by the amount of planning that I'm doing for them, so let's just go with /this/ thing and just see how far I get before it fails miserably. It remains to be seen, of course, whether I /can/ keep this up, but you folks, at least, have faith in me, and that's enough to keep my own confidence boosted.)
