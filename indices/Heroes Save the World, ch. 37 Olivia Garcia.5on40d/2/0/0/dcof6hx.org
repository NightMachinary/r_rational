Can't wait to see what's going on over there! Will update my list with Meifeng as soon as I read it :)

So I didn't have a particularly rigorous system for determining morality--mainly I just weighed "what they're doing" and "how they're doing it." Which is why the Nigerian shapeshifter is Undecided--he's squelching corruption, but doing it with murder.

Ananya is similar. She's currently being used to generate clean energy, but she's /actively trying/ to figure out how to make herself a WMD. That's not so good. I very much hope she makes it onto the Good list at some point.

Hah retrophony is one of the sillier ones :P I welcome other suggestions!

I used "pocketing" because of the dual reference to pickpocketing and pocket dimensions. Trying to keep these all one word for consistency.

Thanks for your thanks! One of the things I love most about this community is the ability to interact with the authors. I'll happily give on Patreon as soon as I'm in a position to do so. Keep it up.
