There's [[https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless-skies/][Sunless Skies]]. It's the sequel to Sunless Seas, which is a top-down gothic/lovecraftian horror shipping game. You go out to sea with food and oil and try to make money exploring new islands and trading stuff, while not ending adrift or having to resort to cannibalism. Unfortunately, it had a fair bit of problems (trading isn't very good and it's really hard to not die and lose all your progress, even in the late-game and on non-permadeath mode, it's very slow, etc). It's also gorgeous and has a great setting. Sunless Skies is the sequel, where you're in a train in space instead, and reviews are saying it's a better game overall. Maybe you'll enjoy it.
