Oh, I played a ton of Minecraft back when it was a young, fresh game, the graphics thing is really more because I feel like there are a ton of Minecraft-esque games out now, enough that I can be a bit picky about what I play so that it's not all left to my imagination. I played Terraria back in 2011 and didn't have as much content as it apparently does now (a perpetual problem for me, because I'm not patient about games). I'll add it to my list to revisit (and maybe mod).
