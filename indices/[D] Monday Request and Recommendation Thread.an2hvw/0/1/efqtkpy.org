The "go out into danger" thing basically describes any survival game--most of them in my experience don't have you be a perpetual hobo, but involve making a safe space with shelter, resources, and the like to retreat to between dangerous resource-gathering runs.

Have you given Terraria a shot? Presumably if you eliminated minecraft as "not pretty" you're not down for the 16 bit aesthetic (tho it has atmosphere in spades, so it might balance out). Unlike minecraft it has excellent progression and a clear path to follow through several bosses, with the final boss being a pretty solid end point. If I had to guess it's probably 20-60 hours end to end, totally depending on how sidetracked you get building your base up (and how cautious you are before crossing each metaphorical threshold).
