Does anyone have any good Fate Stay Night/Typemoon/Nasuverse fanfics? Any that someone from this sub might not hate would be good; it doesn't need to be stellar.

In particular, it would be amazing to see a fic with any detail in the magecraft of the Nasuverse, which I find incredibly fascinating.

It's mostly awful trying to find fics on eg. FFnet, when most fics either butcher the magecraft, or rely heavily on the fanservicey aspect of the Nasuverse.

Really, anything not terrible would be great.
