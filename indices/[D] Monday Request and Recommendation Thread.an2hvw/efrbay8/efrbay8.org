Thanks to [[/u/Makin-]] for recommending [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multi-cross-worm-naruto-homestuck-mother-of-learning.682117/][Conference Call]], the Mother of Learning/Worm/Homestuck/Naruto crossover fic here a few weeks ago. The characterization is really spot on (their roxy is great) , I highly recommend it. Also darn you, it made me remember my love for homestuck dialogue and snark after being off the hussie train since the 1st gigapause. So, uh, if any one's got any other hs fics where I can get that fix let me know. I've already read [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/DaneelsSoul/pseuds/DaneelsSoul][Rain of Frogs & Collision]] and have been sucked into the hole of playing Hiveswap. God damn it.

Also, for an actual book recommendation, I've been rereading one of my favorite short story collections, Burning Chrome by William Gibson. It has a lot of really nice cyberpunk vignettes. Barring silly ones like Johnny Mnemonic, the ones like Fragments of a Hologram Rose throw in a lot of great background world building
