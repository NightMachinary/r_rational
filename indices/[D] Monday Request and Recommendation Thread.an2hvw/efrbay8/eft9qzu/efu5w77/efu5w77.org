Vienna Game is just Neuromancer rewritten with Homestuck characters, and Act Omega has been stuck in the same arc for what feels like three years now, no plot progress whatsoever. If you're looking for an epilogue something like [[http://odditycollector.com/mtm/][Mr. Tambourine Man]] or even [[https://mspfa.com/?s=14113][cool and new web comic]] might be better, though extremely more lighthearted.

The other stuff you recommended is good shit, though.
