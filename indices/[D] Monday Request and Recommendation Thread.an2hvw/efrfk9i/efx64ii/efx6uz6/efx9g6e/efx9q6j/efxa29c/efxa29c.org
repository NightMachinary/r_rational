Yeah, I'm seeing not so subtle hints about that in my 5 minute re-skimming of his manifesto.

It doesn't take a psychiatrist to pick up on it as a manifestation/projection of his self hatred towards his life sans body autonomy (in the sense of basic control) and feeling robbed of dignity.

If nothing else, this + the sea inside make for very compelling arguments for self directed suicide/euthanisia.
