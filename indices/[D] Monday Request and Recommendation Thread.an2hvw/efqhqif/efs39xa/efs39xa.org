I'd recommend Darkest Dungeon.

Dark dungeons, bright base -The risk and reward loop to build your base and squads is good, although I wouldn't call the base warm or comforting! Losing heros you are invested in can be brutal, which will either make you really feel the danger or feel very frustrated.

Style - The visual style is striking to say the least, with the different zones having great enemy art that matches their zone. I personally love the attack animations style. The narrator is also great in my opinion, but that's very much personal taste.

Tech progression - Armor, weapon, and skill upgrades for every class. Upgradeable base buildings and equiping your heros with better trinkets over time. The base buildings and trinkets are my personal favorite improvements over time, since they offer real choices vs flat improvements.

Definite end - Yes...but it honestly might not be worthwhile to reach. I find reaching it very hard to balance with having a high enough difficulty throughout the rest of the game, which turns the final stretch into a grind for me. I also tend to enjoy the beginning challenges of games more so than endings though, with hundreds of hours in Factorio but no rocket ever built for example, so take that with a grain of salt.

Relatively short - Vastly depends on your playstyle, how you choose to learn, and your settings. I hate to be cliche but it can be long in the same way Dark Souls can be seen as a long game.

Bonuses: Setting: if you enjoyed some of the grim darker parts of Sunless Sea you should enjoy the settings feeling of being a torch flame blowing in the night, keeping the dark at bay and precariously pushing it back while knowing you can lose it if you get too complacent.

The biggest downside is the RNG, you can and will get slapped down by strings of bad luck. Most cases aren't truly unavoidable if you're honest with yourself, but it does happen and feels pretty bad when it does.

Disclaimer: I haven't played the expansions, which seem to significantly increase base management importance and offer lower risk side missions.
