I've been playing Subnautica lately and really liking it. I'd like more like it, specifically:

- A go out into danger, come back to a warm comforting base loop
- Pretty visuals
- A gradual tech progression
- A definite end
- Relatively short

I played Minecraft /way/ back before it had all the junk it has now, which is one of the only survival style games that I've played (and it would fail on both the pretty visuals and definite end front, though I've heard there was some kind of dragon added, so maybe the 'end game' thing isn't true anymore, or there are mods to change it).

Depending on how you define it, Factorio might also qualify ... but I've already beaten it a few times, then beat it with Bob's Mods, then beat it with Bob's/Angel's, so that's well-worn ground.
