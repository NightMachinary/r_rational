Same here. I'll respect his opinion that it feels too much like sacrificing himself and letting himself be replaced by a pod person, but people legitimately can change in ways that run counter to their past selves and yet lead fulfilling lives (e.g. a consummate bachelor ending up happily married with kids when only a year ago he'd loudly swear off marriage/ domestic life for good).

His categoric refusal to give them a shot... just makes me sad secondhand, for both him and his family/loved ones.

I'm not really seeing any references to (psychological) therapy either. Given that he sounds like he had resources (money, family, support network, etc), it'd be only himself as the obstacle. I too wonder if he could have improved from it, but it sounds like he was more of a cognitively oriented guy whod find ways to rationalize what he was feeling (ie I believe he would have found a way to essentially think around the therapy, which would probably require a gifted therapist to counter.)

He sort of alludes to Frankel 's man's seach for meaning as powerful therapy... just not for him. He definitely respects Frankels echoing Stoicism (I guess? The point about always having the freedom to choose ones reaction to events, come what may), but regrets that he was unable to do the same for his own circumstances. His isn't a bad critique of stoicism either (it's in line with my own observations about buddhism being one of the most insightful views into the human condition, but it's prescribed cures not being as good as the diagnosis)
