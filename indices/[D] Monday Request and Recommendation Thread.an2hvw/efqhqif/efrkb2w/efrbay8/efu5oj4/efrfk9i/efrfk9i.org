[CW: suicide, medical descriptions, poop, sex, strong denigration of people with disabilities]

So, about 5 years ago I read this suicide note (really, it's a novella - very long). It was written by a guy who became paraplegic after a motorcycle crash, and did not want to live anymore in that condition.

I found it very interesting. I'm not quite sure if it counts as rational literature (it's not fiction - there's news articles and obituaries about the author), but I'd be interested to read other people here's take on it. I found it very confronting and visceral, but also... a bit illogical at times.

He talks a lot about philosophy and the realities of being paraplegic. I recommend it, as long as the subject matter isn't likely to affect you negatively.

in particular, when he talked about not being depressed, just not liking his life which he said was objectively terrible, and therefore not wanting to take antidepressants because that would effectively "kill him" and replace him with a doppelganger who was not him, because he would /never/ be happy living paraplegic. I didn't agree with that logic, because if he was going to literally kill himself with a knife /anyway/, philosophically killing himself and replacing himself with another person happy with his lot in life would spare his family and friends grief But what do I know, I didn't live his life?
