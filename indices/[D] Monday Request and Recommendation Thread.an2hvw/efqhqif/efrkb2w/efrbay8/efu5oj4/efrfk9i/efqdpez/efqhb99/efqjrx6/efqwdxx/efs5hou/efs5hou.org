Ditto on anti rec for Maybe I'm A Lion.

The story reads like typical shounen manga with OP protag who gets powers and boost when needed, in contrast to the antagonist group Blackwatch who not only have and use tactics and training to track, guide and capture the protag but also rely on overwhelming force combined with science gadgets to counter protag's regeneration, and despite that protag still wins.

Even when they drop a specialized thermite payload on him he still regenerates because magic thinks Lions are super special awesome kings, even though basic zoology tells us they sleep, rest and conserve energy and mostly hunt outcasts and weak members of prey packs.

Make no mistake, Blackwatch is the anti zombie squad, comparable to a low grade SCP team, they can and will resort to drastic measure just to prevent an infestation and save humanity as whole, if Prototype game is anything to go by they are basically a fascistic branch of military ready to kill civilians and drops nukes on entire Manhattan.

And yet I was still rooting for them to win, because they have actual goals and try to win in ways you could reasonably expect to work, which don't because of author decision. They are bad people but they should have won in the end. I stopped reading somewhere after the thermite drop failed, maybe it got better though.
