Contrary to [[/u/Escapement]]'s recommendation, I never could get into Maybe I'm A Lion. Not familiar enough with Prototype for it to be good. On the other hand, there are a few gems that I've found, mostly crossovers.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-reach-out-f-sn-smt-p4-crossover-story-thread.245101/][Fate/Reach Out]] is a crossover with Persona 4. It's good to you even if you don't know the Persona 4 characters, but the Fate portion of the crossover has only really just become relevant, and it updates slowly. Magecraft is less relevant compared to the Persona stuff, but it's still there.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/thaumaturgic-awakening-worm-fsn.378247/][Thaumaturgic Awakening]] is much better in that regard, and it has a regular (monthly) update schedule. That the author just broke, by two months, but, eh, you take what you can get with fanfiction. Unlike Fate/Reach Out, it requires knowledge of /Worm/. But if you haven't read Worm, I'll take the time to recommend it to you here in the recommendation thread anyway. In /Thaumaturgic Awakening/, Rin, Saber, and Shirou are in a poly relationship. This isn't too relevant to the story, but it might cause you to dismiss it for fanservice.

That's pretty much it. There's a /Harry Potter/ crossover I know is pretty good about this, that involves the gang going to Hogwarts and mixing the magic traditions together, but I forgot the name, and also all of the characters are in a poly relationship with each other. Again, because something about Fate/Stay Night seems to provoke that. It's not super long, IIRC, and /very/ dead.
