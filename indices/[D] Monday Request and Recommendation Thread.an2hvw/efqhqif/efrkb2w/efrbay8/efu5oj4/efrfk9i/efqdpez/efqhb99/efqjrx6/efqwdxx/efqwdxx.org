[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-hollow-fake.12936/][Fate/Hollow Fake]] is /extremely/ good. It's a finished (and very long) quest of an alternate universe with superb characterization and storyline. The author is currently running a Fate/Grand Order quest too that I've heard good things about, but haven't read myself.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-stay-write-go-fate-stay-night-au-si.19663/][Fate - Stay - Write - Go!]] is an AU where the author is inserted as the brother of Shirou and inherits Accel magic. It's Shadenight if that means anything to you, which means its 1) pretty good 2) chunni grimderp 3) munchkining. Later chapters are pretty "magecraft heavy".

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-wandering-swordsman-fate-au.51803/][A Wandering Swordsman]] is much more light-hearted, but also entertaining quest centered on Musashi wandering her way into a Grail War. Currently running.

[[https://fiction.live/stories/Fate-Grand-Quest/WSqYHFxdbasEpMKH5][Fate/Grand Quest]] is a long (nsfw) quest running on fiction.live. It's pretty good and gives even non-waifu servants characterization, although devolves into porn occasionally.

[[https://fiction.live/stories/Fate-Walpurgis-Night/mTcaddsMPg66nnS5S][Fate/Walpurgis Night]] is a finished (nsfw) quest on fiction.live following a Master in a Grail War. It's ok, although has quite a bit of fanservice/porn.

Other than that, I can't really recommend any Nasuverse fiction. There isn't a lot, and most if it is /real/ bad. I can't think of anything that goes into magecraft much, but that's mostly because Nasuverse magecraft is very much /not/ rational or self-consistent. I see a lot of people try to argue Servant powerlevels or magical laws because Nasu puts out Word of God posts and Servants have grades for skills and mechanic-ish NPs, but it's pretty fundamentally shounen - all those rules are just there for framework and so the main character looks cool when he breaks them.

EDIT: Actually, I wrote [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0YdkCbc-Pu7DvYxpCQt0YHFJGbhneR1CffXbapq47M/edit?usp=sharing][Isolation]] (1339 words) a few months ago for one of the writing prompts because I was thinking about how sentient world-entities is the only sane way to handle non-self-consistent magic systems. Maybe you'll enjoy it.
