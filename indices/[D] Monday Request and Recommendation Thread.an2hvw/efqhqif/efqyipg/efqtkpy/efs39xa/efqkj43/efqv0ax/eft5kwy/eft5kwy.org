Ha! Me too! I've owned SN for years but never could get into it (I kept trying to play it in VR and the controls did not work at all). Finally booted it on a flatscreen and a week later I'm 20+ hours in and totally engrossed.

I should add some recommendations here:

- "The Void" by ice pick lodge- a nightmarish exploration of an afterlife. Devastatingly weird/creepy. Also check out "Pathologic" by the same studio. Some of the most bleak but simultaneously /interesting/ games I've ever played.

- "The Long Dark" - frozen wilderness survival

- "Astroneers"- a very cute planetary survival game with some of the same themes as Subnautica, but (last I played anyway) missing out on the engrossing story.
