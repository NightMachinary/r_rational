I actually do think that I might make a return to Minecraft. Based on that chart, I think I played the bulk of my time in 2010, prior to Alpha 1.2, and obviously mods can really extend the life of the game.

(I'm still going through Subnautica (at a rate of about an hour a night), but the end is in sight.)
