I love Sunless Seas, it's unique cosmic horror and quirky style is a blast. The full soundtrack is also my #1 favorite studying music, but my opinion of it might be warped by my impressions from the game.

That being said I don't think it's a good recommendation here given the heavy story and slow gameplay. There's not much building up, and once you've learned a bit there isn't much tension or threat in the world. It's also a great game to watch let's plays of, since you can speed up/skip the travel times and repetitive tasks.
