Subnautica is good. If you've finished the game, I would watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLsPoJWO-e8][Joseph Anderson's review]] for a look into some of its flaws, and also [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGSa3UbxWo][Three Games to Refund No Man's Sky For]] for some similar recommendations (Subnautica is one of the things recommended in the video). EDIT: No Man's Sky itself has come somewhat close to this. It's not the game it promised at launch yet, but it's really close.

If you last played Minecraft /before/ the dragon, you're missing out on some pretty good content. See [[https://i.redd.it/fz2lgt15czc21.png][this chart]], looking specifically at the major features added after 1.0. It's still a pretty relaxed, easy game, and killing the Dragon is only a soft-ending, but there is a bit more content in-between to see. EDIT: Just saw the graphics stipulation. As always, the solution is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tgevDloTac][MODS]] (haven't watched that video, just the first I found off of Youtube).

RimWorld has a similar end-goal to Subnautica, but it's basically Dwarf Fortress lite, complete with worrying amounts of cannibalism, pain, and death, so I don't think it fits with what you're talking about.

On the other hand, Fallout 4 with proper survival mods is pretty much like this, complete with the base-building mechanics. I haven't played much of any of the Fallouts, but from my experience with modded Skyrim, I know that the simple act of forcing your character to /eat/ goes a long way.
