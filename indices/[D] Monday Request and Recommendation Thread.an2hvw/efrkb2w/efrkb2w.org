I've just read the latest chapter of Lizard Person posted here and now I'm craving more stories about telepathy.

Telepathy is a bit of a broad and vague request. So to specify, I'm asking for stories where the ability to enter another person's mind is a major aspect of the story and I'm very interested in stories where a character spends time in another person's mind (like a mindscape from /Naruto/).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6680379/1/Heresy][Heresy]] - Something goes wrong with Naruto's Kage Bushin, and Sakura and Ino need to enter his mind to help him wake up.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HALOVO/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i3][Patternist Series]] - Doro is a manipulative immortal who lives by stealing the bodies of others. He uses his immortality to breed a race of telepaths and this is the story of an Earth ruled by a master caste of telepaths.
