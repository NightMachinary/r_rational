Well, you're screwed if you want good plot-based Homestuck fics. The well written ones are 99.9% romance based, and you already named the only ones I'd consider rational. You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals][Modern Cannibals]], which is not quite a Homestuck fic, but Homestuck-themed, if that makes sense.
