  *What is glowfic?*

  The short answer is that glowfic is a genre of play-by-post text roleplay mostly characterized by its historical origins. It borrows certain tropes and quirks from a parent RP tradition (that usually took place on LiveJournal or DreamWidth) and the rationalfic genre (warning: TV Tropes link). Some of its defining/idiosyncratic features are, among other things: authors decided in advance (as opposed to anyone being allowed to join any threads), alternate universe versions of characters (original or not), heavy exploitation of magic, resourcefulness, ambition and hubris, suffering, and lots and lots of crossovers. Also so much shipping of everyone with everyone else, it's amazing.
