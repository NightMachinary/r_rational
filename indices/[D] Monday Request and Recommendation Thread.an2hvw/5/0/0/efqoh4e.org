Going to second this recommendation and also the warning associated with it. I had no idea what Prototype was going into it, and only a bit of experience with KnK, but it was really gripping (especially the titular "Lion" character's mental process, as he's crazy). But it ends suddenly and right before a majorly anticipated confrontation, which was incredibly jarring and disappointing.
