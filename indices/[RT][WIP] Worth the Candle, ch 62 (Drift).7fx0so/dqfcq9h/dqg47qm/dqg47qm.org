My thoughts indeed! Whether it's how the System handles demons or beings without souls, it looks like a big glaring blindspot--

--Actually, scratch that. That was my first thought, and would be really exciting (as well as scary) if so, but I'm replacing it with my new first hypothesis that the System is identifying her fine, but /she doesn't have a name/. In that case, with the System just not having a name to put in that position, it should be replaced by a name as soon as someone (the protagonist?) gives it to her (and it's accepted). Not being able to display her name because she doesn't have a name is unfortunately less exciting than not being able to display her name because she doesn't have a soul (or because she's a possessing demon).

Edit: When checking about whether any name was mentioned, I was reminded that Amaryllis is not going to be happy about him choosing to save her, perhaps mollifiable by the Companion status revelation.
