I don't know about that. There's a few ways you could potentially get a null pointer, at least in C:

1) You left your pointer uninitialized, in which case it could be a null pointer or any other random number. You might get a null pointer, but you might also get some random person on the other side of the continent.

2) You tried to allocate memory to store the name, and the memory allocation failed. This is kind of a really weird possibility, because if you're at the point where you can't store a simple string of bytes, there should be a lot of other problems with the simulation.

3) You actually set your pointer as a null pointer.

I actually think 3) is most likely in his instance. If souls themselves are pointers, then the lack of one is arguably a null pointer. The system tried to access the 'soul' pointer and retrieved 0, then tripped the null pointer exception.
