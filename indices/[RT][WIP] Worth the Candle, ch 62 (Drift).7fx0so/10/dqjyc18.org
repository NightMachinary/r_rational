  “They're prone to demonic possession; without a soul, it's easy to enter the body. She won't have any magic that ties to the soul, which means most of them.”

  “We're talking about demonic possession here?” I'd asked.

This confused me a bit. Was Mary originally saying "she's prone to possession", and that had been changed during the editing process? Or is Juniper asking something akin to "She can be possessed by a demon here and now?"
