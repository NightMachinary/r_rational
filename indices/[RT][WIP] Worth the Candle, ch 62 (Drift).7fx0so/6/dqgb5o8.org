Theory: Based on the conversation before he turned the elves into fighting machines, I am making a guess that the method Fallatehr is using to control the shaped is that he has rendered their souls unstable - without a soul mage to maintain them, they will decay and eventually turn soul-less. The non-anima is the result of those experiments, and also a reminder what happens to you if you cross him, which is why he kept it around.

... Which in turn implies the non-anima was the sort of person who would rather go into oblivion than obey Fallatehr. Yhea, if I am right, definitely companion material, tough reconstructing a soul is a tall ask.

Other things soul-magic is very likely to be useful for. Fallatehr edited fear out of himself. The fact that this is possible implies that self-directed soul magic can render Joon zen about the whole leveling process - That is, just straight up carve it out of himself as a value, making his attitude one of "it happens, it happens". That is very good news, because Experience-point addict Joon is not a story line I want to see.
