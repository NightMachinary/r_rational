edit: Thought I'd mention that the first seven foot tall woman reference:

confused me a bit and I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7fx0so/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_62_drift/dqf6liq/][elsewhere in the thread]] other people were confused to. You did mention her at the beginning of the last chapter in the sentence:
