My bet is simply that the "world" of the stimulation is one data structure (a matrix? heh) in the simulating computer system's simulator-process's address space; while souls are simply other data-structures in the same process's address space. By itself, that gives you no more ability to program the simulation than the existence of BLOB-typed records gives you the ability to program a RDBMS.
