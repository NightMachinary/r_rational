Hm.

The rules strongly incentivize finding a way to perfectly hide bodies, as it guarantees victory. The rules also do not state that a player cannot sludge, murder, and dismember another player, then dump pieces of him or her somewhere completely inaccessible for non-dismembered humans.

Speculation: this is why the game will get lethal.
