What do people think about a parent comment in this thread where we can reply to comment on recommendations from previous weeks? Like, "rec x from last week was decent, thanks '[[/u/user123][u/user123]]' " or "rec y was not to my taste", and so on. A minihub for discussion, maybe, which wouldn't interfere with the rest of the thread.
