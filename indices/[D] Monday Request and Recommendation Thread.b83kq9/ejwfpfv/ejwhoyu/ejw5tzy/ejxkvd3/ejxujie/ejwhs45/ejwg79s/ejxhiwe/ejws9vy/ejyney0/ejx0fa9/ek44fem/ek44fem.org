(spoilers)

Only 26 chapters in, and the story's already jumping the shark. It's not really a good and dedicated-enough LitRPG, it's a story that uses LitRPG as an excuse to justify all the silly events and decisions that keep happening to satisfy tropes that the author / audience feel appealing (the Japanese variety of a protagonist with a harem, asocial protagonist somehow managing to become a leader and save everyone, "quirky" and jealous female characters, etc).

Tampa's criticism of "no concept of space" is especially accurate. The inconsistencies are absurdly ridiculous. In one scene, an entire pack of 60, 2-meter tall werewolves is described to be sleeping in one single school computer lab. Later on the character of lv22 manages to fight off against 16 of these werewolves that are lv23--37 in the same room and defeat / kill all of them without dying. In a later scene, a hallway "that was barely 5 arm's width wide" hosted 50 or so boar-like creatures that were in size "akin to a small smart car", "towered a good 7 feet tall, while they were just as wide", and had tusks "about 2 feet long".

Moving on to decision-related non-rational criticisms about this story, the characters get penalised as being irrational and/or zombie-int for the following:

- deciding to kill the whole pack of the werewolves in bulk, without even first testing the principles behind their plan on one single captured werewolf
- not proactively hunting down and killing the player-killing character and his gang after learning about them, and after these PKers keep causing problems for them. The amount of OP power-ups and skills that said PK-character receives is also an example of Diabolus ex Machina.
- after learning that killing "special elites" prevents further spawns of that entire mob class, not only not locating and protecting these special elites from being killed, but actively going out of his way to kill as many of them as possible. His reasoning? He couldn't get stat points and level-ups fast enough, so he decided that hunting down the less than 10 special elites was the way to go about increasing his stats.
- after learning that the food-type mobs have become a non-renewable resource, not controlling and limiting the distribution of food to either only high-level characters, or those characters who were at least willing to start levelling up and contribute to boss-killing efforts.
- deciding to proceed along an unknown path after discovering the xenomorph-[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy][expy's]] boss's skull carapace on that path. By this point they have just recently barely avoided getting a few of their party members killed by a group of "regular" xenomorphs. There's also a possible plot hole here, since the matriarch was somehow dragged by a stronger monster /through/ a closed and painted over entry.
- 4 idiot balls taking effect at once for their group to end up stealing an egg from a boss monster that was using other boss monsters for food.

TL;DR: There are a few interesting ideas in this story, but if you're looking for a good LitRPG to read, there are many better alternatives to exhaust before having to compromise with this out of lack of further choice.

edit: in the later chapters, there is some interesting (experimental, I would say) attempts of examination of problems like control, trust, loyalty, etc. There's also some character development, even if it feels somewhat incongruent with the past profiles of those characters.
