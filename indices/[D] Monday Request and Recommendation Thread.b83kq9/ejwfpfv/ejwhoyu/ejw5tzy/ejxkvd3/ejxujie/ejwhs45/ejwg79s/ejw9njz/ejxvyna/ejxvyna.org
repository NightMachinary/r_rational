Request:

I'm hard to please, and I don't know why. Some stories absolutely grab me and some stories bore me to death, despite being popular with the same people who love the stories I love.

So, I would love it if people could recommend me stuff I might like based on stuff I like and don't like. There's more stuff I don't like, but this is examples of stuff I don't like that I feel I /should/ like given my cultural milieu or whatever.

All in no particular order

LOVE LIST:

- The Martian (book + film)
- Crystal Society (all three books)
- Pretty much everything in the Friendship is Optimal universe
- The Marteian (MLP/Martian crossover fic)
- Animorphs: The Reckoning
- Prime Intellect
- Passages in the Void
- Asimov short stories, but not Foundation
- The Hatchet series of books
- The Hunger Games series of books
- Death Note
- Three Worlds Collide
- Handmaid's Tale
- Stargate (SG1, Atlantis, and Universe)

SHOULD LOVE BUT DON'T LIST:

- LOTR (books + films)
- Rendezvous with Rama
- Player of Games, Consider Phlebas (I really want to love the Culture so if people think there's Culture books I'd love that'd be awesome but I think these are meant to be the two best ones...)
- The Pride of Chanur
- Blindsight
- Foucault's Pendulum
- Superheroes in general
- HPMOR
- Foundation
- Star Wars
- I tried reading Ra on qntm and it never grabbed me

I think there's more stuff I could include, but this is what I happened to write down right now. Would appreciate it if people could help me figure out what makes the second list different from the first.

The first list will also serve as a recommendation list, I suppose!
