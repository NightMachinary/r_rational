I'm going to argue against change:new world. I read it years ago and it just didn't work for me. Let me see if I can dig up my review from back then... [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/63mxkf/monthly_recommendation_thread/dfwn1ir/][ah, here we go]]:

  [[http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/14075][change: new world]]: Avoid it. /Eventually/ you might get drawn into it, and it does improve as time goes on, but the writing isn't very good, the power jumps and rules are seemingly arbitrary, and the author seemingly has no concept of measuring time or distances (I don't care how big your school is, it shouldn't ever take ten minutes to run down a hallway). The world is interesting but basically a trope by now (the world turns into a game and most people die but the high schoolers survive!). I get the impression that the author began this while in high school so there's some amount of wish fulfilment involved. Read about 100 chapters, and it wasn't worth it.

I remember there were some concepts which were creative (like flooding gas into a room to knock out enemies), but the entire thing struck me as a first attempt by a person who played a lot of videogames but hasn't written all that much before. Keep in mind my review was only of the first 100 chapters and that was two years ago; no idea if it's improved or been rewritten since then. But it wasn't even above mediocre from my recollection.
