I mentioned this a few months ago, but I think this is a good time to reiterate: Go watch/read *Kaguya want's to be Confessed to*.

The basis gist of the story is of two highschool students trying to make the other confess. It's funny, heartwarming, and has strangely good worldbuilding/lore for a romcom. It is not rational, and the two MCs are more "Death Note" geniuses than /actual/ geniuses, but it's still very good.

The anime has just finished and it's a good way to jump in (be aware that the anime doesn't adapt everything, so make sure to read any skipped chapters when moving onto the manga).

I highly recommend the work, and I know that several people on this subreddit have already picked it up.
