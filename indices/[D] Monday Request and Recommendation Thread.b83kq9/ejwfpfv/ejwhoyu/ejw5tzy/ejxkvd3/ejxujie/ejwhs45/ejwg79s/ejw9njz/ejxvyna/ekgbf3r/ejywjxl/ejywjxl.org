Does anybody have any idea what happened to Jukepop Web Serials? The old site went down and was replaced, most of the stories on it weren't archived properly on the wayback machine, and there doesn't seem to be any hints or indications about what caused this. I remember it being an extremely active site several years back, but it seemed to drop off the face of the earth at the end of 2016. My guess is a lawsuit, but idk.

On a side note, does anyone remember reading Gentleman's Guide to Hunting Fantastic Beast by Serji Perjes? I've only been able to find three of the archived chapters, and would gladly take any similar recommendations.
