Thanks for the rec. Just read it all and it's very good, had me giggling a lot, though you're right that it gets more serious. Which is a good thing since the humour could have gotten tiresome after a while. It becomes an actual decent story/character growth arc.

Agree with your rating, and in terms of pure entertainment value I probably enjoyed it even more than A Bad Name. Will be following this one.
