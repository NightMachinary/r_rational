Some traditional book recommendations, for once!

1. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise?ac=1&from_search=true][Ash and Sand series, Richard Nell]]. Not rational, but a very good "gritty" fantasy. Although it's dark, the story is about overcoming this rather than revelling in how grim and depressing everything is so I'm not calling it grimdark. The first book is low magic, although with some clearly impossible things, while the second book ramps up the fantasy elements a lot. I've just been watching Sanderson's lectures on writing which are linked in the wiki here, and one element he mentioned as important is a sense of progression throughout the story. That's one thing I personally also find very satisfying, and this series does it extremely well. The characters are interesting, the world is not a carbon copy of medieval Europe and has a genuinely different culture which makes sense based on the physical situation, lots of elements really work. Highly recommend.

2. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21801573-the-march-north][Commonweal series, Graydon Saunders]]. This has been recommended here before, but I thought I'd bring it up again because it's so unique and seemingly under-appreciated. I'll mention first, it's rational. The March North (linked) is the first book, but you can also start with the second book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25635541-a-succession-of-bad-days][A Succession of Bad Days]] which IMO is the best of the series so far (they are very different books however.) The setting is a ground-up imagining of a world with "the Power," which is magic that can do almost anything. People's ability to do things with Power is inborn, determined by their "Talent" which, the characters in-story note, is on bimodal distribution; normal near 0 but the tails follow a power law. So every once in a while there is an extremely powerful sorceror that can do almost anything. But because of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbesian_trap][Hobbesian trap]]-type logic the choice for a powerful sorceror is to either build up an army by enslaving other lesser sorcerors and the general population (most of whom can use magic to some extent, or at least are useful as sacrifices in rituals) or be enslaved or killed by those that do. Where the story starts, this has been going on for thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, while the story is set in a relatively new polity (the Commonweal) that is organised like a parliamentary democracy. The story, starting with the second book after the first makes the violence very clear, follows a group of new, very powerful sorcerors that are all completely untrained and thus will die if they don't learn to control their magic. The great (and rational) part about it is that they get extremely good tutoring from experienced mages and work hard, and...nothing particularly goes wrong. So why read about them rather than the violent establishment of this new government, or some other rocky period in the Commonweal's history? The story emphasises things like building, creating, cooperation, law, equality, choice, and so on. It takes these people with this immensely destructive power (like, annihilate everyone within square kilometres with a thought+) and they only use it on creating works of public good. It's so refreshing compared to pretty much everything else where fighting would be front and center. Plus, the magic is just /damn cool/. If it sounds at all interesting, have a look at some of the reviews on Goodreads and pick it up.

3. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control?ac=1&from_search=true][Version Control, Dexter Palmer]]. This is more on the literary fiction side, but it's also sci-fi. Not rational, but it's sort of a deconstruction slash homage to magical-realism so I'd say that being rational isn't the point, and wouldn't improve the story. Overall, it's the best book I've read in years. It doesn't do anything amazingly out-there, but it's /incredibly/ well-constructed. I struggle to say, "This was what was great about it," because the real magic is in how everything combines together. It kind of hits all the checkboxes, interesting concept, great characters, interesting ideas/extrapolations, good philosophical discussion/moments that actually make you think without being in-your-face or preachy, and importantly a solid plot with great pacing that makes the story easy to read, almost a page-turner. I would recommend paying attention as you read, as some things you might think are a mistake are actually not, and details matter. But you can also just read it for the story and enjoy it. Can't recommend it enough.
