My understanding of rational fiction is that it doesn't have to be realistic necessarily, but rather consistent. There are also in-universe reasons for the guns to be a bit slow, which I won't go into here for fear of spoilers. (It has to do with the target scan they perform in real-time)

If you look at the sidebar, I would argue that PP satisfies at least some ratfic criteria:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources. (although this one is a bit forced, since I'd argue the characters are generally competent and intelligent but don't display particularly creative solutions)
- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

Still, I suppose that a case could be made that PP is just rational-adjacent as opposed to rational. It's a matter of interpretation.
