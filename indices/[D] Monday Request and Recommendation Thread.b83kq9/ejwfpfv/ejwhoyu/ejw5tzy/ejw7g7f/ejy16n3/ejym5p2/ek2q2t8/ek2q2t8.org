Didn't really like Made in Abyss, world building was quite poor, the rules they establish don't seem like they would at all result in what it is presented.

I don't know how anyone in the rational community can think that the world building was fantastic. It was a classic this looks pretty or seems nice so we'll have it and pretend it has no repercussions on anything (it reminded me most of Harry Potter, let's have a school with kids and not think about what that means for the wizarding population). It's been a while since I watched it but I remember that I really struggled to finish the show. Also I don't think it changes how good the show is but it is basically abuse porn so if you don't like that you'll also not enjoy the show.

Pyscho Pass is the only other one I've watched and that was good.
