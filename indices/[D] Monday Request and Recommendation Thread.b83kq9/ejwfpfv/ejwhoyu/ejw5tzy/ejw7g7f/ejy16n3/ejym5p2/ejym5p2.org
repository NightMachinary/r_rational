  *Shin Sekai Yori* is a series I've already recommended in the past, but since it's one of my all time favorites and among the most rational in its world-building I think it's fitting to mention every now and then. Amazing atmosphere and a chilling and superbly constructed plot in a utopic/dystopic post-apocalyptic setting with psychokinetic powers. (Rational)

Really good anime, and I second the recommendation.

... for the anime.

Don't read the manga. It's smut (mixed with horror). The only interesting part to it was seeing the differences between the manga's story and the anime; it made me wonder how much else was cut/changed.

  */Made in Abyss/* is a hauntingly beautiful show about the descent of two children into a mysterious and dangerous giant chasm, i.e. the titular abyss. The setting is really intriguing and some of the scenes are quite emotional and disturbing. Still waiting for a second season, so proceed at your own risk! (I wouldn't call it rational, but the world-building is fantastic)

I'm a bit on the fence about it. I liked the worldbuilding and the animation style (the characters reminded me of the characters in Final Fantasy Tactics), but the story's mood could vacillate wildly. It starts out feeling like a shounen anime but has some straight-up seinen scenes involving torture and body horror. Really inconsistent tone. And it was really uncomfortable how the author for this seemed to revel in getting a ~10 year old girl naked, tortured, or both. I felt like I was watching someone's fetish brought to animation.
