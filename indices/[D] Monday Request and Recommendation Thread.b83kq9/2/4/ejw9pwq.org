I am not sure how I felt about made in Made in Abyss. (minor spoilers) It had the same problem as a lot of shows that pretend to be one thing and then filp the tone for shock value. The mc's going down the hole is a really stupid decision but I extended my suspension of disbelief becuse that is the type of desion people make in cute adventure shows in order for the plot to happen. Only the anime it's self let didn't that fly and had the mc's punished for that decision. Now I think that the mc is a moron and feel like I wasted my time watching one thing only for it to be change into something I don't like. Also that last episode with the fucking elevator scene pissed me off and then the show ended giveing me no closure. On the other hand the bit I did like was good. I would recomend not watching the last episoded untill the next seson come out as the second till last was a better ending point.
