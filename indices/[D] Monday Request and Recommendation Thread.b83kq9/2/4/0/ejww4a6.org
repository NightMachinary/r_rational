It's heavily implied that Riko has essentially no choice in choosing to go down the abyss-- everything from the abyss eventually returns to it, and it seems like there's some kind of compulsion driving people down. Also, Made in abyss telegraphed that it was going to be fucked up pretty early on. A little girl finds praying skeletons and get attacked by fuckhuge monsters on the very first level, and we're explicitly told it gets more dangerous as you go down.

Also, as for watching made in abyss and expecting to ever be satisfied... Fluffy moments are plentiful, but ultimately transient instants between nonstop emotional fuckery.
