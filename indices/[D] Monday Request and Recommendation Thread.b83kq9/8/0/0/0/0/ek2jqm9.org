  I am surprised you like Stargate, though - what I've seen of it seemed to be pretty formulaic.

It is, and maybe I only love it because I started watching it at about age 14 or 15? The worldbuilding is fun, the show is fun, the characters are fun.

Thanks for expanding on your thoughts! That's very helpful.

  The second is just a good fun romp in the early books and gradually add more and more thought provoking / hard sci-fi themes.

I think that might be the "problem" I have: I like books that lay it all on the table pretty quickly, and I really don't like the thought of "getting through" the first books because it really gets good in the third book, you know? Like I watched the original star wars movies, the first two, and didn't watch the third. I've had people say "you have to watch the third! it's the best one!" and I'm like if the first two did nothing for me I don't think the third is gonna suddenly be my favourite film, y'know?

  Death Gate Cycle is high fantasy but I recommend it over something like LOTR because it doesn't take itself seriously in the least and the overarching story and background setting are interesting. Written the nineties, I believe, so some elements have become played out over the years if you read a lot of fantasy.

I read almost no fantasy, but I haven't really liked high fantasy - but I think I also haven't really given it a chance. I might see if I can get a sample for that on Kindle (doesn't look like I can...). I'll try Beyonders Book 1 since I can get a sample delivered! I'll also get a sample of Feed.

Thanks :)
