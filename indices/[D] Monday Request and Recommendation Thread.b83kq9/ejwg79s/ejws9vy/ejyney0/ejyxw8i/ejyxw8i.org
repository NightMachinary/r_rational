I agree with some parts of your statement but not above mediocre? I read alot of stuff on royalroadl because there are only so many rational stories on this subreddit and let me tell you the stuff on royalroadl is all together below mediocre compared to the RT stories on this subreddit.

But, apocalyptic litrpg is it's own genre which is prevalent on royalroadl and I can say with no doubt it is the best apocalyptic litrpg on the website.

Compare change:new world with the statistically most popular apocalyptic litrpg on royalroadl, Randidly Ghosthound. Randidly ghosthound is trash incarnate. The side characters of randidly have no motivations of their own or substance while change:new world has a solid cast of side characters. Randidly tries and fails to make a new interesting society with the unrealistic game elements while change:new world has a society yet explored giving in to the more apocalyptic feel.

As for wish fulfillment...they both suffer from the OP wish fulfillment MC but I like to think the OP MC wish fulfillment from change:new world is more “believable” due to the hard circumstances.

But, I also concede the fact that it looks like the MC from change:new world [[/spoiler][Is the only one with the identify skill which is beyond broken.]]

Also, can you guys believe that the author of randidly ghosthound makes $5-7k a month from patreon?
