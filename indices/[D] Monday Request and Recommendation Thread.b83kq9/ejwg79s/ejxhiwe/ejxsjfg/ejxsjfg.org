I second Siren Song. It's technically well written and most importantly original. The protagonist is an OC outside of Brockton Bay, but it managed to still be captivating even for me, who can't usually get into original characters and settings in Wormfic. The powers and villains are original and fresh, instead of the typical level grinding and overwhelming firepower versus generic brute/blaster enemies many choose to go with.
