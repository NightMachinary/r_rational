The most similar in terms of genre/meta-awareness and fitting your points would be would be [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]] (NSFW!) which is a porn quest where the litrpg aspect is based on eroge rather than standard fantasy RPGs. I don't rate it as highly as WtC but it's better than every other litRPG I've read. If you can get over the NSFW nature of it (or if that isn't a problem in the first place) it's pretty good.

Here's a list of other litRPGs I've read recently. None of these are rational at all unless specifically mentioned:

Books:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36431054-beginner-s-luck][Character Development series, Aaron Jay]]. This one has a slightly different concept I guess, it's not really believable but whatever, it's essentially just background detail. The actual story was fairly competently written (at least better than what you typically find on Royal Road) but had some lengthy political rants which could be a turnoff. Otherwise it's just mindless entertainment like most LitRPGs.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38739408-ritualist?ac=1&from_search=true][Completionist Chronicles series, Dakota Krout]]. Utterly standard. Dropped it about a third of the way through the second book because there's no plot.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36483019-level-up-or-die?ac=1&from_search=true][Underworld series, Apollos Thorne]]. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8397/underworld-level-up-or-die][RoyalRoad preview]]. It's just a group of people summoned to a dungeon and they proceed to grind levels. Despite that, it's kind of engaging, particularly if you're the kind of person that likes incremental games, like me. Dropped it somewhere in the third book though.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39908465-restart?ac=1&from_search=true][Level up series, Dan Sugralinov]]. Barely got started, the start seems boring. Maybe it's better later, but I have other stuff to read.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43308857-polyglot?ac=1&from_search=true][Polyglot: NPC Revolution, D. Richardson]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20247/polyglotnpcrevolution][Royal Road]]. Have read about 6 chapters, might continue when I run low on other things. Nothing earth-shattering so far.

Royal Road (ones I have bookmarked):

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]]. Very long, reasonably entertaining. Writing isn't great, but it's not the worst either. As mindless entertainment, you could do worse.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21361/skyclad][Skyclad]]. Was good enough that I read up to the latest chapter at one point, but I haven't gone back to it in a month or two. Take from that what you will.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21178/the-outer-sphere][The Outer Sphere]]. Same comment as Skyclad.

Tried a lot more that I couldn't get into and can't be bothered digging up the names/links.

Worm litRPG fics (in order of "recommendation"):

1. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/#post-32256937][A Bad Name]]. The best of the Worm/Gamer fics. I actually keep up with this one as it updates.

2. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/][The Paragamer]]. Not Brockton Bay based (yet), which is nice. Read A Bad Name over this in general, but if you're looking for more, this is OK too.

3. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/][Siren Song]]. Similar as previous.

999. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/brockton-in-venatus-worm-gamer-oc-taylor.451374/][Brockton: In Venatus]]. I hardly even want to admit to reading this, but if you have a weakness for the occasional OP SI stomp fic then go for it.

I've also read Wandering Inn to a point (2.5ish?), but gave it up after a while as it was no longer holding my interest.

I wouldn't exactly /recommend/ any of the ones I've listed, but if you're not picky, have a look.
