It's probably just that Symbiote was posted a long time ago, but I'd agree it's worth a read (and recommendation).

While you're reading farmerbob1, I would highly recommend [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/][Set In Stone]], which is a slow-burning downlift/uplift-in-progress story that is drastically different from Symbiote but definitely worth a try.

The story follows a rational, innovative protagonist as he solves all his problems with his herd of swine (only partially joking). I would say reading the prologue and first chapter should be enough to give a hint whether you'll enjoy it, but if that type of story doesn't do it for you then be aware that the protagonist makes a breakthrough that puts him in touch with the world-governing AI that is uplifting humanity, and adds a whole new dynamic to the story.

[[/u/farmerbob1]] If you don't mind my asking, it looks like this was completed in 2015 and the site says it's the first book in a planned series. Is that still the goal?
