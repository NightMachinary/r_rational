I eat reasonably well, but I have never been one to exercise much, since I left the Army. Between stopping smoking a few years back, and discovering the joys of middle age, I am more than a bit overweight, but I can still move around easily.

That said, yes, I need to lose weight before I develop unpleasant side effects.
