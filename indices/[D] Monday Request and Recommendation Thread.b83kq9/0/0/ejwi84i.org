Most stuff that gets recommended is old enough that others have read it already. In this very thread, there is a discussion about the merits of some of the recommendations (and I have done similar things in previous weeks). Basically, I think this function is already satisfied by sub threads from people who have already read/are already reading a given recommendation. These threads aren't usually so busy that there would be a big cost to adding such a sticky, but I'm not sure how much value it would add, when at least some of that kind of discussion is already happening.
