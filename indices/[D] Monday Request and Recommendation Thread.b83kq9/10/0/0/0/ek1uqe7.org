I'm sorry. I did my absolute best and I really wanted to find the story after reading the first chapter and I was disappointed that I couldn't find it at all.

All I found was someone asking the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/10511562/][same thing]] on Sufficient Velocity about a year ago. I even made an account to ask him, but I need to have had made at least three posts before I can send a message. Do you want to try messaging him?
