I appreciate so many recommendations, but I'm not sure where to start, especially because none of them really grabbed me with their descriptions.

The only one that really grabbed me was Feed, and that was only a little, and probably only because it seemed to have a vaguely decent sci-fi premise (even though the premise seems to be... bloggers stopping vampires?).

The rest all seem very high fantasy or space opera-y, both of which I don't seem to like (another one on the "should love but don't" list: star wars!, but I do LOVE Stargate which is also pretty space opera-y too...).

I'm sure since you took the time to recommend them there must be a reason, so I'd love some more detail?
