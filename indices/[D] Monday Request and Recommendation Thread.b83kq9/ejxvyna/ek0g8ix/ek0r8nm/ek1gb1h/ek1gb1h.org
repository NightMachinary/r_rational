I haven't read all of the books you listed as liking or disliking but it seems like you enjoy books that are thought provoking and lean rational with a decent pace. What you dislike seem to be books where the prose itself drags down the story or pacing or is full of itself. I am not surprised you didn't like Star Wars, which I've always thought kind of slow. I am surprised you like Stargate, though - what I've seen of it seemed to be pretty formulaic.

I'm not the best at describing things so I figured I'd see which summaries and reviews grabbed your attention.

Since you didn't specify genres, I just tried to give a broad range of sci-fi/fantasy series that fit the above and would have broad appeal. There are two on there I would call space opera or military sci fi (the first one and the Vorkosigan Saga, though they're rather different). The first I find amazing because the author managed to convincingly have a character be basically omniscient, but still have a story. The second is just a good fun romp in the early books and gradually add more and more thought provoking / hard sci-fi themes. If you're not a fan of space opera I would probably skip the Jon and Lobo one too, as that one has a lot of similar elements to space operas (Sentient outlaw space ships just do not fit in what I'd call Space Opera but looking at that Goodreads page, apparently others would.)

Death Gate Cycle is high fantasy but I recommend it over something like LOTR because it doesn't take itself seriously in the least and the overarching story and background setting are interesting. Written the nineties, I believe, so some elements have become played out over the years if you read a lot of fantasy.

Garrett PI is a mystery/urban fantasy with a smart and witty MC. /On A Plane Horse/ is the first of a series half urban fantasy/half regular fantasy about what it would be like if major aspects of reality were embodied (think Greek gods) - death, war, time, fate, etc.

Beyonders is one of the better YA/children's regular fantasy seriee, if you like that sort of thing. Very readable as an adult. The Corean Chronicles is in a similar vein, but geared for adults. Probably the most "traditional" fantasy series on this list aside from Death Gate Cycle. It has a cool magic system, world building, characters, etc.

Feed is a zombie apocoplypse book with at least one great twist. I usually dislike zombie & vampire books but I like Mira Grant's (aka Seanan McGuire's) take.
