I really recommend Binding of Isaac Rebirth, and I will add Dead Cells and Risk of Rain 2 fill a similar niche of constant improvement and cool items, with the latter having some excellent multiplayer. Celeste is also great.

Into the Breach was a bit too cerebral and repetitive for my tastes though, it's a bit like chess, too much like work for what I look for in a video game.
