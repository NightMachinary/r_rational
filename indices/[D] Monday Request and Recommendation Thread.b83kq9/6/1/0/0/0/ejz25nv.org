I have no opinion on the work in question or the rest of the genre, since I've never read any of it, but I'm not sure we should be recommending stuff just because the bar set by the rest of the genre is so low. It sounds like that means maybe the genre as a whole is, at least for now, worth avoiding. We should expect quality no matter what genre or type of media we are consuming. Being the best of a sub-par bunch is still not great.
