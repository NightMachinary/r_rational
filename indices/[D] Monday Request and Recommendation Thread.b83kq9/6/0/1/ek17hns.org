Another Worm litRPG fic I'd recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/][A daring synthesis]], which focuses on Greg Veder as a protagonist. I rate it up there with A Bad Name in quality, though it has a somewhat different focus - Greg is very much a flawed hero, portrayed here as something of an edgy 4channer. Much of the story focuses on the comedy that comes about with someone so socially disconnected being forced into social connection. That being said, it gets more serious as it goes on.
