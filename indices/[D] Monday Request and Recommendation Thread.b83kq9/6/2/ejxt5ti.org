I've mentioned this earlier, but the translated chapters of "The Amber Sword" radiates an overwhelming sense of played-straight CHIVALRY and HONOUR that leaves the reader feeling he's sweating behind a visor on horseback himself. The translator also helped edit the work to make it more fit the taste for western audiences, your mileage may vary.

The MC's also really good at motivational speeches, which I recommend aspiring writers take inspiration from. Trigger warning: include Japanese/Chinese RPG elements, points-don't-matter stats and items, and unashamedly ripping off Magic the Gathering card game mechanics. 224 chapters translated out of 1200+, the original webnovel is finished.
