Yes. I plan to write more, but I currently make a living as an OTR truck driver.

In fact, I recently bought a truck, and am busting my tail to get it paid off.

And, if working 70+ hours a week isn't enough, I am still pursuing a patent, which eats up most of my free time.

Working 12-14 hours a day leaves me little downtime to do much more than sleep.

Eventually, if the patent doesnt pay off first, I will try to have both a truck and house free and clear, and only drive 8-9 months of every year.

The funny thing is that despite working more hours per week than just about any time of my life, and having little time to devote to writing, I am happy. I enjoy driving and am good at it.

The beauty of the great open rural spaces in the US is breathtaking. I'm afraid driving is now something of an addiction.
