I was surprised that a cursory search didn't turn up a recommendation for the (now completed) web serial [[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/chapter-1-a-meeting-of-the-minds/][Symbiote]] (and if I'm mistaken and it has been recommended before, then it's been long enough that I think it's worth bringing back up). It's a pretty interesting story about symbiotic artificial organisms that have perfect control over internal biology, as well as nanoscale construction and quantum computing. The story explores the implications of that kind of powerset and and the psychology of what humans do when given those abilities. The worldbuilding is interesting, the characters have well defined goals that they pursue rationally, and the outcomes of changes are realistically propagated throughout the world.

My biggest critique of the story is that the dialogue is pretty stilted and doesn't feel very natural. There is hardly a single conversation in the whole thing that feels like the way two people would actually communicate. Additionally, it has a pretty major powercreep issue (although the author deals with it better than some other stories I have read), and the main character is an acknowledged Gary Stue.

Despite these issues, I think it's worth a read.
