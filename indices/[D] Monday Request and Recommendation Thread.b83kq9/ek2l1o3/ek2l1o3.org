I would like to point folks at some books I recently listened to. Dennis E. Taylor, his Bobiverse series. Strongly rational, and even touching on some basic rationalistic concepts rather than simply making sense.

I must admit to having a soft spot in my heart for fictional characters with the first name Bob.

Bob is the result of corpsicle technology being abused in a dystopian future. However, he plays along as a good little recorded brain in a box, until he decides to stop playing by the rules. Then the fun begins.
