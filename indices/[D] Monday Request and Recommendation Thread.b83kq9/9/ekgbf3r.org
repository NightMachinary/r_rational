I am currently listening to the 'Threadbare' LitRPG series by Seiple.

At first glance, it might seem to be a young adult series, but it is actually quite well-written from the evolving point of view of the protagonist.

The protagonist is a teddy bear animated as a greater golem, allowing it true sapience, and the ability to gain levels, stats, and skills.

It's a interesting take on an alternate intelligence, and, surprisingly, it all holds together pretty well - at least through the first book, and halfway into the second. The protagonist mostly seems to demonstrate believable mistakes. There are a few instances where certain characters can be seen holding an idiot ball, but the protagonist is actually enjoyably rational, to the extent that he can be, based on his evolving intelligence and abilities.
