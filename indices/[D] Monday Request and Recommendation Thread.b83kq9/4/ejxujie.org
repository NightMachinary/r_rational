I recently read [[http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/176254611660/sugaru-miakis-your-story-part-1][Your Story]], a japanese novel by Sugaru Miak that takes place in a world where people commonly purchase fake memories to make up for their various deficiencies in life. Fake familes, honeymoons, childhoods, lovers, you name it.

The story is about Chihiro, a man who abhors the practice of implanting fake memories, who unintentionally finds himself burdened and tormented by incredibly realistic fake memories of a childhood friend. To make matters worse, he then meets her in real life, even when all signs point to her being a fabrication.

It's a story that'll leave you wondering what is real and what it is that even defines the word "real". Are artificial feelings and memories any less meaningful if they've been so perfectly manufactured that you can't tell the difference?
