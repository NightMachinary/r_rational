After the recent anime announcement, I've read the Beastars manga and would recommend it to anyone. Great characterizations and worldbuilding. I have no doubt it would be a serious contender for the AOTY title if the anime can manage two third of the manga's quality,

Only weakness I could think of is that there is one part where it really pushes the suspension of disbelief, but it's early on in the story and the chapters after have consistent quality.
