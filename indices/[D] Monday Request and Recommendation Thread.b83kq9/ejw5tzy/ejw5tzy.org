Here's some anime recommendations you fellow [[/r/rational][r/rational]] dwellers might enjoy!

​

*/The Promised Neverland/* season one has just finished airing and I found it to be really intriguing and genuinely clever and engaging. I highly suggest to go in blind! I haven't read the manga, by the way, which I heard is also really good. (Rational)

​

*/Shin Sekai Yori/* is a series I've already recommended in the past, but since it's one of my all time favorites and among the most rational in its world-building I think it's fitting to mention every now and then. Amazing atmosphere and a chilling and superbly constructed plot in a utopic/dystopic post-apocalyptic setting with psychokinetic powers. (Rational)

​

*/Psycho Pass/* also counts as an amazing morally grey dystopic cyberpunk thriller. Absolutely recommended if you're into the genre. (Rational)

​

*/Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor/* deserves some mention as the most thrilling high-stakes gambling anime out there. The pacing is agonizingly slow at times, but if you enjoy mind games and strategy you will most likely have a great time binge-watching this. (Rational-adjacent)

​

*/Made in Abyss/* is a hauntingly beautiful show about the descent of two children into a mysterious and dangerous giant chasm, i.e. the titular abyss. The setting is really intriguing and some of the scenes are quite emotional and disturbing. Still waiting for a second season, so proceed at your own risk! (I wouldn't call it rational, but the world-building is fantastic)
