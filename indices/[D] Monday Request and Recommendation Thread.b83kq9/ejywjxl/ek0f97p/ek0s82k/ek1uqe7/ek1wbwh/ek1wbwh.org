Thanks for trying! As much as I'd like to find the story I'd much rather know what happened to Jukepop. Several hours looking for answers has lead me to nothing but speculation and frustration. My best guess is that the site owners were hit with several lawsuits over publishing rights, or something along similar lines, but again, it's only a guess.
