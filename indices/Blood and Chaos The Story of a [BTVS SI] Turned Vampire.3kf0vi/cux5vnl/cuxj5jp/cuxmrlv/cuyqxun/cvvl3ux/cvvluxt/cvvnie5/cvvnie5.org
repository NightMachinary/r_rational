  Out of curiosity, what exceptions might you recommend?

For the ones where the sex scenes are actually well-done? Well, my standards are simply if it's good enough for me to still remember it a few days later, which is only two of them.

First up is [[http://www.amazon.com/Good-Intentions-Elliott-Kay-ebook/dp/B0054E8QYE][Good Intentions]] by Elliot Kay. The sex scenes were fairly well-written and actually spent some time focused on the women's pleasure instead of being like other stories where it's all about the male enjoying a sex-doll of a partner. I also liked it because of how the sex was used as part of the plot instead of being gratuitous (at least not too much). I liked the story, but it's not too rational.

Next up is [[http://www.talesofmu.com/about][Tales of MU]] which I'm only 50 chapters into, but I really like how strongly the author is focusing on the multiple sexual relationships between different monster species with wildly different cultural expectations about sex. As well as highlighting the spectrum of unhealthy relationships to positive ones. The only thing I'm uncertain about is how well she's depicting BDSM and similar actions. It's different from what I expected, but I realize that my expectations were colored by popular media and trashy romance novels, so I could be just wrong about how being sexually submissive and dominant works.

They both involve sex as part of the plot and as a positive relationship experience like how [[/u/TimeLoopPowerGamer]] does for his stories.

Also, I was surprised to receive a comment from you within half an hour of me posting a comment on a thread where no one else had commented anything for about two weeks. Are you following me online?

Because if so, I'm actually flattered. I didn't think I was interesting enough to be watched by anyone. Well that and the fact that I kinda look up to you for being able to write something as awesome as SI.
