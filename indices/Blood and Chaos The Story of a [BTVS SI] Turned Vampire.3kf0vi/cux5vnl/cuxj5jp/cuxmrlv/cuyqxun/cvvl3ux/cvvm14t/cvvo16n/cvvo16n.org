Oops! I posted a comment earlier to you earlier, but it looks like my computer didn't post it. Argh...

Anyway to recap, have a follow from me on AO3 and fanfiction for your upcoming chapters. ;)

  Tonks as a post-gendered, sex-positive, magical transhumanist bodyguard

You need to do this for NaNoWriMo. /DDDDDooooo it!/

So many writers just use Tonks as a perfect disiusger, or even as someone who can become the woman of your dreams without even addressing the potential psychological issues that might have (does he love me for me, or just who I can become?) or even take advantage of the more esoteric uses of her ability (hello eternal youth and quick route to super-strength). The closest was someone commenting that her clumsiness could be due to her body-shape and mass changing so often that her brain just can't learn the proper muscle memory quickly enough before her body changes again.
