Regarding protagonist's amorality: in Buffy Universe becoming a vampire means that the original person “dies” and a “soulless” demon inhabits their body afterwards. Being “soulless” in turn means that a vampire doesn't care much about morality and generally lacks compassion and empathy.

There was a lot of drama strewn around this with two major characters. I'm guessing later on Jack will either recover his soul or discover that it's gradually “recovering” with time.
