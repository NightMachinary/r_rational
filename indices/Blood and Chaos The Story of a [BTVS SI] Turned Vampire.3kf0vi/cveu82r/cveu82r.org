Little help here, what's all of [BTVS SI] stand for?

I've watched all of Buffy, way back when, and just tried reading this. It seems interesting, think I'm going to keep going, but I'm confused. Either I'm forgetting a ton of Buffy (which is very possible) or all this starling / mother / father stuff is not part of Buffy cannon?

Thanks.
