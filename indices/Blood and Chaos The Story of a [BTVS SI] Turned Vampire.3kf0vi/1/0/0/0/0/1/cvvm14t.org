Glad you liked. Got 30k more just for my unfinished works on AO3. Editing them all this weekend. Will publish more soon, that's a promise.

Wish I could publish like people on SB but I can't keep up that schedule right now--/publishing/ even 1k every two or three days would be grueling for me

I still write that much all the time, mind. More really. My folders are just full of unedited stuff. I just don't publish it because reasons. But my still unpublished HP smut with Tonks as a post-gendered, sex-positive, magical transhumanist bodyguard-slash-first for Harry will be my shining moment of fanfic smut. Just you wait and see...sometime in 2016, most likely. Sigh.
