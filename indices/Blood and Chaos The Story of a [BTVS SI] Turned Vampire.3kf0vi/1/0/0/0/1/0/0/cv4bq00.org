Actually it would probably also be awesome to just have them have a healthy relationship already early on/from the beginning. You know, intelligent stories where love and/or sex is neither the main focus of the story nor something kept in the background.

Or maybe I myself don't know what I want due to the lack of finding such things often enough to compare them to each other.
