This, of course, opens up a very interesting ecological question. Hosts are obviously used to transport individual yeerk shards for the purposes of genetic and memetic mixing, and to protect and maintain pools. But they are apparently not the primary source of biological energy actually running their metabolism. I wonder where that comes from in the natural ecology.
