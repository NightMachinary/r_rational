I'm actually surprised *no one besides Tyagi* has mixed up Thàn and Tom yet considering how similar the two sound. This is interesting:

  “This Tom person you arrived with?”

Does Thàn and Tom sound different in thought-speech?

Also...Thàn is apparently Vietnamese for 'God'. Atlas Labs. Suoros doesn't return any direct translations, but Suor does - Portugese for 'sweat'. The god that sweats holding up the sky? Appropriate, considering his vigil with Serenity.
