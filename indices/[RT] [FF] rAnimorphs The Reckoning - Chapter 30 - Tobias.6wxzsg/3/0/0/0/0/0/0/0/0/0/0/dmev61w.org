Not necessarily, in the broadcast; a lot of the way that scene was depicted had a "this is what it looks like to the viewer, who is not already an insider to this alien knowledge" quality to it. My mind glossed over it as, "Oh, that's a Hork-Bajir, and the language being used is allowing the reader to occupy the viewer's perspective, regarding this broadcast."
