Really enjoyed the chapter, but in the interest of actually having (hopefully constructive) criticism for once:

1) Tobias came off a bit too uncertain of himself when talking to Tyagi. I get that he was off kilter due to the stress of the circumstances, but as he mentioned, he's been through a /lot/ at this point. Maybe I'm forgetting that this level of second guessing and being unsure of himself and having mental stutters is part of his character, and there was attention put on lampshading all this, which is good, but it still felt a bit much: I felt a bit annoyed with him. He also didn't even consider that he might not actually talking to the president, once he realized she was morphed.

2) There was a lot of "wait, /what/ happened?" going on in the beginning, to the point where I actually went back a couple chapters to make sure I didn't miss one. For the first time I felt like too much had happened off screen between chapters. Not sure how reproducible this problem is if story is all read in one go, just thought I'd point it out.

Overall still enjoyed the chapter a lot: particularly Tobias's musings on flying :)
