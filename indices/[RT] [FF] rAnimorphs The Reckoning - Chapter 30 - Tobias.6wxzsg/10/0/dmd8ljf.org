Yeah, I'm starting to bump up against "it's hard to do chapter viewpoint switching." Ideally, I could've shown more of Rachel or Marco's perspective from inside the base, but it's been soooooo loooooong since a Tobias chapter, and I really don't want to crawl inside David's head, so this was the solution. Perhaps inelegant; I can foresee at least once more in the arcs plotted so far where you might be similarly sad that stuff happens off-screen, but mostly this was the high water mark (or low point, if you prefer).
