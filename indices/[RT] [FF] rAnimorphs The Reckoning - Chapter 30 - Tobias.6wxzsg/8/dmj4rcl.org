Right now the thing I'm excited for the most is when the Ellimist's and the Crayak's involvement become common knowledge among the human command structure, and all of a sudden the President and all of her advisers have start seriously considering the possibility that the Animorph's continued insights, decisions, and general involvement might actually be crucial for any kind of human victory.

Also I'm starting to really like the idea of a Human - Yeerk aliance, even if it kind of creeped me out at first. It does seem to be the best solution. From what happened with Ax when he bonded with his yeerk, a yeerk doesn't have to fully dominate a human it bonds with. And that got me wondering; in this new partnership, would the unit of Yeerk inserted into individual humans actually have to be its own independent sentient being?

From what I've understood of Yeerk culture and biology, the true individual among their species is the greater Yeerk pool, to the point where killing sentient Controllers isn't truly considered murder. What the main characters have interacted with are essentially just fragments of that greater whole. So here's my idea:

If we're going full integration, only put enough Yeerk into the average individual human to act as a vaguely sentient 'third hemisphere' of the brain. We already have two hemispheres that can act more or less on their own when the connection between them is severed. If I (an average Joe) was given the choice, I would definitely sign up for having a third over implanting another voice into my head.

That way, the greater Yeerk Hive Mind could enjoy the memories it wanted without significantly compromising humanity's agency, or causing intolerable human suffering. And perhaps humanity could fully donate the brain dead to the Yeerks, if the Hive Mind wanted it's own individual, fully controlled bodies, so that no living minds have to be truly enslaved.

And if this fic ever goes full transhumanist and implements some genetic engineering a la the Iskoort from canon, it seems to me to be most plausible way Humans and Yeerks could ever become one species. Two human brain hemispheres, like we have now, and third, detachable Yeerk hemisphere.

TL: DR - Only put a little Yeerk in individual humans, so that the Hive Mind can have the memories and experiences it desires without having to take slaves.
