Doh, missed that. First hypothesis becomes still less plausible.

Though, I think the tap idea also loses credibility. It only works as a trap if it could plausibly /not/ be one. "Dracon" might be a risk the tap setter chose to take, but "and a lite" now sounds like steganography; "I know what this is, and if you can read this message, I want you to know that I know".

I don't know why anyone would be doing this, but I'm not ruling it out.
