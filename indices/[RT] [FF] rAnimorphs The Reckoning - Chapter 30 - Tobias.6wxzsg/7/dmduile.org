One of the things I like best about this story is how it just.doesn't.stop. I really felt for Jake there in the woods--even with morphs to keep exhaustion at bay, he's running on empty. Throughout the story, and especially in this chapter, you don't forget for a single moment how high the stakes are and how quickly time is running out.

I'm also happy to see Tyagi seriously considering a voluntary cooperation program. The transhumanist in me very much wants to see human-Yeerk collaboration, especially given the firsthand testimony from the existing cooperative Controllers and the fact that Yeerks seem to evolve extremely quickly when exposed to new brains. The fact that it's literally a last-resort gambit to avoid extinction is unfortunate, but well within expected behavior for humanity. I would love to see what a fully human-integrated Yeerk pool looks like, as well as the community of their Controllers.
