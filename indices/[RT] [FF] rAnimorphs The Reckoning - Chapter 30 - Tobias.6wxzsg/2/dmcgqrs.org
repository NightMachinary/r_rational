Great chapter, keep it up! TK17, you're awesome and you should feel awesome, woop woop!

Lots of setup and exposition in this one. I still love the feeling that this story invokes of peering through a window into vast, nonstop world where characters don't pause to wait for the story to catch up. That said, I do think the story would benefit from showing more stuff onscreen - like all the things Jake described to Tobias. Also, it's been a while since we've had deep character moments between the Animorphs. I want another chapter like the one where they all morphed each other.

Whoa whoa whoa, that's a typo, right? It should say "in Ax and Marco's dad's heads", right?
