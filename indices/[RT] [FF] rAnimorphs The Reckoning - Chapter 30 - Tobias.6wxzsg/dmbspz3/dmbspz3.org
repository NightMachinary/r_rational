I've come up with two explanations for the ebay listing.

One is that Garrett hid it in a construction site somewhere and someone found it. "Dracon" is a coincidental typo; "double a batteries" is probably just a silly assumption.

The other is that it's a honeypot. "Dracon" is to get someone's attention; "double a batteries" is for extra deniability, to make it look like the seller has no idea what they're holding.

If so, who's it a trap for, and by? Won't work on the animorphs, /unless/ you've actually found the box, and even then they'd need to find the listing and figure out how to track the seller. Maybe Tyagi's group? They know what the box looks like thanks to morphing Tobias. And V3 would be totally capable of setting this up, even if he doesn't know what Tyagi's group knows. Maybe just to help figure out who knows what, more likely to turn a human-in-the-know into a Controller.

I think this is my dominant hypothesis, but I'm not confident.
