Garrett from a few chapters back:

#+begin_quote
  And so I decided that I was /not/ going to take it to the CHEE, and *I was also not going to tell the rest of the ANIMORPHS what I had done with it, except that I would maybe give them some CLUES in case something happened to /me/ because I wasn't STUPID, I didn't want them to lose it forever if I caught a random DRACON BEAM or something*. And I guess if they found out and tried to argue with me, I would /try/ to explain to them those REASONS I had thought of and any other ones I could come up with, but in fact it wasn't because of those REASONS, not really.

  I just had a FEELING, and I hoped TOBIAS wouldn't be MAD AT ME.

Edit: Foreknowledge aside, the structure and phrasing of the listing certainly sounds like the way Garrett thinks.
