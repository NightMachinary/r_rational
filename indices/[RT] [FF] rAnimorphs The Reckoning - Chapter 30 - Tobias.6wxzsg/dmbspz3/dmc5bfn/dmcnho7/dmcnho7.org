So... Garrett set up an auto-poster to put the listing on ebay in case he doesn't reset it every day. If something happens to him, the Animorphs find the posting because ???someone they know set up a webcrawler???

And then how do they find where the box actually is? Maybe there's a steganographic code for Tobias in there that we can't read alongside the ones we can?

EDIT: the Chee might be the webcrawler. But the whole point of this is that Garrett doesn't trust them.
