My reasoning was "however yeerks reproduce, it's probably not directly tied to how many hosts they have"; my understanding is that overshooting happens when a species can eat more than enough to sustain larger numbers, until the food runs out. Yeerks don't consume hosts, or need them directly to survive.

Then again, I don't know much about real life parasites. Maybe overshooting applies to them too.
