From the inside I'm not sure that you would be able to tell, which is why it's so easy to think that the Time Matrix is, well, a time machine.

But from some theoretical vantage point outside of the Time Matrix's area of effect you would be able to tell. Alternately, if you were treated to the botched universe that Elfangor, Loren, and V3 made, you might start wondering, even if you couldn't prove it without finding the right vantage point.

*Edit:* To clarify, I think that the distinction is important because one, it raises the probability that the r!Animorphs continuity was created by someone in the canon continuity, but two (and more importantly), because it supposes that there is something outside of what the Time Matrix can affect. If the Time Matrix could change anything and everything then there'd be no need for a universal INT/WIS boost because you could just remove The One (or whatever our Unknown Meddler was trying to fight).

But from the inside you wouldn't be able to tell, barring access to information from the right vantage point.
