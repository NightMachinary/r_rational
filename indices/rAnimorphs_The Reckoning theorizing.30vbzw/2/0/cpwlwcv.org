  "Riddle me this: What's more likely, that the Time Matrix sends you back in time and creates new universes, or that the Time Matrix only creates new universes, and your apparent time travel is the result of the universe being recreated as it was at your intended temporal destination?"

If you have universe traveling capabilities outside of the Time Matrix you could travel to the original universe if it still existed.

If someone tried using the Time Matrix to return to the original universe, it would either need to have the original saved, or generate a fake imitation of the original universe, or it needs to have created a new universe and left the original intact for that person to be able to go their.
