Now, I haven't read more than a little of the Animorphs because it was so horribly unrational... so there may be something in the books that makes this comment moot... but if not I think this question is the result of a category error:

"Riddle me this: What's more likely, that the Time Matrix sends you back in time and creates new universes, or that the Time Matrix only creates new universes, and your apparent time travel is the result of the universe being recreated as it was at your intended temporal destination?"

I don't see that there's a meaningful way to distinguish these two statements. What would the observable difference between the two situations be?
