I'm kinda disappointed by how KA dropped the ball with the Yoort. They never showed up again, and then the way that the series ended it seems like they're never going to be relevant because the Yeerks were getting treated to the Escafil device and being made into nothlits.

Hm...

I propose that Crayak or The One managed to interfere with the Ellimist's plans, and that the Ellimist didn't want the Yeerks to be forced to take the nothlit route and, at the time of the Yoort plot, didn't think that would happen.
