Hmm, I have no intention or desire to submit anything to this, but if I were to write something for this prompt it would be a short story based on HP Lovecraft's quote from the Nameless City:

#+begin_quote
  That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.
#+end_quote

You see this fascinating poem is a reference to the Old Ones' immortality and state of mind. They are eternal and will never die. However they spend time in a death-like state as a sort of hibernation.

I choose to interpret this as if they are so fundamentally different from humanity, that death is not a end for them like to would be for us, but rather a state from which they can revive from which would imply death has died, no?

So I would write a story where humans have changed into a form of Old Ones like the ones described in HP Lovecraft's stories. It's up to the reader whether or not this is a bad thing.
