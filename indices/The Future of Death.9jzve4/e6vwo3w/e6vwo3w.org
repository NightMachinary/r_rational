  they're paying a ton. 50 cents per word. That's nearly ten times what is considered "professional pay rate."

They're paying 50 cents per word /on spec work./ (The listing says, "Please include your story as an attachment." You write and submit a story, and then they decide afterward if they want to pay you.) If you submit a story and they like it, you get 50 cents per word, but if you submit a story and it's not accepted, you get 0 cents per word.

If you assume that you have, say, a 2% chance of getting your story published, and factor that into a calculation of expected value, then a 2% chance of getting paid 50 cents per word (and a 98% chance of getting paid 0 cents per word) gives you an EV of 1 cent per word. Obviously, you can adjust this number up or down depending on whether you think your odds of being accepted are better or worse than 2%. (Things to consider: the estimated size of the slush pile, the number of submissions they're going to accept, and where your skill level as a writer places you within the (presumably bell-curve shaped) distribution.) Your EV calculation could also factor in the likelihood of your story getting rejected by io9 but accepted by another magazine (or the potential reputation gain of self-publishing the work and posting it to forums like [[/r/rational]], if you care about such things).
