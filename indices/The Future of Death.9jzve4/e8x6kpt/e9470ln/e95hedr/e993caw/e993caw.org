I spoke to an editor friend last night. She said that, given the probably volume, lack of manpower, and use of an email address for submissions rather than a submissions system; and seeing that io9 published a Future of Death story on Oct 31st -- they are probably done with this, and no one will receive any rejections, even form rejections. We should consider the publishing of that story to be our notice, and feel free to send our stories elsewhere.

Tho I would suggest waiting a few months, so avoid the crush of everyone else doing so.
