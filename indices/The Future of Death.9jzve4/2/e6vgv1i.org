  50 cents per word. That's nearly ten times what is considered "professional pay rate."

5 cents per word would make 100 dollars for 2000 words, so you would have to be able to finish a 2000 word piece within 2 days just to make minimum wage, including researching and editing and whatever. People might be writing for those kinds of fees, but not if they want to make a living of it.
