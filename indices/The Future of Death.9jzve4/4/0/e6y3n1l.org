I've heard the hibernation interpretation before and think it downplays the grandeur of that line. I prefer more abstract explanations.

For example, maybe entropy's effects on Old Ones are different due to their embodying the underlying stuff of the universe, and so where time wears down the minds and bodies of mundane creatures it reinvigorates theirs, either directly or by wearing away at surrounding matter that impedes their connection to greater sources of power.

Or, we could have a "the arc of the universe bends towards horror" huge timescales thing going on where these are beings of such power and size that they can't meaningfully decay until billions of billions of billions of years have passed, and so are usually coincidentally jolted into resurrection before that point.
