I submitted a few days beforehand. No word back yet, but I would be patient. Some markets get back to you really fast, but usually it's a wait of 2-3 months. Considering that they are paying a ridiculously high per-word rate, and they are io9, and according to comments they don't have any interns helping... I would expect a very long wait.
