I love the detail of Unown being simple enough to factor out common data and identify which parts predict their size/weight/shape.

It also seems that Hidden Power isn't understood. I suppose that justifies the name, but it makes me think someone is going to figure out how to get an Unown to fight, possibly as a downstream consequence of Red's Other research. Is Secret Power a move in this setting?
