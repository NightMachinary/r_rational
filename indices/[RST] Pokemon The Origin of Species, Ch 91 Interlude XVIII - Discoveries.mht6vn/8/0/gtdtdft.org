It's funny because, as you said, the name gave a good excuse to have it not be known, but also the latest Pokemon games actually deleted a bunch of moves, including Hidden Power... which leaves Unown without any!

(Unown aren't in Sword/Shield yet, of course, so it's not a huge deal that the move doesn't exist (though it does have implications for the competitive scene), but once they're in the next game I expect it'll be back in the games again)
