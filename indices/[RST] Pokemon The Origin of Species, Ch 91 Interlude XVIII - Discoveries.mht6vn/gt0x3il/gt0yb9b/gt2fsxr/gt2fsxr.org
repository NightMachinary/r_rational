My theory is the "master" in "masterball" is far more literal in this case - what it does is take the conditioning to the logical extreme and strip/block the sentience and individuality off a Pokemon caught by it, making them a perfect, flawlessly obedient killing machine but one trapped inside its own head so to speak.

Higher capture-rates are replaced in this world by Pokeballs having capacity limits(?) and I believe it was at least implied during the Karen Intermission chapter that an Ultraball could snag a legendary, it's just so insanely, suicidally dangerous that nobody's survived the attempt.

... Huh, on that note, is it mentioned anywhere how big Zapdos actually is in this?
