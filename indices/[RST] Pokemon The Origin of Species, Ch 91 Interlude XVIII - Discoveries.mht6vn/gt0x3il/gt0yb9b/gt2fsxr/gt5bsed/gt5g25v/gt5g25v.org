They're not, though. Blue's Shiftry is the best example we've seen of how the Pokeball conditioning tech isn't a guarantee. Even caught and conditioned that thing was still vicious and specifically called out by Brock's second(?) as a Pokemon which was only barely under control.

Another is the Squirtle/Tortodile injury incident. "When their blood's up" were Blue's words for how they can and do ignore commands to stop in the heat of the moment.

The main thing existing conditioning does is make targeting humans unacceptable. Other than that, a lot of bets are off. A ball that strips away all that instinct and makes them into biological robots is both monstrous and plausibly something someone would want to develop here.

It's just my theory, I could be /way/ off the mark, but it seems to fit with what information we have about the setting and mechanics of things.

Edit: and an obvious point - conditioning != training. The Master Ball might also be intended to imprint sets of commands, conditioned Pokemon still need to be trained properly. This might be designed to bypass that issue.
