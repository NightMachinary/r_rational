Presumably known or assumed, but discussed only off-screen.\\
Feel that's missing from the story.\\
Like... after the fight, I want to know whether Kyogre and Groudon is dead. If there are corpses.\\
But then again... the author doesn't want to talk about where the legendaries fly off to, when they're not currently creating disaster.\\
Like, what's Zapdos' off-season like?\\
Wherever they are, they'd bring disaster, but they have to be somewhere at all times.\\
This should be both highly plot-relevant, but I guess it's better to only write this, when you need to, to not constrain your plot space prematurely.\\
Guess that's in the nature of a serial.
