In OoTS, TMs involve hacking the pokémon's data while digitized to "install" the technique, and, in some cases, physically rearrange the pokémon's organs to give them new capabilities entirely - the canon extreme case being Rhyhorn's Flamethrower. I don't believe it's possible to psychically merge with the pokèmon while this process takes place.
