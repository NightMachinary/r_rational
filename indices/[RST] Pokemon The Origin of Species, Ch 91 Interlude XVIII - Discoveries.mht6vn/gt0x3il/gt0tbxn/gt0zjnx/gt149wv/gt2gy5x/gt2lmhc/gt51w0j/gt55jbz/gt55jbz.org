Yes there are justified uses when talking about the Legendaries. However the problem is that the power is so easily abusable by people grabbing strong Pokemon without being trained or vetted by experienced Pokemon trainers. And that's not even getting into the Renegades who can't be trusted with any strong Pokemon.
