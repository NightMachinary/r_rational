Actually, this brings up an interesting question about merging in general with a TM being given, particularly with psychics, or indeed ghosts with the seperation possibility between them. Though, I do seem to have the impression they are done in the ball. Obviously hard to merge with that, but it would certainly be something I'd be interested in reading about him trying if it is possible to learn a TM outside the ball. Maybe something to bring up with Bill or Oak.
