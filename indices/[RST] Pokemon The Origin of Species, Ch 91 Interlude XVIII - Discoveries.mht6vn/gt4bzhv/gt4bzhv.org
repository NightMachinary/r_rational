  "I can't do telekinesis. Like, at all. I've merged with a dozen different psychic pokemon and even a couple other people as they used their own, and I'm just not able to do it." He sets the rock down and takes another chip. "The thing is, most ghosts can't either unless you use a TM on them."

I wonder what would happen if Red merged with a pokemon, then used a telekinesis TM on it while merged. Or are TMs applied to a pokemon while it is in a pokeball?
