Hello! I guess this might be a little weird to ask, but, I was wondering if you have any advice on how you expand the pokemon locations when you're writing?

I'm trying to write a pokemon fic myself which was heavily inspired by how this story treated places like Cerulean City and made them feel like places I'd love to visit, so I've been trying to draw on that similar sort of way of expanding the cities into the pokemon world that lived in everyone's heads when we first played the games, but I don't think I have the hang of it yet.
