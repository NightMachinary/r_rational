I try to draw inspiration from real cities, personally. What do "tourist cities" have that make them "touristy?" What do coastal cities "feel like?" Then I think about what flavor of the city is in the region, what the "story" behind it is, the same way "New York" or "Paris" or "Miami" or "Tokyo" or "San Francisco" and so on all have cultural feelings wrapped around them, particularly different cities within the same region/state (like, San Francisco vs Los Angeles). And finally I just spend some time "walking" the city in my head, deliberately imagining the sorts of things I'd see in a city within the pokemon world, the sorts of stores that would exist to cater to trainers, coordinators, the sorts of media that would be on display, etc.

You might also find other inspiration available in the anime or manga, but I haven't used it, personally.
