If I may interject as a bystander.... As you likely know, Kanto and the other in-game regions are modelled after real-world locations. Similarly, the various towns and localities also correspond to real locations. So, you might find it worthwhile to do some light research on, for example, Tsuchiura City, the real-world version of Cerulean City, and see if anything about it inspires you.
