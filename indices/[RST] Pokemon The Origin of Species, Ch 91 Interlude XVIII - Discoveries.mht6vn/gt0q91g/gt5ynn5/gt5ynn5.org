I read after some revisions had already taken place--it's unusual for me to wait any amount of time on the 1st! As a result I noticed things that are a little subtler than usual, though:

1) but I'm definitely going to buy some stronger pokemon to round out my belt with other strong pokemon."

Strong pokemon thing gets a bit repetitive; this could probably end at "my belt."

2) and there are some other pokemon that can naturally use Psychic or Ghost type attacks but not Psychic ones, or vice versa... you've been measuring two different things?"

I think "Psychic or Ghost" here should just be Ghost?

3) "Oh, yes, I'm sorry I've lost all my manners... come in, come in out of the cold..."

"I'm sorry I've lost all my manners" here reads like an apology specifically about having lost his manners, which could be it? But if the sorry is about leaving them out there, and the manners are an explanation, a comma after sorry would probably be preferable.

4) Minoru how did you end up here?

Comma after Minoru.

Another great chapter, thanks!
