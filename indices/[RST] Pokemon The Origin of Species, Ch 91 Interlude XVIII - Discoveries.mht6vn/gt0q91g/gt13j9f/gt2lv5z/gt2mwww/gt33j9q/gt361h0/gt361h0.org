I'd say that's much more clear than before, though I still think this line:

But she's happy to cater to her preference if it gets the two to spend more time together.

Could be tweaked further.

I'm imagining something like “But she's happy to cater to his new preferences, and seeing him consider a fresh viewpoint from his friend showed how much he'd grown” (though that sounds awkward even to me)

While it's no longer ambiguous for me, the sticking point is still the implication that this second line sounds as if they are only going meatless when Leaf is joining them for dinner, while the first line implies it as true for all meals even without Leaf. It's now Red's preference, not just Leaf's.

I'm sorry if this seems nitpicky, it's small and already improved, just giving my full view on it.
