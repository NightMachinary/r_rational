Ah ok. That description makes the text make sense, but is not the understanding I would have guessed from any of the text versions (though that might be because I'm confused as to why Red would consider that logical- why is it more okay if she buys it instead of him)

Maybe the first line should indicate more that she is concerned with his reduced meat diet, and views their meals during his visit as an oppurtunity to help him get healthier- but an oppurtunity she is willing to give up to have Leaf along.

My confusion has centered around the exact degree to which Red has reduced his meat consumption (mostly due to Leaf). I'd been interpreting it thus far as him only eating it a few days a week, and now this makes me think he never eats it (when the reality is he eats it if it is served to him)
