I predict that the horribleness of the Master Ball is that it bumps up the capture rate by wiping the mind of the pokemon, and then programs them with the bare minimum to function and execute attacks. But it's like commanding a zombie with no initiative outside of your orders.

After all, people have been working on improving capture tech to transport humans. Why not go in the reverse direction and induce the same thing that happens to humans in pokemon as well so you can be certain they won't resist the capture?
