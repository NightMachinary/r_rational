Ooh! It's been a long time since I've seen the "masterballs are evil" trope. Last time was when I read Latias' Journey/Brave New World, where the Masterballs were all portals to the same hell-like pocket dimension ruled over by the evil glitch pokemon MissingNo.

Can't wait to see your take on it.

Also I'm curious how Team Plasma will react. Speaking of Team Plasma, do they know of Leaf's plan for permanently saving humankind from the threat of wild pokemon attacks so that humans will no longer hate/fear pokemon? Do they know her plan requires humans to catch 'em all?

And does /Blue/ know of Leaf's plan? I feel like with his whole #WhatComesNext thing he'd ought to be collabing with her. Giovanni obviously knows Leaf has a plan to permanently end the threat of wild pokemon attacks that doesn't require a FOOMed Mewtwo, even if he doesn't know what it is. And it was Giovanni who gave Blue the idea for #WhatComesNext to begin with. Collabing with Leaf on her project feels like a no-brainer.

Also, Leaf's plan would involve catching /a LOT/ of wild pokemon, which would be a boon for pokemon research including Red's. And the sooner her plan succeeds, the sooner they can convince Giovanni that humankind doesn't need a FOOMed Mewtwo to survive.

Honestly at this point Leaf's plan ought to be the highest priority thing for all the main characters, with the Silph investigation only being the second-highest priority.
