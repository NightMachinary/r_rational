I was actually thinking about the master ball a few chapters ago, and what a 100% catch rate ball would be in this universe. My guess is it has longer range and faster lock-on time, meaning you just have to point and catch - no throwing necessary. The thing is, it seems like that would kind of ruin the story. Sure, maybe it needs rare or expensive materials, but if a company can make one then a country could make dozens. Almost every legendary is caught within a few months, and it just seems like an anticlimax. You could shift to politicking about how you use the caught gods, but it would feel kind of strange tonally.

This made me dismiss the idea. But now it's being brought up, so I'm guessing there's more of an interesting story to tell here than i thought.
