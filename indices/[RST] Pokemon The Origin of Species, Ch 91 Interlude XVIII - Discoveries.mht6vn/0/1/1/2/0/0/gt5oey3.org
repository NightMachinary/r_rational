Well fair enough, it is not perfect.

But it's a lot closer to perfection than what we get for animals.\\
I don't see how being even more perfect would be considerably more extreme by any standard that values the original mind state of the creature.\\
I can't help but seeing the current conditioning being already extreme, because I'm anchored by real world standards.

Reminds me of Leaf being shocked at Bill's solution of simply copy-pasting an individual species-mind for a whole population to quick-pacify them. It's not that I can't appreciate the technical distinctions, but they aren't too interesting to me.\\
Don't value animal mindstates as an inherent good, at all.

Oh well, maybe it's another Leaf-concern.
