I think the real concern is trusting the human to use the legendary for the benefit for humankind. For all of their strength and destructive power, wild legendaries attack infrequently. A human wielding a legendary could decide to take over a country and become a king or emperor. Who could stop them? No one has ever successfully beaten a legendary so far, let alone one given strategy by humans.
