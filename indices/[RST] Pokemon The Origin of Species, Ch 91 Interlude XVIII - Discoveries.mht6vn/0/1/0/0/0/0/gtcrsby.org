  No one has ever successfully beaten a legendary so far, let alone one given strategy by humans.

Surge killed Kyogre by feeding it a Magnezone, didn't he?\\
Well, it was a team effort, but I like the idea that this was a delayed killing blow.

  A human wielding a legendary could decide to take over a country and become a king or emperor. Who could stop them?

I think that's what psychic warlords were back in the day. Close to the same argument could be made against the invention of the Pokéball.\\
Chemical warfare with smogmog, area denial with grimers. Firebombing with Charizards.\\
That hasn't happened, because the people on this world are no less creative, but far more reasonable. Don't think that would change. Thanks to Red's mass proliferation of Abras, you won't have much fun playing tyrant, anyway.

The threat that I see with killing/catching legendaries, is unintended consequences. Their origin is not natural evolution.\\
This implies Eldritch intelligent intent.\\
Waking up Groudon woke up the aquarium fish, this woke up Rayquaza. And those Regi-things.\\
Killing a legendary or catching it, apparently incurs "divine" retribution.

The risk in overthrowing the status quo lies in "What comes next?".\\
There are right and wrong answers, but not obvious ones.

Perhaps you should catch a legendary ASAP, to have a fighting chance of all the ones, that will awaken soon.
