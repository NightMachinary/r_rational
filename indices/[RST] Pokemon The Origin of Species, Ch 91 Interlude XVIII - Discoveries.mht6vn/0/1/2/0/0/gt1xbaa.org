Or perhaps the Master Ball interacts with sentients in some way? I'm assuming it's more complex than just "captures humans with no drawbacks", because that sounds incredibly useful. A high possibility for abuse, of course, but I'm not sure I'd describe it as "heinous".

My theory is that the Master Ball removes the "brain dead" limitation and is /really damn good/ at the sort of training/loyality induction/brainwashing normal pokeballs do.
