Yes, but like you said, the issue is with what comes after. If only one faction has a legendary, they'll instantly wield incredible power over everybody else. That's going to cause so many issues in the immediate short-term and perhaps long-term as well.

The only way to stop all the bad things from happening is for every major faction to have legendaries of their own. MAD will then be in place and they'll keep each other in check, but until the political landscape shifts into that new equilibrium, there'll be trouble with only one faction wielding that incredible power.
