This seems like a reflection of modernism - the movement that believed that we could create new, better ways to do things out of whole cloth, and that the government could make those things happen.

This belief is true in some cases (water treatment facilities, vaccination campaigns) and false in others (housing design, social structures, human genetic makeup). When modernism went wrong, it was often very overconfident, and very wrong.
