The segregation of women really struck me here. I sometimes find an interesting contrast between Ursula LeGuin's /A Wizard of Earthsea/ (which is male-dominated and segregated) and her influential (both in-story and out) female and non-binary characters in later series. But seeing this makes me think that it's /no wonder/ Earthsea ended up as it did, because that's how /everyone/ did it, and there hadn't yet been an Ursula LeGuin for Ursula LeGuin to follow (well, perhaps not in SF&F).
