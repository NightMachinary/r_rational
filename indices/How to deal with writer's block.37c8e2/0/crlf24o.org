Just keep writing. In the process of writing, ideas will eventually come to you, and if you look at your words and see that they're crap, hopefully you'll get some understanding of /why/ they're crap, and figure out a way to fix it.

Writer's block doesn't have to mean staring at the keyboard doing nothing, and I personally think that's the wrong way to deal with the block.

(If the problem is that you don't know enough about something, you can alternately spend your time doing research.)
