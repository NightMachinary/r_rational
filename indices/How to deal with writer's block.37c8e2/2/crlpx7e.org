I am not a writer so take what i am saying with a grain of salt, But i read something before which felt true for me(in the context of writing technical stuff etc.). i think its something by Stephen King , though it might have been someone in here just as well.

"There's no such thing as a writers block, there's only holding yourself to too high a standard. see that if you try letting yourself write without being negative about it eventually you will manage to write something which you will also feel good about, but if every time you start to write you are stopping yourself because its not good enough you will never get there"

googling a bit i see a similar quote by William Stafford, if that helps
