I haven't found a way to push through it. It's obviously possible, but I haven't found myself in a situation where I absolutely need to produce (since school, at least), so I've always dealt with it by stepping back and doing something else. Something else is usually finding something to read, or possibly watch or play. This does mean I mostly write in waves, cranking out 10k words a week for while and then not writing almost at all for a while, but it works for me. I'm sure it's different for those who have already broken through and managed to get published. In the words of Jim Butcher: "I don't have a muse, I have a mortgage."
