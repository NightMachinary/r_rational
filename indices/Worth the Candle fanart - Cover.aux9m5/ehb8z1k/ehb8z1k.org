Well, it's not terrible, but it definitely doesn't really capture anything close to an accurate mood for the story.

Also, WtC is a multiple book work, one cover wouldn't cut it.

Personally, I would expand on your idea, and make each cover a shot of a table with a game laid out on it, with a small but supernaturally bright candle illuminating the scene into sharp focus.

Each table would be set in a place from that book, like the first could show the abandoned gas station in the background.

One of the covers could totally be a table with a game of arches in progress.
