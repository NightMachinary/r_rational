"Worth the candle" is an expression that means something (especially a game) is worth the time/effort/trouble. It comes from the old days when you needed to burn a candle to do anything at night, which was much more expensive than turning on a light is nowadays, so an activity had be worthwhile in order for it to be worth the candle.

In the context of the webnovel, the phrase gets a pretty significant title drop in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27497037][chapter 36]], during Juniper's prayer.
