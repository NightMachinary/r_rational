There are limitations.

Without finding the book again to check, I'm pretty sure that size seems to be limited to about a car, advanced technology seems impossible/impractical, and the accuracy of an object seems dependent on both the reader's concentration and the verisimilitude of the text.

(Any or all of this may be wrong, it's been years since I read this book)
