You seem to be misunderstanding how Nen works, on a pretty fundamental level.

Nen powers get more powerful the more restricted they are. If you have a power to summon fire, that will be weaker then a power that can only summon fire on Saturdays, which would be weaker than a power that can only summon fire on Saturdays which can only hurt people named Bob.

For a practical example, take Gon's rock. Pouring a bunch of energy into a fist and then attacking with it is basic Nen stuff, anybody practiced enough could do the same basic thing. In principle, you can get identical results through using Enhancement - you'd just have to be skilled enough to make up a deficit. This applies to all Nen types. Anything a Conjurer can make could be made by conjuration. But if you're not using a technique, with restrictions and which suits your personality, it'll be far harder to do so.

Could Basho write those haikus? Probably, yeah. But because his power is so wide in scope, he won't get much of a boost in actually making those things happen. He would, for the most part, be a Conjurer or whatever else making those things happen through Nen normally, without any sort of technique. It's doubtful he could get much of a result out of any of them, if any at all.

With Nen you can get power with either effort and talent, or restrictions. If Basho has an unrestricted ability, and he hasn't put an insane amount of effort into it, and he isn't crazy talented, he can't be that powerful. There aren't any loopholes.
