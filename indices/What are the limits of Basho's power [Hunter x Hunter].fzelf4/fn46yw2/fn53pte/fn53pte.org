It's probably not that powerful. Remember that Nen Abilities are never that broad. Basho is apparently stated to be a "Conjurer" in HxH's fighting game. Since both uses of his power involve bringing fire from a poem, you might presume that his actual power is to to create items or displays of energy as described by a haiku. He definately doesn't seem to have the personality traits of a Specialist, but shows the traits of a Conjurer or Enhancer.

The part about whatever he brings being weakened if the poem is bad is presumably just that "unknown psychological component" mentioned by Biscuit. You might see him as a more limited Green Lantern actually if he is limited by Will, because in addition to having the will he also needs to make a good poem about it.

As for your examples. Well, the first might work on himself, assuming he can Enhance his own immune system. Or create a drug that does something similar to anyone it is injected to. But the latter was always impossible. Divination like that seems to be limited to Specialists
