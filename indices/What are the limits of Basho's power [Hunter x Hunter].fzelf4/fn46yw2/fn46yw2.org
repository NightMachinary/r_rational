I'm a big HxH fan, and I think Occam's razor is in play here. There might be contrived reasons why Basho's power wasn't used more, but the most likely reason is because it isn't that versatile- he uses it on two occasions, and on both occasions he uses it to summon fire. If you hear hoofbeats, look for a horse, not a zebra- he was a bodyguard of mild standing with the ability to summon flames, manifesting them using written triggers.

His interactions with other characters show he doesn't think himself that strong, so attributing a highly powerful and versatile ability that he never demonstrated seems like a stretch. Most likely, he passed the Hunter exam with his good physicals and instincts, but was not a standout and did not awaken a particularly groundbreaking nen ability.
