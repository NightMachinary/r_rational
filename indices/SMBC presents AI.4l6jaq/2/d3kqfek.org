What bothers me in "Strong AI doomsday" scenarios is that the AI usually treats all humans the same. The AI with the highest chance of that happening would be the 'ethical' one because there's a chance you tell the AI to treat everyone the same no matter what, and even then that's not necessarilly the same.

And what about manipulation of individual humans? I think the true horror of a strong AI is its ability to take advantage of your personal preferences/quirks/friends to manipulate other people.
