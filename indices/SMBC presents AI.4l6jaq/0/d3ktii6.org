I kind of want to point out that, the job of /Methods of Rationality/'s writer notwithstanding, AIs and existential risk don't have much to do with rational fiction.

This subreddit is all about stories that make sense with smart protagonists and no unsatisfying writer tricks, right? Today's SMBC isn't related to any of that. I feel like a bit of a dick for saying all that and being all "Stop talking about things that ain't what I'm here to read!", but I think the point stands. There's such a thing as being off topic.
