Dang I just finished reading up to chapter 10. I don't know if I should go back and reread or not. Hmmm. Decisions decisions.

I think removing the first 3 chapters is probably a good idea. I found it hard to invest myself in the rest of the cast when I know about the existence of Jay and not so silent bob. Although losing the in medias res intro for the main character is unfortunate. Every new character always felt like another clue to the mystery you set up.

You definitely have something interesting going on here, so I'll keep reading. One thing that I noticed for myself though, is that it takes a certain mood to jump into the story when the main character is the way she is. If I were to map this story to a season it'd probably winter. But thats neither here nor there.

I dont have the imagination to come up with a story or setting like this one, so I'd be pretty bummed if it stopped because of lack of viewership. If I were to give advice it'd be to not worry so much about getting a large audience and just tell the story you want to tell for the sake of telling it.

That sweet sweet patreon money would be nice though.
