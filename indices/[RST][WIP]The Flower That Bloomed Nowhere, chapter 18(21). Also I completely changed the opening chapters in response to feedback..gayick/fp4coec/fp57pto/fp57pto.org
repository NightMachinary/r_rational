  I think removing the first 3 chapters is probably a good idea. I found it hard to invest myself in the rest of the cast when I know about the existence of Jay and not so silent bob. Although losing the in medias res intro for the main character is unfortunate. Every new character always felt like another clue to the mystery you set up.

Despite having some awkward prose, I still (mostly) like the prologue chapters and think they set up a lot of narrative elements in a way that I found cooler than doing it conventionally, and if the story wasn't a serial, I'd keep them. But the reality of serial writing is that new readers are incredibly unwilling to give an author the benefit of the doubt compared to a novel, and too many people were put off or overwhelmed by them, or the transition between them and the start of the first arc proper.

It's funny, since I originally wrote them thinking that a more action-y opening would help reader retention on a site like royalroad. I don't know what I'm doing!

But no, I'll find some way to work them back in.

  You definitely have something interesting going on here, so I'll keep reading. One thing that I noticed for myself though, is that it takes a certain mood to jump into the story when the main character is the way she is. If I were to map this story to a season it'd probably winter. But thats neither here nor there.

Well, it /is/ a horror-tagged story that's about death, which is reflected in the protagonist. I try to add a certain levity to the dialogue to make it seem more fun, but it is meant to be a bit oppressive in tone. I guess the air I'm aiming for is the inverse of a lot of fantasy, which tends to have an atmosphere of hope in a dark and confusing world, whereas this is more like... The horror of seeing something wonderful slowly being marred?

I'm not sure if that makes any sense.

It probably hurts the popularity of the story, but I struggle to make optimistic viewpoint characters interesting.
