That's advice I've heard a lot, but to be honest, I think you can only put so much stock into it? You hear it from people like Wildbow and Pirateba, but their experiences might be examples of survivorship bias - they wrote something niche and with a bit of first-timer jank, but their work managed to reach the right audience at the right moment for the format and took off. There are far more web serials that authors have labored on for years without ever gaining any recognition.

On RR, there are stories that are so good at pushing the right buttons that they can catapult to earning a living wage for the author within /weeks/ of being launched. Obviously, I'm not writing something that's going to have that level of mass appeal. But I think if a story, in spite of being marketed, doesn't get some kind of respectable audience by 100k words, then something about it is flawed, and pushing ahead rather than trying to find the problem will only trap you in a writing death march.

But still, thanks for your kind words! I hope it picks up, too.
