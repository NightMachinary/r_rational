Definitely, and she also addresses the fortune factor and the elusiveness of success in Questions #3 and #10. Yes, the vast majority of stories and authors will never gain the recognition they're seeking because there's just /too much/ content out there (monopolistic competition and Sturgeon's law). Like you say, success right off the bat is a matter of luck and standing out from the crowd. But if writing is your intended career or you're invested in succeeding, you can't depend on luck.

Don't worry about RR's viral equivalents of popcorn flicks. Firstly the spirit of the above advice is to prevent yourself from falling into a psychologically harmful inferiority spiral (unless you're the rare type that thrives on competition/envy/spite). Secondly, Royalroad's standards are a terrible metric for aspiring writers. It rewards certain tropes, formulas, and writing styles (e.g. bite-sized cliffhangers) that don't really help you improve as a /writer/. The takeaway is that if you want the RR kind of success, you either have to (1) "sell-out" to the formulas that work for Royalroad's target audience, (2) keep writing new stories until something sticks by the law of averages, or (3) simply perservere, get better at writing, and eventually write a story that's so good the boundaries don't matter.

That said, I do think there are some flaws with the introduction that's seriously hamstringing it and reader interest, but I've already sent you a PM about it. I mentioned first-impact appeal, but web serials are particularly sensitive to first impressions. For the majority of the audience, I'd say the introduction is the gatekeeper. Unlike paid-for novels and e-books where there's a sunk cost, with web serials, you usually have one opportunity to set the hook and line. Not only that, the more readers you can convince to follow it, the more there's word-of-mouth. Self-promotion marketing like this thread helps, but I think word-of-mouth recommendations are the most effective type of marketing in the web serial world. In response to your OP, my opinion is that the intro should be rewritten. Rest by PM.
