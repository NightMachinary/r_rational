heh, really?

I was mostly referring to this last passage, which doesn't sound like something who loves life would say,

#+begin_quote
  "That the gods are condemned to suffering, as we are," she said, still smiling. "For in the unlikely event that there truly are some manner of divine beings, and they did create us and our inherent condition, no punishment for that act could possibly be sufficiently great." She didn't frown, but a certain severity entered her eyes. "If mans lot in the Remaining World is the one he is to bear for the rest of time, then I hope whatever realm they have found exile in is a thousand times worse."
#+end_quote

I mean, outlook on life aside, it's pretty clear that she was far more charismatic and sociable than utsu.
