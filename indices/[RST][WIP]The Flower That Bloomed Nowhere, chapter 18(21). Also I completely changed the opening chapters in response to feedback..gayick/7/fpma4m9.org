*Edit: Hm, on second thought, it looks like the Web Fiction Guide is being remade and submissions [[http://submissions.webfictionguide.com/][aren't moving at all]] since last year August. I'll leave this post up because technically they're still taking submissions. Will keep thinking!*

Hey, I was thinking of how to better promote this story (besides sending it to my friends and family, which I've done and am doing).

Have you considered submitting it to Web Fiction Guide [[http://webfictionguide.com/about/submissions/][(submissions guide)]]? Looking at the [[http://topwebfiction.com/][Top Web Fiction]] list (which is a service of the WFG) I think your work fits in fairly well- the style reminds me most of Mother of Learning, #11 on the list. I don't think its a typical RR story and it surely has wider appeal than this subreddit. You might be able to gather some reviews and ratings better that way.

Submissions has fairly defined rules, and it seems you might need a personal website to post your story because they "do not list stories on large sites like FictionPress or Authonomy, as they have their own very extensive communities, and we really can't handle the volume...It is fine to additionally publish an ebook somewhere, of course, but we want the version intended for your web readers."

Apologies if you've thought of this already.
