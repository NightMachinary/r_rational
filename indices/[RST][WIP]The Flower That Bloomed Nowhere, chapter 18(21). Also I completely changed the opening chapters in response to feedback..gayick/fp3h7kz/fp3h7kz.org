I'll check out the story tonight, but your tone was rather glum so I was reminded of [[https://wanderinginn.com/writing-faqs/#9][some advice for web authors I recently read and think may be helpful.]]

  *Question #8: Hey, I was wondering if like when you first started on here did you get discouraged by comparing your growth to others on here? (Referring to RoyalRoad website)*

  I try never to compare myself to others. My advice is simple. Never look at your ranking. Never look at your views. Just keep to your schedule and write on. That's why my main story is NOT on Royalroad--it's on my own site, where rankings don't matter. I only put my story on Royalroad after I had my own community. My advice to all web writers is not to expect even more than a single comment until you've been working for 6 months.

  6 months, with no views, no comments, no recognition. I think that's the bar people struggle with. And it will be far, far longer if your goal is sustaining yourself with writing monetarily or achieving accolades. There is no good advice I can give besides keep writing for the sake of writing. For the one or two people who read and enjoy your work. If I offer any other words about ranking, numbers and so on, it will all be subjective and unhelpful.

  Advertise your work, by all means. Stress about it, engage your audience, all those good things. But write because you want to, not because you're expecting something for it.

So hang in there (or don't), beat a dead horse (or don't), just write whatever you have the passion for. If I recall, the renowned time loop story in webfic circles (MoL) had a very small following for years after starting in 2011. The updates were consistent but sparse and I don't think it really got much recognition until late 2014.

Best of luck and hope this time loop lives up to its potential!
