Suppose a person get knocked by a car. Car leaves. Five witnesses report that a car was: white, black, pink, red, yellow. Forensics found on a knocked persons clothes pink paint (pp).

We have now:

P(w), P(b), P(p), P(r), P(y) - priors

P(pp|w), P(pp|b), P(pp|p), P(pp|r), P(pp|b) - likelihoods.

Now, if i have onle two priors (P(w) and P(p)), i will calculate likelihood ratios P(pp|w)/P(pp|p). But how can i calculate likelihood ratios for five hypotheses?
