There were some well founded questions in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5n4253/up_the_beanstalk_human_livestock_escapes/][the thread for Up the Beanstalk]] as to how the world could possibly turn out that way. Not Long Now sheds some light on that, while also being an overall richer story imo.
