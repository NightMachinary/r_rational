To elaborate on the strawman angle, the machine seems like the most viscerally unpleasant potential conclusion of the Grandfather's ideals, rather than the most appropriate one. The narrative repeats the idea of building machines that are better, faster, bigger, and yet the supposed futurist settles for a machine that will not, and in fact cannot, be improved. The limiter will by its very nature slow progress to a crawl, and the difficulty with altering the behaviour of the brainwashed workforce only compounds the issue, even if a true innovation were made; the Grandfather, who apparently built the machines ex nihilo, couldn't possibly have missed these points.

With the technology available, a more sensible machine would first sort, and then limit and/or cull, the children. The most intelligent would be educated and brainwashed separately, and only then would the remainder be limited. This would, at least in theory, remove the risk to innovation posed by the machine, if you presume both that children can be accurately sorted by intelligence and that those sorted into the "unintelligent" category wouldn't later become intelligent. Neither is much of a leap relative to the other proposals of the story. The machine would also be less rigid, with complete blueprints being made available and concessions made to future expansion - or, perhaps, the offspring towers would be mutable, in a macabre parody of evolution. The outcome of this would be an exponentially self-improving machine.

(If we presume the possibility of deliberately breeding intelligent children a la Brave New World, we can remove sorting entirely. However, in the absence of this technology, we can settle.)

However, if we take this further, we find that there's actually no reason for many of the manual labour jobs. The pedal power is inefficient to the point of absurdity - the workers would obviously consume more than they produce. Cutting out the middleman and growing fuel to burn would dramatically increase efficiency. The slaughterhouse is likewise pointless; the long generation time and high energy cost relative to meat output makes humans one of the worst possible livestock animals. Even if you grant that babies are the tastiest possible food (which seems to be true only for the sake of including cannibalism, but whatever), there's no reason to feed human flesh to the workers (I'm assuming that's where they get the meat, as is implied by /Up the Beanstalk/) whose happiness is of no concern to you. A vegetarian diet is completely viable and more efficient by an order of magnitude, provided you choose the correct foods. Manufacture may briefly exist as a manual labour job if automation just wasn't there yet, but if it did it wouldn't for long given the tech level of the machines. At this point we only have a handful of administrative jobs, which is just fine anyway. If we must have work that's fine, but it'd be busywork.

If we take this further, the expense of wasting that much metal by building literally everything out of it serves no purpose other than as a metaphor for technology (technology == metal, everything is metal therefore everything is technology). Concrete, brick, and wood are much better and cheaper building materials. This is especially true given how much stone the machines must be pulling out of the ground. Making the machine vertical is just an engineering headache - a horizontal machine is more efficient, since it doesn't require digging or supporting the weight of upper levels, and you don't have to worry as much about miniaturization.

At this point we have an ugly merito/technocratic dystopia, in which everyone is brainwashed, the output of the society's fantastic technology is wasted for no particular reason other than so that there can be poor for the rich to look down on, built of decaying brick and concrete, housed in vast and incomprehensible machines, where the common man is oppressed for oppression's own sake and deliberately made stupid for the sake of social order. Lots of Brave New World and 1984, but with a strong anti-technology angle that neither had. Also cannibalism.
