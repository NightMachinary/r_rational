Rational fiction isn't quite related to hard sci-fi. It's more about the urge to optimization - in the course of the story, do the characters (primarily the protagonist) use every resource available to them to achieve their goals? Whether or not those resources could possibly exist isn't relevant to the category; Superman's powers or Aaron Smith-Teller's Kabbalah are just as valid a target for optimization as the internal combustion engine or a pencil sharpener.
