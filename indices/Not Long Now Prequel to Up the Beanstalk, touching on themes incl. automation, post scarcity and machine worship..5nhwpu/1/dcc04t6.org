Hey Aquareon,

I briefly skimmed through Not Long Now (but didn't spend too much time reading it, so feel free to correct me on points).

Maybe I can point out some reasons that there's been a lot of discussion over your works in this subreddit?

First off, your writing is very good. Use of language uniquely defines our protagonist (though more character development might also be good). Also, the rampant self-replication at the end is the sort of doomsday scenario we enjoy very much over here.

Yes, having an internally consistent world is part of it. And we can presume that things follow the laws of physics (no faster than light travel, for example). But the "consistency" rule is usually meant to indicate that story worlds don't contradict their own stated rules. Like, being able to form fire from sand is fine, as long as our protagonist doesn't find herself suddenly without options when locked in a jail cell by the beach.

But in Not Long Now, we don't have too many internally defined rules. I think it'd be more satisfying in the rational sense if we were given an idea of what can't and can happen in a better sense before the ultimate reveal. Sure, the notes at the beginning hinted at things, but it...didn't feel exciting?

And, sure, the use of orphans ala Snowpiercer does bring up some ethical questions about providing vs paternalism. But it seems strawmanned by the Grandfather. Would these be the ultimately compelling arguments that might convince /you/ to go down this route?

Surely it's not with a mechanical behemoth that keeps its workers on only the barest rations?

So I think you could have strengthened those arguments that tug at the boundaries of our morals.

Lastly, rational fiction usually has protagonists trying things and generally being aware. I understand that our hero had little else to go, but there were a lot of warning signs at that orphanage. Might those have left him uncomfortable? And was his connection to his Grandfather something he could use to get higher status? (Slightly odd that he thinks of making friends first and then throws all that away.)

Also, when the protagonist, in response to discovering the orphanage is really just being run in the way that it is, decides to become a co-conspirator, isn't exactly in the spirit of rational fiction. Rational doesn't have to mean take the realistic view and screw all the other humans. You're allowed to /try very hard/, using all the available resources, mental or otherwise, to try and let /good/ (in the sense of whatever side you're trying to espouse) win.

Tragic failures are interesting in a sense, but a lot of people here at [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I think, also do like seeing /deserved/ victories, where good does win, but through effort and not a deus ex machina.

I know this overview was all over the place, but hopefully that gives you a flavor for the sorts of stories we do enjoy and how Not Long Now sort of misses the mark for a few components.
