Sure, once they understand wtf it is, how it works and what is happening. The towers do not need humans to replicate, btw, just for maintenance.

The ending illustrated how the rate of replication outpaced our destructive capacity in an era before nukes. The inefficiency of human beaurocratic mechanisms at investigating a threat, devising and then mounting an offensive versus mindless replication as quiclkly as the machines are able. You can defeat an enemy just by expanding faster than they can destroy you until you engulf everything.
