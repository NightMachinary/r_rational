  the Grandfather, who apparently built the machines ex nihilo, couldn't possibly have missed these points.
#+end_quote

You misunderstand his goals, and appear to believe he was a wholly sane, well intentioned man rather than one simply consumed with the challenge of building a self-copying machine as soon as technologically possible.

#+begin_quote
  However, if we take this further, we find that there's actually no reason for many of the manual labour jobs.
#+end_quote

See above. The kind of robotics necessary to fully automate everything didn't exist. The grandfather substituted brainwashed children in order to get to the "finish line" faster. It is then not strictly speaking a self replicating machine, but a self replicating cyborg.

#+begin_quote
  The most intelligent would be educated and brainwashed separately, and only then would the remainder be limited.
#+end_quote

This is shown to occur in Up the Beanstalk.

#+begin_quote
  The pedal power is inefficient to the point of absurdity - the workers would obviously consume more than they produce.
#+end_quote

Geothermal is stated to be the primary power source.

#+begin_quote
  the expense of wasting that much metal by building literally everything out of it serves no purpose other than as a metaphor for technology (technology == metal, everything is metal therefore everything is technology). Concrete, brick, and wood are much better and cheaper building materials.
#+end_quote

Adding materials means adding complexity and size to the machine. Additional levels are now necessary for manufacturing bricks, and including wood means the machines would no longer be able to spread once all forests are consumed.

#+begin_quote
  Making the machine vertical is just an engineering headache - a horizontal machine is more efficient, since it doesn't require digging or supporting the weight of upper levels, and you don't have to worry as much about miniaturization.
#+end_quote

The towers replicate by means of robotic arms, cranes, etc. extending from one tower to the immediately adjacent construction site of the next. This is feasible for a tall, thin structure but not for one that is spread out horizontally.

#+begin_quote
  the offspring towers would be mutable, in a macabre parody of evolution. The outcome of this would be an exponentially self-improving machine.
#+end_quote

They still are, due to errors in replication. Our own cells do not intelligently self-modify. The main limiting factor is that it was set off on a planetary surface rather than in space, and would consume everything in the environment before any meaningful evolution could occur.

The rest are legitimate observations, but should be viewed with the understanding that rationality does not equal magnanimity. Rationality just describes how you go about pursuing a goal, it does not dictate what the goal is, just like science.
