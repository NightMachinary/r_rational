Yeah, but if you're going that route, what you need to do is shift the liability, which you can accomplish in two parts.

The first is to put out a blog post, or press release, or open letter, or some other publicly available text, where every seventh letter is ciphertext for a character on the scroll wheel, using a simple substitution cipher. The beauty of this method is that the scroll wheel is *already* encoded with a substitution cipher which the UUs are trying to decode; using another substitution cipher obscures the connection to the scroll wheel but does not add any difficulty to the decryption process. Unless someone knows exactly where to look, it'll be effectively impossible to find (and if the people tracking down the leak do know where to look, your secret is probably blown anyway).

The second step is to sow misdirection. Start a rumour that there will be an attempted theft at [other facility with the scroll wheels], and then substantiate it just enough that, when the time period of the "theft" comes and goes without incident, everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

They'll never be able to substantiate that the leak came from the other facility (because it didn't), so it shouldn't cause any harm, but it should also prevent you from being considered the most likely source of the leak.
