You're totally right. I remember the Motive Name was used to drive cars in Unsong, so it must be possible to operate scroll wheels remotely or at least while they're not visible.

Keep the 3 factor authentication X 3 (tech, transport, patient) for people to even get into range of the scroll, but have it be sealed in concrete/metal that leaves just enough area to fit one patient (have your department be the lowest basement level (typical for radiation oncology centers) with the name buried underneath. Assuming it works in a sphere you could have a small stretcher / bed directly over the edge of the names effective area. Then potential thieves would need to learn the location and timing of a treatment, piggy back off that using social engineering to actually get in the same room as the scroll, and then still would need to extract the scroll without bringing the building down on top of them, plus there would be at least two employees in the same area who could sound the alarm.
