This is based off my personal experience with medical facilities and interest in physical/social security. I've done my best to keep it realistic to modern hospitals, and take into account patient needs and OSHA requirements. TL;DR: Repurpose an old radiology department for its physical resilience and architectural characteristics, use the area of effect nature of the purifying name to allow for a physical barrier between patient and tech with the scroll wheel, use 3 factor authentication for the scroll tech, transport tech, and patient to keep the scroll locked up except during confirmed administration, set the whole thing to alarm if there are bad actors or a medical emergency, practice good patient information security and site security.

Intellectual / Employee Security: Start with the obvious: Don't teach the name to anyone. Teaching employees the name and having them sign an NDA and do-not-compete is insufficient. Only run the name off scroll wheels, keep the scroll wheel location need to know.

Operational Security: Do you bring the wheel to the patient or the patient to the wheel? Security to get to patients in most hospitals is actually quite lax, and assuming I'm using a modern hospital design, with open doors during the day and maybe an emergency-only entrance with security guards and metal detector at night, the risk of something happening to the wheel, or more likely an employee dropping/breaking/losing the wheel in transit is too high. You have to take the patient to the wheel, or well secured location. You can transport even incredibly unstable patients to hour-long MRI's while attached to multiple forms of life support, if they're sicker than that then curing an infection with the wheel isn't going to be enough to save them anyway. The tech for the day enters the facility, is verified with ID badge, personal code/password, and fingerprint, goes to the scroll-tech-only part of the hospital, where there's a restroom, computer, lunch room, and call room, and has to verify identity again to go to the area where the scroll wheel actually is.

Administration Site Security: Here I'm reading the purifying name literally from the UNSONG RPG book and it says it "cleanses and area". This makes things easier. This whole section is me repurposing already existing hospital architecture: Repurpose an old radiology room, either an MRI or an old linear accelerator room. They're typically already underground, have multiple checkpoints and shielding, and have a divider between the patient and the technician. On one side, have the technician with the scroll wheel, on the other side, a marked area where the patient needs to be for the scroll to work. Have the administration room require an employee ID badge, a transport tech fingerprint, passcode, and a patient ID bracelet to be scanned for entry to the administration/patient area. For patient safety, you probably need a one-way door so the scroll tech can access the patient area. That door only opens back to the scroll administration area with a scroll tech badge, code, and fingerprint.

Storage Security: Scroll wheel is kept in a room that is only opened by a combination of: tech ID, tech fingerprint, and confirmation of scanned patient ID bracelet (checked against a list of patients who are pre-approved). Once last standard checklist occurs prior to the vault room being unlocked, which includes verification of patient DoB or SSN or personal passcode, and visual verification of patient identity against medical record picture of them by transport. Vault opens, scroll wheel comes out, tech takes it to the admin area, and returns it after using. You could have the one-way door above and the exit to the tech-only area be locked while the scroll wheel is out, but I'm pretty sure that's an OSHA violation, so just alarm them instead to call hospital security and rapid medical response, since that's the only reason the tech should ever open that door with the wheel out.

Informational Security: I'm serving an exclusive clientele with the Name, so I don't need to disclose the location of the place where the scroll is administered to anyone other than the techs, who have their own route there, the patients, who paid to be on a list of approved users and have some legal or financial consequences for giving the info up, and the tech who transports the patients to the name area. You can easily require the elevator to get to the old abandoned radiology department be an employee only elevator. If you were particularly paranoid you could have 3 walls of the administration area have a door and one-way mirror and only one actually have the tech and scroll behind it, but that seems like a waste of money for an edge case where terrorists gets this close to the scroll and then blow open a wall.

What does this protect against: You now need 3 factor authentication times 3 (2 techs and a patient) to get the scroll to unlock, plus confirmation in the record that an MD or more likely a committee approved scroll administration for this patient. Impersonating a scroll tech or a transport tech or a patient isn't sufficient, and even a tech who was turned against my hospital would still need the right situation to get access to the scroll, and leaving with it not in the right place would set off alarms. Your administration room is underground, shielded, and in a secret location, so an earthquake or other natural (or Name caused) disaster would keep it safe.

What doesn't this protect against: The one-way access and barrier between the scroll tech area and the patient/transport tech area is your weak point. One bad actor at that point of any of the three could steal the scroll, but it would set off alarms. A turned scroll tech (or someone with their face, badge, access code, and fingerprints, but I don't think that level of impersonation is common even in Unsong) could wait until an approved patient came down and just leave via the one-way door once the scroll unlocked, but they'd still need to deal with security. A patient could pay their way onto the list, infect themselves, get approval for treatment, and then take the transport tech hostage or fake a medical emergency, which would still have to deal with security. Same thing for someone impersonating a transport tech. A terrorist or social engineer could also piggyback off the process (follow the transport/patient, use their information) if they learned of a name administration that was happening (we do our best with patient information info-sec but you can only do so much), but they could only get into the patient/transport tech area of the namology department, at which point the name is still locked away and inaccessible without the authentication process, and attempts at threats or hostage taking would probably be met with a silent alarm (button located in tech area, also likely already present prior to renovations). Your players or other bad actors could also have a plant on the security team or rapid response team, and set off the alarm on purpose, but those employees would also have 3FA to get their gear every day, and would have a background check and interview to get hired.
