I believe for the FBI Bomb thing you are referring to is the Harvey's Resort Bomb (which did in fact detonate, but with no injuries). I have a coworker who was a former EOD tech (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) and that bomb is apparently the gold standard for "hard to defuse" for anything made by a single individual or small group (anything less than a nation-state).
