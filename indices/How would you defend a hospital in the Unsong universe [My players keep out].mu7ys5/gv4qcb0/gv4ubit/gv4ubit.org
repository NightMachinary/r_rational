Good stuff, but I think it would be simpler use the MRI's anti-theft mechanism. Convert the scroll wheel into a multi tonne, room-sized contraption and install it in a secure, central location. All you'd really need is a unique, closed system to distribute the name; with a lot of bulk and useless junk added on to confuse potential thieves. Or you could keep the scroll wheel in one piece, and embed it in a car-sized hunk of reinforced concrete.

There was some bombing case that I can only half remember where the perpetrator did something similar, just tonnes of wires and so much extra junk added on top of the bomb that the FBI couldn't determine what if anything was necessary to the system... IIRC it was not detonated and there were no fatalities. If anyone can remember more details, let me know, this gap in knowledge is bothering me.

I read UNSONG a few years ago now, so I may not be remembering enough for this thought to be valid.
