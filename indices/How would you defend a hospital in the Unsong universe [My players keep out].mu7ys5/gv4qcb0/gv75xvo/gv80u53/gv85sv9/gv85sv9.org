very cool! hope it goes well.

I've recently been playing Blades in the Dark, which has some really nice aspects that could potentially port well. It's highly narratively based vs the more detailed mechanics of D&D, and one thing I like is that enemies don't make rolls for the most part. there's just sucesss or failure on the PC rolls, and when they fail it comes with a Consequence of the GM's choosing. This is great because you don't have to plan everything out in advance and tune the challenge level - the PCs just make a plan, roll to execute actions, and when there is a fail or partial success narratively appropriate wrenches get thrown in the system. It's very fluid and gets everyone involved in the storytelling rather than the minutia.
