So I agree with [[/u/aponty][u/aponty]]'s answer... but to elaborate on it, merely allowing the scrollwheel to get stolen doesn't properly fix the system, you want someone who can reverse engineer the name (or at least the scrollwheel) and redistribute it freely in a fashion that undermines that capitalist system that monopolizes and maximizes shareholder profit while pretending this is justified under the motivation of funding research into new names.

So along those lines... I would set up extensive but intentionally faulty and inexpensive security theater around the scrollwheel that is actually designed to allow a Kabbalist disguised as a security specialist that is secretly a singer unlimited access to the scroll wheel. My hospital will probably suffer badly if theonomic's companies blame me when the name (not just the individual scroll wheel) gets reverse engineered.... but if my "security consultant" is clever enough they could steal the name off the scroll wheel while leaving the wheel intact, then anonymously redistribute the name, (pretending to have simply independently invented it).

The theonomic's company that "owns" the name would lose out on some profits but a lot of official usages would still need the official version so they would have enough funding to keep chugging along. A lot of the free usages the theonomic's company wouldn't have licensed in the first place because they wouldn't be able to price discriminate and extract value out of them, so they wouldn't really be losing money.

On a related note... I think the whole thing about the theonomic's company methods and attitudes illustrate just how close while yet so far Scott is from properly grasping leftist thought. Like he sets up the theonomic's companies as clearly bad in the sense that they are maintaining and supporting an unjust and outright inefficient system... but then he tears down this point by making the radical leftist a ridiculously bad strawman and the theonomic's company CEO an alright guy that is really in it for the greater good, so you know, the theonomic companies aren't actually that bad. In the process missing the implicit point of his own world building that the capitalist system that propagates the exploitation of the names for profit is bad and inefficient no matter how many nice, smiling, well meaning CEOs he writes and idiotic Dylan Alvarez types oppose it.

*Edit*: I missed the context of a Roleplay... with that context in mind, it would certainly make for a sadistic/ironic twist to reveal that the Hospital Administration had already leaked the name prior to the players trying to steal the scroll... I don't know if the tone of your campaign is right for your players to find that ironically funny as opposed to just trolling. If they confront the singer Kabbalist secretly reverse engineering the scroll posing as a security guard it could make for an interesting boss fight with the option for the players to diplomacy their way out of it if they guess the situation of recognize some Unitarian Universalist shibboleth because they paid careful attention to the lore.
