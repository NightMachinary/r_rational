Not going to be able to compete with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mu7ys5/how_would_you_defend_a_hospital_in_the_unsong/gv4qcb0/][this]] but I think Klipah enables double-blinded placebo administration of the holy names of God, which could both help your less fortunate patients (in the Unsong-verse, I imagine the placebo effect is really strong for multiple reasons) and enable some extra security. Have an opaque computer algorithm responsible for determining the level of care a patient gets and outputting the ID of a scroll. It usually outputs the ID of a decoy scroll. Each scroll is locked in a separate locker. For bonus points, some lockers don't have scrolls, just exploding ink packs, and the computer never outputs those IDs.
