First episode has CGI animated background people, which is a clever way of reducing still image shots most animes have to fill in the frames. Will ad more reviewing later. EDIT: Spoilers btw So far in the first episode, the protag has: stopped a parasite attack by cutting off his own bloodflow with speaker cords, attacked the parasite with knife and researched on internet about his parasite condition. HOORAY FOR RATIONALITY Continuing on: The parasite IS LEARNING ON ITS OWN by reading books and transforming into animals it sees on the page, the protag is planing to cut off the parasite surgically and the parasite is negotiating with him, another parasite is trying to kill the protag before he notifies the authorities of the parasitic existence.

OK that's it for ep1. I find this sufficiently rational. For now.
