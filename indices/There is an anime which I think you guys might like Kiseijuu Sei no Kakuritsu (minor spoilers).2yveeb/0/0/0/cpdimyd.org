Judging by ratings and reviews on mangaupdates and anidb, they are pretty much equally awesome. It comes down to which medium you prefer in general. I'll wait for Blu-ray releases and then watch it in one sitting. I've read manga 5 years ago and don't remember what it was about at all. The only thing I remember is that it was interesting.
