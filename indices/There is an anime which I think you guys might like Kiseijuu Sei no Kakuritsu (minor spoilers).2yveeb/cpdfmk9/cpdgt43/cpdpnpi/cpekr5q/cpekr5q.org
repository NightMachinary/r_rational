I agree with watching the anime. It's available on Crunchyroll and pretty excellent. Don't expect ufotable budget and production value, but the studio that worked on this was very clever with their budget and making the anime look good. The visuals are as better than you'd expect for what they'd spent on it. The soundtrack is solid and even includes tasteful dubstep.
