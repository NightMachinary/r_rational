Content note: Graphic violence, gore, cannibalism (sort of), death, murder, PTSD, body horror, betrayal, sadness, and mild cursing.

Edit: also, sexual assault.

That being said, none of it is gratuitous. It's all done because the logic developed in the story and the rules of the world require it.

Rational, but not rationalist. A lot of organizations that are often portrayed as incompetent are instead competent. Subverts a lot of dumb horror tropes. There are predictable twists, but many of the main characters, even the secondary main characters, act savvy and smart. The girl doesn't go to investigate the strange disappearances alone, she brings a weapon. The police don't go in willy-nilly and die for no reason (well, maybe at first), they realize they're dealing with a new kind of enemy and develop new weapons and tactics and try to account for all possibitiles. They also choose their priorities carefully.
