Battery from Worm could be described as having one second super-speed and strength. It was pretty worthless before she understood her limitations, but once she did and learned to work around them, she managed to stop a villain who was repeatedly breaking villains out of the vehicles transporting them to the inescapable prison.

There's a character in League of Super Redundant Heroes who can telekinetically control cats. Being able to do that with remotes would work pretty much the same, but without being considered animal cruelty. You could tape remotes onto everything, and fly using a sufficiently large pile of remotes.

Doze from Homestuck has super slow motion. He's difficult to kill because of it, but he's also pretty useless.

Talking to fruits would be useful if they had some understanding of what's going on, but if they could only tell you things they could reasonably know like rainfall, it's pretty worthless.

Bullet attraction is incredibly useful. You could disarm your opponents by pulling their guns out of their hands. It never said the bullets have to be fired.

75% levitation would make flight a lot easier, so you could probably make wingsuits practical. You could also generate electricity by almost levitating on the way up and not on the way down.

Summon a lamp once could let you kill a supervillain by summoning it inside his head. The problem is knowing you have the power.

Turn into a laptop forever would make it vastly easier to upload your mind into a supercomputer, so you can think faster than a normal human. You could also mod your mind to make math really easy and stuff like that.

Define "hat". You could put someone onto your head and then seduce them. It's especially effective if you have a team member with super strength.
