  One second super-strength depends on what the refractory period is, and how much strength is granted. I would have to crunch some numbers, but if the numbers were right, you might be able to use it to drive a specially made generator. One second is also enough to throw a single punch, though there you're limited by whether you also get the required secondary power of limited invulnerability.
