*Bullet attraction* is actually a superpower in Brandon Sanderson's /Mistborn/ series. It's a subset of a bigger power of pulling metal towards you, but the way they attract bullets is to pull them in towards the core of their body, which they keep heavily armored for just that purpose.

*Invisibility in the dark* is basically just "conditional invisibility". How useful it is depends on what we're defining as darkness, but it could be a very useful stealth power, allowing midnight burglaries without setting off motion detectors, being caught on camera, tripping lasers, etc.

*One second super-strength* depends on what the refractory period is, and how much strength is granted. I would have to crunch some numbers, but if the numbers were right, you might be able to use it to drive a specially made generator. One second is also enough to throw a single punch, though there you're limited by whether you also get the required secondary power of limited invulnerability.

*Absorb bad luck* implies that you can give someone good luck. Sure, this sucks for you, but that's why you have a trusted confederate. You suck up all their bad luck, they go buy a lotto ticket, and hopefully you don't get struck by lightning in the meantime. If nothing else, it's at least a service that you could get paid for.

Also, pretty much any of these would let you win Randi's prize of a million dollars, aside from "turn into a laptop forever" or "seduce hats".
