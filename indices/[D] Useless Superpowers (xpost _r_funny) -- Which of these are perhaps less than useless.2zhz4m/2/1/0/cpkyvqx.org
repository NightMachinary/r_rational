If that works, then reviving bugs is basically equal to "have any organic material explode into bugs". Life on earth has existed long enough that pretty much every carbon atom in the biosphere has been part of a bug once. Revive those bugs, and you destroy the present container.

Even if there's a reasonable time limit, you could revive the bugs someone swallowed yesterday and remove/revive /micrograms/ of bug atoms from their body, killing billions of cells.
