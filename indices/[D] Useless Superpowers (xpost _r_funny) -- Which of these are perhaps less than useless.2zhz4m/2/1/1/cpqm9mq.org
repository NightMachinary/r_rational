This seemed silly to me, at first, but I think there's a way to make it work. Much of the time, when a bug gets killed, it gets killed by having digestive enzymes injected into its body, then having its jellified guts sucked out through the same hole. If you can reverse that process, you will need a means of regenerating working insect guts.

The question is, what's the easiest way to extract the guts without completely destroying the body, is it worth it?
