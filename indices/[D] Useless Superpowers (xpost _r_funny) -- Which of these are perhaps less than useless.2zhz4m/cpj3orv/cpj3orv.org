*75% levitation* = super jump. Plus you'd be able to control your arc by adjusting your levitation force mid-air.

*Remote control of remote control*: bind remote controls to your devices. You now have technomancy.

*detect trash*: potentially useful for detecting forgeries or defective parts.

*read own mind*: if that means anything, that means extremely enhanced introspection, and that is very very useful.

*super slo-mo*: this may grant a defensive buff ranging from OK to significant depending on the implementation.

*revive bugs*: I imagine this could be a million dollar talent in the market of rare bug collectors and transporters. Imagine a collector who wants to see their specific of an extinct butterfly fly again.

*desaturation*: Grey Boy cosplay.
