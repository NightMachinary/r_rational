  it's nice to see the setting not immediately be sucked into a singularity.

Good news: even if a person stored up their mass for 20 years and "used" it all in 1 ms, they still wouldn't be dense enough to form a black hole. They would, however, extert a large (~500 GN) force on whatever they were standing on over a relatively small area -- even the compressive strength of diamond would not be able to hold up to that much (~10 TPa) pressure, so you'd end up with the person depositing a pretty large amount of energy into whatever they were standing on. And their own body. So the biggest danger to someone nearby would probably be shrapnel, not a black hole.
