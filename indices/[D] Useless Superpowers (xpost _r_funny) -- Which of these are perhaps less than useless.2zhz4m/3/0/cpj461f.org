  *75% Levitation* suggests you would only need a little extra thrust to achieve "full" levitation, and even if you can't find yourself a 25% jetpack it might at least make you lighter on your feet, more agile, able to jump to great heights.

This is actually one of the powers in the /Mistborn/ series by Brandon Sanderson. You can store your weight in metal bands worn around the arms and wrists (called metalminds), making yourself lighter while you do so. This is used for extra agility, to decrease falling damage, and to jump higher. Though it's a tad more useful there, because you can store closer to 99% of your weight (and, of course, extract it).
