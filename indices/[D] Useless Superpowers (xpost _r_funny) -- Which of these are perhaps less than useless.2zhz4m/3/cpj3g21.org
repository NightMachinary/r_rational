*Read your own mind*, if it's actually a superpower (as in "more than normal capabilities") sounds like a kind of supercharged introspection that would allow you to reflect on your own thoughts and where they came from, and perhaps thereby make yourself more aware of your biases and mistakes.

*Trash detection* could, in particularly poorly cleaned areas, be used to increase your situational awareness - inferring what else is going on around you by how it disturbs the trash.

*75% Levitation* suggests you would only need a little extra thrust to achieve "full" levitation, and even if you can't find yourself a 25% jetpack it might at least make you lighter on your feet, more agile, able to jump to great heights.

The picture for *acid tears* suggests that the problem is that they immediately flow into your own unprotected eye, but if there's a helpful Panacea/Bonesaw-type around, you might be able to have yourself modified to move your tear duct, so that you express acid from somewhere more useful.

*Control remote control* is a matter of perspective - who's to say a remote control couldn't have sharp edges or an attached explosive charge, at which point it becomes a mentally controlled levitating weapon. Or you could control a large number of the things to build them into some sort of agglomerated structure - build impromptu walls and bridges to control a battlefield, or swarm an opponent with the weight of hundreds/thousands of little plastic bricks.

*Summon a lamp...once* is of limited use since it's a single-shot but you might get something useful out of it by stretching the definition of "lamp" - anything that emits light could be considered a lamp, so you just need to will yourself into summoning into existence some sort of omni-useful progenitor device... with a light.
