  Abnormal armhair growth: I simply cannot think of a use for this one.

It depends on the definition of "abnormal." If it means "ridiculously fast", then shave it frequently and use it to stuff pillows / insulate your house / weave cloth / whatever.

If it mans "armhair that is made of palladium"...win!
