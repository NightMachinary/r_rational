- Acid tears: Ow my eyes! No good.
- Invisibility in the dark: Very good for being sneaky in the dark. (Also, immunity to lasers.)
- Control remote control: With a custom-built "universal remote control", you can control a computer with your mind. Neat trick. Alternatively, build a sharp and heavy remote control and use it as a weapon.
- Communicate with fruit: Utility depends entirely on how much information is available to fruit.
- Trash Detection: Good for disposal of hazardous materials. Sweep an area to check it's clear of biological or radioactive waste.
- 75% levitation: I assume this means you can make yourself 75% lighter? Great for climbing.
- Summon a lamp once: Summon it phased through another object. Hope for an explosion.
- Bullet attraction: Wear bulletproof armour and all the bullets will hit you instead of anyone else.
- Read your own mind: True self-awareness! See your own cognitive biases in action! Mind powers are always the best.
- Instant hairloss: Instant disguise.
- Abnormal armhair growth: I simply cannot think of a use for this one.
- Absorb bad luck: Okay, bear with me on this one. Go to the casino. Bring a friend. Bet on the roulette wheel, red or black. Your friend bets twice as much as you, and on the opposite colour. You'll lose a lot of money, but they'll gain twice as much. Split the profits, then try the same stunt on the stock market.
- Super slo-mo: Slowmotion your way past the boring parts of life!
- Revive bugs: Work in conservation, protecting endangered species of bug.
- Ultra fast aging: Instant disguise that only works once. Adequate way to avoid being carded when buying alcohol.
- Invisible handwriting: Nope, I'm stumped here.
- 1 second super strength: Punch things. 1 second's all you need.
- Turn into a laptop forever: Instant disguise that only works once. Sort of.
- Seduce hats: Seduce the Crown Jewels. Elope with them.
- Desaturation: Turning back to normal is an instant disguise.
