Amusingly enough, bullet attraction appears in another Saderson series, /The Stormlight Archive/. Practitioners of a certain lost art can infuse an object to make it attract projectiles. Late in the first novel, /The Way of Kings/, a character uses this to protect his army squad from hails of arrows by infusing his shield.
