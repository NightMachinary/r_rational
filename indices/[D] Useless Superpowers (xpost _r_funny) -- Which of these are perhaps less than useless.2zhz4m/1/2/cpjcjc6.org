It doesn't say that you can choose who you absorb bad luck from and how much bad luck you absorb from each person. How do you know the bad luck you absorb won't gradually make you more and more unlucky in your search for clients? The more bad luck you absorb, the less likely you are to find a really unlucky person, and the less money you will earn. Once you've gotten a reputation for improving other people's luck, people who are already very lucky (and if you're particularly unlucky, people who aren't very generous) will come to you and have you absorb what little bad luck they have. When they don't see a significant difference in their luck, they will be less likely to pay you as much, if at all.
