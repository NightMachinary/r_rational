You could use it to disarm people, since they have bullets in their guns. Like if you're in a room full of armed people, if they haven't drawn their weapons, you can just telekinetic ally summon all their ammunition, easy. I'm sure you could find a way to use this against bullets that have already been fired, but it would be MUCH more useful against bullets that haven't been fired yet.

In effect, not too different from the disarming spell from harry potter. Guns aren't super useful without bullets
