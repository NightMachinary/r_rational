Ignoring the stuff others already mentioned...

Acid tears: emotional blackmail

Control remote control: why does everyone seem to think this is telekinesis? Sounds like infrared-based technomancy to me. Which is an awesome power.

Communicate with fruit: TONS of mechanical-turk style stuff you can do with this, explaining a task to the fruit and then having it do simpler communication with a computer using metabolic changes sensors can detect. Also most fruits are still alive and doing stuff you could presumably instruct them to change the timing of, such as germination and ripening. You could make lots of money telling crates of fruits to time their ripening to when they'll be eaten. Finally, fruits actually DOES have senses and "memories" about temperature, moisture, and the levels of various chemicals.

trash detection: capture illegal pollution stuff

read your own mind: possibly very usefully for cognitive science and AI programming, in addition to the rationality benefits. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL SUPERPOWERS EVER; WAY MORE VALUABLE THAN ANY STANDARD ONES!

Super slow-mo: Very useful for science on stuff that normally happens to fast to detect or interact all the ways you want to. Also, greatly reducing life support needed for space missions.

Revive bugs: Amber get. Cue Jurassic Park. Or in more generality, getting back long extinct species from fossils is the way to go here. Insert all the standard arguments for why biodiversity is a very very valuable thing here.
