You don't get magical powers because magical powers aren't real, clearly in this hypothetical universe something weird is going on.

Also, you can get much more powerful than sulfuric acid. If you get more potent acids then you can melt through a wider variety of materials that normally don't interact with acids. You also get mixtures that explode if they get into contact with water as they react so vigorously.
