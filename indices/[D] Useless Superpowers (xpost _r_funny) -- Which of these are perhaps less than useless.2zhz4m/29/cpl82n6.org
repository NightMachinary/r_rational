Super-slow mo: Jump off a plane. Activate slow-mo the instant before landing. If you act like you have tremendous inertia while slowed to outside forces, you could basically have conditional super-strength by swinging a hammer and activating slow-mo mid-swing. Combined with 75% levitation and a jetpack that provides more than 2.95 m/s acceleration per your body weight, which has already been brought up, this would allow you to perform orbital strikes by yourself. Assuming the one-second super-strength comes with super-durability as well, you could even survive it if you timed it properly. Summoning a lamp that intersects another object might result in the annihilation of both, meaning a four-kilogram lamp materialized in a sphere of osmium would result in an antimatter-equivalent explosion with force equal to ((volume of lamp/density of osmium)+4 kg)/c^{2.} Bug revival - does this include fossils? Because, back in the day, there were some pretty badass bugs. Also, desaturation = urban camo.
