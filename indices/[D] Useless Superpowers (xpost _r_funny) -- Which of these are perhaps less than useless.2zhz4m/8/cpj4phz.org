Acid tears. assuming this lacks immunity to acid, a very bad power. If not it serves as a way to do touch attacks.

Invisibility in the dark. In mild moonlight. Very strong power.

Control remote control. Could be very useful, depending on how hard you can throw it. Could you attach a spike to the end of the remote control and use it as a spear? Attach a bomb?

Communicate with fruit. Since fruit isn't sentient, is this making them sentient? If not, then it's not really a super power- anyone can do a one way communication with fruit.

Trash detection. Hide some trash in someone's car, homing beacon. Throw trash at someone, now you can see them in the dark, even if they're invisible in the dark. Very useful power, depending on the range.

75% levitation. Potent speed boost power, would let you run very fast.

Summon a lamp, once. Very weak powers are predictably not very useful. If you can summon any lamp

Summon a lamp like this worth 2 million, or a lamp made of pure platinum fifty feet high.

Bullet attraction. Attract them to an armored body part.

Read your own mind. Useful for introspection I suppose.

Instant hairloss. Useful for disguise purposes I suppose. Perhaps if it really does instantly vanish the hair you could use it to get rid of radioactive waste? If you could do it to others you could give haircuts or threaten people with hairloss if they didn't help you.

Abnormal arm+c+hair growth. Depends on how abnormal.

Absorb bad luck. Useful service to sell.
