Bullet attraction could be heavily abused on a battlefield. Construct a movable bunker, basically just huge walls of lead carried on the back of a sturdy tank, and parade it slightly off to the side of your rushing forces. Bam, your troops can now close the gap.

Alternatively depending on what "bullet" translates to this could be used to assist orbital strikes in their accuracy.

Invisibility in the dark has basically created a perfect nocturnal assassin that can't be caught on film or with infrared. 75% levitation, if that applies to things you're wearing, means a person could carry almost twice the equipment of the average soldier/laborer. Have them use their power on an entire train car which is attached to their shirt then save 75% of fuel costs & undercut all shipping competitors. Reviving bugs could be used to decimate competitors crop fields, imagine bugs that refused to die despite the use of pesticides just continually eating your crops despite the fact they're covered in poisons.
