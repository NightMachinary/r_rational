...yes it does, Sanderson misnamed it in Mistborn either deliberately or by accident. I made a thread about it [[http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/888-effects-of-iron-feruchemy/][here]] a few years ago. It has practically every quote related to the use of Iron Feruchemy from the start of Mistborn to ch. 6 of Alloy of Law, as well as analysis on all of it.
