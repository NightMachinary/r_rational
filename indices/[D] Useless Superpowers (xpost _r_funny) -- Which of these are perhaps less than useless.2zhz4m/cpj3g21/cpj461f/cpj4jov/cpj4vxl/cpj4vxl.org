Yup, you're basically storing "units" of weight/rate that you could measure in poundhours, and when you're not storing, those units are just sitting there waiting to be used. I don't think there's a limit on how many units you can use at one time either, aside from common sense. So if you need to weigh a 1000 pounds for a minute, you could get that by having stored up 16 pounds for an hour.

There's a /Mistborn/ RPG that I have at home that gives all the rules for this which the novels sort of gloss over. IIRC there's also a limit based on how much metal you have available to you to dump weight in.

(And weight is only one of sixteen attributes that you can dump and then pull out.)
