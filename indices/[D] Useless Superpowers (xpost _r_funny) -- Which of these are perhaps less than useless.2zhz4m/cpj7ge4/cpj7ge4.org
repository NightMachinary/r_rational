Okay, let's see...

Acid tears: I can't see an upside to this.

Invisible in the dark: low rated stranger power, great for covert missions at night.

Remote control control: depending on the strength of the TK this could be great.

Communicate with fruit: aaaaaaand I'm no longer a vegetarian.

Trash detection: could locate sentient alien life via detecting their trash.

75% levitation: energy from nothing, entropy is solved.

Summon a lamp once: ...does this power obey the Manton Effect? If not, it's a good assassination tool, because no one will believe you had anything to do with it, and even if they did all tests will show that you can't summon lamps.

Bullet attraction: wear sufficient armour and summon all bullets everywhere. The world is now much less armed.

Read your own mind: very useful rationality tool.

Instant hairloss: ...I got nothing.

Abnormal armhair growth: see above.

Absorb bad luck: absorb all bad luck everywhere, the rest of humanity now only has good luck.

Super slow-mo: slow your body to the point where time passes at a rate of 20 years per second for you. Instant cryopreservation.

Revive bug: team up with Skitter and take over the bay.

Ultra fast aging: this isn't a superpower, it's a progeroid syndrome.

Invisible handwriting: hide evidence by liquifying it, then writing using it as ink.

1sec super strength: Become a boxing champion.

Turn into a laptop forever: unless the laptop runs an emulation of your brain, or has something really useful for humanity on it, this is just suicide for no good reason.

Seduce hats: ...

Desaturation: allow scientists to study the effect you have on EM radiation, leading to breakthroughs in physics.
