  I wouldn't generally recommend The Dagger and the Coin series because it's rather dry, but I think this sub in particular would appreciate fantasy that's more focused on economics and philosophy.

I'll second your mild recommendation for /The Dagger and the Coin/, and add that /The Long Price Quartet/ (starting with /A Shadow in Summer/) by the same author is very good, and I found it to be even more in line with this sub, with themes of existential risk, and alien intelligence in addition to the generally good plotting and scheming.
