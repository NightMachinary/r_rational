I'm one of those, and I'm also the first to admit it's very different from the others. Mostly in that it has an identifiable plot arc, rather than just continuity. But it really doesn't fit into the pattern of the rest of Trek. I see TOS, TNG, and Voyager as forming an irresistible progression. Kirk the explorer, Picard the diplomat, Janeway the warrior. Diplomacy from weakness, equality, and strength.
