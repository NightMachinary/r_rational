TV:

[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/][The Good Place]] is, well, good. It's managed to be both funny and surprising going into the second season, and I strongly recommend it.

I've been watching a little bit of [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3865236/][Into the Badlands]] recently, and while I can't recommend it on the merits of the plot, the fight scenes are quite nice for a TV show.

[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/][Lucifer]] is still funny, though it seems to have lost a little bit of drama going into the third season (in particular, I think they're drawing out the "Lucifer reveals the truth to the detective" arc too much).

Which Star Treks are good? I've been watching the Orville, which has seemed alright, if slightly underwhelming, and I'm not sure if that's because it's legitimately an average show, or because I'm not the target audience. I haven't watched a whole lot of Star Trek (the "save the whales" movie, /Into Darkness/, and /Darmok/), so I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for which movies/TV series/episodes to people would recommend for comparison.

Books:

It's a long way from new, but I would strongly recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky][A Deepness in the Sky]] to any fan of science fiction. It's my favorite work in the genre, and I think it works well either on its own or as a prequel to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep][A Fire Upon the Deep]].

I wouldn't generally recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dagger_and_the_Coin][The Dagger and the Coin]] series because it's rather dry, but I think this sub in particular would appreciate fantasy that's more focused on economics and philosophy.
