I remember reading the "Thirteen and a half lives of captain Blue Bear" and "Rumo" by Walter Moers at that age but be warned there is a bunch of pretty gory stuff and body horror in there. The Cyclops only like to eat their prey alive and struggling. The illustrations are pretty beautiful and the story is endearing, I am pretty sure that "Rumo" is a deconstruction of the hero's journey it might be more appropriate to a seven year old.
