For a significant part of my childhood, up to and including high school years, my dad read the Riftwar Cycle to us after supper. The first saga is about Midkemia, a relatively normal fantasy world, as it gets invaded by the Tsurani, humans from another planet who found their way to Midkemia through rift technology and desired the natural resources Midkemia has. The first trilogy is about Pug, an orphan in a relatively minor holding who gets apprenticed to the local magician and eventually gets wrapped up in the war.

The world comes across as surprisingly fleshed out, which is a result of Midkemia being a world the author used for roleplay. He had a rule that to participate you had to add one thing to the world, be it a place or a historical figure or a species, and once he made Midkemia into a setting for a story there were tons of elements scattered around with no grand purpose for the plot behind them, making them feel that much more authentic when you come across them.

As the story goes on and you enter new trilogies, you find that decades may have passed and the exploits of main characters a trilogy or two ago are the stuff of legends. When the master sailor is forced to brave the most dangerous of waters in what amounts to creative suicide and /succeeds/, people talk about it books later.

Of course check them out yourself before reading them to your children, but this was a formative series for me and while it's been quite a while since I read those first books I highly recommend them.
