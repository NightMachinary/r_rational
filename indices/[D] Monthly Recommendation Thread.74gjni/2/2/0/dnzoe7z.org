I agree that the series (especially the beginning ones and the co-authored trilogy on Kelewan) were great. Also extremely formative for me - Laurie's speech on what love means in the second book (or second half of /Magician/) is still one I quote today to explain my feelings on the matter. But I can't imagine having a parent read some parts of the first book out loud to a young child. That scene with Pug and Carline in the tower before he leaves? Gets a bit too steamy for ages 5-7...
