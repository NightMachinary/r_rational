You know, I completely forgot about that until just now, but yeah, with that in mind it'd probably be best to wait a few years first. I don't know exactly how old I was when we started the series but I'm pretty sure that scene mostly went over my head.

Ah well, that at least gives a few years to maybe read the series on their own before deciding, but I kinda feel like even if they read it to them now or soon it wouldn't traumatize the kids or anything since (if I'm remembering right, please correct me if I'm wrong since this /was/ a long time ago) most of the content in question is subtleties that the kids will just not catch in the first place.

edit: also now that I think about it my dad had a tendency to censor what he was reading at times because he doesn't like swearing or other words like that, so in retrospect my impressions of the writing style could've been significantly different from what it actually was.
