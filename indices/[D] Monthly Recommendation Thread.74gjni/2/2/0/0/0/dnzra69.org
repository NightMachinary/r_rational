  I kinda feel like even if they read it to them now or soon it wouldn't traumatize the kids or anything since (if I'm remembering right, please correct me if I'm wrong since this was a long time ago) most of the content in question is subtleties that the kids will just not catch in the first place.

Oh I agree. They probably just won't understand what's going on. I think I read the series around... 12?... and I definitely had a better grasp of what was happening.
