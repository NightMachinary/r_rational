People might be turned off by her politics, but I think that [[http://www.anamardoll.com/2011/02/narnia-narnia-deconstruction-index-post.html][Ana Mardoll]] does a good job of talking about how the Narnia books aren't very well-written and how Lewis's worldview really tarnishes them besides. She's currently wrapping up /Horse and His Boy/, and is doing this in publication order, so /Magician's Nephew/ and /The Last Battle/ are all that's left.
