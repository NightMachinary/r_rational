You might have a point, it's obviously many years since I've read them. I think they have a great sense of atmosphere, though, which is nice when reading out loud. And the characters are vividly depicted even if, as you say, the depth of characterization often isn't there.

Percy Jackson is supposed to be good for younguns, but possibly for kids older than yours? I also remember enjoying A Wrinkle in Time and The Dark Is Rising as a kid.
