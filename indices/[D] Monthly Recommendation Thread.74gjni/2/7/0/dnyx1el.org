Sorry, but we did the first two books of Narnia, and although I thought they were great as a kid, I can't figure out why now. It's one deus ex machina after another--heavy on the deus. I honestly have no real problem with the religious stuff, either; it's how I was raised, and the books are supposed to be allegorical.

But there's just no real plot structure in there. Aslan fixes all, and if the children are ever in any danger, it's only due to their lack of faith in Aslan and his inevitable resolution of all plot points. It makes for a very clumsy, ham-fisted story, with extremely little dramatic tension. Character development, such as it is, is usually limited to one character per book, and even when the rest of the characters are not flat, static foils, tired cliches, or mere scenery, his female characters are almost invariably all three.

And then there's the problem of Susan (Google it, or read the story by Neil Gaiman here: [[http://grotesqueanddecadent.tumblr.com/post/21272759751/the-problem-of-susan-by-neil-gaiman]])

I just don't think they are good or satisfying stories, and I can only chalk up their enduring success to how unlike anything else they were when they were written. The fact that a work is intended for children seems to excuse all manner of literary clumsiness, and while I can admit that the Narnia books were quite original in their day, I can't imagine why they've stood up over time. I have to chalk that up to the religious content and the fact that, like I did, most people who've enjoyed them did so as children, without the benefit of any experience with a really gripping narrative.

The omake bit in HPMOR knocking the Narnia books was dead on.
