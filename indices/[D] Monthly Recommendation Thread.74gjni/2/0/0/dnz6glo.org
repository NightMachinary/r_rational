Fair enough, although we've already done the first few Harry Potter books, and I'm holding off on the latter half of the series, as I think it's a little dark for them just yet. I recently tried some Discworld (which are some of my favorites), but they're a bit young for those yet and didn't really take to them like I'd hoped. My son liked it at least, but it was a bit slow for his taste, and all the puns and references go over his head. Part of the problem might also have been my bored daughter's constant interruptions. Still, my policy is that if they don't actively want me to read it to them, we find something else to read.

Maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself. Still, it'd be nice if there were a few more level 1 intelligent characters in juvenile fiction.
