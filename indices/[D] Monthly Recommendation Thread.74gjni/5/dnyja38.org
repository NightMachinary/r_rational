/[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204390][World's End]]/ is a fun (if [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair#Political_career][propagandistic]]) slice-of-life story. See also /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ (which I've read several times), /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7522][King Coal]]/ (which I haven't yet gotten around to completing), and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16470][The Profits of Religion]]/ (/enormously/-entertaining nonfiction propaganda), written by the same author and available for free at those links (unlike /[[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/worlds-end-upton-sinclair/1005894087?ean=9781504026451][World's End]]/, which I got on sale for two dollars through Goodreads).
