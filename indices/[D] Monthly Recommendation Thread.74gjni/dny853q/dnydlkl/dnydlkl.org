Sounds good, but is it finished?

Edit: Nevermind, I figured out what that Status field at the top of every chapter of Fanfiction.net stories is for.

Edit edit: Yes, it's complete.

Edit edit edit: It was fun and enjoyable. I won't say it was incredible, but it was well done (overlooking a few minor typos, grammatical errors, and revision errors that resulted in garbled sentences, but those were not distractingly frequent). The highlight is the characterizations and their interactions, which are interesting, original (or true-to-the-source-but-intelligent-about-it) and well-executed. The story doesn't have a huge amount of dramatic tension (as most of the dangers from the original content are fairly easily navigated by cautious, intelligent characters who actually think about their situations for a moment instead of being Gryffindors), but the story is interesting, the dialogue is both good and often amusing, and a number of fun, light-hearted shots are taken at the tropes of the original series. It was definitely worth the read.
