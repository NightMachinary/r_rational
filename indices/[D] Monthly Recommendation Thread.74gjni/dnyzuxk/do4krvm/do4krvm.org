I came across a spectacular time travel HP fanfic recently. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]] takes Harry back to Tom Riddle's school years, during Grindelwald's heyday. The characterization for Dumbledore and Riddle is the best I've ever seen and the butterflies from Harry's presence make Tom's perspective quite gripping. Not slash-bait.
