On the "Last" point, my reading was:

[[#s][reading]]

On second thoughts about the book, I don't think I'll be /able/ to re-read it. It's just too psychologically /twisted/. [[#s][Nancy's ending]] [[#s][That other girl with the eyes]]

The author has /problems/, and I'd really like to see this 'Verse given a fix-rat-fic. Include both sorts of kids in the same school, adequately and fully present a wide variety of possible stances to take towards the experience, and allow that different responses are healthy or unhealthy, based on the situation. Make Nonsense and Logic orthogonal to Virtue and Wickedness, so that we don't have to hear constant moaning about how the characters wanted to stay in unicorn rainbow land forever [[#s][yikes tho]]

Heck, [[#s][Eleanor]]

Speaking of Sumi, [[#s][Oracular Urchin]]

Also, it was pretty thoroughly implied that [[#s][Jack]]

Lastly, [[#s][world types]]

I ended up +almost+ rooting for the villain once I realized what they were up to. They weren't sitting home crying into their pillows. They were /solving their problem rationally/, in exactly the way that experience best suggested, horrific as that was. Monstrous, sure, but it's not like there hadn't been whimsical suggestions of grisly murder since the first pages of the book, as something that might /just happen/. Monstrous, but in its way, a psychologically healthier response than the toxic middle-ground everyone /else/ was inhabiting, between full relapse and proper rehabilitation.
