So yesterday I bought [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EveryHeartADoorway][/Every Heart a Doorway/]], and ended up more-or-less reading it in one night and morning.

If an intellectual thing can be a mindfuck, this thing is a feelsfuck. /Damn./

Without spoiling, it's /dark/. Like, it takes what ought to be a whimsical magic-boarding-school genre and turns it into regular emotional knife-twists and serial killing. It made me sympathize with the characters even when I was judging them for basically being doubly-abused children with a measure of Stockholm Syndrome, and then it started hurting them /more/, and then it would give little narration details that made it /even worse/.

Or maybe I've just read enough Discworld to immediately compare what happened in /this/ book to the Queen of the Elves, and see a level of darkness that wasn't even there.

Or maybe my real problem is that I've been repeatedly torn away from my roots in life and /am/ my inner child, so I empathize with the characters /much/ too easily.
