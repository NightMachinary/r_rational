I'm finding that to be a surprisingly difficult question to answer. I want to answer with works of fanfiction known to this community, comparing apples-to-apples, but unfortunately the set of stories I enjoy and the set of stories I consider well-written are not 1-to-1. Maybe /Luminosity/? But not /Radiance/, which was very poorly done. /Time Braid/, of course, even if it does have its share of problems. /Applied Cultural Anthropology/ showed up recently; I thought it was extremely well written, even if its incompleteness makes it difficult to judge as a whole.

Concerning /The Waves Arisen/, I can say I thought some of the re-imagining of the Naruto-verse was well done, even though I didn't like the grimdark feel it gave the story. Maybe I should ask in turn what makes you think it was well-written? Suppose for a moment that the overtly rationalist elements were removed or downplayed. Can it be considered good in any sense?
