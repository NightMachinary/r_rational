  Concerning The Waves Arisen, I can say I thought some of the re-imagining of the Naruto-verse was well done, even though I didn't like the grimdark feel it gave the story.

So it's weird for me to see you say that after praising Time Braid, since Time Braid has things like Tsukuyomi mindrape almost right away, which is one of the things that turned me off the story (unless that is part of the share of problems you alluded to).

I found Waves Arisen very competently written from a technical standpoint (sentence-by-sentence). At a higher level, the plotting was solid, where I could see how every arc led into the next and it wasn't just a collection of stuff happening. Mostly what I liked, though, was the rationalization of the Naruto verse, as opposed to the didactic rational/ist/ elements. It had a similar appeal to me as something like Mother of Learning, where there was a fantasy world that seemed internally consistent in terms of "who was doing what sorts of things for what sorts of reasons," and it did it without inserting elements into the pre-existing setting that came out of left field (e.g. Time Braid's demon metaphysics which have no precedent in Naruto). Even if you got rid of the lessons about rationality or the anti-deathist stuff, it's still got a coherence that does a lot for me.
