I'm putting [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/40/Walk-on-the-Moon][walk on the moon]] in my "hiatus" bookmarks folder (I'm going to go ahead and create a "hiatus" bookmarks folder) but what's there so far is a pretty interesting read. IIRC it was recommended in one of the earlier rec threads here.

I also have [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/leaves-of-grass-naruto-si.28246/][leaves of grass]] bookmarked but I don't think I started reading that yet and I don't remember where I heard of it so can't comment on the quality, just that it seems to have had an interesting/trusted enough source and/or description for me to bookmark it.
