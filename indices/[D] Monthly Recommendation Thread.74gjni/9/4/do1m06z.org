Haven't gone too far into the Naruto fanfic scene, but Dreaming of Sunshine is very enjoyable. The author does a rather good job of making things in the Naruto world make any sense, which is an accomplishment. Has a Sasuke who gradually goes from his canon self to someone who isn't an ass all the time.
