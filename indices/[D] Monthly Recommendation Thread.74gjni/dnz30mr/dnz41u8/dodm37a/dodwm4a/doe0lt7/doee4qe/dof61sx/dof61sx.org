I do not see that at all.

Would it help if you understood that /Time Braid/ is technically a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_Goddess!][crossover fic]]?

  I found Waves Arisen very competently written from a technical standpoint

Good sentence-by-sentence construction is one thing. Necessary, even, or I won't even read a thing. But insufficient. The plotting of /The Waves Arisen/ was fine. Not superb, but fine. That is to say, it was clearly written from a complete outline that existed at the outset. But scene-by-scene, it was terrible. It's like the author just gave up halfway through every scene, and killed off characters just so he wouldn't have to deal with them or their consequences.
