The Waves Arisen is a complete fanfic that came out in early 2015 by someone with no web presence under that name before or since. I believe everyone accepts that [[/u/Wertifloke]] was a pseudonym for someone who didn't want to publish rationalist Naruto fic under their usual name. I'm about 60% for it being by Yudkowsky.
