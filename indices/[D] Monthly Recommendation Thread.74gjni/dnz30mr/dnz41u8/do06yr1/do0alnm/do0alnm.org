There is definitely a /lot/ of thematic overlap. My 40% non-Yudkowsky space in part represents my subjective estimate for "this is so EY that it feels redundant with his other stuff, to the point where I could write a long post detailing all the similarities, and so another person wrote it" (which obviously got a complexity penalty). But I still think it is more likely he wrote it than not.
