Part of the reason I think you might want thematic redundancy like that is either if you're A) a somewhat polarizing figure or B) you want to create a feeling of false consensus. That is, if you are the kind of guy that a lot of people seem to have a hate boner for, you could write under a pseudonym in order to reach those people, who might not otherwise give your work the time of day. And similarly, you might want to trick people into thinking "oh, well authors A, B, and C think that" because that will cause them to weight whatever you wrote about higher (this is one of the primary reasons that people on the internet use sockpuppets).
