Thirded. Also agree that the Long Price Quartet is even better (although the writing starts out not amazing, it does get a lot better as the series goes on). I'm a huge fan of Daniel Abraham so I'd recommend anything he's written, even the urban fantasy (Black Sun's Daughter) and of course the Expanse series.
