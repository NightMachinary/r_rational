  Which Star Treks are good
#+end_quote

I recommend starting with the middle seasons of The Next Generation. The original series is fun, but can occasionally be cheesy by modern standards. Voyager, Enterprise and the first season of TNG could be anywhere from decent to painful depending on the episode. A lot of people like DS9, but it's a departure from, and in some cases a deconstruction of Roddenberry's formula of peaceful, heroic exploration and extremely secular optimism, so I don't think I'd recommend it as a starting point.

Mid-series TNG, though, holds up well. The writing is smart, the characters are likable, the effects still look decent, and it's probably the best example of the kind of idealistic themes the series is famous for.
