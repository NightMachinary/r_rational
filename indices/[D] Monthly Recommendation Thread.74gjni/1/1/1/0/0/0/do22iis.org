I think it casts a fascinating contrast between two different types of deity.

The Prophets were aloof. They sent divine artifacts to their chosen people which served as cut-and-dried evidence of their existence, but these artifacts ranged from vision quest tools to horribly dangerous time machines. Occasionally, prophecies would be handed down to those who used the Orbs, and these prophecies were fairly accurate, if sometimes inscrutable before the fact. They were reliable, and the general thrust of their interactions with Bajor were positive. It was pretty difficult, as a Bajoran, to think that the Prophets were malevolent. Far away and incapable of answering most prayers, perhaps, but not malevolent.

It's a good religion, and those who truly knew the voice of its deities were good people. You know, the way most religions claim their followers should be.

The Founders, on the other hand, were clearly evil. The only people who worshipped them were those they genetically engineered and brainwashed to worship them. Subservient pawns who received nothing but abuse at their hands and would sacrifice themselves in an instant for their sake. They ruled with an iron grip over countless civilizations, the fear they and their warriors instilled the only binding force. Their crusade brought them to the other side of the galaxy, where they were beaten back by those who relied upon realistic assessments of their own capabilities rather than their reputation and delusions of grandeur.

You know, how most religions wind up playing out.

The scene where Sisko convinces the Prophets to vanish the Jem Hadar fleet coming through the wormhole was the clash between these two religions, and the real religion with good deities handily won by virtue of having never lied about their power. Outside the wormhole they could do very little, that's why they needed the Orbs. But the wormhole itself was their domain, their celestial temple. If the Founders had bothered to listen to the Bajorans and observed their evidence for their religion, they might have realized that. Instead, they lied to everyone including themselves.

Kind of like most real world religions do.
