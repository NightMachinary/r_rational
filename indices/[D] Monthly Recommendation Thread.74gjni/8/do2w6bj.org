[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/72/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry potter and the natural 20]] hasn't been updated in almost 3 years but I made a "hiatus" bookmarks folder for another story so I figured I'd look this one up again and mention it here. It's a funny, rational, unfinished HP + D&D crossover.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/chapters/8982751][Amelia]] is a pretty well-written worm fanfic. I'm pretty sure it's finished.
