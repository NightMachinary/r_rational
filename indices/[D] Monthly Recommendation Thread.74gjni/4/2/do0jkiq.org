Re:CREATORS comes from the same writers, directors, and animators as Fate/Zero with a /vaguely/ similar premise that explores interesting ideas. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an adaptation of another manga from the same creator of Arslan Senki and previously held the highest score on MAL before Your Name. I can vouch that the latter has a fantastic English dub.
