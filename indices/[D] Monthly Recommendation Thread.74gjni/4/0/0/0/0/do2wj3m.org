+1 for made in abyss. I haven't read the manga but the anime does still have some weird short thematic bits and pieces that don't really fit with everything else (like the method used to punish the kids for even pretty mild rulebreaking, wtf). They're pretty easily ignored though and the anime doesn't dwell on them so overall it's a pretty relaxed adventure story that only catches up to reality (i.e. what the characters should really have gone through given the difficulty of what they've attempted and their experience) in the last few episodes.

So I'd say it starts getting pretty rational only at the end but it's well-drawn and funny and interesting so worth a watch regardless.
