I second that. Made in abyss is good and, at for this season( assuming they make more seasons, otherwise I'll read the manga) , it seems to have good and consistent worlbuilding. Also it seems that the kids are going to have to be smart( and lucky) to survive instead of being given power ups .The anime seems a lighthearted shounen first , because of the art stile and other reasons , but then things start to happen, like that the training montage that is obviously not enough to make a significant difference , doesn't make a significant difference,( I mean it's difficult to measure how useful it was and it probably helped, but what I mean is that it wasn't ussed as an excuse to make them extremely more competent )and then chapters10-13 happen.
