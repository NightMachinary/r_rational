  [[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/12/hospitals-across-england-hit-by-large-scale-cyber-attack][The NHS has been hit as part of a global cyber-attack that threw hospitals and businesses in the UK and across the world into chaos.]] [..] Ross Anderson, a computer security expert at Cambridge University, said the attack appeared to exploit a weakness highlighted in secret CIA documents released in March by WikiLeaks. Publication of the documents led Microsoft to issue a “critical” software patch to close the loophole, but it is unclear whether it was installed on NHS computers. [..] “If large numbers of NHS organisations failed to act on a critical notice from Microsoft two months ago, then whose fault is that?” Anderson said. [..] Alan Woodward, visiting professor of computing at the University of Surrey, said that the attack's success “is likely to be because some organisations have either not applied the patch released by Microsoft, or they are using outdated operating systems”. NHS Digital said it was unable to comment on this at short notice.

TL;DR: Shit's on fire, yo. Make sure any Windows systems you are dependant on are not vulnerable to this cryptovirus.
