I've been rewriting a (non-rational) fanfic I started working on over a year ago. It's still not great, but I'd love any sort of feedback on it, especially what areas I should try to improve on at the moment.

  Naruto's angry, Sasuke's sad, Kakashi's an alcoholic, and Sakura is starting to not give a shit anymore. This wasn't what they'd expected from Ninja life, but as Konoha's enemies gather, there's no time for regrets. A strong Team Seven AU with a mystery time-traveller.
