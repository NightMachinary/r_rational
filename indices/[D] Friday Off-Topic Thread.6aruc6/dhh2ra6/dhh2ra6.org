Has anyone been watching the new season of Doctor Who? I've been seeing a lot of praise for it, but all the episodes so far I thought were just okay. As a diehard Clara hater who considers the previous season to be an endurance test (I didn't even like Hell Bent as much as everyone else), I still think consistently okay is a step up. In particular, Thin Ice felt like it was written in response to how much I despised Kill The Moon.

So it's hard for me to call this new season a disappointment, but I still don't think it's a return to form. I was hoping I would see a return to the glory days after The Husbands of River Song became one of my favorite episodes of the series, for reasons besides it being the first episode after Clara had left, but even if this season ends up being forgettable at least it doesn't enrage me with how boring and stupid it is.

I've been watching the anime Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (I prefer dubs, sue me), and it's become one of the biggest surprises I've had lately. It's a slice of life comedy the a stoic computer programmer Kobayashi who happens to be a maid otaku and a dragon with godlike powers named who's in love with Kobayashi for some reason so she turns herself into a moe maid, plus several other dragons who show up, and against all odds I actually find it very compelling.

It's hard to pin down exactly why, especially since it features so many tropes and kinds of jokes I've seen before and haven't liked before, but aside from me finally being inoculated to the quirkier aspects of anime I think it's because the show is pretty damn rational. Kobayashi's reason for letting a dragon who openly expresses romantic feelings she doesn't reciprocate move into her house isn't entirely logical, but everything after that checks off all the boxes for rational fiction.

Kobayashi is skilled at problem solving and continuously pursues her goals using the resources at her disposal, the dragons have a logical mindset for their alien values, what little worldbuilding and descriptions of magic we get are consistent, and the story acknowledges the horrific implications of the situation and how it could potentially all go wrong. It's kind of like The Devil is a Part-Timer with all of the roles reversed or Sgt. Frog if it took its story and characters seriously.

I haven't finished it yet, but I get the impression that there is more to it than simply being another slice of life comedy with fantasy elements. I feel like I relate to the characters in ways I don't entirely understand and there is some underlying theme to the story about becoming an adult and managing relationships both friendly and familial. The way it presents it is definitely odd, both in terms of story content and direction, but even if it ends up being just good rather than great I'll still be satisfied.
