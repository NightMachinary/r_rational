Those videos are what got me to watch the show in the first place. If I hadn't been confident that I was going to enjoy the show I probably would've never seen it at all. Not because it's slice of life, but because it has fetishistic elements like yuri bait, maids, and gags involving giant boobs that I have zero interest in. I sadly had every surprise spoiled for me, but it still ended up being a good time now that I've finished it.

The ending was a bit underwhelming and I thought the explanation Torru's father gave for his actions contradicted hints given about dragon politics prior to that, but I still like the series enough to check out the manga for more. I think what I like about it is that the flawed characters simultaneously make me feel okay about my insecurities while still encouraging me to keep on working to live life to the fullest.

EDIT: Other shows I can recommend in the same vein are The Devil is a Part-Timer (only one season, manga has more story) and Ouran High School Host Club. Both are slice of life comedies featuring goofy characters and surprisingly serious stories that made me feel happy afterward.

The only straight-up slice of life show I've liked is the moe-filled season one of K-On! It didn't make me laugh or cry, but it made me smile and helped me relax when I needed both. It's cute for the sake of cute with the bare minimum amount of story necessary, but it knows what it is and embraces it.
