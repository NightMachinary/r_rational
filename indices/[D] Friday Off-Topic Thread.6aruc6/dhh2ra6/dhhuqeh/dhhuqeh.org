Re Dragon Maid, I too found it weirdly appealing. I'm a big anime fan, but not when it comes to slice of life. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uejsTnvmudY][Digibro's videos on the show]] were helpful in pointing out some of the stuff that I hadn't even realized I was enjoying. You should probably finish the show before you watch the videos, though - there are some spoilers in there.
