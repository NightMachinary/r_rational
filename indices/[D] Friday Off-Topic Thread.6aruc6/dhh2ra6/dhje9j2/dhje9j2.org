I stopped watching Dr. Who because I just got sick of Clara, and I'm glad to hear others found her so hard to stomach too. Now that I know she's gone I should probably give catching up a try to see how I feel about the show without her. I highly doubt it will ever be as good (to me) as it was in the 10th's time, but I can hope.

I'm enjoying watching a new anime every week though, so might be awhile before I do.
