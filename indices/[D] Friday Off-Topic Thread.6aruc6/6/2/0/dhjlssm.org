I very highly recommend The Husbands of River Song. It was the first episode after Clara left and proved to me that Doctor Who could be good again. It features the long overdue return one of my favorite reoccurring characters, puts the Doctor in a unique and interesting situation unlike anything I've ever seen, uses that situation to give clever new insight into his relationship with River, and is just plain fun! I couldn't remember the last time I'd had watching Doctor Who.

The whole episode is just a fun adventure with fun characters saying funny dialogue yet the story could still be taken completely seriously. It was the best time I had had with Doctor Who in years and one of my favorite episodes of all time. David Tennent will always be my favorite doctor, but this is the one episode where Capaldi has reached that level and stayed there for the entire episode. Even if the glory days are behind us, I don't think the magic is totally dead yet.
