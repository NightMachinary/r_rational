I'm honestly really glad I'm not alone in hating that episode, and Clara dislike.

I studied classroom pedagogy for years in college, and you will never, never convince me that Clara was intended to be a good teacher.

I'd love to see a Game of Thrones crossover video where Arya Stark was reciting her list of names of people to kill and coincidentally added Clara's name to the end, since the actor who played Arya was instrumental to Clara's death. Arya Stark: badass enough to assassinate people from entirely different universes. (crackfic)
