To be fair a drowsee probably doesn't need to hit that hard when hypnosis makes their prey totally defenseless. I can totally see their telekinetic power being underdeveloped in favor of a more powerful hypnosis/dream eater.

Also that people can become crazy/vegetables after a dream eater attack is terrifying.
