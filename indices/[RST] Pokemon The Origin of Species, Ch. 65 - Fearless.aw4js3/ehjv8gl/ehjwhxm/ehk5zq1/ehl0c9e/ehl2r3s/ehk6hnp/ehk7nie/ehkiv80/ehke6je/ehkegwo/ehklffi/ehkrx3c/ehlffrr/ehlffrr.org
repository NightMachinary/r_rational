To elaborate on what I'm trying to say, even a single very strong punch by a strong human man (let alone any other ape) could kill the average person. So the fact that she basically got up again suggests it was, in fact, force on a human scale of things. Even if the force was more than what the /average/ human could procure, it was not above the range of what a trained human fighter might be able to deliver, and far below what for instance a gorilla would deliver.

This surprised me because throughout this story I've sort of been assuming that pokemon power is orders of magnitude above what you'd expect bullets and shields to be effective on, let alone an ape. if pokemon force operates on those scales, you would expect a human with a weapon to be somewhat more effective against them. Therefore you'd expect trainers to be armed with something more than just pokeballs (for the odd occasion when they ran across a pokemon low level enough to take on themselves). I thought the reason Trainers did not bother with conventional weapons, and the reason Pokemon themselves were not trained to use weapons, was that Pokemon were just so tough and so strong that an ordinary weapon would not realistically add anything to the situation.

(I was similarly surprised that e.g. Machamp could not carry two human beings and not be slowed down to less than a human's running speed - due to the absence of weapons I've been imagining bigger power differentials between humans and pokemon than perhaps were intended.)

That is to say, if that's the best Drowsee has to offer in terms of brute force, (Dark type) Blue holding a spear would have a pretty good chance of slaughtering it. Add a gun and it's no contest. Which means the rangers would be carrying guns, just in case they encounter a situation like this.

(Anyway, this is now more nitpicking about a relatively tiny detail than is necessary haha)
