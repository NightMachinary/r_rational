  While racing back to the burning hospital, they pass by two formations of patients and trainers early on, and then no one else. It makes Aiko feel nervous, then hopeful. Maybe there's no one left to evacuate. Maybe they can just turn around and head back to Leaf...

  A vibration runs through the ground, shaking the street beneath her tires and almost spilling her. She hears breaking glass and cracking sounds from the buildings around her, which makes her nervous, and when they arrive a couple minutes later she immediately notices two things: how much more of the building is now on fire, and how much emptier the campus is.

This is a tricky scene transition, so thank you for taking feedback on it. I backed up a few paragraphs and read the new version to see how it works. You ended up telling us that Aiko is feeling nervous in back-to-back paragraphs. It feels repetitive as a reader.

As always, thank you for writing such a compelling story. I really enjoy it!
