I see people calling this the “Stormbringer arc” or the “Zapdos arc” but I vote we name it the “Daystar tests how bad he can make us feel for Red in as few chapters as possible arc”. I mean Jesus Christ, someone give this kid a break.

Awesome chapter as always. Fingers crossed that Aiko makes it out alive.
