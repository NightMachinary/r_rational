I really hope Aiko makes it out alive. Besides how sad her death would make us feel, it would also have a huge impact on the rest of the group. I don't think they need something like this to end this horrible day (hard to believe all those chapters happen in about half a day).

Also, poor Red. How is he still going after everything? I don't even want to think what effect these events will have on his mental health.
