I feel like Red is getting some flak here, but in all liklihood he is correct - the risks here seem very high for a very uncertain payoff. The Second is being motivated not by a logical cost-benefit, but by a debt he owes - which is 100% a good thing to die for, human values matter, but Red and Aiko dont have to commit to that. I dont think Aiko is wrong to want to have her moment where she sacrifices and overcomes fear, but that can be used to justify anything. Red may be totally drained, but I see no reason to think he isnt the one thinking most clearly. (Of course both sides can be correct - sometimes you have to just defy the odds for yourself)

Still, now that Aiko is charging in, I feel like Red should shift is mind after some thought - his loyalty to Aiko is much stronger than to random people, again human relationships matter. So I hope he does try to help later on in the next chapter.
