Akio may still be being affected by the lingering aftermath of the pressure when making her decision to follow Jack into the building

  The thought of just staying out here while the people and pokemon burn inside... she wouldn't be able to live with herself, would never be able to look Blue or Leaf in the eyes again... The memory of how she froze up when Zapdos appeared shames her all over again. /This is my chance./

Wonder if she'll reflect on that when she has more distance from the event, assuming she makes it out alive.
