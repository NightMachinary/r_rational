He's dealing with the aftereffects of the Pressure, his own grief from overexerting himself psychically, finding dead children, witnessing people and his Pokemon being killed or wounded, and watched his friend and crush get terribly injured by a fuckhuge monster and had to carry her perhaps a mile or so through a ruined, practically war-torn city, still full of monsters and corpses, and sit alone in a hospital for hours while his friend his patched up without any support.

By himself, without other friends, without his family, without his Pikachu, and without an adult.
