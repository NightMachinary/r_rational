Ooooh boy, if this was a more stereotypical story then I would say that Aiko just set off the mother of all death flags. Especially with the kiss on the cheek she just gave Red before running into the burning building. However, I don't know DaystarEld well enough to be able to predict how likely Aiko and/or Jake will make it out.
