#+begin_quote
  storm ravaged streets
#+end_quote

This should be storm-ravaged.

#+begin_quote
  Now that we're a smaller group, need for information of each person's capabilities are magnified
#+end_quote

Subject-verb agreement; I would change this to "*the* need for information of each person's capabilities *is* magnified"

#+begin_quote
  crabby
#+end_quote

krabby

#+begin_quote
  "Tracking and pokemon care." Aiko says.
#+end_quote

Period after care should be a comma.

#+begin_quote
  It takes Aiko's eyes adjust with the remaining light outside
#+end_quote

"adjust" should be "time to adjust"

#+begin_quote
  Where the distinction is drawn in her own mental landscape?
#+end_quote

I don't understand this sentence fragment fully -- I think it should be more clearly integrated with what comes right before it.

#+begin_quote
  rush at the lipald
#+end_quote

liepard

#+begin_quote
  encompases
#+end_quote

encompasses

#+begin_quote
  likely toward a the pokemon
#+end_quote

remove "a"

#+begin_quote
  Aiko and Elaine are resting on against one of the barricades, shoulders leaning against each other as their backs lean against their bags. Eevee and Psyduck are resting with them, eating the same nutrient bars they're munching on.
#+end_quote

Two things: I don't understand why this narration is in present progressive tense instead of present simple, and the first sentence has "resting on against one", where either on or against should be deleted.

#+begin_quote
  she the dread reaches her heart
#+end_quote

remove "she"

#+begin_quote
  Some trainers just arrived that went in
#+end_quote

I think "that" should be in front of "just"
