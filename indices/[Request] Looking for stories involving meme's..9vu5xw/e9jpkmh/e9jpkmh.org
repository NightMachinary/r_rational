- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14495.The_Mind_Parasites][/The Mind Parasites/]] --- a Lovecraftian horror novel, most relevant recommendation from this list, I think. Not giving a description to avoid possible spoilers.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontypool_(film)][/Pontypool/]] --- a horror movie, certain words and concepts represented through English language become lethally viral.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][/the Resonance trilogy/]] --- a HP fanfic, Prophecies become reality warping and self-fulfilling memes when they are inappropriately handled and breach containment. The relevant plot arcs take place about halfway through the story (starting somewhere around ~1,200 out of ~2,000 pages written). The story itself has a somewhat slow-burn but realistic development (in character personalities, relationships, etc), with Harry eventually amassing enough power to start dimension-travelling.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext][/Thursday Next series/]] --- there's an antagonist in the later books that is capable of turning representations of herself in other persons' minds into self-aware (IIRC) sabotaging agents. The series itself has a kaleidoscope of other interesting and original ideas as well.

- Weeping Angels from Doctor Who --- see episodes [[http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Blink_(TV_story)][/Blink,/]] [[http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Time_of_Angels_(TV_story)][/The Time of Angels/,]] and [[http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Flesh_and_Stone_(TV_story)][/Flesh and Stone./]]

  - see also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][/That Which Holds The Image,/]] a DW Ã— HP cross-fic featuring them

- [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][/Transdimensional Brain Chip/]] --- a web original comic, by the end of the story two religious memeplexes infect a significant portion of the protagonist's transdimensional network of selves into two separate and actively warring botnets.

- and relevant SCPs of course: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/memetic][1,]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/7i4lli/best_memetic_scp/][2,]] etc.
