Just finished that, wow. Arc's ending was pretty awful (as in sad, not bad writing), but fitting. "Too clever for their own good" indeed. The story is tagged "irrationalfic", and that's a good name for it: Arc knew just enough about rationality to be dangerous to themself, as well as to others, and that ultimately cost them their life. It seems to be implied, though, that 3's reckless repeated wiping of Arc's memories may have contributed due to accumulated brain damage and poor impulse control.
