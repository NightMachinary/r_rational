I'm not sure I'm the best person to explain it but I think the basic idea is: once you make that sort of thing you're not you anymore, you're a new person. And who's to say that new person won't decide there's some other modification they'd like to do (maybe one the original you wouldn't even really object to) and now they're a third person. Said person decides on another modification and so on and on... it's a slippery slope thing... at some point the person deciding on the next modification is so far removed from the original that they're likely to make changes the original wouldn't want, maybe even that they'd find unacceptable. I think that's the basic reasoning for Juniper's rejection of the idea. Which isn't to say his feelings and his ego don't play any part in it, but I think it's uncharitable to say that's all there is.
