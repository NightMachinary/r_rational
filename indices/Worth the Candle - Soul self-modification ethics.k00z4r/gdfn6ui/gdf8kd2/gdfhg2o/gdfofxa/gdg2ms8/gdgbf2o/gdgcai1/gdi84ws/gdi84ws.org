#+begin_quote
  I think this is a pretty personal viewpoint.
#+end_quote

It's a viewpoint /some/ people have. But, note my original phrasing --- these are reasons that people /can/ be okay with these things. As in, /for the people who are/ okay with these things, these are the most likely justifications that such people would give (I mean, if you give them time to rationalize what are probably emotional visceral reations.)

#+begin_quote
  Should they not do that because it's erasing who they are as a person?

Well, yes, but actually no.

If you're suicidal, you have /a preference for self-modifying to no longer have preferences/ (or, equivalently, a preference for no longer being able to personally act to optimize for your other preferences.) In other words, you want there to not be a "you" in the world, in the sense of there being someone with exactly your preferences who has to put in the work to make the world match those preferences. A suicidal person who has shadow clones would /presumably/ want to murder their shadow clones "for their own good" before ultimately killing their original body. (And indeed, in reality, sometimes you'll hear of depressed parents killing their own children "for their own good" before killing themselves. See above about children carrying on parents' preferences.)

If you have a preference for "you" not going on, then that usually translates to no longer having any "selfish" preferences, e.g. preferences for the dispensation of your estate in ways that align with your interests. If you cared about these things, you'd want to stay alive in order to optimize the world toward them!

But being suicidal /doesn't/ usually translate to not having any /selfless/ preferences, i.e. preferences about things happening that are "good" in some global-human-utility sense.

And /usually/ these remaining preferences, despite being nominally "selfless", still hew closer to the side of "selfish" than "selfless." Even if you don't want "you" to exist in the world, you'll still tend to care about/worry about /people like you/ having good things happen to them in this world-without-"you", more than /people not like you/ having good things happen to them in said world. E.g. you tend to worry about how your family/friends will go on without you, rather than worrying about what difference you could have made through efficient altruism.

And when you apply that logic to the dispensation of /your own body/ after your [ego-]death --- well, what could be a better possible use for it than for someone /almost, but not quite, exactly like you/ to possess it and make use of it?

And that's basically what you're doing by taking the anti-depressants (or performing any other kind of discontinuous ego self-modification): you're "dying" and donating your body for the incarnation of a person who is almost, but not exactly, "you", to use as they please.

The same instinct that drives people to donate a kidney to save a sibling, means that they'll tend to be okay with passing their body over to the control of a "mental branch-offshoot" of their own mind.

(This presumably means that exactly the sort of sociopathic people who /wouldn't/ donate a kidney to save a sibling, also will tend to be /much less okay/ with the idea of self-modification even as a solution to suicidality. This is a testable hypothesis!)
