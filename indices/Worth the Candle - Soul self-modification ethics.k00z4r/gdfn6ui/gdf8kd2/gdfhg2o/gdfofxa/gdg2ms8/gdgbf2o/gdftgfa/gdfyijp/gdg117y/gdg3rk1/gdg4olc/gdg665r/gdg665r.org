  Changing a person is generally done to bring them more in line, and that's intrinsically bad; worse, a single change can then be followed by more changes, and it's entirely possible to eliminate all traces of what was.

But there is a fundamental difference between me imposing my will on someone else, and me imposing my will on myself. The first is oppression and enslavement, the second is self-actualisation. The reason why the first is regarded as evil is because it leads to deprive another person of one good we consider especially precious - the ability to steer your own life. Conversely, self-modification makes you /more/ effective at steering your own life. The difference is crucial, and the reasoning in one case can not be naively transferred to the other.

As for it being dangerous, in the specific forms of soul magic, sure, it is. But consider this: so is surgery. How many ways are there of cutting someone open, messing with their insides, and then closing them back up? How many of these will leave the person alive, and in fact better off than they were before?

Obviously surgery is a delicate, dangerous affair, whose use is generally avoided unless strictly necessary. Cosmetic surgery is something many people wouldn't even consider, given the relatively high risks compared to the pretty superficial gains (and yet, it IS a thing). But that doesn't mean we don't do surgery, or that surgery is evil. There is a fundamentally very different mindset towards "this thing is evil; it should NEVER be done", and "this thing is extremely dangerous; it can do good, but only if guided and practised by an expert, and for the gravest of reasons". In fact, in this hypothetical scenario, licensed soul magicians helping you with your mental troubles while cooperating with you and your desires, with appropriate safeguards and checks, would probably be the equivalent of our therapists or surgeons.

Here's a very spicy mental experiment: suppose there's a pedophile. They've never hurt any child, they realise it is wrong, but they still experience sexual desire towards children and suffer from it. A soul magician can change this aspect of their mind and remove their paraphilia, making them less dangerous and allowing them to live a healthy, normal life. Right or wrong?
