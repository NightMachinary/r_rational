At least when I die in bed there is a clone in the morning, at least when I die from teleportation there is clone at the receiving end, where is the clone from gunshot?

If I go to sleep and there is no clone in the morning (maybe I never wake up, mind erased, whatever you like) then yes, it's equivalent to a gunshot.
