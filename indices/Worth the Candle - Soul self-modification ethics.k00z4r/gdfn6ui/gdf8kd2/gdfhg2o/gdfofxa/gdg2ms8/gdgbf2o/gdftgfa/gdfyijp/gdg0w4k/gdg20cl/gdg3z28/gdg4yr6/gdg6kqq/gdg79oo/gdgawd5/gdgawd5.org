I don't know if it is in all countries, also it's kind of a moot point since if it's successful, well... y'know. And if it's not, certainly punishing attempted suicide strikes me as one of the most morally disgusting things you could do.

Regardless, I'm not obligated to agree with the morals of the law. On suicide, like on drugs, I believe if it makes it illegal, the law is simply wrong.
