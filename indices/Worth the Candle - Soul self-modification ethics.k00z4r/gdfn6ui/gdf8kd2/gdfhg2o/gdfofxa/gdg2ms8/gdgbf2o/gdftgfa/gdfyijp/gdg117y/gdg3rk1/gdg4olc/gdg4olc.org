I'm not saying it's evil in this case either, note :) But then I also don't think suicide, or even murder, is intrinsically evil in a full consequentialist sense.

But it is /absolutely/ a thing that you should hold at arm's length and regard with the utmost of suspicion.

I said it's not "intrinsically evil in a full consequentialist sense", but I /do/ think it's evil in an immediate sense; that is, you should only do it if you're getting massive gains out of it. It's a deal with the devil, and the devil is oh so very good at getting people to make bad deals.

  why would it be evil for me to do so?

I'm not the only person here to post the Murder-Gandhi thing :) but the basic answer is that I think people are value and diverse opinions and behaviors in people are valuable. Changing a person is generally done to bring them more in line, and that's intrinsically bad; worse, a single change can then be followed by more changes, and it's entirely possible to eliminate all traces of what was.

And even that isn't /necessarily/ wrong, but it's really sketchy and you want to be careful with it, and many many /many/ people wouldn't be that careful. Again; deal with the devil; don't just read the contract, don't just read what the contract implies, but read everything that those implications imply, and everything /those/ implications imply, and so forth on into infinity.

At least for me, that's an almost-instant "nope".
