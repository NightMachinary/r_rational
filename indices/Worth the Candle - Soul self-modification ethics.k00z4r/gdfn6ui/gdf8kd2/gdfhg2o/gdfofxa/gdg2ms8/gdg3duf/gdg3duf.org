Well, but OP says that obviously doing it to other people is bad. I agreed myself above that it's super dangerous, but dangerous is not the same as evil. It all depends on what safeguards you put in place, but not the act of self-change itself.

I guess as a comparison I could use this: is drinking alcohol evil? No. Is drinking alcohol, despite knowing specifically that you lose all control of your actions when drunk, while you're working at the control station of a nuclear power plant, evil? Well...
