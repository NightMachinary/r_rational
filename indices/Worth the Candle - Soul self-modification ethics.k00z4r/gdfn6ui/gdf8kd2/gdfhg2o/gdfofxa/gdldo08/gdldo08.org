Thank you for being succinct.. Sadly it leaves holes overly pedantic people will point at, which is one of the main reasons I avoid commenting on these kind of discussions.

Specially in a sub as nerdy as this, either you need to deal with people writing 1500 words to point out one small issue in your succinct comment or you yourself have to write a 1500 word monster to describe a simple thing that could be done in 3-5 lines with +95% accuracy.
