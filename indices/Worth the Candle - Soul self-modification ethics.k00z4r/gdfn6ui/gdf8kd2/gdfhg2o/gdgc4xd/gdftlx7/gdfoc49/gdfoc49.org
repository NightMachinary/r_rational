Premise: haven't read WTC, just exploring the concept.

I couldn't see a serious argument for why doing something like this would be in itself intrinsically /evil/ - as you said, "I'm going to see a therapist" or "I'm going to learn to play the piano" is effectively self-modification too, and no one sees an issue with it.

I can however see a lot of arguments for why it would be /dangerous as fuck/, if we're talking modifications that are sudden and that affect your judgment - potentially on their very own success. It could also be considered ethically problematic depending on the circumstances: if you undertake a modification that could make you evil, and have no backups, you will not be able to judge yourself as being evil and thus going back afterwards. So you just created an evil being and added it to the world. Good job!
