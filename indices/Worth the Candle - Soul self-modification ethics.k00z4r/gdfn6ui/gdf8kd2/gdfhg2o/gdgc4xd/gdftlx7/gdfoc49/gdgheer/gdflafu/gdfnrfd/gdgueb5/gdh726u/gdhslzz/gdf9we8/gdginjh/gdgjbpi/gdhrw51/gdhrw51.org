Your first change could be to set this as a high value: "only ever perform value modifications that Pre-Mod Me would not disapprove of".

Your second change could be "prevent the first change I made from getting removed".

Your third change could be "do not let these three changes get overriden by higher values".

Just some ideas. I bet there'd be loopholes in practice. But if you never reach a point where you'd want to exploit them, maybe it'd suffice.
