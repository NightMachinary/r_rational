Would anybody be interested in talking about practical ways you could mitigate the risk of slippery slopes? Given that values in the universe have numerical values my intuition is to make a shelling fence of allowing X values to be changed with some value Y or perhaps Y%? Or perhaps store the current values and say that any change can at max deviate with X points from the current baseline? Perhaps having scheduled check-ins by a trusted soul mage and store a meme that would pop out if a threshhold of change were reached?
