That would definitely be a cool and interesting method of concluding the story: every character except for Joon is actually just a puppet, none of their characterization, struggles, or literally anything else about them matters. Joon grieving for Fenn was utterly pointless because she never actually existed, similarly his romance with Amaryllis and friendship with Grak and Raven doesn't matter at all. This would indeed be the pinnacle of writing, totally and completely, to have 99% of the characters not matter at all. I applaud you for your insight.
