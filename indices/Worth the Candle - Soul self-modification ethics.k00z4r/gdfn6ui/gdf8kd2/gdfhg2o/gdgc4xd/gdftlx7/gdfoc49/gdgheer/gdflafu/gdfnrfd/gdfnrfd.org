I don't know if Joon would think this way, but it's similar to the argument against suicide---it's a decision you could change your mind on in the future, but making the decision stops you from being able to do so. With suicide obviously the thing stopping you from changing the decision is death, but with soul modification it's easy enough to continue modifying your soul to prevent it changing back, and changing your values on something will significantly influence your decision to continue doing so. Additionally, it's a drastic change. Obviously there's other forms of self-modification he would be okay with, but they're either not as drastic, not as permanent, or not as self-reinforcing.
