I think at least a portion of it is Joon's ego and that the /specific/ change Amaryllis was making was, effectively, to like him less. It's not noble, but knowing that someone---someone you yourself find incredibly attractive---pines for you is gratifying in a very base way.

If the change Amaryllis was making was instead to fall out of love with Grak, my model of Joon as a person is that while he would still have reservations, he would not have put up quite the same level of resistance. It would be an "Amaryllis and Grak" problem rather than an "Amaryllis and me" problem. That she modifies herself out of love with him feels on some level like a rejection.
