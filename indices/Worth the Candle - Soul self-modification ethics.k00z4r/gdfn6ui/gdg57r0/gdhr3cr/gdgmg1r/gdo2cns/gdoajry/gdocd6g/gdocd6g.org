I disagree. Do you think there is just an "arbitrary distinction" between a knife and a nuclear bomb? Both can kill millions of people, one of them "just" does it faster and easier. Would you say they are the same? Would you argue that we might as well decriminalize personal nukes because they are essentially just knives?
