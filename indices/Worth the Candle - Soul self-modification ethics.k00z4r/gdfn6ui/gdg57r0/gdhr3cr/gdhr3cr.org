I think this shift problem is self-averted, considering that in order to self-modify a value (provided it's done deliberately) you need to have a stronger set of values to push against the one.

The ice-cream example doesn't work well because you're not modifying the "enjoy a specific taste of ice-cream" value, but the particular parameter of that value. If you had to reduce "enjoy a particular taste of ice-cream" to "not enjoy ice-cream", chances are you wouldn't, unless another more prominent value superseded your enjoyment of ice-cream, like "eat healthy food" (subset: "favour consuming less calories").

I think that, given this, all you can really do by deliberate soul-editing is either shift parameters or optimise for higher weighted values.
