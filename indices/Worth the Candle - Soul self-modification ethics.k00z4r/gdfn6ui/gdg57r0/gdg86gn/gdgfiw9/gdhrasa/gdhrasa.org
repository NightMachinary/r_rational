Fascinating, thanks for taking the time to type that out! I'd love to hear more about the "low-hanging fruit of suddenly-easy self-modification that /was previously inaccessible/" part. But I understand if you don't want to over-share.

Does this mean you're able to act according to your values near-100% of the time now? Do you prefer veggies over sweets? Do you enjoy exercising? Are you able to get to bed at a set time every day and fall asleep rapidly? (Assuming you'd want those things.) Put differently, are you able to always act rationally (meaning congruently with your values)?

That does seriously sound overpowered. I could do anything with powers like that. Why aren't people like you taking over the world?
