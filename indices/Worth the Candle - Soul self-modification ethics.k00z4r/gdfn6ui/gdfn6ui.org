It's not about morality. It's about a slippery slope which is in fact kinda slippery.

Say you have some ordered list of values S. Now consider the set of ordered lists of values which would be acceptable to you (as a replacement for your current values.) Let's say that this set can be derived from your current set of values S and call it S'.

So for example, an ordered list of values which is identical to S except that the value of vanilla ice cream has been swapped with the value of strawberry ice cream is probably also acceptable to you and so would be a member of S', but an ordered list of values which is identical to S except that the value of your own life has been swapped with the value of strawberry ice cream is probably not acceptable to you, and is therefore not a member of S'. Notably, S' contains S and also very likely some ordered lists of values which are not S.

Now consider the set of ordered lists of values which are acceptable to some version of you that has altered your values to be some member of S'. We can call this S''. Once again, S'' includes all members of S', and also likely some ordered lists of values which are not in S'. You can think of S'' as the set of possible souls which are "reachable" from your original soul in two steps of alteration.

As you may have noticed, the set of reachable souls increases with each allowed step. Also, the set of souls reachable after n+1 steps likely includes some souls not reachable after n steps.

This is quite concerning, because if a soul is not reachable after n steps, that means that it's not acceptable to a version of you which has modified its soul n-1 times.

So if you modify your soul a bunch of times, even if the modifications are acceptable to you at each step, your soul might reach a state which would be unacceptable to the version of you with your initial soul.

Now, notice that it is not /necessarily the case/ that after modifying your soul a bunch of times you reach a state that would be unacceptable to the original you. It could be, for example, that you swap the values of strawberry ice cream and vanilla ice cream back and forth 20 times.

However, if you model each successive decision as having some element of randomness, such that at each step each acceptable soul state has a non-zero chance of being selected, then as you modify your soul more and more times, the probability of you reaching a state which would be unacceptable to your original self approaches 1.

Thus it's /very risky/ to not set some kind of Schelling fence on modification to one's soul, and more conservative fences are stronger. If you just modify your soul whenever doing so seems convenient, you're very likely to end up someone that the original you would not have wanted to become. If you modify your soul only when it seems absolutely necessary, you're less likely to end up as an unacceptable person. Whenever you modify your soul for some reason which is less significant than your reasons for modifying your soul thus far, you effectively lower your threshold for soul-modification, and increase your chances of becoming an unacceptable person.

Now, how is this different from modifying yourself in other ways, like therapy, or growing as a person, or making friends?

The difference is that soul modification has no cap on how fast or drastic it can be. Changing as a person tends to be a gradual process, and so there's some element of slipperiness (a risk of becoming a person that you-from-the-past would not have wanted to become) but not nearly as much. You do actually want to be kinda careful about drastically changing yourself through means other than soul magic. If my friend suddenly went from being a total introvert to an extreme extrovert or vice versa, I'd be concerned. If that change was due to self-modification of their soul, I would simply be /much more/ concerned.

TL;DR: If you modify your soul willy nilly you might end up as Murder Ghandi, which would be bad, and modifying your soul for at all (particularly in ways that aren't /absolutely necessary/) can make you more likely to modify your soul in the future and end up as Murder Ghandi.
