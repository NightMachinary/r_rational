I didn't read the story, but the qualitative difference is this:

Going to therapy changes us by changing the inputs of our mind, and those different inputs will (might) change our personality/behavior.

With magic, the character changes their mind-software /directly/, without going through the input/output interface of their mind, and it therefore introduces a sort of discontinuity/rule-breaking on the meta level, which is not present when you go to therapy.
