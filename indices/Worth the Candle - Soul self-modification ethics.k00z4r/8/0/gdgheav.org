That sort of principle is just as constraining as the states it tries to prevent, though. "I'm in state A, and I can irrevocably move to state B, but I'm not willing to make irrevocable state-changes in myself like that" leaves you /every bit as stuck in state A/ as making the change would leave you in state B, except minus the part where you get to pick /which/ of the two you'd rather be stuck in. It's strictly worse, from a preference-satisfaction standpoint, compared with either "I like it better in state A, so I'm not going to change to state B" or "I'd rather be in state B forever than in state A forever, so I'm going to make the change".

There's plenty of reason to be /cautious/ about any such change, of course---to monitor your preferences over an extended time to make sure it's not just an in-the-moment impulse, to figure out if there are any unanticipated downsides on the other side that'll make it less good than it superficially appears, et cetera---but, after all such caution has been applied, it's often going to be the case that the best thing to do is still to go for it.
