The whole point of the original post was to ask whether it makes sense to consider soul magic evil on principle. I have no problem to agree that something like it would obviously be extremely potentially dangerous and to be used with the utmost care, but that is a world apart for me from something being evil. I can't fathom a world in which rape or genocide are okay as long as they're used with the utmost care. This puts soul magic more in the bin with e.g. pharmacology or genetic engineering or nuclear energy - things that can /absolutely/ hurt or kill people if misused, but also be a great power for good if tamed and used properly. There's still a lot of evaluations to make on a case-by-case basis about what constitutes appropriate use, of course, but it would also be immoral to /not/ consider them when instead they would be essential to protect lives. Evil things can be at best the lesser evil if the alternatives are shitty enough, but never a good in themselves.
