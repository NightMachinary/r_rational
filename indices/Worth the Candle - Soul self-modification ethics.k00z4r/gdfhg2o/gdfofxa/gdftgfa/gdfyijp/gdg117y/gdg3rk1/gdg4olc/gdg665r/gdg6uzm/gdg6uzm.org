  But there is a fundamental difference between me imposing my will on someone else, and me imposing my will on myself. The first is oppression and enslavement, the second is self-actualisation.

On the other hand, suicide is illegal. There's cases where we actively don't want people imposing their will on themselves because (arguably) their will is currently flawed and will result in irrevocable harm.

  But that doesn't mean we don't do surgery, or that surgery is evil. There is a fundamentally very different mindset towards "this thing is evil; it should NEVER be done", and "this thing is extremely dangerous; it can do good, but only if guided and practised by an expert, and for the gravest of reasons". In fact, in this hypothetical scenario, licensed soul magicians helping you with your mental troubles while cooperating with you and your desires, with appropriate safeguards and checks, would probably be the equivalent of our therapists or surgeons.

I absolutely agree, and note that I'm not saying soul magic modifications are /always/ wrong. Just that they're dangerous as hell.

I can imagine a world where people are doing full new-medicide-doubleblind analysis on specific soul magic manipulation practices, to see if they're good treatments without serious side effects. This is a /very/ different world from "let's go eat some mushrooms I found and see what they do", which is the unlicensed-soul-magician-fucking-with-their-own-brain scenario, except in the case where the unlicensed soul magician is also carrying around a WMD and has already shown the bad judgement to use it.

(In fairness, in Aerb, it's also really easy to hide what you're doing; I don't blame them for deciding to just ban the entire concept. But I can imagine a more restricted version of soul magic that's really useful therapeutically.)
