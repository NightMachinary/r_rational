I think there's an argument that it's kind of an assisted combination murder/suicide/birth, yes. I wouldn't insist it's morally wrong, but "well, it's arguably suicide but maybe not morally wrong" applies to other forms of more-universally-agreed-upon suicide as well.

If someone gets kidnapped and force-fed permanently addictive drugs that change their entire personality and behavior, then set free, what is this? I think there's an argument that this could be considered murder, in a world where the self is considered more important than the vessel.

(Which, largely, isn't the world we reside in, but is I think defensible.)
