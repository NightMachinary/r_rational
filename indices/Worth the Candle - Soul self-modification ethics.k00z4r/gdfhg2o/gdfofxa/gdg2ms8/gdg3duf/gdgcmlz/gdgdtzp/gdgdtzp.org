It doesn't really matter much, the time horizon is what matters. What you say holds on the time horizon of a lifetime; the "drunk in the control room" scenario lasts a lot less, but also gives you a much shorter horizon to cause irreparable damage. Point is, it's not that the action itself is evil, but rather, whether it is performed in a context in which it makes it probable for you to cause damage against the better judgment of your current self.
