I think that's true for that one change. however /everyone/ seems super freaked out by soul modification, even self soul modification.

There is a cultural/historical source for this, but it needs to have some real basis as well that made me he culture fear it in the first place.

I think there is fear of addiction and snowball effects. Yes, people change naturally all the time, but the ability to make root level permanent changes to every aspect of personality and values with the flick of a switch is dangerous. It is the same thing that makes self-mosifying supe-AI scary.

When you make one change, you can't be certain that the new you won't want further changes that the current self doesn't. The runaway effect could essentially (heh) destroy you as a person, and create a monster that only cares about "improving" itself...and others.

This is apparently what happened with many soul mages, and why it became illegal. The tempation of continued changes snowballs into destroying the self and becoming an optimization machine.
