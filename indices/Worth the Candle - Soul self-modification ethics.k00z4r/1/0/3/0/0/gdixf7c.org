You can just artificially up your 'hesitance to soul modification' value each time immediately before. If you notice you are having to inflate in more frequently over time, then you have discovered empirical evidence you are in a modification cascade and slam on the brakes until your hesitance value can be naturally leveled out without requiring manual changes. Once its stable again, you are clearly no longer addicted to change.
