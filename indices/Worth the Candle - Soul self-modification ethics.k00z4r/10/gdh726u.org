Perhaps there are concerns akin to those at play in the Legend of Murder Gandhi. As best I recall it: Gandhi, offered a million dollars to take a pill that would make him a vicious murderer, declined. But he was willing to accept the money to become 1 percent more murderous, this not being particularly murderous. But a 1 percent more murderous Gandhi, being slightly more inclined towards murder, was now willing to enter into a deal where he took another pill, becoming 1 percent more murderous---and so it goes, until Gandhi had become very murderous indeed, far more than original Gandhi would have agreed to for any amount of money.
