Of course it's not a certainty. Not every soul mage becomes Falletehr. But it is a very real risk that by the time they end up in equilibrium, they're much farther from the initial state than they would have wanted. Which could be very bad, depending on the direction of the changes. It's not that a bad outcome is certain, it just has a non-negligible probability of happening.
