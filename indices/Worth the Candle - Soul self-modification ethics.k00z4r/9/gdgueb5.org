I think there's an element of being unsure of how safe the procedures are. Juniper's skill in soul magic is piped into his brain by a not terribly benevolent deity, and at various points it's obvious that he sometimes lacks some crucial knowledge/skill in a magic, magic that he has significant skill in, that regular mages know really well. He would be using this magic to make fundamental changes to who he is as a person, with no good method for undoing those changes should he make a mistake. Soul magic has a relatively convenient interface for making those changes, it seems like it should be a bit harder to make significant mistakes, but it's really not something to approach lightly. And these fears are definitely not unfounded. Raven and presumably other people can give histories of soul mages making exactly these kinds of mistakes.

He could make bodily changes with relatively less risk of a slippery slope, but he doesn't seem to have any special knowledge of biology. Given how fine grained the bodily modifications seem to be, I don't see any reason he couldn't accidentally make changes that don't biologically function.

All of the above goes doubly for spirit. He's the /only/ practitioner for spirit, so no one else would even know what to do if he made a mistake, the interface is much worse, and spirit is a /lot/ better at changing a person than soul magic is. It's a lot more equivalent to doing surgery on your own brain.
