I /tried/ the act-according-to-my-values-basically-all-the-time thing, but it didn't really work. It /is/ possible for me to use hypnosis to hack willpower, but the hacking looks like /increasing the amount of willpower I can throw at a problem/, not like /reducing willpower costs/. Still potentially useful in the short-term, but not long-term sustainable. When I try to do self-hypnosis to get myself to do a thing I lack the willpower to keep myself doing normally, I can potentially get it to work for a while, but if I /keep/ pushing it I end up developing an aversion to /hypnotizing myself with the expectation that I'll make myself do the thing some more/ in the same way that I'm averse to the thing itself.

(Which doesn't mean that I /can't/ use it to contribute useful willpower-mustering effects when needed---during those first couple months, two examples I noted down were using it in order to help myself focus on writing papers for my finals in school (notably, that was the most intensely stressful paper-writing week of my entire time at school), and then later to get myself to start the occasional conversation which I had a strong social-anxiety-induced aversions to starting---but it means that I need to be relatively restrained with it, rather than having anything close to the superpower that you're envisioning.)

In terms of low-hanging fruit... I don't have direct memories of everything, but I did some digging through my diary from the time, and I can at least give a broad sampling.

So, first, there were various short-term maneuvers, like the previously-mentioned "focus less on the unpleasantness of the cold floor" thing and "go back to sleep after the fire alarm" thing, fuzzing my perceptions of text I was reading in order to avoid absorbing any of the spoilers I knew were littered around, calming myself during a particularly-stressful afternoon, getting up sooner after waking up in mornings, et cetera. Nice to be able to do where needed, even in the absence of direct long-term effects.

In terms of long-term effects, there was the previously-mentioned thing with removing my aversions to the smell of vinegar and the taste of ginger. The central idea there was to generate a short-term hypnotic effect (a long-term one wouldn't have stuck in place, and would have been too high-effort to refresh constantly) to render them non-unpleasant, then use that short-term non-unpleasantness to reset my priors on how unpleasant they'd be next time, thereby bootstrapping the short-term effect into a new default.

(How easy that maneuver is for me to pull off, I should note, is dependent on exactly where the unpleasantness of a given thing comes from; in this case, it was by longstanding negative associations dating back to my childhood, rather than by any more concrete in-the-moment effect, so it was relatively easy. But trying to do the same thing with apples, which cause an unpleasant physical sensation when I bite into their skin, was harder, because I'd need to remove the unpleasantness of /that entire class of sensations/ rather than just of the narrow experience of biting-into-an-apple; I got partial results from that one, but it wasn't nearly as unambiguously effective.)

By a similar token, I got rid of my tendency towards fainting when medical people stuck needles into me, which was previously somewhat inconvenient. I did that one by giving myself a trigger to shift my brain in a non-fainting-shaped direction and then activating it while being poked. It took a couple applications before I was really confident in that one and able to activate it by habit without needing to think hard about it, but ultimately it worked.

Also, I managed to somewhat reduce my body-related dysphoria by giving myself a habit of avoiding paying attention to the most unpleasant-to-pay-attention-to bits of my body. I didn't come anywhere close to actually /getting rid/ of it, but the reduction was still nice.

Overall... self-hypnosis works as a willpower substitute for me, but only limitedly, and using it that way is much less sustainably effective than using it in certain other ways. Said other ways include redirecting my attention in non-willpower-demanding ways (as with the dysphoria and the spoiler-dodging), and putting myself into short-term altered mental states which /do/ cost willpower but which don't need to be held for long enough or repeated often enough for that cost to be a problem (either because they serve their purpose quickly (as with putting myself to sleep) or because they can be bootstrapped into habits which don't require further maintenance (as with the smell of vinegar)).
