Nothing much in the way of resources. As far as approach... I'm not sure the way I approached it will work for everyone? It was pretty thoroughly improvised, not dependent on any external advice-sources, and it was very plausibly dependent on quirks of how my mind is structured. But I can try to summarize it anyway, just in case it /does/ work for other people.

Step 1: get hypnotized by not-yourself, ideally several times, and get a sense of what the experience of it is like. (I personally did this by way of the various not-too-hard-to-find hypnosis audio files one can dig up online; alternatives exist, if you're not inclined in that direction or if you find it ineffective. Being hypnotized is very much a skill one picks up with practice, so the first time is likely to be the hardest.)

Step 2: while /not/ being hypnotized by someone else, run through the same sorts of mental actions you run through during the induction when being hypnotized by someone else, and try to enter the same sort of mental state. The trance will probably not be as deep; but hopefully you'll be able to enter it at all.

Step 3: use whatever corners of your mind /aren't/ tranced (which, due to the aforementioned not-as-deep thing, will probably be present) to generate suggestions for the hopefully-larger parts which are. Suggest whatever seems both useful and easy-to-do-with-hypnosis.

(The first time I did self-hypnosis, I was testing it out as an idle distraction while waiting for a friend to show up for a Nerf axe fight; I used it to help prevent myself from forgetting my planned tactics mid-fight (which had happened to me during several previous such fights). That sort of attention-redirection is, at least for me, among the easiest effects to produce. Other things I did, over the next couple weeks, included ignoring discomfort from a too-cold floor, and shifting myself from adrenaline mode back to sleep mode after a false fire alarm woke me up several hours early.)

Step 4: practice and experiment. Practice getting the trance deeper; try out different ways of generating suggestions for yourself to see what's most effective; try new sorts of mental actions, and see which ones do or don't work; try setting some triggers for yourself to access useful effects more quickly when not mid-trance, and then try to learn the mental actions which result from those triggers so well that you no longer /need/ the triggers, you can just do the actions directly; try other things I'm failing to think of while writing this; in general, see what you can or can't do, and try to stretch the limits of that as far as you can.

...and that's it. When I followed this trajectory, in the first couple weeks, the effects I could get mostly were interpretable as placebo effects, albeit ones that it was very convenient to be able to generate on demand; after a couple weeks of practice, I became able to do much more unambiguously not-placebo actually-hypnosis effects. The first couple months were filled with huge numbers of low-hanging fruit of suddenly-easy self-modification that was previously inaccessible, as well as some scary moments of realizing that things I'd rather /not/ do self-modification-wise were /also/ suddenly easily accessible if I were to get clumsy. Eventually I cleared most of the low-hanging fruit, and from there self-hypnosis became a much less central part of my self-modificatory arsenal, moving from being The New Big Dramatically Overpowered Thing to being just one more useful tool among many.

Your experiences may or may not match mine, in terms of all of this; but hopefully this summary is useful regardless.
