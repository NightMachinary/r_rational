Well, in some respects yes, they are on the same slope.

If knives had no other purpose than murder then I might very well ban them along the same line as nukes

Similarly if everyone used nukes in their daily lives for some pragmatic purpose then they may remain unbanned

Of course, this ignores that you could use utilitarian calculations on the above which admittedly may also be arbitrary.

I suspect that any utilitarian calculation of soul modification is going to be strongly in favour however

There are of course other distinctions between the two but capacity for murder is certainly a line that they are both on.

At the end of the day even though the morality of myself in 40 years or 1000 years or from 5 years old to 20 years probably (based on past experience and other people) will have left the S' group I make no effort to sabotage my future self or even to try to continually indoctrinate myself to make sure I stay where I am now
