To answer your question: no, that person isn't 100% me, but 95% perhaps? Not actually that far off in my optics.

But it's a bit of a weird thought experiment because different values aren't independent. It doesn't make sense to change a single value, it'd revert because of other values supporting it, just as happens in story.

Furthermore, in-story you get to choose which values to change. You'd only change values that you actually prefer to be different.

So take your most precious belief, and then point to a secondary belief that limits you from pursuing the first. Remove the secondary belief. Is this person still you? I think so. All you've done is make your values less contradictory.
