Sure, but I doubt someone considered enough to set up such fallbacks would ever be that criminally stupid in the short to medium or even a lifetimes length.

In fact, when you start feeling frustrated about setting up safeguards. *That* is your signal to go to the next level and think about if you need to tweak your satisfaction levels. Although honestly, you don't need soul magic for that. You just need to sit down with a nice sandwich and remember that only a raving lunatic doesn't use safeguards for self-surgery (and that all further modification is completely off limits until the obvious truth of that fact is once again clear).
