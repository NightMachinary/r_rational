it's not good, simply because the more you soul edit the lower your treshold for what's acceptable become, if you can just remove any inconvenience by changing what you think about it you lose your morals.

you don't like to think about how much pain and suffering doing something will cause, so you just change so you don't think about that any more, that's one of the paths the slope lead too, while it begin in a benign way that's not where it ends.
