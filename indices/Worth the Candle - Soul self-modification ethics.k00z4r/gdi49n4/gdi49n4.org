The problem with editing one's own mind is that there's no outside perspective to keep that in check. A qualia that edits its own perception cannot perceive that change. It doesn't help that Joon just plain doesn't understand souls to any real extent. He's just playing around with the memory editor GUI he was given. These things compound to make it so a scenario where the characters trap themselves in a destructive loop of soul-surgery becomes very realistic.
