It definitely does. If you were in a world where you sometimes had to kill people, and each time you killed people you felt a little less bad about it, you would be pretty worried about this, yes? And the fear of becoming a person who kills people willy-nilly would be a very good reason to do your best to avoid killing people, suppressing your guilt over having killed people, suppressing empathy, etc.

The difference is that there's only so fast you can become a murderhobo through natural means. There's no real cap on how fast you can become a murderhobo through soul modification.
