I think people consider there to be a big difference between "working to change yourself over time" and "explicitly replacing yourself with a different self with a sharp discontinuity".

Like, if you have a girlfriend, and you want her to be better at chess, you could teach your girlfriend chess, or you could break up with your girlfriend and go out with someone who's better at chess. But in one of those cases there's a discontinuity and replacement, while in the other case there isn't.

I'm not sure this /matters/, note. I'm not taking the position that self-modification is inherently wrong. But I am taking the position that it's recognizably different, and that I can understand if people want to then treat it differently.
