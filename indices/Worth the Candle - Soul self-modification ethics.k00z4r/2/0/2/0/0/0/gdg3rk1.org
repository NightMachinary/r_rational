Ok, but consider something like the Unbreakable Vow at the end of HPMOR. Would placing similar compulsions and restrictions /on yourself/ voluntarily, for the purpose of fostering what you consider positive habits, be something you'd consider evil?

Suppose I was an addict and suffered from it, if I could erase the tendency to addiction from my mind/soul in a snap, why would it be evil for me to do so?
