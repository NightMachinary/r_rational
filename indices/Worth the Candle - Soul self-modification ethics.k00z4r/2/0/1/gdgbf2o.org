Your soul in WtC isn't your "ideas, thoughts, and knowledge." It's your preferences. Your preferences are all /you/ are.

Think about it this way: if a clone of you, who has all your /ideas, thoughts, and knowledge/, but different /preferences/ --- your evil twin! --- kills you, that's a tragedy for you. You don't want that, and will resist it. They're "replacing" you, but it's not /just/ that --- they're going to go off and shape the world in ways you disagree with.

Meanwhile, if you die, but in your place lives someone who shares /none/ of your ideas+thoughts+knowledge but /all/ of your preferences... well, that's just amnesia. People are usually pretty comfortable with that.

It's also the reason people can be okay with teleportation, or with being temporarily simulated, etc. --- if /their/ conscious experience ends, but the conscious experience of someone /with their same preferences/ goes on, then they can "rest assured" that the world will continue to be optimized in the way they wanted to optimize it. (Or, to go deeper on this, continuous conscious experience is really just a kind of animation/slideshow of a succession of different "yous" who happen to share preferences. You're /always/ being replaced by the next "you" a moment later, but that's okay, because /they're/ going to want what /you/ wanted.)

This is also why people feel that having children obviates mortality, somewhat --- to the degree that you can make a child "carry on your legacy" (i.e. share your preferences, and carry them out in the world as an optimizer in your place), "you" aren't gone.

When you dig into these philosophical edge-cases, most people find that what "you" are, all along, is just the set of things you do and don't want the world to become. The set of possible worlds that drive you to make them real; and the set of possible worlds that drive you to prevent them.

And, in either case, changing the boundaries of those sets, makes for a person that the current you would probably fight to the death to stop.

(If you can get behind the above, then here's a philosophical rabbit-hole of a statement to evaluate: "puberty is a violation of your human rights, since you're being replaced by someone with different preferences. Nobody should have to go through that without the consent of the prior person to be so replaced --- where that consent would imply that they already had preferences that were compatible with the ones they'll get hardwired into them by the change.")
