  People are usually pretty comfortable with that.

I wouldn't be. And this all is born out of the (fictional) conceit that you somehow can draw a sharp line between ideas and acquired knowledge and preferences. As if there wasn't a perpetual feedback loop between the two. My preferences are shaped by my experience. Had I grown into a war-torn country, or as a peasant in 1300, or as a king in Ancient Greece, I would be a different person.

  It's also the reason people can be okay with teleportation, or with being temporarily simulated, etc. --- if their conscious experience ends, but the conscious experience of someone with their same preferences goes on, then they can "rest assured" that the world will continue to be optimized in the way they wanted to optimize it.

I think this is a pretty personal viewpoint. The issue of the continuity of the self isn't this clear cut and in fact the paradox of teleportation lies in that - it's not clear that teleportation does not REALLY kill you and replace you with a copy. Mostly because teleportation doesn't exist and for all we know it might be impossible (and perhaps this impossibility makes the question itself nonsense).

Again, consider this: someone is depressed. They are suicidal. They have a preference for death over life. Then they take antidepressants. Now they are not suicidal any more. Should they not do that because it's erasing who they are as a person? I can be okay with erasing 1% if it allows the remaining 99% to achieve its goals better, no?
