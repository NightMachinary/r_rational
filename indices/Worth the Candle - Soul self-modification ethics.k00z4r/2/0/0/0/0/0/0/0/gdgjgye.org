No, obviously it is. My point was that "soul magic + a lifetime" can be compared to "a lot of alcohol + 15 minutes messing around with the controls of a nuclear power plant". The alcohol is reversible in theory, but by the time it would be, you will probably be dead, and so will be a few square kilometres around your current position.

Or to avoid arguing about the safeties built in into nuclear power plants, make that the controls to fire a nuclear ICBM from a silo, which is even worse.
