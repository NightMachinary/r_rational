The problem is the speed and mechanism of the change, and that soul mages can do this to /other people./. You start "optimizing" yourself, and soon become a person that only cares about optimization, and then start secretly optimizing others to fix the world and align it to your values. It's an addictive mental virus, in effect. There's evidence this happened with other souls mages which is why it was made illegal.
