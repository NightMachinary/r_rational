The anti-depression potions seem like something to sell via the customers of their other stock. Clinically depressed people might not be able to afford it themselves but, like JP, rich clients of the alchemists may have someone that they care about who would benefit.

I'm surprised they'd ask for payment in cash rather than in a reciprocal exchange of delver magic, though. They're wealthy and their wealth was built on a handful of inherited magics; getting more would be better than a few thousand bucks they could get just as easily from a mundane client.
