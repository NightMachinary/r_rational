'Wraps' in the sense that if you go far enough north, you end up south. Assuming that radio waves didn't bend at all and there was no atmosphere to muck things up, a powerful transmitter wouldn't just cover the entirety of Aerb, that signal would keep going and cause interference. Someone standing at the notional 'edge' of Aerb would be getting signals of equal strength from both 'north' and 'south'.
