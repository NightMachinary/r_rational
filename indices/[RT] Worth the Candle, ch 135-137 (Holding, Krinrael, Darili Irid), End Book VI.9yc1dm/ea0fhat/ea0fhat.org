Yep, definitely tearing up a bit. It really took my a while to actually like Grak much, but the backstory chapter opened up a new vista, and this chapter just killed me.

  */Companion Passive Unlocked: Wardproof (Grak)!/*

  */Wardproof:/* /Grak can selectively ignore wards that would apply to him, the things he wears and carries, and up to one other person (at a time). This ability activates automatically when the effect of the ward would be undesirable and can be selectively applied to any ward Grak chooses./

Hella thematic. It is a superpower that will protect him from even his own Annihilation Wards for as long as he doesn't want to die.
