By the way, over in [[https://discordapp.com/invite/8MdWg2r][the alexanderwales Discord server]] we're currently starting work on [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki][a Worth the Candle wiki!]] We've got a dedicated channel for discussing what we're doing over there - summaries for the story's first update ([[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Taking_the_Fall][chapters 1-5]]) have already been completed, but we need all the help we can get. If you can't contribute to the story through Patreon, this is another way you can help out!
