  though I've got to say Grak's quest felt like it was almost... too easy?

You seem to think that Grak's quest started and finished in this chapter. But in reality that's only when the quest ended. Technically, Juniper has been working on this quest from the very moment he met Grak.

It was a very difficult thing for Juniper to emotionally connect to Grak (since da nada reminds him of his worst moments). Plus there was the whole bit with learning Grak's language.

While this quest hasn't involved any fighting, I would definitely say that it's a quest reward that was well-earned. If it's a reward well-received is another question.
