  I've got to say Grak's quest felt like it was almost... too easy? I mean in the real world sense, sometimes all it takes is a friend being there for you, and Joon finally recognizing Grak's personage and acknowledging it might have been the narrative hurdle he needed to overcome.

I think this was an attempt to show character growth on behalf of Juniper - him relating his suicide attempts to the suicidal Grak and then bonding over it. It is, as far as I know, the most detail he's gone into it in the story. I'm not even sure if he broached the issue with Fenn or not.

  I'm really disappointed that Fenn is increasingly likely not to come back. She was easily my favorite member of the main trio, and I think her character added a lot of much-needed lightness to the ponderous and kind of soggy Amaryllis/Joon non-relationship. While her loss might be narratively useful, it's very unsatisfying to see her cut out so completely and Bethel's turn as comic relief isn't really filling the void.

I agree that the absence of Fenn has really changed the tone of the narrative, and I also think that it's a detriment. I was never really enraptured with any of the romantic threads of this story as they felt, often at times, a bit under cooked, but I did appreciate the lightheartedness that Fenn brought to the story and she's really missed on that account.

As you stated:

  lately it's been in more of a planning and conversation mode which isn't as viscerally thrilling.

I have the same identical thought. In the last batch of chapters I complained about the lack of "rising action/tension" in the story - for instance, we were told and not /shown/ all of these horrible things that are on the move to end the world and I felt like that really cut the legs out from underneath what should be a feeling of impending crisis.

I hope to see some forward progression in this direction soon.
