So much heartgripping emotions in the past few updates and it was immensely gratifying to see Grak and Amaryllis' personal dramas surface in a fashion that Joon can no longer brush aside 'cause low SOC. I felt like his new insight into SOC's true value is giving a shape to the endgame approach (namely, overpowered Loyalty bonuses and companions) and what I think is the overall game's intended theme - forming positive, deeper relationships in spite of trauma/grief and learning to rely on others in hard times*. SOC's rise would also be a wonderfully ironic dig at dump stat memes and typical D&D games. The DPS-build synergy munchkining is always fun, but character-building and little poignant details is what really does it for me. I'm unashamedly hoping those 2-3.5 books left suffer heinously from the ninety-nine rule.

* I read [[https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9mh3ig/psychiatrists_are_using_vr_to_submerge_patients/][this article a while ago that fit so snugly into my belief in the game-as-therapy]]. This game wouldn't meet a million ethical principles, but who knows what psychotherapy will look like post-singularity.

That aside, the one thing that's stuck with me lately is Amaryllis and silly reflections on determinism in romance. I admit to being borderline paranoid of her since the start because of her manipulative streak, but the latest (heartbreaking) revelations on her love for Joon weirdly left me simultaneously melancholic and hopeful about her existence. When Vervain was alleged to be a DMPC, I thought there was a small non-zero (creepy) chance that she was one as a DM mindfuck, but now I consider her a DMNPC (an NPC that the DM crosses some lines in creation/manipulation so that it feels like she was "created" with a tacked-on explicit purpose). AFAIK, Amaryllis isn't aware that Joon perceives her as the epitome of beauty (i.e. definitive proof of DMNPC-hood), but she's still in this limbo where she was likely "built" to pair with Joon yet at the last moment the DM stepped back and said "compatibilism, bitches! you get free will!" I try to imagine what purpose/romance-by-design is like and one part of me recoils and rebels at the farcical "choosing" with such a fundamental value rigging and another part sneers with "well, where are your complaints about oxytocin and biology? if it makes you happy, do it." Honestly, I've never been sold on the Amaryllis-Joon ship (part of it is rebelling against the obvious bait), but I am rooting for Mary's happiness, which she deserves, if only for Cypress' sake. What strangely gives me the greatest hope is the throwaway line on dwarven romances:

Some random thoughts:

What happens if Grak tries to walk through the bottle? I was thinking he could simply lead the Doe through, but I'm guessing they'd probably hit glass.

Due for a respec soon-ish if the 100/28 math is retroactive, all that gold would easily put Gold Magic as one of Joon's strongest abilities given that he has both Essentialism/Spirit to strangle the call of gold. If only Grak isn't against it, which could be vaguely possible given his redirection from material penance into saving the world.

That was such a sneaky and silly reference to Threadbare. Belly button lint and anise *eyeroll*. Not that cafeteria-food-subsisting teenagers would know, but anise is amazing in some meat dishes.
