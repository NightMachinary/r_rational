Unfortunately, the .mobi converter that AO3 uses can't handle files past a certain size (for unknown-to-me reasons), and this isn't going to be fixed in the near future. Easiest method right now to get a .mobi that Kindle can handle is to [[https://calibre-ebook.com/download][download Calibre]], load in the .epub, then convert it to .mobi.

(I haven't confirmed that this works, but it should work in principle; it's been a few years since I've used Calibre.)
