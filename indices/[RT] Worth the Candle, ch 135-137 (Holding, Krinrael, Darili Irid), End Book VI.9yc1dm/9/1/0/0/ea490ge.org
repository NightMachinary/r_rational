The Anglish custom for referring to dwarves as 'he' could also just come from the speech patterns of amateur Anglish-speakers, without even taking the male coding into consideration.

In Mandarin Chinese, spoken pronouns are non-gendered, so "ta" can translate to 'him', 'he', 'she', 'her', or 'it', depending on context. ("ta de" for the possessive) A consequence of this is that Mandarin speakers learning English will often use the male pronoun even when inappropriate. eg:

#+begin_quote
  "You forgot your phone. I left him on the kitchen table for you."
#+end_quote

So a dwarf comes into town, you make friends with them, and they start telling you about their family. They refer to all of their relatives using male pronouns because 'h' is easier to say with a dwarven mouth than 'sh', and honestly the whole gendered-pronoun thing is still confusing them. So even if you are a species which doesn't associate beards with maleness, you walk away from the conversation with the impression that all dwarves are male.

Sure, highly fluent dwarves might realize that "they" is a better translation or prefer the nuance of loan-word pronouns from Groglir, but the majority of dwarves won't even notice the difference unless they think about it.

In fact, I'd expect the stereotype to be that dwarves don't understand what women are. When a chinese person refers to your mother as "him", it's confusing for a moment, but then you realize its just a translation mistake. When a dwarf does the same, it's plausible that the dwarf really doesn't know your mother's gender.
