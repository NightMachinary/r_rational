Yeah, that threw me for a loop too.

We had a lot of detail on Grak not actually being male and Joon just being an everyman who just rounded them off to male, but when they get an interlude chapter, they just go on using the male pronoun.

Grak does refer to all the dwarves we encounter as male (iirc, I don't feel like going back and checking) so it might be them just not really caring and using the pronouns they're used to in most of society, though that seems weird for the flashback at least.

I'd personally be interested in WoG on what we're actually supposed to draw from this.
