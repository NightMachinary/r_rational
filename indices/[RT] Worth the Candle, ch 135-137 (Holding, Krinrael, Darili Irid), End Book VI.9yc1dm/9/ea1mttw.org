Surprised nobody's talking about both Joon and the interface gendering Grak as male. Even Grak's own story does it! Which maybe indicates it's being told by future-Joon. Seems really weird (for the interface) and disrespectful/inconsiderate (from Joon).

Joon messed things up with Fenn in part by not respecting her or trying to understand her on her own terms. /Terms/ are literally part of the problem: she gets mad at him trying to respect her by accepting “washater” as a word for the interface because she already suggested it 30 chapters ago and he just totally forgot. So it kind of seems like a lesson unlearned.

OTOH, Grak and Joon's relationship is very different, and this is a good example of how you can really connect with someone and help them out even while misunderstanding a basic fact about them.
