Thanks for the clarification! I think if the emotional impact of the passage wasn't so important, it would have been pretty cool stylistically to have it shoved in our faces that Dwarves are Different. (In kind of the same way that it's cool to read about experiences very different from your own.)

Enjoying the story as always, btw! Don't take this comment as a negative response to the chapters overall.

I'm also curious if you've read Ada Palmer's Terra Ignota series, a really deep/engaging sci fi series that plays with sex and gender descriptions a bunch.
