I tried the version with Groglir pronouns and I agree. Replacing only pronouns sounds weird in a way that the typical proper noun swap doesn't. But gender is a big thing for dwarves...

Alternative explanations: it could be the sound of the pronouns that don't mesh well with English prose, or the variety applied to each English equivalent and mental gymnastics needed to match frequent occurrences of pronouns (maybe just one pronoun is better?), or just the frequency of replacements itself.
