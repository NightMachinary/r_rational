  A consequence of this is that Mandarin speakers learning English will often use the male pronoun even when inappropriate. eg:

  "You forgot your phone. I left him on the kitchen table for you."

Oh yeah, French speakers make that mistake all the time. (there's no "it" pronoun in French, and all nouns are gendered, even stuff like "kitchen" or "table")
