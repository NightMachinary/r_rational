I didn't mean it like that, I was just kidding about the Joonbait. I doubt Grak even wants Joon's affection anyway.

No I was more thinking whether or not he'd like it to make his romantic life easier if he has no attachment to his masculine form. I'm not sure if this is horribly offensive towards the gays, but I do wonder how many gay men would take the opportunity to change their physical appearance to be a female without any downsides.
