Really? We're actually more than half way through already?

I actually thought this was going to encapsulate years of Juniper's life. Similar to how Uther spent decades of his life in Aerb. And you are telling me that Juniper is already more than half way through his 'story'!?!

I mean he hasn't broken even one exclusion zone yet and there's at least 13 quests for that. Not to mention possible quests for exploring the other 62 zones, quests for empire building, all of the other companion quests, or even quests for dealing with the gods.

From my perspective, Juniper is a good way into making his way through the 'game', but nowhere near half way. But you are implying that he's 2/3 of the way through.

This was a major surprise!
