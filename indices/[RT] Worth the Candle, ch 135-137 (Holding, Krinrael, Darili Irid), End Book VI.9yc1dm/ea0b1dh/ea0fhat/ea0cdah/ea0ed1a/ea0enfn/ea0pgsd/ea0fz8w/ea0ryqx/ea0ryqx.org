Note that the books have been getting longer as they've gone on, partly because there are more characters to deal with. IIRC Book I comes out to 60K words or something like that, while Book VI was 216K. In theory, that might mean that three and a half books would come out to be 700K words, which would put us at the halfway mark by word count, if not by abstract-plot-units.

Edit: I do think there's a temptation to run forever and become something like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, where it's just going to continue on indefinitely until it either becomes unprofitable or the writer dies. Aside from burnout, there are a lot of problems with attempting something like that, and how much there is to say about the same set of characters or the world they inhabit is definitely one of them. Then you get into issues like maintaining proper power scaling, maintaining tension, etc., and it becomes clear that degenerate narrative cycles that keep looping forever are really difficult to do in a way that's satisfying to readers (and maybe more-so, for writers).
