I think it's interesting that Joon didn't get a companion quest "help Amaryllis revolutionize technology on Aerb". This is despite her explicitly wanting it to be "an open plot thread" (chapter 124).

But I note that Fenn's and Grak's were both very personal quests. So I suspect Amaryllis, if she gets one, will be similar.

One possibility is that: (spoilers encrypted text) The first encrypted message says 'Juniper can help you with [being too cautious and manipulative]'. I suspect, if she ever gets around to asking Juniper to help her with that, it will trigger a companion quest.
