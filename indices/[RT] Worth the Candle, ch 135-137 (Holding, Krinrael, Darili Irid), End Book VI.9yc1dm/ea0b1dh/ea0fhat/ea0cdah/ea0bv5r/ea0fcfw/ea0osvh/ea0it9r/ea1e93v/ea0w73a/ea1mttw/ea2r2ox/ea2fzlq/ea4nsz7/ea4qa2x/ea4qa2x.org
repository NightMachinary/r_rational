Just looked it up, it was back when they were camping out in the locus and first discussing narrative. Chapter 55, Bond Girl:

  “Can you not call it a game?” asked Fenn. She took off her glove and tossed it to the ground.

  “Sorry,” I said. “The ... interface?”

  “No, something better than that,” said Fenn. “How about washater, does that work for you?”

  “More elfish?” I asked.

  “It means something like game or system,” said Fenn. “A set of artificial rules. How have you not learned Elfish yet?” /Wah-sha-tehr, a set of rules, five words of Elfish down, thousands to go, plus a whole new set of rules. Yay./

They didn't get into a fight about it the second time Fenn brought it up (in ch 117), she just got annoyed:

  “We don't know enough,” I said. “We don't even know if [Uther] was playing by the same rules. If we had different rules -- I mean, it seems like we did, doesn't it? His so-called Knack seems stronger than whatever you'd call the thing that I have.”

  “Washater,” said Fenn, from across the table.

  “And ... what does that mean?” I asked. Step one of getting back on the right footing with Fenn was, after all, treating her more seriously. I had no idea how things were going to look between us going forward, but I could at least see the shape of things.

  “Washater,” said Fenn. She seemed unaccountably annoyed that I'd asked. “Just an elven word that fits pretty well.” She paused slightly. “It means a system of rules, basically. I don't think you'd want to call it a game.”

I forget or miss tons of things about the story, so never fear :P. This is just one that stuck with me for some reason.
