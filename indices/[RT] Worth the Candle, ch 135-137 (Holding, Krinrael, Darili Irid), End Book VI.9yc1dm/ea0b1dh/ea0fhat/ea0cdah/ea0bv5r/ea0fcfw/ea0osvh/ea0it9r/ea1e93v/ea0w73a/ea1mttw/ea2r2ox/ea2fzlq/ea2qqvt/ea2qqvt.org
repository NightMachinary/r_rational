I tried it, but in practice, it reads /way/ too awkwardly and distracts from what the text is actually saying (especially using the established Groglir pronouns). It would have been more accurate to the internal view that Grak has of himself, but that accuracy would probably take away from other aspects of what the narrative was trying to convey. I also briefly tried it without gender at all, by skipping pronouns, but that had similar problems with awkwardness.

In general, you shouldn't take anything from it. Grak doesn't view himself as male, he views himself as a dwarf, but in Anglish it's customary for dwarves to take male pronouns, in a similar way that the vitrics take female pronouns, and for the most part people don't have a problem with this, especially since /most of the time/ dwarves code male. (Notable exceptions include pregnant dwarves, dwarven midwives, dwarven childrearing, dwarven occupations, and dwarven sexuality.)

Now that being said, the game interface should consistently use dwarven pronouns, since that's what I did in the past; I will fix that.
