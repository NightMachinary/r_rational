Oh come on.

You live to be 100 years old. During that life, you forge a empire, defeat gods, spearhead amazing technological developments, knowing that it's all for nothing and the only thing that will remain is a bunch of books you write about it. Your love life is bitter and twisted, your relationships are either mercenary or toxic, and your soulmate is forever gone out of your reach.

Knowing what you do, and knowing that your younger self might fuck her only chance at a fulfilling love life out of arrogance, do you really not send her a message, for the sake of a dumb promise you made 80 years ago?
