I'm going to guess that the creator/editor/admin is [[/u/altoroc][u/altoroc]] as they have the earliest edit on that wiki.

ETA: The Wikia username of the earliest edit is Altoroc, and I looked up [[/u/altoroc][u/altoroc]] here, and that Reddit user has posted in [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]] about Worth the Candle.

ETA: I honestly don't care which wiki ends up being "the one". I just figured duplication of effort was not a good idea.
