So when the idea was first floated a week or so ago, we did find your pre-existing wiki. Can't remember the exact discussion, but ultimately we decided that we wanted a fresh start. We weren't happy with the "worth-the-candle-webnovel" URL and, with only seventeen pages already out there (most barebones TODO pages) and no idea who the editor was, opted to start over with a better URL and permissions to mess with templates and site formatting. We're trying to adopt a chapter-by-chapter methodology for adding information to the wiki, rather than a more scattergun approach. Didn't mean to tread on your toes; are you in the Discord?
