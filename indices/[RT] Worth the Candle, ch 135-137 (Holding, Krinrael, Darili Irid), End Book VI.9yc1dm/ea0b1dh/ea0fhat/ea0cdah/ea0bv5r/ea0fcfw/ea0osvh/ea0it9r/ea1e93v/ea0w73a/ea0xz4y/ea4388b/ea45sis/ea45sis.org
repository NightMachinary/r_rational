Chapter 137

- Time for Grak's companion quest!
- Have we heard of Altek before? I don't recall them.
- The Daril Idrid people seem like assholes already.
- Not clear how this was all expected to work, given how long wards last, even with distnace and travel time it would seem more cost effective to have a travellign warder visit them. Or Grak to work as a warder in other nearby places and send money back.
- Interesting getting something narrated from Grak's perspective. He seems more self aware than Juniper, or at least direct about it.
- The rest of the hold should really not have been surprised at his reaction, given they had already inferred he was putting off coming back. Trying tp forcefully reintegrate him into everythng at once was bound to fail
- Bethel being able to fly is another addition to her ridiculous range of powers now. She's like a flying fortress.
- How is juniper smelling the place if he's breathing from an oxygen tank? Aren't they airtight?
- "I felt my stomach churn when I saw a larger corpse cradling a smaller one in its arms." Ah fuck, right in the feels. Reminds me of a similar thing in the ruins of Pompeii.
- Juniper's description of his granfather and his own depression is really moving. Can't really put together coheret comments on any of the suicide stuff.
- Juniper's parents are sounding increasingly neglectful and awful.
- And the game interface has to undercut a meaningful moment as always. Fuck the DM.
