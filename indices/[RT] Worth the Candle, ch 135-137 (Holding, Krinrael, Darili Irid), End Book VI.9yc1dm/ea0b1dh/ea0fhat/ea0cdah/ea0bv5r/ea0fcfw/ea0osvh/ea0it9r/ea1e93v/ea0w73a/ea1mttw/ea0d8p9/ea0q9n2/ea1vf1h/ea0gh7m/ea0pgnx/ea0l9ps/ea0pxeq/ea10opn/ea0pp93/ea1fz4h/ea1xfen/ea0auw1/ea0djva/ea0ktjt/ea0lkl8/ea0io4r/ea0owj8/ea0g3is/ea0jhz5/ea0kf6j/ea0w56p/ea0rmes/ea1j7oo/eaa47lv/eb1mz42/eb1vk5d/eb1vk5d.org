That /should/ all be fixed, consistent with the initial valuation of gold at ~20,000 obols per pound, for 20,000,000 obols total, half of which is "gained" (but held in the glove) after the raid on Aumann's.

ch 54 is correct, assuming that Grak gets half of the 20M haul and that Fenn and Juniper leave with 2/3rds of 10M (roughly 6M).
