When I wrote that, I was thinking mostly about signal interference; Aerb isn't a single flat surface, it wraps around, so if you're high up and broadcasting in all directions, the radio waves will overlap.

One of the other problems is that light on Aerb undergoes a kind of anti-refraction as it travels through the air, which shortens the apparent horizon (only really notable in a few places, and implemented partially to save me time trying to work out atmoplanar haze and viewing angles). Without that, the downward bend of light due to gravity would make you appear to be living at the bottom of a huge bowl, which is weird for no good reason. I haven't done any calculations, nor described the mechanism that makes the anti-refraction phenomenon work, but it's definitely a complicating factor in terms of radio transmission.
