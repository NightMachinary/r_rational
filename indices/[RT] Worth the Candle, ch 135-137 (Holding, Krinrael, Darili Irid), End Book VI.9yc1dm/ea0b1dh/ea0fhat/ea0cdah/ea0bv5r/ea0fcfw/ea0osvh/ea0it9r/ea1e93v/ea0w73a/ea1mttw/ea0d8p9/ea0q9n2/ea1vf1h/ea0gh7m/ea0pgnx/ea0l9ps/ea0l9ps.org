First of all let me say, I'm really glad we've gotten back to more Joon-centric arcs lately. The Amaryllis arcs were fun, but it did feel like the party was starting to drift out of focus and Joon's renewed interest in all of them has helped to cohere the story a bit. It's nice that these side quests that have been piling up are starting to get resolved, though I've got to say Grak's quest felt like it was almost... too easy? I mean in the real world sense, sometimes all it takes is a friend being there for you, and Joon finally recognizing Grak's personage and acknowledging it might have been the narrative hurdle he needed to overcome. But in this game world that Joon finds himself in, /nothing/ has ever come as easy as a road trip and a short speech before. I do hope that the others pose a bit more of a challenge- the best parts of this story have consistently been Joon and the others rising to meet the obstacles presented to them, and lately it's been in more of a planning and conversation mode which isn't as viscerally thrilling.

I'm really disappointed that Fenn is increasingly likely not to come back. She was easily my favorite member of the main trio, and I think her character added a lot of much-needed lightness to the ponderous and kind of soggy Amaryllis/Joon non-relationship. While her loss might be narratively useful, it's very unsatisfying to see her cut out so completely and Bethel's turn as comic relief isn't really filling the void.
