It's been a while, Mrs. Wales! Haven't had a chance to read the new chapters yet, having just caught up with the last bunch (which were more fantastic than usual, which I'm attributing to you spoiling/enabling him with typo fixin'). Anyway, here's the usual errata for the older chapters:

120

He was late coming out. If I'd handed over the crown, he could have put it on her, gotten out faster, they [they? or she for Fenn?] might have --” She sat down on the ground and broke down into tears again.

122

<You and Amaryllis think alike,> replied Bethel. [possible incongruity with Bethel being unable to read minds, since Joon's preceding thoughts weren't marked as thoughtspeak and just the <Perhaps> didn't seem enough to go by]

123

which order we'll tackle them in given our abilities and how rapidly we think +to+ [we] can escalate up

125

“The sheathe can apply poison [sheathe apply poison? or blade?] with a thought, and stores several dozen

127

Similarly, there were mountains with more than thirty thousand years of erosion and rock strata that seemed like +they've+ [they'd] have taken millions of years to form.)

128

the library was cavernous, stretching forty feet from floor to +the+ ceiling [or: the floor to the ceiling]

129

I still +prefered+ [preferred] my right hand

We likely won't have the books on hand, but we'll have them indexed as completely as +was+ [is] feasible.”

Even then, the organizing authority -- the Fifth Empire, though it didn't go by that name -- knew that it was a temporary ward, something that would stop Fel Seed from using his particular brand of magic, but which wouldn't kill him outright. In that, +they failed+ ["that"/"they failed" is a bit vague since the rest seems to be saying they succeeded in warding Fel Seed and revealing its non-magical capabilities], and it's instructive as to Fel Seed's capabilities without his magic, but getting to that stage without four thousand warders and whatever Thargox happens to be is a tall order.”

131

She apparently didn't take much enjoyment from having what was effective[ly] a small town inside her

132

“It's a series of stopgap measures and incomplete solutions, some of which likely aren't going to be viable in the real [world, unless 'real' is library-speak],” said Raven.

Let me know if you have any suggestions +of+ [for] what's best.”

133

She made a gesture +of+ [for] people to come closer.

The truth was, it wasn't memetic in nature, and aside from looking at my soul (or presumably, spirit), they wouldn't actually be able to find anything, but that wouldn't necessarily keep them from understanding that there was something “wrong” +from+ [about] me.

134

I had never removed a memory before, given how difficult they were [to] make sense of and how central to my being they seemed.

I slowly backed away and +watching+ [watched], hoping that it wouldn't resurface, and breathed

“Given our protocols, if I acted unilaterally, it would be taken [as] a sign that I had
