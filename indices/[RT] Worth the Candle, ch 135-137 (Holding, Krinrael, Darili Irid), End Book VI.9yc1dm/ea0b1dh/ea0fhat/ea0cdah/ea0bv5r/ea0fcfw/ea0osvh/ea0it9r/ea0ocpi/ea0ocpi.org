#+begin_quote
  */Quest Accepted: All That Glitters - Return to Darili Irid with Grakhuil once da has gathered enough gold to satisfy da nad self-imposed penance to da nad former clan. Speak with Grak to learn more. (500/1000) (Companion Quest)/*

  */Quest Updated: All That Glitters - Go with Grakhuil Leadbraids to the mausoleum of Darili Irid when he's amassed one thousand pounds of gold. You are the only one who can help him make peace. (517/1000) (Companion Quest)/*

  */Companion Passive Unlocked: Wardproof (Grak)!/*

Solace in Chs 44 and 57:

#+begin_quote
  */Quest Accepted: Taking Root - The world has but a single druid, tending to but a single locus. With the locus so constrained within a magic bottle, no more druids may be inducted, but removal might prove fatal. With your help, druids might stalk the world once more. (Companion Quest)/*

  */Quest Updated: Taking Root - The world's last druid has died, leaving the last locus severely constrained and untended. Eventually the imperfectly self-regulating cycles of life within the bottle will fail and the locus will die, unless you can find a way to remove the locus and transplant it into the wider world, where it was always meant to be. (Companion Quest)/*

Amaryllis in Chs 80 and 104:

#+begin_quote
  */Quest Accepted: Pregnant Virgin Princess - Amaryllis has accepted the gift of Yaxukasu Axad. In nine months, she will give rebirth to Solace, and the world will once again have a druid -- if there's a locus to provide her a grove. (Companion Quest)/*

  */Quest Completed: Pregnant Virgin Princess - Amaryllis has given birth to Oorang Solace, bringing her back from the dead. If another of your party members dies, don't expect it to be so easy./*
#+end_quote

Completing Amaryllis' companion quest involved her giving rebirth to Solace---who remains a companion---instead of unlocking a companion passive. Curiously, the completion message for her quest was not flagged with "*/(Companion Quest)/*" though, so that might be an oversight.

No other companion quests to date.
