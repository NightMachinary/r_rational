Have you thought about using "they/them"? It's used in many modern English contexts to refer to a singular nonbinary person, and personally, I think it flows well. Grak, coming from a species with no sexual dimorphism, seems to literally exist outside a binary gender system.

Even it sounds a little quirky, language changes as people use it. It'd be cool to see explicit nonbinary representation in a story regardless.
