/Reading the chapters individually and spaced out to maximise my enjoyment and curtail my desire to binge them./

*Notes on Chapter 135 below:*

- I'm loving Bethel's weird architecture obsession. Wonder if its meant to hint at something deeper going on in her psychology. A desire to show off and exert her power? Also seems to weirdly interat with her idea of "houseness" if she doesn't want to feel like a facility but keeps building giant rooms.\\
- So Pallida is definitely into Amaryllis in this timeline as well. Seems to be mostly transference from her ancestor which is kinda gross. Can't see that ending well, even if they went okay in the alternate timeline.
- Juniper and Raven both seem to be downplaying the extent of what happened in the library which is troubling.
- The fox guard have a bunch of weird rituals and stuff going on. I imagine June will have to go visit them some time and complete a quest of his own to prove he's the Chosen One TM.
- I hadn't thought about the possibility of the basilisk image being in his soul. That's a problem in that it makes it harder to prevent/defeat the level up obsessed Juniper next time. Though it could also serve as a defence against hostile soul magic. They haven't discussed how to prevent the levelup problem in the future, which seems like a ticking time bomb.
- Lots of hints about Amaryllis overusing the time chamber.
- Juniper definitely needs SOC badly. It's a force multiplier. He's more at the stage of managing other people and interacting with big powers than he is dealing with 1v1 physical threats, short of DM contrived situations.
- June and Amaryllis's relationshi continues to be a complicated mess.
- Bethel seems to be evolving into an advisor kinda role. Maybe she desires to be useful in ways beyond being a house. The deliberate creepiness also seems to be a way of keeping people at a distance. Would be interesting to see longer conversations between her and people who aren't Juniper.
