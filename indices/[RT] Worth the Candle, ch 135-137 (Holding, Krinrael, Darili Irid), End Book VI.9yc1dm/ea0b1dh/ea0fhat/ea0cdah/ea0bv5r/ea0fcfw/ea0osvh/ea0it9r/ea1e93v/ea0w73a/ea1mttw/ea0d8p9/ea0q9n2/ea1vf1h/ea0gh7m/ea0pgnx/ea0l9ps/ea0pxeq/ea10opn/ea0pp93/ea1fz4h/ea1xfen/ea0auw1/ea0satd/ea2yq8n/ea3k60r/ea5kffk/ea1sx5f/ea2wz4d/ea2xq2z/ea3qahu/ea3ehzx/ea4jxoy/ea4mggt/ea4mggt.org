Yeah... Didn't think about the fact that he'd just have done that at the first opportunity.

Though I'm not sure it is enough. Even if you could edit out all trades of a heroin addiction from a former junkie and make him as clean as someone who never used, he could still get hooked again if forcefully fed heroin a few times. And leveling up is described as better than any drug by orders of magnitude, and increasing with every new level. It could well be that all Spirit can do is not requiring him to tune his "level up" value every morning.

In fact, in chapter 135 (IIRC) he even says he had to find a workaround by using Spirit to strangle his connection to the memory of extacy caused by all the previous level ups. The next time he levels could form a brand new memory, requiring him to be wrestled down again.
