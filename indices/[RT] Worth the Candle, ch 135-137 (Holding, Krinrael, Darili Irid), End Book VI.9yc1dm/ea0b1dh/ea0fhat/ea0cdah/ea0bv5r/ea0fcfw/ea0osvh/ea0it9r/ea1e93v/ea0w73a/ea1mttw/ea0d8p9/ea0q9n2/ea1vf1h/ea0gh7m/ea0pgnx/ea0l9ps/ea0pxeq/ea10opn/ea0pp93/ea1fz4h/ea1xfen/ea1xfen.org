  She put up a network of â€˜satellites', hung in place above Aerb using rotating shifts of still mages and other magics

Wait a minute, why a network of satellites?

Wouldn't it be cheaper to have a single flying fortress of computing and radio signals, that should be able to communicate with the entire hex? (it being flat and all). You'd get economy-of-scale benefits on a ton of infrastructure that way: teleporting personnel on and off the station, teleporting materials, security measures, all database operations (databases are /way/ more efficient when all the data is stored in a single building), etc.

On the other hand, a single satellite is more vulnerable to things like terrorist attacks and exceptional failures.
