Notes on Chapter 136:

- • Re the kinrael bit at the beginning of the Grack interaction, I can't tell if juniper is actually being totally clueless or was trying to be funny.
- • Grak really just wants to be loved. :( I wonder if his messed up arranged marriage thing has left him with insecurities about his self worth as it relates to romance, hopefully he can learn to get value from friendship type relationships as well.
- • The spirit fiddling seems like it should work from the description, but narratively speaking it feels too easy. Maybe there are going to be unanticipated negative side effects to messing with the spirit. (Maybe that's why Arthur banned it?)
- • Platonic Amarylis and Juniper time is nice.
- • The discussion of personal identity with levelup!Juniper is interesting. Resolves some of the issues we were talking about in discussion of the last chapter\\
- • Still no interaction with Valencia.
- • I love the magic satellites.
- • Plastic mages sound scary af.
- Pallida seems very happy with being onboard, sems to have casually enough assimilated.
