Thanks for reading. As usual, there will be no (intentional) break between books, and the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][progress spreadsheet is here]]. Mild progress related spoilers follow, i.e. how far we are from the end; I think that at this point, there are between two and three and a half books left of the story proper. When I started the story a year and a half and nearly 800,000 words ago, I wanted to hit [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], and that's the direction we're moving in. If it's more than that, it's probably because I indulged myself in diversions.

A big thanks to [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][all my donors on Patreon]] and everyone been following along.
