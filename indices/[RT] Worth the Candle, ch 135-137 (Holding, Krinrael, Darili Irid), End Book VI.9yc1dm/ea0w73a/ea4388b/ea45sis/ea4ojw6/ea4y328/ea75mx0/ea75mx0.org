The kind of entrenched communities we're talking about really don't think that way.

They don't think about incentives or your personal feelings or whether you consider their rules to be valid at all. They don't think about how you might react to given inputs, the same way an abusive husband doesn't think about the damage his abuse does and the kind of behavior it incentivizes. They only see what they want to happen, and the negative reinforcement they can apply if you deviate from the path they set for you.
