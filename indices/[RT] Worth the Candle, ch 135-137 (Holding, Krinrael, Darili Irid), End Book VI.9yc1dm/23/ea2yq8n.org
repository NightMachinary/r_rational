So... in the original summary the author claimed this would be a harem fic. Then the summary was changed to take this out. Now that Amaryllis and Joon pairing seems to be becoming canon after all, I'm starting to wonder if maybe the DM really did plan for Joon to be romantically involved with everyone in his party eventually.

I will be amazed if this actually is able to happen naturally, but the DM seems to have a tendency to plan out everything in advance down to every last butterfly effect. The question is, is AlexanderWales a skilled enough writer to make it happen without looking forced?
