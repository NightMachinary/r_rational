“Ideally we don't have to,” I said. I was comfortable enough admitting that. “But if that's what it takes, then yeah, we'll leave eighty million obols [inconsistency, just noticed another possible few throughout story where the value of 1k lb AU fluctuates from 20-40-80 mil, see quotes with other possible party gold inconsistencies] worth of gold there.”

  Grak shifted in his seat. “One thousand pounds is my penance to the clan,” he replied.

  “Or about *twenty million obols*,” I said. “Alright, if you help us to rescue Amaryllis, we can provide that, if it turns out that there isn't any gold in the upper levels of the tower. Obviously if the gold is there, you'll break down the wards and we'll rob him blind, but if it's not, then Amaryllis Penndraig will have the ability to pay for your services.”

  “At current market prices, minus the amount you're owed from our stores, the remainder of what you need amounts to roughly *forty million obols*,” said Amaryllis. “There are a few ways that we might get in a position to be able to pay that out to you, but it was always going to take years.”

  “Fine,” said Amaryllis. “It's going to cause us no end of problems with capital, because we'd be idiots to plan on paying anything out in the beginning, but I'll personally guarantee you** forty million obols** within two years time, and if I don't have it, we'll go kill a fucking dragon and take its hoard or something, okay?”

  “Okay, so,” said Pallida. “First things first, I have *twenty million obols*,” she said, opening one of the crates. “That's about as much money as I would like to commit to this life, but there's about twice as much in holdings, which I could get with varying degrees of time and hassle.”

I thought I was probably far enough away from any roads that even if I didn't die right away, I would bleed out before anyone could get me to a hospital. Before I could get myself to the hospital, I guess, since I didn't trust myself not to go silently. [double negative, but intended meaning seems to be single]”

From what I'd found, +That+ [that] was the surest way to make it actually fatal,
