I wonder what Fenn's companion perk would have been. Probably something to do with bows.

Also, because the thread got deleted, I have a quote for the Amaryllis being a DMPC from the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31229865][Amaryllis POV Chapter.]]

#+begin_quote
  he said a small prayer to each of the five gods, and then a final, sixth prayer to the Dungeon Master that Juniper believed was the one true god of Aerb. Prayers to the gods had their own specific structures to them, with motifs and iconographies that the pious were expected to adhere to, even if prayer itself was next to useless. The prayer to the Dungeon Master took some thought, because no standards existed for praying to what was only a theoretical deity.

  Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging. Place a dungeon before me, and I will delve it. Place a dragon before me, and I will slay it. *I am, above all else, your player.*
