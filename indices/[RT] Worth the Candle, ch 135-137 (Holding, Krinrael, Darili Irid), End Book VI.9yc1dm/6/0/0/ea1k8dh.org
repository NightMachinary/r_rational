Mmm, I actually don't think that the "Companion Quest" tag in the Pregnant Virgin Princess quest was referring to Amaryllis, I think it was there as a reference to Solace's companion quest, since the last line references the locus. Solace's death was directly reflected in the updated description of her companion quest of saving the locus, and the quest to revive her was presumably tagged as a part of that quest.

It seems like there is one big Companion Quest for each party member, and completing with grant them a very strong buff on par with this. Another reason to think that was merely linked to the locus quest, and Amaryllis' companion quest hasn't triggered yet.
