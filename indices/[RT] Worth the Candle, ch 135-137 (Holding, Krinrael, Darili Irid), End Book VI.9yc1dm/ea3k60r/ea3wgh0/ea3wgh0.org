  “You keep using the word penance,” I said. “A self-punishment?” The game had told me as much, in the text of his companion quest.

  Grak wasn't looking at anything in particular. I greatly preferred conversational tooth-pulling with Fenn, where getting her to speak meant wading through jokes and diversions rather than silence.

  “Something happened to Darili Irid,” I said. I paused, watching him. “You came back. They tried to force a life on you. You left. And then -- I don't want to guess at what tragedy happened because they didn't have a warder. I will guess, if you don't tell me.”

  “It is time for us to go back,” he said, finally switching to Anglish.

  “Something horrible,” I said, staying in Groglir. “An invasion? A theft?” I wasn't that eloquent to him, I'm sure, since the ideas I was trying to express had to be cobbled together from words that I already knew. “Assassination?”

  “Accident,” said Grak. I saw his jaw move slightly as he clenched his teeth. “A ward failed. They had hired a warder, cheap, part-time, to replace the old dwarf I was meant to take over from. He had little training. Little knowledge. Three years, provisionally licensed, but,” Grak rubbed at his nose with the back of his hand. “Darili Irid was deep beneath the surface. There were complex wards to shape the flow of air, to keep it clean. We used processes that were dangerous. When the ward failed, the air fouled, quickly.”

  “Oh,” I said. “Your father ... ?”

  “Everyone,” said Grak.

  “Oh,” I said again. “Shit. That's,” I folded my hands in my lap instead of saying more. It was horrifying, for a start. I had questions about how such a thing could even happen, what safety checks had failed, what alarms had been silent or just not installed, but before I could put my foot in my mouth, I realized those were the questions that Grak would have asked himself in the days and weeks after he'd learned it had happened. He wasn't telling me so I could diagnose the problem, or propose a solution. “Can I -- how many?”

  “Two thousand, three hundred, forty-six,” said Grak. “Everyone.”
