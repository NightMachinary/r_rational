#+begin_quote
  What do you mean 'platform'?
#+end_quote

Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, etcetera.

#+begin_quote
  If it isn't displaying, the problem is the fonts and layout system.
#+end_quote

Yes, generally the fonts.

#+begin_quote
  No font covers all of Unicode, but that's why you have different fonts for different codepoint regions.
#+end_quote

Which I do, and I keep adding them as I discover gaps in the default distribution on my platform. But I doubt one percent of the user base of any platform does that. They just use what's shipped by default.

#+begin_quote
  Are they not distributed widely?
#+end_quote

They're not distributed /by default/.
