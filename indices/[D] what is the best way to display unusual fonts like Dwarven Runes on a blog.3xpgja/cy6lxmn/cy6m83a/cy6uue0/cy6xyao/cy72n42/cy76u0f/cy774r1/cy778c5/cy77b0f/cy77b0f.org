What do you mean 'platform'? Unicode is a character encoding, the data looks the same here as it does anywhere else. If it isn't displaying, the problem is the fonts and layout system. No /font/ covers all of Unicode, but that's why you have different fonts for different codepoint regions. So what are you saying is the difficulty? Are the fonts available to open source not covering Unicode well? Are they not distributed widely? Do the text rendering systems not support Unicode broadly? Why are these things not already fixed?
