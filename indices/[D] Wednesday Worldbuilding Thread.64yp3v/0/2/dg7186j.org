Perhaps once, the only way humanity could survive in this dark mirror of our universe was as slaves to dark lords, destined to have children and then be immediately sacrificed in unspeakable rites to protect the next generation from the horrors in the sky.

Then came the Enlightenment, a ritual where some of the most mad of the dark lords, such as Descartes, Bacon and Newton, trapped a minor god of chaos in a maze, leaving a measure of order in it's place. From that order came the Thaumo-Industrial Revolution, which made it possible, for the first time, for humanity to survive without the mass sacrifices. Instead, people could be sent to factories, where their bodies and souls could be modified on the assembly line to be strong enough to survive some of the eldritch horrors.

With the invention of computers and mass-spellcraft in the '80s, that process became largely automated and decentralized. For the first time, humanity began to find a measure of peace. Songs and movies were created for no purpose other than entertainment, and the Dominion of Washington Immortal saw it's average life expectancy rise above 30.

Then, in 1995, Kurzweil and the burgeoning Cult of the Singularity did /something/, and computers haven't quite worked properly since.
