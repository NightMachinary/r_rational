There's some Mythos lore from [[http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/gods-teeth-a-delta-green-campaign/][RPPR's Delta Green campaign God's Teeth]] that could be useful here. For the game, they introduce a new aspect of Bast called Sredni Vashtar, based on the short story of the same name, which represents animalistic predators and feeds on other parts of the Mythos. It's powers and servants can be, and are in the game, utilized to defend humanity so long as you keep feeding it like a tamed wolf. Don't expect to housebreak it, though.

There are extreme downsides, of course. Only pre-lingual people can communicate with Sredni Vashtar, since it's based it totemic and atavistic rituals, and the way it's summoned in the game is by abused children who haven't been taught to speak so they couldn't call for help. In addition, it hungers for anything that's been touched by the Mythos, including victims of it. If you don't want to listen to the game, even though you should, you can get a summary from their [[http://slangdesign.com/rppr/2016/09/podcast-episode/rppr-episode-133-gods-teeth-campaign-post-mortem/][post mortem discussion]].
