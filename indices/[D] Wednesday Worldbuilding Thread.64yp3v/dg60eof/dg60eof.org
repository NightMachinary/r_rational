I've been toying with one idea for some time. 'Eldritch computers'.

First, [[http://imgur.com/gallery/zBtoQ][inspiration]]. Slightly more [[http://windows95tips.com/page/4][there]].

The driving idea was: come up with devices which could plausibly actually behave this way, postulate further that the devices are widely distributed, then figure out how the rest of the world must look like. The result:

Imagine a Lovecraftian world full of eldritch beings. Simply /existing/ there as a human is dangerous. Hordes of inhuman abominations would torment you, eat you, erase you, mindrape you, inflict a fate worse than death on you, propagate through you, etc., etc.

Despite that, a high-tech human civilization exists there. The safety of its citizens is ensured by technomagical 'eldritch computers'. ^{/It's never safe to turn off your PC./}

They're capable of mostly everything our modern PCs are capable of. In addition to that, they work as autonomous wards, i.e. protect people's apartments from eldritch beings. They detect incrusions, try to stop them; give suggestions to the humans when an incrusion is happening. Offer ways to fight back. They have supernatural abilities/functions which their owners could use. Hardware for sacrifical rituals is among them. They have magical control over their owner(s), which the owner could use to manipulate his/her perceptions, memories, emotions...

Naturally, given the setting, they're quite scary themselves. They're partially organic. They /grow/ organic parts as needed. They make eerie remarks. They may or may not be sentient. Ordinary, non-specialist people don't know what they even /are/, exactly. They could easily suggest doing something horrible like cutting off your hand and sacrificing it to stop a demon attack. They could /do/ something horrible, such as turning off your emotions or paralyzing you in a dangerous situation, going as far as destructively uploading you, sending you off to another city, then detonating the tactical nuke embedded into them to prevent an Outer God's invasion into this reality. So on.

Questions to consider:

How were the eldritch computers developed/found/summoned? How they defend people: do they constantly and automatically perform highly-complex warding rituals, or do they lend their computational power to Yog-Sothoth in exchange for protection? What exact functions they have? How would people view them? How would a programmer's job look like? How would programmers/engineers be viewed? What shape the society would take?

Or whatever else you may find interesting to do with the idea.
