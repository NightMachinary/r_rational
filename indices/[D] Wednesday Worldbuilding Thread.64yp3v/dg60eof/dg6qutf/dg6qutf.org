I'd imagine that the process of Eldritch incursion was a pretty slow one. As each new being started to interact with reality, ancient societies figured out rituals to prevent some/most of their influence. As time passed and technology progressed, more and more eldritch beings started to converge on the universe. Eventually the sheer number of beings and the complexity of rituals involved grew to the point where nobody could know and perform all of them consistently enough to defend themselves. Enter Windows 95, which uses the tortured collective souls of all the previous ritualists to make everyone who installs it a master ritualist.
