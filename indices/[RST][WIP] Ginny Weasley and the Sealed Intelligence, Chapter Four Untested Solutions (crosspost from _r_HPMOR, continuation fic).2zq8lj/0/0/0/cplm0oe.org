The more I think about it, the more sure I get that Madam Pomfrey is Moody using polyjuice. He helped redesign the hospital, he's a leglimens (we have no reason to believe Pomfrey is one from canon) and furthermore, he's EASILY paranoid enough to polyjuice himself into a hogwarts staff member just to catch an 11-year-old by surprise with leglimency simply because she reacted strangely when that hat put her in slytherin.

It's gotta be Moody.
