My assumption was that Pomfrey was intentionally non-sly about entering student minds. I'm sure like any leglimens she's capable of using her ability undetected against a non-occlumens like Ginny, but in the interests of disclosure she "makes some noise" or something so it's clear what's going on. I could see HP preferring this method. Pomfrey being a leglimens is a little unusual though, maybe she's actually Moody using polyjuice
