I doubt Harry would kill them regardless. The HPMOR canon explanation for ghosts seem to be that they're an imprint of a person's memories and personality made at the moment of their death. Sentient or not, that seems like the kind of information which would be extremely useful in resurrecting an individual who would otherwise be considered dead in the information-theoretic sense.
