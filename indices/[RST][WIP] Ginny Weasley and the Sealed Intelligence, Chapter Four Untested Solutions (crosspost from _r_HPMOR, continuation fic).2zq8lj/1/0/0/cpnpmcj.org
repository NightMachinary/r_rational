But in canon the diary only possessed Ginny through her forming an emotional connection with Tom by writing in it over an extended period, so she would /know/ that something weird was going on and we haven't even heard mention of the diary yet...

...Is what I was going to say before double-checking HPMOR chapter 102.

That seems to indicate that the takeover is immediate upon physical contact (and it didn't take the first person who picked it up because...people take care not to directly touch Dark objects?). At the very least, it's pretty clear that horcrux 1.0's work differently in HPMOR v_v.

Furthermore, the extraordinary claim of Ginny having the diary now is justified by the extraordinary evidence of her being a Parselmouth and of the Hat being eager to make her a Slytherin. In the face of these, it's not so unlikely that some /other/ "Dark" person stumbled upon the diary and then acted the same way that Canon!Lucius did, and for the same reasons (getting it off their hands, striking against House Weasley, and if it was a blood purist who also knew it was a key to the Chamber, striking against muggle-borns). Or, heck, it could be Draco, degenerated to full-on evil after the end of HPMOR and associated extreme denial of the results of his earlier blood purity research with Harry.

Edit: there's another obstacle to Ginny having the diary now: in HP canon, /Voldemort/ didn't even give the diary to /Lucius/ until sometime during the (First) Wizarding War, which started in 1970. Pioneer 11 was launched in 1973. So in HPMOR, Voldemort almost certainly stopped caring about the diary and his other horcrux 1.0's long before he would've given it to Lucius, meaning that, before this chapter went live, the most likely scenario was that the diary was still in one of those fortified hiding spots.
