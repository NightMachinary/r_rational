  "TGaB, where the protagonists are all trying to become better people, so that they can make the world a better place without having to depopulate it first."

  To be fair, Cat is trying to do that too. She's just having a lot less luck at it.

I laughed when I read your comment, but thinking about it, it's not really true, is it? Cat is trying to make Callow a better place, sure, but she is definitely /not/ trying to become a better person. A better strategist, or ruler? Yes. But her entire shtick from the very start of the series has been that she's willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish her goals, no matter what the cost to her soul or body will be. "Justifications are for the just" and all that. Cat willingly embraces becoming a worse person if it means she has a better chance at saving Callow. The TGAB analog would be Archpope Justinian, IMO.
