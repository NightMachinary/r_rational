yeah, the author mentioned something along these lines a few months ago however the guy is rather prolific and I dont think it will be one of those cases where the work never gets picked up again. The guy is enormously invested in his work.

Personally, I love both serials btw - TGaB is in my opinion more philosophical, discussing various interesting topics in a fairly natural and compelling way, whereas PGTE is a wonderfully wild and creative world setting full of amazing villains, snappy one-liners and trope deconstruction.
