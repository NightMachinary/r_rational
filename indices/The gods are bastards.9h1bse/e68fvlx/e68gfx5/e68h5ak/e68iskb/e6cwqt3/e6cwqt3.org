The characterization in TGAB gets much much stronger as it goes along.

I think Shaine, Juniper and Fross are the only ones who have interesting non cookie cutter stuff from the beginning.

The rest of the them start out very explicitly as characters taken off of a character sheet and it takes a while for them to develop.

You're right that the interconnection theme is very much observed in its breach to have an actual effect on the story. It is getting better... but if someone would just make the author a map so I can figure out where things are...

The author also has a bad tendency to introduce new main characters.... all the time and they don't get cut. The combat feels less real because all of these people with phenomenal cosmic power and casualties are non existent.

Also, the thing is long. Like almost Worm length and not done. It's at 13 books now.

It's still worth the read and it has so many really good ideas and interesting settings in it. (The Golden Sea is excellent)
