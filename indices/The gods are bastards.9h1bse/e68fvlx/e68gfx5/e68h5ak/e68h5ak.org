Both are YA-ish dark-toned fantasy novels with interesting worldbuilding and great witty banter between characters (in the style of e.g. Joss Whedon's Buffy The Vampire Slayer). So there are a lot of similarities, and if you like one then trying the other is probably worth it, especially when they're both free except for the time you spend reading them.

That all said, I personally like Practical Guide much better.

I think the biggest difference between the two, for me, was that Practical Guide had better matching between characters' narrated abilities and the story themes with the actual story events. That is, in TGAB we are told Character X is a academic genius and planner, Character Y is super powerful and unique, Character Z is a violent person who is good at fighting... and then in the actual plot Character X doesn't have any good ideas or knowledge ever and is instead a dumbass at all times, there are like 5 people exactly like Character Y and also none of them are a big deal, and Character Z never fights impulsively and loses many more fights than they win rather casting doubt on the whole 'good at fighting' idea. The plot has characters constantly talking about themes of "The world is more interconnected now and you can't just fight, you have to have Cunning Schemes and work with others..., etc" but all the main characters Cunning Schemes and so forth don't work and the only times they succeed is when they just fight.

There are many more differences, stylistic, thematic, and so forth between the two - but that was the biggest problem that I had with TGAB, that I didn't have with Practical Guide.
