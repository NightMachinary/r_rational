For yet another opinion, I think the main difference is that PGTE tells a single story - the story of Catherine Foundling of Callow - while TGAB tells the history of a world through several interconnecting stories. Both share some similar elements: fantasy setting, worldbuilding, magic, great characters, and hilarious banter. But they have very different feels.

PGTE is pretty straight forward and constantly has a sense of urgency. The stakes keep rising for Cat, and she's constantly getting pushed from one desperate emergency to the next. There's an entire world (actually a few worlds, if you count Arcadia and the hells) that we know exists, but mostly is just casually mentioned in side chapters, introductory quotes, or throwaway sentences. It kinda almost feels like Dark Souls in a way - you get a grasp of a much larger picture and loads of history through item text, but the plot itself revolves around the action.

TGAB is more meandering; while the author tells us from the start that "a great Doom is coming," it never really feels like there's much urgency. Instead, the series explores more of the world and its history, primarily because that history is extremely relevant to whatever this coming Doom is going to be. This is done by following several different characters or groups of characters, with various degrees of intersection with one another. The plus side is that it allows readers to really get to know the world, its peoples, and its politics; and it also allows the author a chance to explore multiple philosophies and motivations through different sets of eyes. The down side is that it means whatever plot you're most interested in might be forced onto the sidelines for a few books.

If you had to choose one series to read I'd recommend PGTE, simply because it's more coherent and well paced. TGAB has a lot of great moments, but it also has FOURTEEN books to read through (compared to PGTE, which is currently on book 4 of 5). TGAB has a much larger time investment. In my opinion it's absolutely worth making that investment, but if your time is limited, PGTE has more payoff quicker.
