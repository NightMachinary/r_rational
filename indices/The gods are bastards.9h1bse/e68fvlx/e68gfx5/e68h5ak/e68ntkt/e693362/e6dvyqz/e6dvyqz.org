That's probably the reason I got bored with TGAB (TBAG would've been hilarious) is the lack of urgency. Sort of like the old Star Wars vs the newer Star Wars. The old ones employed urgency and The Big Bad to push our plucky heroes to victory, the newer Star Wars feel a lot more relaxed and, frankly, quite boring.

That's where PGTE wins handily for me, since pretty much every chapter has some sense of urgency and Big Bad being projected with a Sword of Damocles
