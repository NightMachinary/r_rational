If I might interject, I lost interest in A Practical Guide to Evil in about the middle and haven't picked it up again, but I binged all the way through The Gods Are Bastards over the course of several weeks just recently. It's got a fairly standard-genre sort of feel in the beginning, but don't be fooled---there is a whole hell of a lot of foreshadowing and fridge logic being set up behind the scenes that you don't even notice while reading it, which is very fun once you get to the revealing bits.

More importantly---if you share my priorities---The Gods Are Bastards is just plain fun to read. The dialogue is some of the most snappy and hilarious I've ever had the pleasure to read, there are plenty of moments that made me feel genuine pathos for the characters, and there's a lot of clever plots flying around to lend things an air of mystery and urgency. If I had to criticize, I'd say the start is a bit counter to what the story's real tone and rhythm is, and the characters are perhaps not as “real” feeling to me as those in, say, Worth the Candle or Worm---both of which have the most people-like characters I can think of off the top of my head, so that's a rather high bar to clear. It's really a matter of tastes and preferences, you might find that aspect better in TGAB or not really care about that part at all.
