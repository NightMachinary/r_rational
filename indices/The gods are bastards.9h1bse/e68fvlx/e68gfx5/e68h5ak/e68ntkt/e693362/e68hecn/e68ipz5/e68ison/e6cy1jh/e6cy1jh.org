The Practical Guide has a problem in that the base story of the Cat, who is less interesting than Black.

I don't want the story of the plucky girl who wins through grit and determination. That's dime a dozen.

I want the story of the person who thinks their way out. (Someone like Black.... or Taylor in Worm) The satisfaction in some of Worm's best fight scenes were not that Taylor was so very very strong or mean or plucky... it was figuring out how to make here weak power effective and outmaneuver the bigger and stronger people.
