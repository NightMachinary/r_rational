I think that, after professional editing (and paring down the word count by at least half), TGaB would probably be the better story. The worldbuilding is better, the overarching plot and underlying mysteries have clearly been thought through, as they're being exposed piece by piece, and I prefer the idea of a world evolving away from the need to kill everything you oppose espoused by TGaB, rather than Cat's having to murder her way to peace. It definitely needs the firm hand of an editor, though. 50% is a low estimate of what could be cut out and not have much of value lost.

On the other hand, I really appreciate how PGtE is written. Technically, it appeals to me a lot more, and the story constantly feels like it's in motion. Not to say that it couldn't benefit from some light editing, but most of the elements that have been included are important to the story; I don't think editing it would /significantly/ improve it, the way it would improve TGaB. However, PGtE is a perpetual murder-fest; I'd say "in the style of George R.R. Martin," but GRRM would have killed off half of the Cat's merry band of protagonists, and probably all of the Calamities, by now. Yes, I get that there's in-story justification as to why this is, but it just isn't as satisfying rooting for someone because they'd cause the least damage if they win, as opposed to TGaB, where the protagonists are all trying to become better people, so that they can make the world a better place without having to depopulate it first.

So, yes. If you want a story with better fundamentals, and are willing to endure some slow bits in order to learn the answers to the questions that the author is carefully sprinkling into the narrative, go with TGaB. If you want something that isn't trying to be quite so deep, but grabs you and pulls you along an an entertaining ride, go with PGtE.

Or, personally, I think there's value in reading both.
