Slack is more convenient than IRC and easier to use, so it has a better chance of gaining more users.

Also, I didn't know that #HPMOR existed. Maybe existence of our chat room should be more clear to new users, then it will be more valuable and popular.

If people will find this idea useful - I can ask moderators to add a link to the sidebar, so that everybody would know that we have our chat room.
