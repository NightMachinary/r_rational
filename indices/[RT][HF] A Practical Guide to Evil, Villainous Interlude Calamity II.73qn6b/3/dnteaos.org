Updated Chapter:Interlude counts:

- Book I - 28 Chapters, 0 Interludes (0% Interlude)
- Book II - 49 Chapters, 11 Interludes (18% Interlude)
- Book III (in progress) - 32 Chapters, 15 Interludes (32% Interlude)

(where "Chapter" = specifically a non-interlude chapter, and prologues/epilogues are not included in either count)

--------------

While I'm still enjoying the series, I'm not a big fan of the increased interlude ratio.

The first book was solely a single-perspective affair; now, it's /almost/ an ensemble cast (except it's too heavily skewed to Cat's perspective for that to be the case). Which is a shame, as the original single-perspective Cat narrative style is part of what drew me to the series in the first place.

While I can only speak as an avid reader of fiction (not a writer), it seems like a lot of the information from the interludes could be passed to us via Cat's perspective (rumors she picks up, chats she has with Black, etc), as is the case in a lot of other single-perspective fiction. So the interludes certainly aren't /necessary/ to the plot.

And if the author truly wanted to shift to an ensemble narrative, they could have explicitly changed the structure of Book 3 (e.g. "Chapter" no longer means "From Cat's perspective") - which would actually have been interesting, in that it comes with additional implications (including that Cat no longer has plot armor).

As it is now, the interlude-creep reads to me like the author is growing bored with Cat as the central protagonist. It's completely understandable, given the high content output; but as a result, I'm now wary of bumping up my donation to get to the "three chapters a week" tier, in case it leads to further author burnout (not to mention, as [[/u/Taborask]] points out, the potential decline in chapter quality in general).
