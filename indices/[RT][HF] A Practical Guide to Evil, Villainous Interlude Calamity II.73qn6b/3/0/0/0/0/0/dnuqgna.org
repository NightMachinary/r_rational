I don't know, I think it could be impactful.

Imagine if there were no interludes throughout this arc, and we just got really focused and drawn into Cat's story. We hear from Black some vague descriptions of what the Calamities are up to, but nothing more. We get to the resolution of Cat's current plot arc, and shortly after she's victorious (or whatev), she gets a message that (Wekesa? Black? Captain? All three?) is/are dead.

THEN we flash back and get a minor arc of interludes, as we see what happened to the Calamities firsthand.

I think it would be more powerful for /both/ stories, rather than this constant jumping around.
