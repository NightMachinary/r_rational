The current interludes are placed after the summer conflict aren't they?

The current positioning is probably relevant as it places all 5 calamities in combat at the same time.

As for its increase, its pretty probable it returns to normal levels as the current plot wraps up, as it seems to be the herald of the end of the calamities (which would be pretty unsatisfying if we were to learn it second hand)
