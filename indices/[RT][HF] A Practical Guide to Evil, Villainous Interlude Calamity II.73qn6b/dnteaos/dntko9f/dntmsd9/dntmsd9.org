A major part of the problem is that the world-building shifting narratives are at odds with the first person narrative style of the "main" Cat chapters.

I can think of plenty of well-written stories that focus on a central protagonist, but jump around to other characters for the occasional interlude chapters. However, almost all of them are third person. We're already watching the story from that "bird's eye view", so it's not jarring to slide from one character to another.

In /Practical Guide/, we're in first person. We're literally in the head of the protagonist, seeing the world through her eyes. Our interpretation of events stems directly from Cat's interpretations of events. So constantly cutting from that narrative to a /third person/ perspective of a different character is jarring, it breaks narrative flow, and in many cases (such as when we see a battle Cat's in, from one of her general's perspectives) is almost entirely unnecessary.

Worm does use that same style, but in a low impact way, in that the interludes are almost entirely in the breaks between arcs (essentially, the prologues/epilogues of /Practical Guide/). So we experience an entire arc through Taylor's eyes, and then in the post-arc "downtime", we get an interlude from another character's perspective to build out the world. No narrative flows are broken. The few interludes that /are/ mid-arc in Worm, are almost entirely unrelated to the arc in question - they're world-building short-stories, more akin to /Practical Guide/'s "Extra Chapters" (which I did not include in my counts, as I have no issue with them).
