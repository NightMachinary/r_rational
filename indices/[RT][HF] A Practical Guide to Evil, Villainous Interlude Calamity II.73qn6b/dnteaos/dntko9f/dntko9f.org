I personally like the interludes, since they tend to be more dense in terms of world building. It dances a line between the game of thrones style protagonist rotation, and the worm style of occasional alternate perspectives.

The other advantage is for placing, it lets the main narrative play out at a more reasonable rate instead of being forced to constantly escalate, since we can get our adrenaline fix on "side characters". But I can see how it would be really frustrating if you just wanted to see more of cat and this other stuff kept getting in the way
