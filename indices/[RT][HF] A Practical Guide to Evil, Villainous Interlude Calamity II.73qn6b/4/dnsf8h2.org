I wonder if there is a equivalent for black on the heroes side, one that is methodical and dedicated the last year's of his life to raise a new generation of heroes, or the best that they've is bard that is too busy playing the long game to give a shit about the heroes?.

Edit: I'm still waiting for a Pov chapter of the heroes, maybe the one to close the battle.
