Hedge can only use any given trick once a day, so once he scores another wound on her, she won't be able to shrug it off as easily as she's been doing.

Additionally, he mentions that her arm is more magic than flesh now, and we know from back when Cat got her leg injured that a limb replacement that uses magic for animation can be subverted by a skilled magician in a fight. I'm not sure what'd happen if he used Link or Imbricate on her arm to fuse its magic with the magic of the hells, but I doubt it'd be healthy for her, and that's assuming that he doesn't do something like just linking it to another one of the Tyrant's flying towers and making it violently explode.
