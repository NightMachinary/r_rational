  I must add that With This Ring has roughly a chapter's worth of uplift every 100k words (at least before I dropped it),

Um...how far in was that?

  it's not remotely the main point of the fic, just a neat thing.

I have to disagree there. It's true that the SI's first year focused heavily on superheroing, because joining the Young Justice team was the deal he made in exchange for his power source. And his first six months, in particular, follow canon. But even then, he's working to upgrade his team mates' equipment and/or powers, build connections between Atlantis (full of magic users) and Themyscira (directly connected to a divine pantheon with time on its hands) and the rest of the world, brush the dust off captured supervillain tech (Dolmen Gates, elemental control a la Red Tornado) and put it into mainstream use...and perhaps most importantly, show and persuade some of the most powerful people in the world that there are simple ways for them to do even better.

The way I see it, the main point of the fic is, The comics contain lots of really cool and interesting things, but people aren't smart about using them, so let's try fixing that.
