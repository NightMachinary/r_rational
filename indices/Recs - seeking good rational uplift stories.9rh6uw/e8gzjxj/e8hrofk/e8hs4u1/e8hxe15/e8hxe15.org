It has some fairly bad reviews from the few rational individuals that seem to have read it.. Look:

  What did I think?

  If you make a world where a human is being transferred from Earth to another planet, where some aliens, some x-thousands of years ago already planted other humans and several Earth fauna and flora have alredy been transplanted, kindly avoid that they could possibly have had the same evolution:

  - Monotheism\\
  - Indo-Germanic language\\
  - Minutes as a unit of measuring time while the complete calender is different\\
  - Abbeys with real abbots\\
  - Miles as units of measuring distance, for god's sake\\
  - European names\\
  - A substitute for coffee as in "nobody is actually able to get out of bed and something done without\\
  having one first"\\
  - Actual christian marriage with only the occasional exception of more than one wife/husband

  This is all the more grating, since the author tried very hard (and repeteadly) to describe a somewhat different world/planet.

  Also, once said is enough. There's no need to describe MC's eyes over and over, neither his history, neither his "never home again" dilemma etc. etc. etc.

  I'm giving the next one a try. Why with only 2 stars? I had a clear view of where this is all going halfway through the first volume and now I want to know, if I was right.

This review already makes it unreadable for me =/
