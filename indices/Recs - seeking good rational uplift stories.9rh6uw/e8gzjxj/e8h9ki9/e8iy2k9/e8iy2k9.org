Definitely [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30985483-cast-under-an-alien-sun][Destiny's Crucible]]

About a modern chemist that sent to a island in a AU with 16th century tech equivalent. Its not written in the typical [[/r/rational]] story style, however I found it as enjoyable as it was very well written.
