Essentially a non-canon character made up by the author to fulfill a role in the story. They're usually awful, like a better-at-everything-than-the-main-characters-long-lost-sibling who falls in love with the protagonist.

In With This Ring it's just an Atlantean manta-form researcher/merchant who the SI tries to buy some stuff from and helps with/is helped by in magic research. Turns out power rings can make patterns (say, runic shapes) at microscopic scales, which opens up whole new fields of research and new surface world/atlantean lines of communication/commerce.
