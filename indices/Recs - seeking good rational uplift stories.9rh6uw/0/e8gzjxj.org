[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a Young Justice SI with a focus on integrating the insanity that is DC continuity into a functioning society. Magic is 100% real and anyone can learn it yet truth compulsion isn't used in trials or Earth magic to clean up pollution, a superhero built a staff that lets him fly and project force fields (in the 1950's!) and no one tries to use it to generate power etc. It's a long road (it updates every day and is currently at 2 million+ words) but I think it's worth it if you're interested in a world where there's god knows how many possible afterlives and they accidentally (in canon, though it's never point out outside the fic) made monotheism the worst one. Quite impressive that it never really bashes anyone (save Dr. Fate, though I think that's more just working with the character as it is rather than anything malicious) , it tries it's damnedest to give reasonable motivations and mistakes to poor decisions of existing characters. Also has only 1 OC in the entirety of it's run, so that's pretty impressive.

In [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]], in the kingdoms of Inath, zombies are encroaching at the borders and ancient legends tell of summoning one from another world, a place called Earth, who would learn the ancient rights of magic and find the magic sword to turn the tide. When getting /him/ they accidentally grab a materials engineer as well, and it's starting to look like they might not need that sword. After all, they have artillery now.

Also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/][A Better Class of Criminal]] just because it's mildly rational and utterly hilarious. DC SI with Libriomancy powers, but he's mildly supervillain-style insane (and because of that everyone dismissed his "I fell into a comic book story", /of course/ the guy who pulls stuff out of books believes that he fell into one, hahaha) and has James Moriarty in his head. He's also terrified of Batman because he keeps thwarting all his plans and once fought the entire Justice League with the One Ring. He ends up as the magical mayor of post-apocalyptic Gotham City and decides to build a magitech society out of the debris. Still in progress and updates are few and far between, but not dead by a long shot.
