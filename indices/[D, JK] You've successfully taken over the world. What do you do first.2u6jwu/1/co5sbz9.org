Scrap nuclear weapons. Who am I going to use them against, myself? likewise, I'd go about dismantling most conventional military forces as well, save a small 'police force' I could use to prevent rebellions. There's really no point having armies when the concept of a 'nation' is second to your whims.

Secondly, I would plug a few of the holes that allow countries to defect in tragedies of the commons- for example, tax havens. No country will be able to get ahead of its surrounding countries by compromising in a way that harms both.

These are things that any sane leader of a world would do- once you can control an entire system, you can begin to remove areas where that system fights itself.

I'm not an economist, but would tariffs come under this? From what I know of them, they would, but I'd consult some economists before abolishing them.

As a second measure of filling my coffers, I'd confiscate the wealth of all who opposed me. This confiscation would be graduated according to how much I was opposed, and what the crimes of the person opposing me were. So, even if Mugabe surrenders to me immediately, I'll still arrest him and confiscate his wealth. If, however, Argentina opposes me but backs out early on in the war, I'll only take a fraction of the leaders' wealth, deposing them and keeping them under house arrest.

Now, some things that I would enact based on my preferences:

A universal code of law. This would no doubt be extremely unpopular, but hey, what are you gonna do about it, assassinate me? Do you really think the person standing on that podium is the real me? I've never been fond of cultural relativism as a justification for things we might consider 'wrong'. This would enshrine things like freedom of speech, freedom of religion, civil rights and liberties, etc.

A /huge/ diversion of resources towards preventing climate change and research into renewable energy. I'd hope that the money freed up by having a tiny military budget would be enough, but if not, the world is going to have to buckle its belt.

Borders would initially stand (I need to preserve order while I figure out if opening them would let potential opponents get a foothold into more vulnerable locations), but over time I'd dissolve them and encourage people to abandon their idea of a nation. Exceptions would be made if immigration started to lead to a tragedy of the commons- for example, if everyone moving caused a net loss of wealth or quality of life, or if too many people move away from a location that I'd have to resettle in to take advantage of its natural resources.

I'd pump more funding into the space agency (at this point, there will be only one space agency, consisting of a consolidation of the previous ones). This is much cheaper than you'd think, so even if I multiplied the budget by ten, it wouldn't make too much of a difference to the world economy. Also, this money will be made back in the long run several times over.

I'd also pump money into the arts. Again, art is cheap, and it'd help offset some of my negative publicity.

This post is getting a bit long now, so I'll leave out my plans for education and health reform.
