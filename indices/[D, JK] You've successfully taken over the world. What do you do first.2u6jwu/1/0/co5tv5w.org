You would be much better off with a small, nationally-funded organization that does space /research/, and then create incentives for private companies to do all the actual space development. NASA has been great at research, but SpaceX brought the cost of putting things in orbit down by a factor of 10. If they can get the Dragon man-rated in its current form then they will have brought it down even more.

Corporations look for ways to make things cheaper and more efficient. Government agencies look for ways to make things safer. Corporations focus on the short term, government agencies can think about the future. Those are all simplifications, of course, but largely true. You need to take advantage of the strengths of both systems.
