Based on current technology, I don't think we have a nuke that's large enough to destroy an asteroid that was large enough to be a concern to Earth. And even if we do, we definitely don't have the sort of launching and targeting systems set up to accurately fire it off into space and hit the asteroid at a far enough distance so that the nuclear explosion doesn't irradiate our atmosphere.

EDIT: Although, depending upon how far out we're able to predict it hitting us, it's possible to throw enough resources at developing these.
