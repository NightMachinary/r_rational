The part about portions of old militaries becoming rebels is one reason I'd want to dismantle the armies. If I leave them standing they may rebel, but if I scrap their gear and take apart their structure, they're at a loss. Also, the financial power I'd be able to bring to bear would be enormous. Unless everywhere rebelled at the same time, I'd be able to buy a lot of loyalty on a case by case level for rebellions.
