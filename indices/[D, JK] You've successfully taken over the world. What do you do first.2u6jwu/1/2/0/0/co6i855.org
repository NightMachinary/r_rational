How would find all of their gear when you first take over? They're not always documented, especially in areas like Iraq, and plenty of it is acquired through the black market. And some would hide gear when it looks like their country is on the brink of being conquered. As for buying loyalty, the U.S. put a price on Osama bin Laden's head and it still took them many years to track him down. Obviously it's easier when you directly control the country you're searching in, but how much direct control can you really have if most of the people there hate your guts and many of those places are so rural that even their current governments barely have control in those areas? One of the first things I would do is develop infrastructure and centralized administration heavily in as many third world countries as I could in order to increase my ability to control my subjects, but that would take a long time. Even if the insurgents are disorganized enough to not be a serious threat, you would still be fighting multiple wars at a time for decades. Reducing the size of your military would not be an option.
