I'm assuming a lot of this work is already done, though. OP said I'd successfully taken over the world, not that I'd taken over one country and am using that to conquer the world. So, for a case like Iraq, I'm assuming that all current factions have unconditionally surrendered to me, and one condition of that surrender would be for them to cede weapons, fortifications, finances and prisoners to me. The fact that I already hold a good deal of the current movers and shakers in prison would be powerful in places with a tribal system, where the next possible insurgent is the brother of someone I've captured.
