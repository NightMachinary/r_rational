I don't think a small force for rebellions, even if it's a very well-armed one, would be enough. There are a lot of weapons lying around and depending on how you took over the world the leftover equipment of old militaries might still be left. Heck, you could have significant portions of old militaries outright become rebels right after you take over the country. Every country would have people trying to reestablish their old nations; people have a lot of pride and don't let go of tradition easily. Those rebels would have the sympathy of ordinary citizens and would be difficult to root out, especially in the less developed countries. Your empire would have to last a very long time before the majority of people would be alright with being a part of it. Only then could you reduce the size of your military significantly.
