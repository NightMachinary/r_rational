I get the feeling that the rest of the respondents here missed the [JK] tag.

My actual answer would be to gather a variety of top administrative and logistics experts. I'd check that they use evidence-based methods and send home any who don't. Then I'd explain my ideology and goals to the lot of them, update my plans wherever I find a well-informed objection, and look for experts that are genuinely excited and on-board with how my program interacts with their specialties and hire them.

I mean, I would still do that forced berating by a kindergarten teacher thing if I had enough clout that it wasn't likely to backfire, but that's for my own amusement, not an attempt to accomplish something.
