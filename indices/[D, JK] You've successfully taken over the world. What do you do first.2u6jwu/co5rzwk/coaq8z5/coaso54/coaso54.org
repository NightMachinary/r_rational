You're not actually euthanizing anyone - the most you're doing is not allocating public money towards their medical care. They're still welcome to spend their own resources on keeping themselves alive. Some people won't be able to cover the costs themselves, and as a result will die - which is why they're called death panels by detractors. No one gets euthanized unless they want to be. As for state funding of cryonics, I think it's too expensive and too unlikely to work. I would rather spend the money on other things.
