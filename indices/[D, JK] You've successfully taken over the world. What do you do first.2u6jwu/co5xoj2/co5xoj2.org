Step 1. Secure my people. Per my extensive experience with political rulership (democracy 3) I know I need several things to keep the people happy. I need foodstamps so people are well fed and good. I need agricultural production so food prices are low. I need low crime so I need a large investment in education and extreme measures to stamp out all crime. I need healthy civilians.

As such I make large, multi billion dollar, investments in agricultural sciences, food distribution technologies, water purification techniques, have CCTV cameras everywhere, make facial recognition technology so everyone can be identified, have shoot on sight orders for violent criminals (rapists, murderers, and such) and rehabilitation programs for lesser criminals and make a large investment in drone technology and robotic police so in the future I have less need for fallible humans. I enact mandatory public education programs for healthy eating, have regular mandatory sports for my subjects, mass vaccinations, and well funded healthcare programs.

Step 2. I need more money. I need to avoid running out of resources as that can cause problems. I disband most armies, make substantial investments in AI bureaucracies, legalize all drugs (better they be in a drug addled haze than they be thinking about resisting me) force hospitals and schools and police to use recording heavy but paper low measures (I've often heard them complain they spend more time doing paperwork than work) raise income taxes in many countries.

Step 3. I need to entertain my civilians. Happy civilians who enjoy the sight of heavily armed drones flying above their heads are safe civilians. I enact numerous public programs to encourage local cultural events, sports events for exercise, provide funds for local clubs and such. I provide lots of funds for artists and game makers and such to make entertainment for my subjects and spread their works wide and far. Piracy is legalized so my poorer subjects can enjoy entertainments.

Step 4. Whatever I want. People have their bread and circuses, I have enough money to provide. I encourage industry to keep generating more money and follow whatever whims I choose. My ever more mechanized army becomes ever more loyal and irresistible and I win.
