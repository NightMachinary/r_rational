I actually probably would establish death panels, though obviously not under that name. If we have limited dollars available to take care of everyone, then we /have/ to make some kind of decision about how those dollars are allocated, and putting obscene amounts of money towards high risk patients is pretty stupid. The quality-adjusted-life-year model has always just seemed right to me ... and as supreme ruler of the world, I would be able to make it a reality!
