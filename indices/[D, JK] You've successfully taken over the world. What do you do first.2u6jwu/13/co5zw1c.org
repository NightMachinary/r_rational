Delegate authority over everyday lives of ordinary people to local organised religions. On the level of (former) countries, instate a political class composed equal parts of clergy, aristocracy and a meritocratic lower-upper class to placate the academic world, and give them free reign to run their countries, encouraging regionalism and discouraging maintenance of political entities ruling over more than 20 million subjects.

Found an institution of the emperor of mankind to formalise my rule. The institution collects tax from its member states, maintains a standing army capable of overpowering any half of the rest of the world, and runs global-scale engineering and research efforts, specifically space programs, which are forbidden to individual member-states. This results in significant brain drain, as the emperor employs all or the overwhelming majority of leading scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, ensuring his domain remains more advanced than the rest of the world. Wars between member-states are financially discouraged, but not forbidden, though the emperor reserves the right to intervene in any conflict to prevent lasting economic failure.
