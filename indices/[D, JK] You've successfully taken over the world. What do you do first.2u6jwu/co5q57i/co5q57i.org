Ruling the world is probably quite hard. You need to consider a lot of things.\\
One needs an advisory panel or cabinet including all ones most effective opponents. If anyone can provide well reasoned arguments as to why what you are doing is a bad idea, you want them as your advisers.\\
One also needs a good number of scientists available as advisers.\\
This means that you have a much better chance to make rational decisions, based on as much evidence as possible.
