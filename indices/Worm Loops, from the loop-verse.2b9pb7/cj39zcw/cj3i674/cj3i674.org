There is only so much content that is exactly on-topic. This isn't a rational fic, but I imagine that it would entertain a lo of rationalists.

Just like permutation city isn't a rational story, the characters make some very poor choices. But it still has a following because it makes use of interesting concepts.

If you don't like it, downvote and move on.

My preferences are to err on the side of new content, rather then on the side of "purity". So if you could delete this message, so I get more content, I'd appreciate it. I'm worried you might cause people not to post new content.

Or at least be consistent. There are a looot more posts here that don't fit the criteria.
