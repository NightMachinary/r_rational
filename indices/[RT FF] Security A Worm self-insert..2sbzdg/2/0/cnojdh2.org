Disincentivize underage erotica by not promoting it, sure. Just one problem: this fic is not underage erotica, nor does it contain allusions to it. You don't think he's going to change what he writes based on intangible feedback on a story that is unrelated to the issue, surely?

Your comments about SI problems are on the mark IMO. Your comments about underage erotica are, as far as I can tell, basically ad hominem and should not inform anyone considering viewing this. The way you stick them together makes the overall accuracy of your comment difficult to judge.
