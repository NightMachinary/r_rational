cannot downvote this enough. starts surreptitiously enough, but it quickly devolves into the sort of self-indulgent fantasy that si fics are so well known for (the author can do no wrong, is loved by all (excepting the antagonists), etc.). like, seriously, read this shit:

#+begin_quote
  I had seconds in which to think, to act. I didn't even bother trying to think things through. I just acted.

  The narrow street, with tall brick buildings on either side. No pavement to speak of. A woman, in her thirties, dragging a kid, maybe ten, by the arm. The look of desperation mirrored on each face. Running toward me. Behind them, two cars, accelerating now to catch up with them. They'd been playing cat and mouse, letting their prospective victims think they might have a chance, but now a new factor had joined the game.

  Me.

haha what

there's a fuckton of this kind of thing; the author puts themselves into every fucking problem in canon, and /always/ wins. there is occasionally a fumbled attempt at "conflict" but inevitably it is resolved in the si's decisive favour and he is proven to be the incredible genius we all know he is. christ.

(ahem.)

i don't like doing this, and i think that a work's quality (poor though it is) should be judged on the merits of the author. /however/, in this case i think the pleasure derived from the marginal extra reader pales far in comparison to the effect it has on enabling and encouraging the author. so. /please do not promote anything by ack/. roughly 50% of his works are creepy-ass sexual fantasies about underage girls -- often masquerading as standard wormfic. here's the sb mod report from one of his recent stories:

"I AM NOT FUCKING AMUSED.

More to come later, as the moderation staff is currently investigating a thread. Do not make a new thread. Do not repost the story. There will be consequences for this bullshit. You deserve all of it.

And I am incredibly disappointed in everyone who didn't report this fucking bullshit when it started being posted. God damn.

[OPPRESSION INTENSIFIES AGAIN]

Alright, let's make some things perfectly clear:

First: We do not want underage sexual content on this site. This means that the following are not at all acceptable: A) Minors bringing each other to orgasm with their powers. On screen. B) Descriptions of teenagers straddling each others naked bodies. C) Teenagers describing, in way too much detail, how good the sex they just had was. D) Things along those lines. Don't try to game this. You know who you are. Second: If you see underage sexual content on the site, fucking report it. Jesus christ. Even if you don't want to report it, then tell the writer that they are breaking the rules and should edit if they do not want to be punished. Third: Do not assume that because one post is OKed everything else in the story was. This thing is five hundred thousand words long, and this judgement is only based on four chapters of that. This is now a recurring problem, as it has happened in Panacea Quest and this story. Fourth: To all CrW writers, please improve your prose. The moderation staff has to read a lot of your work in the process of doing our job, and if doing so is annoying, confusing, tedious, or actively painful before we get to the creepy sex stuff, we are going to be rather more annoyed than we were otherwise. (As hard as that may seem) Five: There are romances that are not underage girls in lesbian relationships or underage harems. This seems to be a common misconception among rule-breakers, so in the name of getting some variety in our reports, I feel this part of the PSA is necessary. Also, we give a bit more leeway to characters that aren't minors.

Ack, for your offenses in this thread you will be getting a vacation for a month. This is the second time you have been told that 16 year olds are minors as far as SB is concerned, and I dearly hope that it sticks. This thread will not be re-opened, do not create a new one."

he's written some more explicite underage erotica on ao3, which i will not link for obvious reasons. suffice to say that i think this sort of behaviour should be disincentivised, because nobody's really said anything so far.
