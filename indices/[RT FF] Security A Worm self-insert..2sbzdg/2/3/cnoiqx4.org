I don't even know how to respond to that. Didn't know that about ack. Not happy about it.

But you have said nothing to convince me that this fic isn't a coherent world with a smart person maximizing their values in a realistic way (while suffering from something of a "saving people" thing). It fits rational fic in my mind better than 90% of what gets posted here.

I could argue against every single point you made, but I'm struggling to see anything but a pile of nitpicks that don't add up to an argument (and one very valid public service announcement).
