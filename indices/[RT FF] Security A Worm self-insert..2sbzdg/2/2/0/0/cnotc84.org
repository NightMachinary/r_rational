  My beef is not with ack writing underage erotica, it's with him combining it with otherwise unobjectionable works.

Just out of curiosity, do you have the same reaction to slash? If the original work had no such themes, but the author of a derivative one added them?

  I don't have any problem with giving the kind of person who would be into underage erotica a safe way to get their rocks, but it's important to recognize that sexual preferences are not formed in a vacuum.

So your argument is that someone might browse a site for general fanfiction, stumble upon underage erotica and this person is then more likely to abuse children? Do you think that confining this content to dedicated communities is an effective strategy for stopping the abuse? I have a suspicion that it would be about as effective at preventing child abuse as current American justice system is at rehabilitating criminals (counterproductive, that is) and for much the same reasons. Socialization of people to the norms of a suitable culture is an effective way to influence a person's behaviour, but for this to happen they need to feel welcome in the community. What kind of norms do you think people in places dedicated to underage erotica are likely to adopt if you force them out of every other community? I don't think that respecting the rules, opinions or preferences of people who constantly spit on them, consider them criminals even when they have done nothing to warrant it, and so on, will be a core values of theirs.
