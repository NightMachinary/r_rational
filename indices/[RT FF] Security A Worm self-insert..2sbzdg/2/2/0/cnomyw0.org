okay. i feel like i've misrepresented my position, and for that i apologize. to make it more clear:

#+begin_quote
  -- often masquerading as standard wormfic.
#+end_quote

this, more than anything else, is my problem with ack (it was probably a bad idea to isolate it to one clause). i don't have any problem with giving the kind of person who would be into underage erotica a safe way to get their rocks off (ei, a way that does not involve any actual children). i would not have any issue with ack if he were a less godawful author and occasionally also posted stuff to underage erotica dot com, or w/e. but it's important to recognize that sexual preferences are not formed in a vacuum; frequent exposure often creates attraction. my beef is not with ack writing underage erotica, it's with him combining it with otherwise unobjectionable works.
