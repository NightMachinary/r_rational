Thank you for sharing your opinion.

Still, I have to disagree with attacking the work just because it contains underage erotica. I think that the constant effort to drive out the controversial content from every single community is harmful. The whole issue is so damn politically charged that everyone must play the game of social signalling to show how tough on child abusers the are. This stupid monkey circus is really annoying and counterproductive to minimising the abuse of actual real-life children. I urge you to reconsider you stance on this subject.
