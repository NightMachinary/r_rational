Downvoting because the SI protagonist wastes time fixing individual worm character's problems instead of immediately communicating the relevant information he has to people and organizations like Dragon or Cauldron that can act on it. The worm main characters are known to us personally, so it is easier to care about them, but in the face of all humanities extinction (across multiple possible worlds), I think watching out for them should take a lower priority. In terms of saving the world Dinah, Panacea, and Taylor are the most immediately critical and the rest can be ignored. The only reason to hesitate telling Cauldron is because of their tendency to screw up things when they can't path to victory it.

The crap the protagonist tries pulling with Cauldron probably wouldn't actually work. In order to beat Contessa's path to victory and force her to do stuff, he would need to precommit across all possible futures to only reveal his information if his demands where met.

  cannot downvote this enough. starts surreptitiously enough, but it quickly devolves into the sort of self-indulgent fantasy that si fics are so well known for (the author can do no wrong, is loved by all (excepting the antagonists), etc.).

Yeah, the protagonist is trying to manipulate Cauldron, and Piggot and Dragon and Armsmaster and Tattletale and Eidolon and Coil without any kind of parahuman ability. He should have no way of succeeding at this without author fiat. Any of them should be able to force the details out of him one way or another. He shouldn't have even bothered trying if he is supposed to be a smart SI but he does and he succeeds and its annoying.
