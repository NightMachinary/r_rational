/In Security!/ until mike acts she doesn't have a path that even knows he exists, which is exactly the answer to why he kept it low key for a while.

And she can't predict Zion, and the final battle is a blind spot entirely, so she can't know skitter or panacea are important. And every other action until he contacted cauldron was canon compliant.

This discussion is starting to feel like talking to someone who is convinced there is only one way time travel could work, or only one way ai could come about, or only one way magic could function. It is not rational to close of your hypothesis space on something unknowable.

I have written several stories with very careful planning about path to victory, and depending on exactly how it works and how blind it is to certain outcomes it is just as game-able as anything. More so, because it is canon that contessa doesn't actually think but relies on the path to a fault.

As canon is written the is ambiguity, and sure, there is a fanfiction anthropic principle in effect in that certain PTV variants are used simply because otherwise you can't have a story, but the one you just linked would prevent almost every fanfiction written in the wormverse.
