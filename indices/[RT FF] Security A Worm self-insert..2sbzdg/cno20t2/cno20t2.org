This fic is about a non-powered fanfic author entering the Wormverse with prior knowledge of the story.

It essentially revolves around the idea of what a relatively smart person would do knowing the big dangers coming, but being completely personally vulnerable in a world of capes.

The best thing about it is (IMO) /all/ of the characters act at as real people (if not all at level one, some people still make really bad but believable decisions), they all have their own off-screen decisions happening which mess up the protagonist fairly often. The protagonist is smart but not unfairly so, and does his best to do his best.

Unfinished currently, but there is plenty there. It is slow building to conflict, so don't expect worm-style angst for a bit. Some people feel it comes off as a fix-fic but I don't get that vibe at all.
