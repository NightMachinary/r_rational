Utilitarianism /= rationality. A rational character maximizes /their own/ values. How you weight people you know (and know are good people) vs people you don't (and could be bad people) vs people who aren't alive yet is an open question.

And how much you value having a fulfilling personal life with friends is also to personal taste.

If you /knew/ a few specific people were going to get badly harmed and it cost you little to fix it, would you?
