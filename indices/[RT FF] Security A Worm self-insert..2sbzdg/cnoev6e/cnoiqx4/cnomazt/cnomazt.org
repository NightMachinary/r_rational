i didn't really make a complete argument with regards to the quality of the work, just a series of statements. they were meant to warn potential new readers, not to provide evidence for one position or another. others in this thread have made more thorough arguments than i could, but:

#+begin_quote
  But you have said nothing to convince me that this fic isn't a coherent world with a smart person maximizing their values in a realistic way
#+end_quote

the problem is not with the mc acting in an irrational manner, it's with every /other/ character doing the same. the world bends itself backwards to allow the si's bullshit to succeed. this is not what i want from rationalfic.
