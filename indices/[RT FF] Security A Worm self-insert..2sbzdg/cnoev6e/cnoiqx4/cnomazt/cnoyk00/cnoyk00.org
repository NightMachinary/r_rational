Every argument made in this thread ignores Worm canon though.

Worm is a coherent but [[#s][worm spoilers]]

In that context an outside agent who can think rationally and can convince the main characters to listen to them would probably have as much success as mike has had. Especially because he knows their [[#s][worm spoilers]].

That all said, so far in the story his own bad decisions have lead to him nearly dying at least three times (probably more like six or seven), only to be saved by factors outside his control, and this is /despite/ having the personal protection of Fortuna, which is now probably no longer the case. And many of those bad decisions, it seems to me, are because he doesn't really take his mortality seriously... as he has somehow arrived in a fictional world. I would be as messed up.

That hardly seems like a plot armored mary sue.
