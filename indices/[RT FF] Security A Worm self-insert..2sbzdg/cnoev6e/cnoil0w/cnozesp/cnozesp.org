Who did he best in "one on one combat"? Because I can't remember it happening even once.

He set a trap SS exploiting her weakness, and still probably deserved to die doing it but got reasonably lucky... And that is it. Skitter beat a few capes, with him nearby.

Do you mean Bakuda? Are you surprised a security guard defeated an untrained twenty year old women who has no physical powers and probably weighs a third of what he does?
