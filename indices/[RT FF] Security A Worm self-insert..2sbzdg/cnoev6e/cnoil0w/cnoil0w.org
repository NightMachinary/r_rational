Hmm, didn't know the creepy stuff. I have enjoyed bits and pieces of this fic, but yeah... it does suffer from self insertion problems. The main character has actually beaten several capes in one on one combat, which is just so appallingly stupid given he's meant to be an overweight security guard.
