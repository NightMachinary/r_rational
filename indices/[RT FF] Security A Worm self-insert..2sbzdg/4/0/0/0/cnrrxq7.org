He is a fanfiction writer who had spent a lot of time planning his own stories and had recently gone on a worm wiki binge, then wrote down every little thing he remembered about the story as soon as he arrived, and stored that information for future reference.

He explicitly describes exactly how he has that much knowledge, and then regularly fails to remember things that would have helped him.

/Anyone/ who read worm would know enough to manipulate or at least predict the major characters, particularly if they had spent time /writing them/.

I can accept complaints his plans go rather smoothly or he gets lucky in physical conflicts (although I personally disagree) but complaining about his knowledge is just silly. He doesn't have perfect knowledge, even though he probably should.
