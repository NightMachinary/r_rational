Just because the text explains what a Gary Stu does, doesn't mean he isn't one. Also, please enlighten me on when his damn-near encyclopedic knowledge of Worm is explained.

Also, HJPEV, while probably way more talented and intelligent than any eleven year old has the right to be, has clear cut reasoning as to why he's a gamebreaker. He's extensively studied things like Bayesian statistics and the human condition. Like extensively to the point where he has trouble making real, human social connections. And while HJPEV was able to brute-think his way through a lot of his issues, there will still noticeable consequences and near misses.

Mike....read Worm. That's it. There's never any indication that he did ANYTHING beyond that. He didn't sit at home compiling his own Worm wiki for fun. He didn't read Worm every six months. He just read it. And, upon being teleported into the Wormverse, is able to subsequently craft all of these complicated plans with minimal thinking. Like seriously, this story took place over like 10 days. In that time, he's implemented several different plans seamlessly, out thought Tattletale (and the author is conveniently nerfing her power it seems, there's no way he should've been able to keep so much secret from her considering the regular contact he has and the constant dancing around the subject matter he does) Coil, Contessa (all of Cauldron really), the PRT, The Protectorate, The Triumvarate....Need I go on?

And note. Yes. He does have the deep and dirty on all of them, and the canon timeline. I understand this. But that doesn't justify how all of his plans run so seamlessly, despite all of the balls in the air, although we can probably just accept the author's Contessa-shaped handwave for most of this fic anyway :\

EDIT: TL;DR: Reading Worm doesn't make you the Thinker level tactician you'd need to be for all of this guy's planning.
