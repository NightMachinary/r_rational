While it did keep me entertained, I feel like things are too easy for this guy. I mean, yes, he does risk his life quite a few times, but when i say too easy, I'm not saying he's not in danger. I'm saying too easy as in his plans always work out. As far as we can tell, Security isn't anything too special. He's an overweight, 40-something year old security guard, who's only professions have been working security and driving a taxi. And a few self defense techniques he picked up. I feel as if it shouldn't be this neat and easy for him to accomplish so many of his goals.

Yes, I understand that being in the start of the Wormverse, with full knowledge of its canon, is a lot of power, especially when it comes to gamebreakers like Contessa, Coil and Dinah. But there's still a noticeable lack of things not going his way. So far, none of his plans have really gone astray and, if they have, they haven't stayed that way. and get fixed relatively quickly.

All I'm saying is, if you really wanted the realistic portrayal of an over the hill average Joe protagonist, you can't have him go in, and mess with every big player in the game, and have each plan he makes as a result WORK. Just doesn't seem possible. In addition, Worm is stupidly long. Like 1.7 million words long. I can't, realistically, see Security maintaining each and every bit of obscure knowledge from it. Sure, the big plot devices, such as Zion's true nature, Cauldron's shenanigans, etc. But it really gets me when he gets down to the personal level with practically each individual he comes in contact with. Every single little nuance of Worm, he seems to remember. With perfect accuracy. That's just unfeasible. Even down to "Oh, you felt this and that, at this time, and I know how that feels." People aren't that trustworthy. You can't walk up to the DHS, and spill a bunch of classified information to the POTUS and assume you're now going to be taken seriously, as an asset. More than likely, you're going to be brought in and questioned. In fact, beyond Contessa's PtV, there's no reason for Cauldron to not pull a Dinah Alcott on him. He seems to supercede Contessa's PtV, as he has information on enemies immune to it, such as Scion, Eidolon and the Endbringers.

In short, he's a Gary Stu in every way that counts. Sure, he's fat and old. But he's got a girlfriend (FwB?) is being taken seriously by an organization that makes the DHS look like puppies and each and every plan he utilizes while surrounded by Masters and Strangers works out. Every one of them.
