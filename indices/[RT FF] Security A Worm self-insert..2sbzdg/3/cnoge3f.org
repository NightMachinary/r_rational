I feel that for someone who wants to feel nice and have some leisure reading, you could do worse. I only read chapter 2 so far but I felt pretty nice. Others have warned about writing quality and the intelligence of characters, so for those looking for that I'm going to assume this will disappoint you.

TLDR; Chapter 2 might be worth it for the feels, otherwise, refer to other comments.
