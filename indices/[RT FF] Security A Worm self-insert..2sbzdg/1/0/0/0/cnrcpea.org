Again, adding rationality to an irrational world (something the shards are not prepared for) can have big consequences.

The whole point of worm is that everyone is on the cusp of making good decisions, and are nudged away from that by space magic.

Amy getting better with respite and therapy... Exactly what would happen. She was in a vicious cycle. Prior get better really quick when they leave those situations and their needs are meet (speaking from a position of personal expertise).

Eidolon actually getting help (not immediately) is absolutely in character because he is not a bad person. He is /influenced/ by his shard, it doesn't control him. He explicitly /wants to do good/.

And they still don't trust Mike, they are still being influenced against him.

Worm is a world on a knife edge, and mike provides the gentle nudge into the right direction. That is perfectly believable psychology.

The only thing I'm not sure about is Riley, which i admit did seem easy, but I don't think that has fully played out yet, and to be honest she is so young and conflicted it isn't horrendously farfetched either. Again, I have seen similar changes in kids taken out of abusive homes.

Note he didn't try to redeem burnscar, or jack slash, or coil, it even Sophia. He can only help people if they are on the borderline.
