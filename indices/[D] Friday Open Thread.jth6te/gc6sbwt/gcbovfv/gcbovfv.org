I always espouse the 'hacker' ethos towards problem solving that I've found helps with this. A lot of the time people give up because they grasp some amount of the technical breadth an issue has, and the effort needed to acquire the domain knowledge to properly solve the problem. Train yourself to see it as a personal challenge.

From the hacker point of view though, not even within the domain of computer science, the issue is tackled in a (to the individual solving the problem) logical progression of hypothesis, test, fail, repeat until a workable solution is found. It's by no means the best solution, proper solution, or efficient solution, but it does work.

Keep hacking away at the components of a system and eventually an even greater understanding of a given domain is acquired compared to a traditional approach as it's not all wrote memorization and basic troubleshooting to draw on, but a complex understanding of the problem.

This approach does have the disadvantage of making the understanding of a problem very individualistic. With logical shortcuts relevant only the hacker understands, [[https://xkcd.com/1513/][much to the dismay of anyone attempting to work with them.]] Still I prefer it as it grants a greater personal understanding, as well as the feeling of accomplishment with regards to figuring out how something works.

Also, don't apply this learning method to anything involving high tension springs, electricity, or delta-p.
