Unless I'm missing the blindingly obvious, biologists of good standing hold a moratorium on genetically modifying already lethal virus, causing pain and suffering for little expected value for all creatures, modifying human's in the womb, and cloning humans. With those last two perhaps not being a hard rule.

Or am I missing something else that they refuse to touch? I'm not on the up and up with bio-medical research except where it intersects with cybernetics and BCI.
