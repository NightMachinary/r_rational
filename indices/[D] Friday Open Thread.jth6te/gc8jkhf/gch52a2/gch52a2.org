I mean, that's not all that unrealistic. Replace plutonium with hydrogen deuterium produced by electrolysis, uranium extracted from a decent amount of soil, and a laser refinement process, and one reasonably large kitchen could probably fit the setup.

(So yes, we're all doomed)

If it helps, any actual explosion would be swiftly detected by essentially every nation on earth by reading the myriad "geological" sensors scattered around the planet to sense just such incidents - so no testing etc possible really.

I would think your character bringing this to the authorities would probably result in not much surprise (once you've gone suitably high up the chain of command), and a mild invitation into the conspiracy of the ugly truth - that it's all a giant matchbox, dreading tech maturing too much while simultaneously hoping for perfect surveillance to save us all. You might be able to tell a pretty good story of the main character being very paranoid of being watched or hunted down, but then realizing there's not really much of anything behind the curtain to stop this stuff - and maybe choosing to try to save the world somehow on his own.

Also, if it helps, nuke-proof architecture appears to be doable, affordable, and probably not even that gaudy - it's just not quite the traditional American Way, so you don't see it too often. They make large buildings with it though already - the AT&T building in NYC I believe (?) - could be misremembering. If attacks ever arose again as a big concern, I reckon you'd see the world springing the few billion to retrofit and shift to new architectures.
