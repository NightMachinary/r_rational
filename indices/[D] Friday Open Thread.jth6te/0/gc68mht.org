In case other folks miss Elemental Arena as much as I do, here's an update from the author from the comments on the latest chapter on RoyalRoad. Posted 16 days ago:

  Mini update:

  I wanted to let everyone know I have finished editing chapters 1 through 16 for book one and the new versions have been updated. I am currently editing chapter 17.

  I had to take a break for a couple months mainly due to issues with my personal schedule rather than anything book related. But I am back working again as of a couple weeks ago. In fact, taking a break has been helpful since I'm now looking at the material with fresh eyes and able to see the material more objectively.

  As for the first sixteen edited chapters, I have reduced the book count from 670 to 640 pages. Most authors I have talked with say they do a 10% cut during editing, and so far I am close to doing similar. Cutting extraneous words, redundant sentences, pointless musings, etc. really adds up. Additionally, I combined/cut a few scenes that were repetitive. My hope is that this will vastly improve the reading experience, plus it has been a really good learning experience for me as a writer.

  As for plot changes, nothing major has changed and the stats have been left untouched. But a few of the character arcs have been tweaked, most notably in my scaling back of the romantic tension between Nathan and Maya in the early scenes. I have long felt my execution was totally off in that area, and I am a lot more satisfied with things evolving more naturally now. Iliya's name has been changed to Illiana as well. I have received a lot of feedback from readers, and in places where I agreed, I have made some adjustments.

  So for now, I am finishing up the editing for the last nine chapters and then I will switch back to working on book two. Thanks!
