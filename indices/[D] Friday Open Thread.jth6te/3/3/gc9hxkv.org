I blame rupert murdoch and his right wing media empire. You see this viewpoint espoused in his stuff all the time. "Research shows that x is ineffective at solving y? Clearly that means y is unsolvable." - Literally what they say about everything they talk about if they can fit it into that format even if they have to lie. You spend all day being talked at like that without a dissenting opinion even being mentioned (because it's tv or radio) of course it'll seep into your mindset.
