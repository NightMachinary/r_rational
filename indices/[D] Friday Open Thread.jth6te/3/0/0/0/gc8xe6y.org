just some asthma type stuff. I didn't get that sick really, but then I developed a secondary pneumonia and a nasty cough. Took months clear out. The lung damage is generally managed with an inhaler. it is a change of pace but manageable. probably will heal up in a year or two. My spouse got it to, she was sicker than me, but she didn't have any appearance of long term side effects. We got it from a friend through his kid looks like. I managed to hide away enough not to spread it to other members of the household. Given the range of presentations I think I got through fine.
