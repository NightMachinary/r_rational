Thanks for the update. I've been checking that story a couple times a week since the hiatus, hoping for more. It's a little disheartening knowing it's still going to be a while, but I'm glad he can maintain momentum.

I've also been waiting a long time on solomans crucible, but the author is working on a whole different story right now. So who knows how long that will be?
