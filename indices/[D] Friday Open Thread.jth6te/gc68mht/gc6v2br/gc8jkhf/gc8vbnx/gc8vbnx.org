The accepted answer for specialist knowledge is: start conspiracy to avoid anyone looking for it like the human physicists in "three worlds collide". If its so obvious that it'll be discovered again very soon by peers, you'll have to coordinate a moratorium, like real human biologists have done on certain forms of research.

If its so obvious and easy to do by laypeople that it'll be all over the internet next week, take up as much credit as you can and emergency buy a prepper bunker in the Rocky Mountains.
