If the cat was out of the bag that hard - I once read an ooold SciFi story about kitchen table atomic bombs made of lead - that'd be it for humanity. Fin. No encore.

The timescale to even refurbish/restart the basically finished [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA][NERVA]] rocket program, not to mention starting viable colonies is just too long.

Kitchentable super AIDS or kitchentable lead atomic bombs give us a span measured in years.
