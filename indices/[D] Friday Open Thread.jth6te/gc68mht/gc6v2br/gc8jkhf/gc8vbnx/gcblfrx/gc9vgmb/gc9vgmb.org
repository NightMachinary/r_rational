If the cat was out of the bag that hard, would we be able to justify nuclear-powered space flight? Easy energy for Luna/Mars/Europa/belt colonization? Generation ships within a generation? More mundanely, less concern for the radioactive byproducts and nuclear risks associated with otherwise-clean nuclear power (even avoiding the mining and refining processes)?

So, while panic-buying your bunker, maybe you need to consider which world-class leader(s) you would try to onboard somehow with your clearly crank cockamamie scheme.
