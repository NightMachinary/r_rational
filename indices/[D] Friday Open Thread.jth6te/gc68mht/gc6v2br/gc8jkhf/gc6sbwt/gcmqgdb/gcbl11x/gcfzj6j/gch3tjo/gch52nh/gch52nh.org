Kind of?

If your opponent has a knife already, then I guess having a knife of your own is a good idea.

But if your opponent is unarmed, then most people I've talked to agree that getting a knife for yourself lowers your own chances of survival.

(Similar logic on guns btw. Obviously I would not bring a long stick to a gun fight. But I would also prefer not being in a gun fight in the first place.)
