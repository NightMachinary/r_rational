Bat or golf club over a knife, every time. It has a reach advantage, it has a leverage advantage, and it's more likely to produce a fight-ending injury like a concussion or broken bone, rather than a random laceration, which is medically pressing but not instantly debilitating. By the time knife injuries matter, the fight will have already devolved into a wrestling match for control over the knife, regardless of who started with it. This still applies if you're not trained in martial arts - some sort of long stick is more likely to convert frantic flailing into a fight-ending injury than a knife is.

This was actually a recurring topic back when I studied martial arts. Across a bunch of disparate arts, everyone ranks options something like talking it out, calling for help / running away, martial arts knowledge, a stick, pepper spray, a heavy object, a gun, untrained fists, a knife. There's wiggle room, but the primacy of avoiding a fight and admonishment that knife fights are a bad idea were recurring themes.
