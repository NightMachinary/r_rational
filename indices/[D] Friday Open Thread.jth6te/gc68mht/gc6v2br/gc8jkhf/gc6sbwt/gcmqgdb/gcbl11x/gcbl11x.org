What's the rational choice?

An intruder, with similar height/weight/physique to yourself, has broken into your home. You and him are in a windowless room; you with a wall behind you and him with a door (the only entrance/exit to the room) behind him. You don't have your phone with you. Your family/roommates/whoever are gone for the day and your neighbors are on vacation, so yelling/screaming is pointless and the intruder also knows this. The intruder has a knife, of the kitchen knife variety, and he does not have good intentions. An altercation is inevitable and unavoidable. For a weapon, you have the option of a knife similar to his or a bat/golf-club. You can only choose one. Which is the rational choice?
