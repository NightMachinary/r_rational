A bit late to the Friday party now, so I might try again later this week (if I remember) and hope for better traffic.

But I thought it might be worthwhile to create a document summarizing a bunch of knowledge that could be useful for writing a character with the power of Aerokinesis. Here is the outline that I've thought up so far:

- Gases -- State of Matter (ideal gas law, etc.)
- Atmosphere -- Composition; Pressure & Temperature; Layers
- Wind -- Wind Speed (definitions and measurement); Wind Power.
- Weather -- Other aspects of.
- Biology -- Respiration
- Geomorphology -- Aeolian processes and features.

What do you guys think? Any constructive thoughts and feedback, or emotionally-withering criticism?

P.S.: Is there a way to do sub-bullets in Reddit? I don't see anything about it in the formatting help.
