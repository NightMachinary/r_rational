It is some cultural thing. I have seen some explinations of dubious quality about it.

I used to do a bit of powerlifting and strongman and stuff. Not evenough to even think avour competition or whatever. Max half hour a day right. Withour fail whenever I moved anything in the wild people would would be both shocked and awed.

I was just starting to get back into it before covid, I got some lung scarring from it and it fucked me up. I definitely Have gound the appeal of just veging and not doing stuff. So i am fighting to get momentum back.

Still, I am working on it and I should be able to pick up big furnitre again pretty soon.
