Agreed about physical activity; I could basically /watch/ my grandparents whither away after they gave up bicycling. I often find myself thinking how long they might've lived yet if we'd had electronic bicycles back then, to extend their active period.

That said I've given up on plenty of instruments, sports, and games because I recognized that to have fun with them, I'd need to be way better. Why spend my brief free time on those, when there are other sports and games without that requirement?
