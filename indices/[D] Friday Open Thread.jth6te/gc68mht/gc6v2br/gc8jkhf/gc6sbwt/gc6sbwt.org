Is anyone else upset/disappointed by how many people give up on things by default? Where people encounter a challenge, find it difficult or fail, then take away from it that they can't do it in the future?

The biggest one's that bother me are "physical" such vacations with walking or stairs and when people are moving houses. They realize that these things have gotten harder for them over time and just decide by default that they need to avoid them in the future. I understand if they think it's not worth the hassle or the time, but these are usually things where a small amount of preparation would make them easy and would improve your life. I can't imagine not being able to walk several flights of stairs, several miles, or move my stuff out of a house and not trying to regain those abilities if it's reasonable. It especially grates on my nerves since there are people older and physically disadvantaged that can do all of these things. Maybe it's because I'm relatively young but if something is difficult but necessary or enjoyable I try to figure out how to make it easier, not how to avoid it entirely. Or especially if I think something would be enjoyable if it wasn't so difficult. Those ones bother me the most, but I also encounter this with people who are "just bad at things" like "computers" even when they have to use them all the time. I've learned it doesn't help to voice this opinion, even with friends and family, since it makes them feel judged and I won't change their minds.
