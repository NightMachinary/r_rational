Ah, that makes sense. Yeah, the chance your opponent can disarm you and do far more damage with a knife or gun vs if neither of you had one would probably make "neither" a better call. Though I guess that's if the fight is a foregone conclusion. If you can scare your opponent into running away with either, that's a bit better for your odds. Hmm
