The main character's outlook on life is very distorted, but watching him struggle with that is interesting. The author does a fantastic job writing a main character who is simultaneously pitiful and inspiring, repulsive and admirable. The darker moments of the book make it more beautiful, by contrast.

I understand why you'd think it sounds depressing, but in my view it's more like a book that's about depression. Partly, this means it is looking for ways to overcome depression from within the inside. That's almost the opposite of depressing, it could be argued. However, to be fair, the author is not writing a simple book. In order to explore the topic of depression faithfully, Donaldson offers partial explanations and justifications for Thomas' worldview and mistakes. These justifications are simultaneously very compelling, when you view the world from Thomas' point of view, and very inadequate, when you view them in an impartial way. Sometimes, however, they are adequate. Thomas has a strong degree of hardness and pragmatism, that in itself seems beneficial. He struggles with self-hatred, and sometimes this makes him do terrible things while other times it makes him act very altruistically, out of self-sacrificing love for how much better other people are than himself. Even that logic comes across as twisted, but it's somewhat admirable despite it. Because his negative qualities and positive qualities and the connections between them are prominently displayed, overall, while the book makes it clear that Thomas is deeply flawed, it uses an extraordinarily empathetic approach to convey that message. It is a book about emotionally learning how to avoid making terrible mistakes due to maladaptive reasoning processes or detrimental mind-body-behavior feedback loops. I find it valuable for that reason.

As a work of fantasy, it doesn't do particularly well on most traditional benchmarks. What's interesting isn't the plot or the worldbuilding, but what goes on inside Thomas' head. Even after taking that excuse into account, it gets rather repetitive, which is why I haven't gone back to the series yet.

Have you ever watched Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog? That inspired a few similar feelings in me. Dr. Horrible is easy to care about, he has a heart and some admirable personality traits, but he's also selfish and an idiot and self-sabotaging. The stories aren't exactly the same of course, but both their main characters inspire a mixed reaction in me that's both intellectually and emotionally interesting to process.
