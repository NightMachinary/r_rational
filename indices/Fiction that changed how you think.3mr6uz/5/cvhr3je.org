Terry Pratchett's stuff probably shaped my viewpoint more than any other author. Probably partly because I read him at the right time when I was still fairly young, but also partly because he often says a lot of fairly profound-sounding stuff (a larger portion of than average of which is not just sounding profound but is legitimate insight).
