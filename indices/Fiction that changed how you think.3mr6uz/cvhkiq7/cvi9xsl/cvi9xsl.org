1: Can you elaborate on how Twitter has changed the way you think?

2: I just glanced through the Wikipedia page for The Mars Trilogy. I couldn't help but notice the first line of the description of Maya Toitovna, "An emotional woman who is at the center of a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers..."

So like, does this book have well written female characters?
