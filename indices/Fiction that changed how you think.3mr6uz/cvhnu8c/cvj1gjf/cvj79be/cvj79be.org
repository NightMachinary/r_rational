Note the first chapter is devoted to a spoiler warning and a mimetic hazard warning. I found some of the implications of the ideas pretty existentially disturbing. If you are the sort of person that can be bothered by Roko's Basilisk, I would exercise caution about reading this story.

If you like serial escalation, humanity fuck yeah, giant mech battles, and over-complicated plotting, this is the story for you. Be advised that the story is about one or two chapter short of being finished, and that it has been like that for several years now (with a few minor updates each year). The author is in fact rewriting the story from scratch, so it is unlikely he will get to actually finishing it for some time.

Has a good and unique setting, explores lots of interesting metaphysical themes like the implications of precognition. The sequels by the original author are also good. The prequels by his son are low-mediocre pulpy science fiction, and thus trash in comparison to the original. I actually found the sequels by his son to be tolerable, but they are still no comparison with the original.
