Dune. Dune is a fantastic book for teaching you to think in layers. The feint within a feint within a feint is real. The sequels for Dune teach you that just because a writer is clever, it doesn't mean he knows what he is talking about or will come to accurate conclusions.

MoR, obviously, because it lead me to LessWrong.

Pratchett's works are fantastic because in making fun of the way everything works they make you consider why they work like they do and what would work better. I have read them all.

Surprisingly, Artemis Fowl. I was 11, and looking back it did not change the way I thought for the better. Instead it made me an insufferable little swat for a few years there. Though I suppose we all look back at our childhood like that.

Puella Magi Adfligo Systema is a quest on SV. It gave practical experience of testing reality and observing the results. Also learned how to write fight scenes partially from that, which I am glad for.

Ian Irvine's View From the Mirror books. They were the first stories I read where good did not gloriously triumph over evil, and instead was an ever marching parade of taking shit in order to just barely squeak an ambiguous victory, all overturned because you did not pay attention to one particular detail. Not very good lessons from that one either. I learned cynicism. Took a while to get over. Also forced me to consider that the evil invading aliens might be alright people in a shit situation with bad PR.
