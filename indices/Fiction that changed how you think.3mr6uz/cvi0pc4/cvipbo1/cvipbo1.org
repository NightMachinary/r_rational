  Dune. Dune is a fantastic book for teaching you to think in layers. The feint within a feint within a feint is real. The sequels for Dune teach you that just because a writer is clever, it doesn't mean he knows what he is talking about or will come to accurate conclusions.

I think /God-Emperor of Dune/ and /Dune Messiah/ are the books in which Herbert cuts to the damn chase and makes his point. He damn well knows what he's talking about.
