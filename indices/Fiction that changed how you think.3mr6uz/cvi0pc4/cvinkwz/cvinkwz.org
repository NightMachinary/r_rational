  Dune is a fantastic book for teaching you to think in layers.

I think it was sometime around reading Dune (I can't remember exactly when, so I am not 100% it was entirely a result of reading DUne), the I picked up the habit of trying to internalize and understand competing points of view/worldviews simultaneously. I was a Young Earth Creationist at the time, but I tried to seriously imagine how an "evolutionist" (I would have used that terminology at the time) would view things (as opposed to just assuming their viewpoint was because they had rejected God, like >90% of the other people at my church would think). The decisive point was when my "atheist" mode of thinking started outputting more moral answers than my Christian mode of thinking (which was used some mix of moral realism and Divine command theory).

But yeah, it was around the time that I read Dune in High School that I started developing the tendency to try to hold multiple contradictory viewpoints/worldviews simultaneously.

I think God Emperor of Dune might have contributed to my thoughts on omniscience and free will would interact.
