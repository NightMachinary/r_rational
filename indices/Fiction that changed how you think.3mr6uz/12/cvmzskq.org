The short story collection /Where Do We Go From Here?/, edited by Isaac Asimov, is directly responsible for sparking a lot of my interest in physics. Highlights (in terms of which stories had the most influence on 8th-grade-me, not necessarily in terms of which present-me now thinks are the best) include

- "And he built a crooked house" -- Robert Heinlein
- "The big bounce" -- Walter Tevis
- "Surface tension" -- James Blish
- "Omnilingual" -- H. Beam Piper

Each entry in the collection was chosen "for its scientific content as well as its merit as a story," and Asimov writes an afterward for each story teasing some of the science content a bit further and providing some topics for further engagement.
