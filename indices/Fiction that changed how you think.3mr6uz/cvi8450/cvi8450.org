Seconding those who cited /Blindsight/ and the works of Terry Pratchett. Also /Ghost in the Shell/. I would also cite /Revolutionary Girl Utena/ (and, to some extent, its spiritual-semi-predecessor /The Vision of Escaflowne/).

Recently, /Inside Out/, though it's caused my love-hate relationship with the Rationalist community to waver further.
