Dune. I had already read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, but Dune was the first that really caused me to think deeply and philosophically about its meaning and theme for an extended period of time. I was in High School at the time, and after finishing Dune, it occurred to me that the sensations I felt was what my English teachers wanted me to feel about the novels we read in class.

Harry's speech to Dumbledore in the humanism chapter of HPMOR made me consider morality independent of an omnipotent god which (with the help of the Sequence) eventually lead away from my YEC Fundamenalist Southern Baptist beliefs.

In the aftermath of abandoning my religious beliefs, Shinji and the Warhammer 40k made me take humanism seriously. The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover made me question the upper limits of what is possible in my newfound materialistic understanding of reality.
