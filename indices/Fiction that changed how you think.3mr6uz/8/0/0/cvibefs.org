Okay, so Maya Toitovna is not the most stable of characters. In some ways she uses sex and relationships as a way to achieve and maintain and demonstrate power, which is very apparent because Frank Chalmers is the head of the American side of the mission and John Boone is the First Man On Mars. She worked her way up through Roskosmos by playing the game of beds.

As a counter to this negative stereotype of Russia, you have the rounded, stable Nadia Cherneshevsky, who does not define herself through her relationships, and who is a role model to many of the nisei (the second-generation Martians). Nadia's relationships are healthy ones. She's also an engineer, not a politician.

Maya eventually pairs with the psychologist, Michel, who is himself psychologically unstable. This is a healthier relationship, but Maya still has problems with major swings in her mood trends.

Ann Clayborne is the chief aerologist, and while she has relationship issues that we are told ultimately stem from being abused by a male relative when she was young, she does have a stable family life with Simon. The Reds idolize her, but (I haven't read the books in a while) I don't think she likes their attention and elevation of her to a figurehead. She loves Mars, not the life that grows upon it.

There are other well-written women in The Mars Trilogy. Jackie's relationship with Zoe is between a narcissist and her independent daughter, across a generational gap that expresses itself politically. Phyllis' rise and fall from power is itself well-written, but Phyllis is not a POV character. The mystic biologist Hiroko is not a POV character, but we see her through the eyes of Nirgal, Sax, Nadia, Michel and in some ways the non-POV character Coyote. Zoe, Nadia, and Maya are POV characters.

If it sounds like there are a lot of troubled female characters, there are. There are also a lot of troubled male characters. I think the least-troubled person among the First Hundred is Sax, and he's described by his students as a colony of a hundred enhanced lab rats puppeting a human body.

...

I don't think KSR has any people do things because they are male or because they are female, with the exception of Hiroko. Maya isn't emotional because she's a woman, but rather because her brain and past relationships were fucked by Russian social hierarchy. Nadia builds to build, not because she's a mother or some such. Coyote doesn't wander because he's male, but because there's no real place for him on Mars. Hiroko becomes the mother goddess figure of Mars because, well, /shikata ga nai/, but also because she's carrying out her philosophy through the farm team and her family. Characters do things because the characters have reasons, and if those reasons are sexist it's because of in-book sexism rather than blatant authorial sexism.

Does this answer your questions?

For Twitter: I started following people in my industry. And they led me to other people in my industry, and from there to some really truly astoundingly mind-opening people and feeds, like Erin Kissane, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Wesley Lowery, The Marshall Project, and Melody Kramer. It's served to open my eyes to a lot of stuff that I miss in my social circles, and consider political things that I didn't know about.
