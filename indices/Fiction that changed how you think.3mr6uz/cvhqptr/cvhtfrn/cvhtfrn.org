  Peter Watts (Blindsight et al, Starfish et al, The Things) is remarkably good at portraying the inner experience of alien psychologies. I badly want that skill, and I'm preparing for an attempt for RaNoWriMo.

*Yes.* It gets so bad that sometimes I feel like a story I've written is trash because it doesn't feel enough like Blindsight, before I realize, wait, this isn't even in the same genre, /not every book has to sound like Blindsight./

On a related note, I think that one of the most difficult things for me as a writer is accepting that different authors have different styles, and though I write differently than many of my favorite authors that does not mean that my style is automatically inferior.
