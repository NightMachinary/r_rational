Kill la Kill has changed my perspective of resolve and sacrifice. Chills were a regular occurrence. That was my second fiction after quitting antidepressants, and it had a big impact on me emotionally.

Hourou Musuko makes me want to be all that I want to be. The third fiction after antidepressants, and I definitely cried. I like crying.

Peter Watts (Blindsight et al, Starfish et al, The Things) is remarkably good at portraying the inner experience of alien psychologies. I badly want that skill, and I'm preparing for an attempt for RaNoWriMo. I doubt I'll get close in the first draft, but that's more for laying down the plot and setting.

Ghost in the Shell would have been nice to see years and years ago, but I saw it only two weeks ago. I was too familiar with the themes and ideas involved for it to have a real impact on me, but if I had seen it as a child, I think it would have been very formative. Viewing it now only yielded appreciation for the animation, art, and music. I only pieced together the actual plot after a second viewing, as it's very sparse on detailed exposition.

My own story idea is suffering from a number of unfortunate coincidences; the main character is very similar to Ghost in the Shell's Kusanagi Motoko, and she even has a similar hairstyle as Motoko in ARISE. All this, and I had made those details concrete weeks before I watched GitS. Writing is suffering.
