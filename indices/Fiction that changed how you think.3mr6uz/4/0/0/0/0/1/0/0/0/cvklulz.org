  In this particular case not letting him loose on the unsuspecting populace, unless there is some existential threat or something similarly dire. It's not so much about preventing him from fucking with people, as making sure the end justifies the means.

In their mind, it was.

The problem is that it's like trying to keep a dangerous AI in the box...if its jailors are just as dangerous.

The Dunyain don't care about people. The only reason they'd keep him locked up is that it was beneficial to their project*, when it wasn't they sent him out.

It's actually a mystery how crazy he is or how right he is. And it's part of what's driving the suspense of the later series. He's crazy for a Dunyain..but the Dunyain have been wrong. After all, Kellhus was certain that magic and god weren't things...until he stepped outside.

But if you were interested in the rational bits I suppose it would be pretty strange.
