  Why would that be the message?

Yeah, I don't really know who I was addressing with my whinging. Some imaginary straw man most likely. It just sometimes feels like the aim is not to say "let's be careful while we do this awesome thing" and more of "no, transhumanism is pernicious and evil and we should pre-emptively lobotomise anyone who does not disapprove of it absolutely". I haven't figured out why every strongly cautionary statement about transhumanism feels like a personal attack against me just yet. Affect heuristic and my tribal affiliation are probably big parts of it.

tl;dr Transhumanism mind-kills me, disregard previous post.

In this particular case not letting him loose on the unsuspecting populace, unless there is some existential threat or something similarly dire. It's not so much about preventing him from fucking with people, as making sure the end justifies the means.
