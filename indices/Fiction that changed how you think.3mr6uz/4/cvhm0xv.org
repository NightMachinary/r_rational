The Prince of Nothing trilogy is my equivalent to Blindsight. Had a lot of cool stuff about cognitive biases and consciousness in it (though it could get a bit didactic), with the same sort of strain of eliminativism I believe I've heard is in Blindsight, capped with some horrifying scenes with those ideas taken to their conclusion. All against a well-designed fantasy backdrop (based on the Crusades)playing off tropes in the genre.

It got me more into the issue of consciousness and how we think, lead me to Kahneman and others and their views (albeit far less extreme) about thinking, which definitely had an impact on how I think about the mind.
