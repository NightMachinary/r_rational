  My own story idea is suffering from a number of unfortunate coincidences; the main character is very similar to Ghost in the Shell's Kusanagi Motoko, and she even has a similar hairstyle as Motoko in ARISE. All this, and I had made those details concrete weeks before I watched GitS. Writing is suffering.
