  How does this [intensify] your love-hate relationship with "the rationalist community"? Because the psychologists and neuroscientists criticized a movie Eliezer said was Very Rationalist?

No. Psychologists and neuroscientists loved the movie (which isn't surprising, since it was based on the most up-to-date psychological research available, which makes it pretty unique given that most of Hollywood still thinks psychologists cite Sigmund Freud with a straight face), and I didn't know Eliezer had reacted at all.

I knew the film would go over well with a lot of the rationalist community, but I also predicted (accurately) that I'd see a number of self-proclaimed capital-R Rationalists complaining that the movie should have had a character called "Reason" whose job it was to give the emotions a talking-to and stop them from causing Riley to make suboptimal decisions.

Even in the replies to Eliezer's facebook post, I saw some people linking to that godawful Vox article.
