  I think God-Emperor of Dune and Dune Messiah are the books in which Herbert cuts to the damn chase and makes his point. He damn well knows what he's talking about.

He tried to write a character many times smarter than him with powers he could not comprehend: it was a losing proposition no matter how skilled he is. Also, the race consciousness? Being a smart precog of his power and failing that hard? It smacked of him losing because the author wanted him to lose.

I mean, I think we can agree that the thing where humanity seeks genetic mingling through jihad was a bit strange.

It's been a while since I read it or I'd make more specific points.
