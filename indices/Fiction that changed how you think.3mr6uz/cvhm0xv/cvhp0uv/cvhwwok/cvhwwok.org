Yeah, the author has a dark take on things. It can get bad.

But the peaks are relatively few, so it does tend to a similar level of darkness to Game of Thrones (but perhaps a bit worse because he writes /weird/ people, people who are difficult to empathize with because they're actual religious fanatics, not snarky agnostics like Tyrion).

Really, it's hard to tell if it's for someone. Some can look past those bits or really enjoy it, others can't and I'm not surprised.

Ironically, the rational protagonist makes it worse. He's...a bit /too/ rational. Hard to like.
