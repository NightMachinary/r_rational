I know myself rather well. This is partly because I spend so much time considering where I stand on things. I have a very broad range of interests and can discuss most topics at least on a surface level. I am constantly examining myself and everything around me to validate what I know. This makes me a very, very stubborn person, and I can think of no single work of literature that impacted me dramatically by it's content.

But I still have an answer. Wildbow's /Worm/.

/Worm/ was a good read, but the content of the story wasn't world changing to me. How the story was written, the process of serial web fiction - *THAT* got my attention. I determined long, long ago that if I ever tried to write a novel, it would never happen, because I couldn't write that much all at once with no input, and didn't want to impose on family to read what was certainly going to be terrible crap, at least at first.

Wildbow's /Worm/ was the first serial fiction I ever encountered. Somehow. I had always read dead tree books before, nothing online. The idea of writing little pieces of a book, piece by piece, hit me like a Louisville Slugger. Two years later, I can barely look at that first story and not cringe, for so many reasons. But it was good enough that people liked it, and gave me feedback that I desperately needed.

In short, /Worm/ showed me a way *I* could write. At this point I'm far over a million words written since I found /Worm/, and about to start editing six novels for publication (the oldest ones are gonna be painful!)
