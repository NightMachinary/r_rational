Good counter to the spidey senses (I assume there is some kind of usage limit to stop you essentially blurring in place), but I'm not sure it stops the chain precog. Worm gets away with it by having precog be not 100% reliable (so building a long chain is asking for failure) and having precogs interfere. Option 2 is out if everyone has teleportation ("I want to go to the Eiffel tower", say 10000 people simultaneously, followed by a squelch and then metallic groans as the tower collapses under the weight of partially crushed corpses...) but option 1 is definitely open - have the teleport fizzle 1 in 1000 times, or give a false reading of danger, and you can't munchkin so easily with minimal story impact.
