You should try Tor's free samples comprising [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/][chapter 1 & 2]], [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/13/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapter-3/][chapter 3]], [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/14/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapter-4/][chapter 4]] from the first book /before/ buying, because Palmer writes in a unusual style that is fairly polarizing. I love the series but some people hate the style of writing she employs.
