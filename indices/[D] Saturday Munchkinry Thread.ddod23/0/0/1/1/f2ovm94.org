Fantastic worldbuilding. A convincing extrapolation of a not-too-weird future Earth, when Humanity only really inhabits Earth, the Moon, and tenuously Mars. A convincing unreliable narrator who is providentially positioned to tell the story. It's a book with dozens ofnideas, any three of which would be a good scifi or fantasy novel on its own. It's got weird politics, weird economics, weird gender stuff, weird religion stuff, weirder religion stuff, weird tech stuff, meta-narrative stuff, weird point of view changes, and yet it's purposely straightforward and understandable.

As tumblr user birdblogwhichisforbirds summarized the series: "In a world in which murder, religion and gender are illegal, one man spends his life doing those things to other people."
