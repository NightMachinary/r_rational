You've made prison and confinement obsolete, as well as other forms of restricted access. So I'd travel, and I'd probably do some things that would be considered "graffiti" or "vandalism", and I'd clean my gutters. I'd spend more time with family and friends.

If teleportation is a new ability, I'd push for a society and government structure similar to that depicted in Ada Palmer's /Terra Ignota/, absent any better ideas.
