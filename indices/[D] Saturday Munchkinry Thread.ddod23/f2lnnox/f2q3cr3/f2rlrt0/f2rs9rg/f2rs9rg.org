You only need 1 and 3 to make an intermediate cache. Somewhere that could potentially rough it for a night or two in a sleeping bag. It'd be more important to just grab as much as you can before the larger stores and supermarkets get emptied out by unscrupulous people. After that critical period, you could chain teleport into the wilderness to try to find a suitable permanent site.
