  Hikers, spelunkers, and other people with adventurous hobbies will have a tremendous advantage here, due to likely having come across some place no one will think of checking in that timeframe.

Is the site you're looking for secure, pleasant, /and/ unknown? I do a good amount of hiking (and a bit of caving) and am having trouble thinking of a place that meets all three criteria. But I've only gone substantially off-trail (& not to some publicized waterfall or cave or w/e) a few dozen times in my life so maybe more ardent bushbashers could come up with something viable.
