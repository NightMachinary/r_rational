It's true that if you live in a small enough town you'd probably be insulated from the worst of the chaos, but the problem is all it takes is one bad actor to sabotage a community, and people desperate for food will eventually find you through maps or aerial scouting. Then, as soon as word spreads, you're going to have continual problems with your crops and other things being stolen.

Plus for me I live in the suburbs of a metropolitan area which would definitely end up getting ransacked in the long run, so relocation would be necessary.
