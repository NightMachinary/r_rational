You can freeze time.

You are also frozen, apart from your brain.

Don't worry it doesn't age, but still works.

Extra: while time is frozen you can enter a 5m3 empty room. You don't age, breathe, get hungry, etc. You can bring what you're carrying into this room, if you don't carry it then it stays there

Extra 2: the same except the power controller is nice enough to allow computers to function, except bans programming (otherwise the rational choice would probably be to go in and make general AI in the infinite time you have).

What do you do with frozen time where you can't move? How can you exploit this?
