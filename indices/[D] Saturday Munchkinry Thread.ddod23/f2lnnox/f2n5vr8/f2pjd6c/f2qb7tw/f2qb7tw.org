Spend a subjective few days working out how best to use this, to start with.

Depending on how long it takes to freeze/unfreeze, I'd suggest immediately going to your computer, setting it up to flash pages from textbooks up as quickly as you can freeze/unfreeze, and spending your frozen time reading each page, internalising it, and memorising it. Once you've learned the state of modern science as fast as you can view the pages it's written on, the next step would probably be to advance mathematics, theoretical physics, and other fields that can be progressed with infinite thinking time.

The extras make it a lot easier to accomplish this, and open up progress in other fields that can't be advanced through thought alone. I don't think banning programming is enough to stop you trying to make GAI, since you can at least work on the theory and plan the architecture.

Extra 1 means you can become the perfect safecracker of any safe you can carry, simply by trying every combination. Extra 2 is much more valuable, as you can spend your infinite time brute-forcing encryption.
