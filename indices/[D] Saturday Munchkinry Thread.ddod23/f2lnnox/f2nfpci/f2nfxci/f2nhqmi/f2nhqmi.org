Can't get near at ground level as it's packed too densely, so you go vertical. Nothing to grab? No problem, you just need to be falling for 60s (didn't see this limitation before) so you can teleport out, so you jump in at (terminal velocity is 54m/s so...) about 3000m and you get to see the event!
