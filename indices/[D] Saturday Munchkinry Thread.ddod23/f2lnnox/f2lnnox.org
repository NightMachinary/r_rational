You can teleport anywhere on Earth, but so can everyone else. No telefragging, and you get a mild sense of whether or not the specific location you're trying to get to is safe (ie no cars rushing at you, not suspended in the air, nonlethal temperatures, other things that you would notice after being in that location for less than a second).

I'll probably ask about general consequences for Worldbuilding Wednesday, but for now, what would you personally do with it?

Edit with more info:

I'm going for near maximum user-friendliness, so here's what I have in mind. You think “Paris”, and you mean “Paris, Texas”, then you'll go to Paris, Texas. If you've been there before and have even a subconscious memory of the place, it'll probably be the place of the memory unless you specifically mean anywhere else. If you've never been there, it'll go off what you know about it and go to the most mentally significant place you have any sort of knowledge of. If all you know is the name, you'll be at some vaguely central location, as determined by the zeitgeist.

It takes about a second of thinking to trigger the teleport, and then it's instant. So roughly 60 times a minute is your max rate.

I think with today's technology there'd be no way to detect a teleport before it happens, besides maybe seeing if it looks like someone is focusing on something. It's probably possible but would take some focused research for a number of years.

Making a room “full” would work. You couldn't just have dangling beads, but filling it with wooden blocks would be fine. You'd need to stop people from teleporting to wherever those blocks came from, though.

Clothes and surface level worn things are automatically taken with, as well as a breadbox worth of other stuff. No selectively teleporting parts of stuff. Two people trying to teleport to the same place can teleport a third, unconscious person, but otherwise you can't teleport humans. Teleporting is granted at around ~13 years old.
