I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen in the next few hours, but a bunch of nukes blowing up seems like a reasonable benchmark to prepare for.

Get supplies, hide them in anonymous locations around the globe. Get a hazmat suit, epidemology is going to undergo a paradigm change. Try to minimize the time you spend on a part of the globe that is plausible to blow up.

Make sure you have internet access somewhere, so you can keep up with the metagame.

Can animals teleport? The ecosystem is going to be overhauled and globalized, and what diversity remains is based on temperature, available plants, weather and the like.

Can astronauts teleport? Perhaps anywhere within their region of equal gravitational potential?
