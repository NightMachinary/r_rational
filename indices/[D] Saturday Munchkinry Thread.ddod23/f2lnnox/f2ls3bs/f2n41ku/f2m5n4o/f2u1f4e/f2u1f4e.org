Me, I would make a list and spend each weekend at a separate location with my partner. What would it do to the economy though is particularly interesting. It would take lots of trends that have already been happening with globalization and make them so much more severe:

- Most land becomes less valuable. Clifford D. Simak explored some of this in /City,/ even if I don't quite agree with his conclusions. But basically, buying land in a relatively stable poor country makes a lot of sense. Living in an apartment makes no sense whatsoever. Rather than Simak's deurbanization; I would expect hyper-commercialization and economic specialization of some cities. Shipping becomes bigger, faster, etc.
- Labor becomes truly mobile, and moving operations becomes frictionless. Every person can now apply to every job. HR becomes mind-boggling difficult. Manufacturing moves near raw materials or target markets.\\
  At the same time, white collar companies can now make headquarters in international waters.
- Instantaneous shipping for small items means that the transportation field is revolutionized. Basically, everyone can buy ripe/ in-season produce all the time. It also means that you can have big specialist stores that have incredibly high foot traffic if people know they exist.
- Non-specialized labor becomes much harder to find, except for couriers, and even then it's a limited field. Retail centralizes, most big box stores close.\\
- Things get especially weird when you consider what happens with immigration. Any area with conflict basically depopulates in a month or two as industrialized countries face enormous waves of migrants. Do nations dissolve, ignore borders, or become voluntary ethnostates?
- Security becomes much, much more difficult, because you can assume that bad actors have physical access all the time.
- Catching drug-dealers becomes harder than ever. At the same time, drugs become even more concentrated for transport.
- Bulk data transports become a viable substitution for some entertainment uses of the internet. In less industrialized countries we see a lot of this.
- Ability to speak different languages becomes far more valuable. Right now, a store in America needs at most two languages to reach 99% of customers. In teleport universe, megastores can reach 40% of customers by having employees that speak the top 10 languages. The more languages a manager has, the larger a department they can manage, the more people they can serve.
