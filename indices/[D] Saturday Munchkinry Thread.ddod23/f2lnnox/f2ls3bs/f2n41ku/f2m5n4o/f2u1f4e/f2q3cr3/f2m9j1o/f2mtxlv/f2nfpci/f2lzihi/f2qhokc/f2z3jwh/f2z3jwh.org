I might get a houseboat. I've always kind of liked the idea, it provides some security, and most of the downsides no longer apply. Just drift off to sea.

I'd also get some better, smaller camping gear. A bread box is pretty small, considering, but I'd ideally want the ability to carry a "home" with me because it gives you vastly more options for places to stay.

I'd finally try skydiving - no parachute or plane needed anymore. (I assume from how user-friendly this sounds that momentum isn't conserved.)

Obviously I'd go in holiday more, that goes without saying, but ... ironically this would probably mean most tourist destinations are /much/ more crowded, so finding obscure-but-lovely destinations becomes a big commodity. Hopefully there are apps to warn you when places are "trending" and thus crowded.

Speaking of tourism: obviously area denial tech is a big deal in general, but specifically for tourism, it's essential to preserve a lot of landmarks and historical items. Yet obviously it's hard to apply the "no empty space" idea to a lot of tourist sites. If they station snipers (or automated turrets) to shoot anyone climbing on the Pyramids with rubber bullets, is that enough for people to sense it's unsafe? For museums, I'm picturing a grid of dangerously powerful lasers, powerful enough to burn but dim enough that they aren't visible in air and so don't interfere with people viewing from a distance.

Question: If I get a group of friends together, can we carry larger objects other than "unconscious human"? If so, I'd probably volunteer to help lift rockets as high as possible, that sort of thing. I'm guessing there's a good chance you can't, unfortunately, since there's no limit on surface area: volume ratio and so any volume could be lifted with enough people and big enough handles. It'd be cool though.
