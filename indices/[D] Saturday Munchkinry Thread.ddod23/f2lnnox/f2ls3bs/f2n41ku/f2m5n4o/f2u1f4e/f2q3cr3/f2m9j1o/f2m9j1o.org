Assuming that society doesn't entirely collapse, after a period of brief destabilization information about this power, as well as strategic advice on how to best use it, will be widespread. So in the long term, I'm going to rely on the collective wisdom of society to discover and explore possibilities. The time for individual reasoning about this change is in the short term, during the transition period.

I could steal what has not yet been secured, but I don't want to have to live on the run or risk my life, and the danger sense you describe won't alert me to a camera or some kind of reactive defense system.

I could collect goods, perhaps such as rare plants or animals which are moderately difficult to collect (dissuading the buyers from simply getting them themselves), which command a high price in a small market (making it profitable with relatively little work, but not so scalable as to quickly attract the attention of a large firm with a lot of optimization power).

The best move might be to try to get in on the ground floor of the information infrastructure of this new world; I'm already a software engineer, so I could conceivably convince some panicked investors that GrubHub for the teleportation age that I ought to get a lot of their money.

For prosocial munchkinry, I could try to support and publicize cheap, scalable centers of some kind of support, for example a massive emergency room hospital that benefits from economies of scale that anyone can visit.
