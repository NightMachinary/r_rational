I think the mechanism needs more definition than that. How good an idea of where I'm going is necessary? If I just think "paris" where exactly will I end up? Is the teleport instant? Is there a cooldown where I can't teleport again for a certain amount of time? Are there any ways to either detect where someone teleported to or prevent people from teleporting from/to an area (other than something like a bunch of automatic machine guns)? What can be carried when teleporting?
