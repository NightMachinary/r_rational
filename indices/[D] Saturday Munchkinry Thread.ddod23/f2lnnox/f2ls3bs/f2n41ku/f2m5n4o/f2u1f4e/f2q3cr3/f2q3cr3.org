Assuming this is a new world event and our reaction to it, the most important thing would probably be making a secret hideyhole/cache to store personal property and sleep safely, assuming that people can't just intend to "teleport to X's/the nearest hideyhole" and defeat any attempt at security through obscurity that way.

Given that civilization as we know it is almost certainly going to collapse due to billions of impovershed third world humans teleporting to the first rich city they imagine, raiding them for food and luxuries, then returning to their villages on a daily basis, it will be imperative to stockpile as much as I can and cache my supplies somewhere. For this, my best bet is to make a temporary cache somewhere I have already personally been and can be reasonably confident no one will stumble across in the next day or so before I can commit to searching and preparing a more obscure site in the wilderness.

Hikers, spelunkers, and other people with adventurous hobbies will have a tremendous advantage here, due to likely having come across some place no one will think of checking in that timeframe. Alternatively, if relative momentum is nullified through teleportation, then locating a tropical/temperate archipelago on a map, teleporting there, then teleporting repeatedly through the air to scout for an even more secluded island is a possibility. With a personal site secured, the next objective is to gather as many short-and long-term supplies as possible in breadbox size increments. Potable water, food, gardening and hand tools, containers, clothing, medicine, seeds, and so on.

At the same time, finding as many trusted individuals as I can, namely family, close friends and colleagues, to coordinate for future survival efforts. This would be mainly instructing them how to best begin their own caches and a communal message spot where we could leave messages for later cooperation.

With the threat of raiders being able to take anything visibly noticeable from the air, it would be ideal to hold out with procured supplies for around a month before attempting to start any sort of community; enough for immediately available food stocks to run out or spoil and the immediate chaos to die down, likely due to mass starvation by everyone who didn't prepare in those first critical hours. From there, paths to survival can branch in a lot of ways.
