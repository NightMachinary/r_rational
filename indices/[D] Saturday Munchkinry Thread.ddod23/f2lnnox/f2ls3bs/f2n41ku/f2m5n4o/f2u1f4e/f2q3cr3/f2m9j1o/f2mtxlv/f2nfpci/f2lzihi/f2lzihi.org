  what would you personally do with it?
#+end_quote

Well I wouldn't have a car anymore, so that'd be nice. Really transport both on the local and the regional/national/international scale is just a pain in the ass.

Probably I'd move somewhere with a lower cost of living and generally just live a more full and efficient life, visiting my family more, wasting less time on commuting, taking more of an interest in conventions or concerts or the like that travel currently makes impractical or at the least inconvenient. I'd also do some more world travel/tourism, with that initial hurdle and housing out of the way. I'd make a point to still traverse minor distances on foot, if only to keep moderately in-shape rather than becoming a blob person.

I certainly wouldn't become a superhero or anything, wouldn't really try that hard to try and exploit it for wealth or power or any of that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] munchkinry. That shit's risky and dangerous and someone more capable and daring than I is probably already picking up all the low-hanging fruit. I might take a look at the job market and try out the teleporting courier lifestyle depending on hours/pay compared to my current job, since surely there'll be huge demand for such work.

There are of course broader implications for the universality of this power: safety, infrastructure, whole sectors of the market disrupted by changes in transportation, etc. We'll leave that aside and assumed it's handled to the point where I'm not living in a post-apocalypse, though.
