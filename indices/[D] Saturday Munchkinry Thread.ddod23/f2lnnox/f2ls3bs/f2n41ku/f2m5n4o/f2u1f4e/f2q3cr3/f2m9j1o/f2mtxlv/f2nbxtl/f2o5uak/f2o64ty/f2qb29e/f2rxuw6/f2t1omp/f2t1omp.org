If the magic system's designer is already benevolent, you can say "Anyone can intuitively add information to the public pool of information that can be used by anyone to target teleports.", sort of how Google works. This would allow you to teleport to "Whereever I'm needed right now.", but people might be lying. If you restrict it to true information, that's its own can of information from nowhere. If you restrict it to information the publisher thinks is true, people might be tricked into publishing traps, but perhaps that's fair or nonobvious enough that the designer didn't think of it.
