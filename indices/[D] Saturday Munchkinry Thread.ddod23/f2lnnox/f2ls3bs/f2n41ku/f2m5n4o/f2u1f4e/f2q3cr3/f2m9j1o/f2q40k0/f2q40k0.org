  Assuming that society doesn't entirely collapse
#+end_quote

unfortunately, this is a pretty optimistic assumption. Imagine how many people who live in abject poverty right now, who if given the opportunity to effortlessly take a loaf of bread would do so. Now imagine how many hundreds of millions of people all around the world are living in those conditions, now with the ability to instantly teleport to cities of wealth beyond their imagining and take whatever they can carry with them.

To call what would immediately ensue "food riots" would be the understatement of a lifetime, spreading from the most famous cities like NYC, Beijing, and other country capitals, outwards to smaller towns. Those first few days would likely see the collapse of societal infrastructure in its entirety under the flow of billions of economic migrants that literally cannot be stopped.
