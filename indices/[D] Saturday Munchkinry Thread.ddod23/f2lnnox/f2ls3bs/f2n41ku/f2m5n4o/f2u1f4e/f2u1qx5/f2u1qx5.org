I doubt that drugs would become more concentrated, or that drug trafficking would even be strictly necessary, because the stash can stay in the same place while the dealer just goes back and forth to sell small amounts whenever. If they want to sell the whole lot, they just tell them where it is.

In the long term I'd expect a lot of borders to dissolve.
