Seems like a reasonable worst case scenario. Probably would be most likely to happen accidentally, but still.

I'm going to say animals can't, and astronauts can, but still only to anywhere on Earth, so no return trips. I kinda doubt that disease spread would significantly change because of how connected the world already is, but I could be wrong.
