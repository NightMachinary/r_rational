In addition to the fun of everyone having teleportation, you've also given everyone spidey senses (constantly think about teleporting 1mm ahead and your danger sense will be active).

I suspect that danger sense would also be munchkinable into a precog (using chains of if it will be dangerous then I will push this button, making this area dangerous, which past me is looking to teleport into, and will thus press his button instead, etc). Pain in the arse to set up, especially with the <1 sec limit, but doable. I think Asmiov had a story about a chemical beginning with T that would dissolve 3 seconds before water was added, it did a similar thing.
