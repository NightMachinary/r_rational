Well, you've just become an excellent way to track moles in your organisation, depending on how the power works. Say you had a mole from coil, and you checked how they were related to their PRT superior. The superior would view the relation as one of coworkers, while the mole would view it as one of an authority they must be cautious of the attention of. It really depends on how subtle the colours you detect are - you can presumably compare with a known mole at some point to make sure. Even pointing out suspicious people would help, as false positives can be somewhat easily dismissed (although it won't make you many friends, as paranoia increases in your presence).

The power also makes you adept at looking through disguises, if you know the original person well. If someone had a massively different connection to you and everyone else than they did yesterday, you know something's up. Same thing with noticing extremely similar connections in and out of costume. Basically allows you to build up shifting profiles of people over time. Use a notebook (preferably in a code of some sort) to record these relations for ease of MS detection. The code should probably be complex enough to change on a person to person basis so hostiles can't just transcribe certain words or phrases from one entry to another. It's not fool proof, but it helps.

If someone who you would really like to get in contact with appears in a public event, look for strong connections between them and their aids, their aids and crowd members, etc. You probably already know this by the power's name, but if you can form a chain of people who owe favours to one another, you could ask them (in costume) to tell this friend to tell their friend (and so on) until they can get you in contact with the person you want. Excellent networking opportunity.

A more villainous opportunity is blackmail. Find someone in a sexual relationship outside of their partner, and threaten them ominously over the phone to reveal the information unless they transfer money to you or something. Only has to work for a few people, though you should make sure to this as anonymously as possible. Over burner phone at least. There are other relations you can use to blackmail people like this, but cheating seems like the most obvious choice.

Detect corporate espionage if you see someone employed under multiple competing companies separately. Doesn't have to justifiable under law, as your employer just has to fire the offender.

Severely damage relations by pretending your power is revealing things it isn't - an example of this would be telling someone that you can tell X is a mole when they are actually innocent, or telling y their partner is cheating on them when they aren't. Divide an organisation by infiltration in this way, but it's a risky move. Probably better to reveal existing ties.

Detect abuse between people. Detect if someone is stalking someone. Maybe your power can't be used in court, but it can be used to encourage closer investigation by detectives and police.

Do some detective work to find out drug dealers. You can see and remember a dealer's connection with their clients, and cross-reference that colour with random times you see it in the street. Example: A deals to B. You note the connecting colour. The next day, you see two unrelated people walk by each other on the street. C and D are connected by the same colour, so you know one of them is a dealer. Investigate to gather actual evidence, and you're doing well.

That's some things to think about, I suppose. Hope it helped!
