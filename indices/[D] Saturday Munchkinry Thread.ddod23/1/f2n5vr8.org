Can see connections between people, with different colours representing the type of connection (business partner, friend, lover, enemy) and intensity showing depth of that connection, both of which can be different at each end (so you might see a connection in canon worm between Missy and Dean that shows they're coworkers, friends, and Missy's end shows more).

The two ends have to be visible to the parahuman, so no tracking people across the world by their family connections, and it doesn't get in the way of normal vision.
