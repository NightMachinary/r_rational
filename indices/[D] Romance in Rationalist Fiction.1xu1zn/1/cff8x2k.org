I'd find this really difficult to pull off without falling into the "rationalists are emotionless and cold" thing.

Of course, it doesn't help that I'm an aromantic asexual (nothing to do with my rational-fic fandom, since it far pre-dates that!) and most of my stories, where they have romance, have some nasty twist or other in it.

Noteworthy examples of love in rationalist fiction:

- HPMOR's Lucius Malfoy's love for his son. Familial rather than romantic, but very, very touching.
- Luminosity's Bella and Edward. Not interesting, to me, for romance's sake alone. Interesting because of the worldbuildy predestiny soulmates thing, which turned out to be minorly exploitable [[#s][later in the story]]
- Got more examples? Feel free to add them in a reply! I can't think of any at the moment.
