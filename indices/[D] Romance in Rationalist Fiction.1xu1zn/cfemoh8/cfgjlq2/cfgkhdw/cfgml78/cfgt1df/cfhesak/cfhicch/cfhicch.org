Ah, I think I may have found the miscommunication. I'm not suggesting that this is how people normally behave, or that this is how they should behave. I'm saying that concepts from game theory are applicable to dating, and that this might constitute a rationalist story. You're absolutely right that there's a risk of it coming off as socially clueless, specifically because that's not how people deal with romance in the real world.

But I still think it has the possibility to be fun to watch.

(I'd also argue that it doesn't matter if everyone knows their exact expected utility from any given pairing - the game theory part still comes into play when some people aren't going to get their first choice, which means that there are different solutions to the question of who should pair with who, and incentives for people to alter their strategy in order to arrive at a good outcome for themselves.)
