That was just an example of dating as a game, with a whole bunch of really obvious assumptions that are apparent when you think about it for five seconds, but which hopefully got the point across, which is that a lot of the same concepts translate over.

The game is not an effective way to get good outcomes - it's not about that. It's about how people can strategically make complex decisions. Each person is trying to maximize their own happiness, but that doesn't mean that the result is maximized happiness for everyone depending on what strategies are chosen.

So since you seem to want it, let's imagine a more complex version of the game. There's a high school full of teenagers that are distributed along the bell curve as far as things like attractiveness, intelligence, sexuality, etc. (Spectrum would probably be better than bell curve when it comes to sexuality, but you take my point.) Now, unlike how actual teenagers deal with the question of love, all these teenagers are rational actors. They have differing utility functions and differing abilities (the game is asymmetric) but most of them want a partner, with some of them wanting more than that. And from there, the game begins until it either reaches an equilibrium (which may not be the best equilibrium possible) or time runs out.

And obviously there are lot of assumptions still in place there.
