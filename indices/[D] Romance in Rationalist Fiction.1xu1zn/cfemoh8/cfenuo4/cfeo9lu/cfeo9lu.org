Alright, well since conflict drives story, what's a romantic problem that can't be easily solved by clear communication? I imagine that if there's to be any tension in a romance in a rationalist fiction, you'd want to have a romance that's ill-fated for some reason - it conflicts with societal views, there are underlying ideological disagreements, biological attraction doesn't match up with stated values?

I pitched a story idea to a friend awhile back about a modern retelling of Tarzan (in the public domain!) with some steampunk/biopunk trappings, and I realized that it's got the capability to be a good romance, specifically because the inherent tensions internal to Jane that can't be solved by simply sitting down and talking things over.
