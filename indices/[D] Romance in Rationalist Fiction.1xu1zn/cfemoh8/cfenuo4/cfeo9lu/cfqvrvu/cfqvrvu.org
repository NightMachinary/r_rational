Easy. Step one : Laverne - being moderately bright, but a shining exemplar of the rationalist virtues of Luminosity, Conscientiousness and Honesty is very good at monogamy. Over 130 years she marries trice, all three unions ending in the untimely demise and subsequent freezing of her spouse. (Traffic, War, lab accident) Step two: The march of progress finally achieves the grail of resurrection of the frozen. Step Three: Drama.
