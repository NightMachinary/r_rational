  Luminosity's Bella and Edward
#+end_quote

As far as I can tell, Alicorn doesn't think highly of Bella and Edward's relationship in Luminosity. They have to be together /because that's the story/, but there really isn't that much chemistry, either portrayed or intended.

[[http://edgeofyourseat.dreamwidth.org/2121.html][The other Bells]] (who seem to have rather more fun) at some point describe Luminosity!Bella as using Edward as "a glorified thought radio" (and thereby, likely, a firewalled container for moral agency, relieving her of the Bad Feelings she'd get from /choosing/ to invade other people's minds herself.) Not too romantic, that.
