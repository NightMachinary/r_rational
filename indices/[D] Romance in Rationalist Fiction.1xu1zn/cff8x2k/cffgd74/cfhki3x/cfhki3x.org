I found the unromantic nature rather fitting, since there's little I find romantic about the source material's creepy-possessive stalking and forcing-people-to-love-each-other-however-unsuitable-they-may-be magic, but I do agree with that description of Edward as a utensil. (I still find that more palatable than the tool he is in the originals, though.) ;)
