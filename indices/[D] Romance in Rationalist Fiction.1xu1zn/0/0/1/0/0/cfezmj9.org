I wish I had something constructive to add to this scenario, but I don't.

Romance is incredibly low on my list of things I consider desirable in life, so my inner maths went along the lines of "Further progression of this scenario is inoptimal and may result in harm to one or more parties. Optimal solution is to break off contact, and pursue other avenues."

Which doesn't exactly work as a romantic development.
