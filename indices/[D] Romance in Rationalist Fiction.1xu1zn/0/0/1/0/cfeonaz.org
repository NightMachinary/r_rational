My solution was to simply build in really, /really/ significant reasons for the two characters who make the most romantic progress to fall in love, namely that one of them has a terminal disease that would get the other executed for hanging out with them, and that the second person is stuck between the most dangerous man in the world and an organization that wants him for his secrets. Either of them rapidly, completely opening up to the other basically guarantees that they would die horribly.

Of course, the relationship progresses anyway.
