Brienne and I do 1-4, I know a couple that consensually does 6 on a long-term romantic basis, and I'm not sure what you mean by 5.

However 1-4 are defining qualities of /rational romance in real life/. Fiction is about conflict, no exceptions. I suspect that a good rational romance /story/ would need some /actually good reason/ for clear communication to not occur, such as somebody being a secret agent.
