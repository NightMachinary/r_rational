I like that. Putting some more human back into rational humanism.

Rationality doesn't necessarily mean knowing your desires perfectly, although ideally you'd effectively use evidence to narrow in on it. Changing your beliefs about what you want can be emotional and would be a good internal crisis (which of course should be backed by an external one to tell a good story).

There's also the problem of zooming in on a local maximum instead of an actual ideal. Which sounds dry when I put it that way, but if the protagonist is in a happy, committed relationship with someone who closely matches their current idea of an ideal partner, and then they discover someone else who's completely different but better, well, that's rational and a stock romance plot.

Or to give that one a bit more of an edge^{*} you could have the protagonist discover someone wildly different, worse than their current partner, but close enough to suggest that someone else like them might be better. Do you break up with your current partner? Throw out monogamy? Do you date the new slightly worse person to learn about that area of potential-partners-space, or wait for an actually better one?

^{*} The edge is the part of the story you accidentally cut yourself on.
