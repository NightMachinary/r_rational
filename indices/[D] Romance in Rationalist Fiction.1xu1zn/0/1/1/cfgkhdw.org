By "game theoric dating" I meant an application of game theory towards finding a mate. If we take the most basic form of the game, two men compete with each other over a woman, and they adjust their strategies as they see what the other is doing until eventually they arrive at an equilibrium (whereupon the woman makes her choice and the "game" is over).

I've been trying to figure out a good way to fictionalize game theory in the form of competitive romance, but it seems like a lot of work for very little payoff.
