  If we take the most basic form of the game, two men compete with each other over a woman, and they adjust their strategies as they see what the other is doing until eventually they arrive at an equilibrium (whereupon the woman makes her choice and the "game" is over).

Who says two women aren't competing for a man? Who says you're not implicitly adopting social norms based on obsolete ideas about gender roles that objectify all participants? Who says this game is an effective way to good outcomes in the first place?

Hell, how are you even defining good outcomes?
