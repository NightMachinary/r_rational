So what makes probability manipulation (placebomancy) fail in the Unsongverse? The most direct answer provided by the story is more or less "when the universe stops believing you can manipulate probability".

Does the universe believe less in you when you doubt your own methods? Maybe. But the story does say that placebomancy cannot do the impossible. Unfortunately, I think this only complicates the question. Because it is unclear to me if /anything/ is impossible with sufficient probability manipulation (help I'm probably missing something obvious here), so it comes down to people, i.e. everyone watching and the placebomancer(s), believing that the intended results will come from the ritual performed.

What is scary is now that BOOJUM has seen placebomancy literally summon Sohu, they are more likely to believe in stronger placebomancy. We know that placebomancy works under properly controlled laboratory conditions. I am worried that if you taught people enough physics and closed them away in a monastery or something similar, they would be able to time travel.

Picture this: someone builds a monastery on mount Sinai or somewhere equally symbolic, allows only the strongest placebomancers inside, and keeps them carefully sequestered until they die. One day someone walks down from the monastery, and claims that they received a message from the future. Do you believe them? In our world, obviously not, but in the Unsongverse? I honestly do not know.
