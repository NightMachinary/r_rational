I get that, and I've been there (ex creative writing bachelors grad), but I meant something else. I wasn't clear; I have no reason to believe you can't "handle" a complex story. I'm looking forward to it!

What I meant is that the chapter made me feel like a "Where Taylor's powers come from" style twist might have been revealed too early. I'd like to have been misdirected! I hope that this ends up building naturally toward your final goals.
