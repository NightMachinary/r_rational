Hey, Peggy Sue's can be interesting. [[http://otherhistory.proboards.com/thread/431/shall-reap-whirlwind][And They Shall Reap the Whirlwind]] is a long, and occasionally very bizarre, Peggy Sue involving an actual historical figure whose mind gets fed to and replaced by the mind of a 21st-century historian whose career was studying that specific person. (Arthur Harris, commander in chief of the British bomber command in WW2)

The story is amusing in places because almost none of the replacement's attempts to peggy sue the shit out of everything actually work. Failures range from frustrating to horrifying, but nothing is really easy for the protagonist in spite of having been dropped into a situation where they can potentially do the most good. It's a long story, and it does kinda lose the plot from time to time, but it's a good study of how foreknowledge is not an instant-win.

Your structure as written has a lot of potential, especially if you keep the perspective centered where it is, making the interloper essentially unknowable and separate. I think you could be onto something if you plot out everything from the interloper's perspective and only show us things from the current POV.
