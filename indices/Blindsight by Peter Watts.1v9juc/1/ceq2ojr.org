I love this book, but not in a rationalist fiction way. However, this is a very good Sci-Fi and my favorite existential horror to date.

Also, --- I suspect many of us will find this amusing --- this book is an apt example of a story which could not be reduced to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/oq/savanna_poets/][savanna poetry]] without it losing all of it's impact.
