I'm still trying to articulate this point fully, but I enjoy what Practical Guide does to our (as the reader's) sense of narrative.

We know, at the end of the day, that Cat will win. The question becomes - how does she win? What does she give up? For example, in today's chapter, she gave up her literal heart.

At the same time, we know Cat's world works within narratives/stories. She "fits" her story within that of the Orphan Squire to beat the Swordsman. She "fits" her story to touch the power of the daughter-killing-her-father and therefore defeat the Duke of Violent Squalls. Today's chapter (King setting her a task) sounds like the start of a Story, but the question to the reader is: which story are we going to see?

So as the reader, we wonder: which story is the author going to "fit" this into? King setting an impossible task to get rid of a "faithless" steward (focusing on the relationship between the King and Cat, like Hercules or other [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask][Impossible Tasks]])? Group of people [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest][questing]] to save their friend (focusing on Cat's heart-loss)? Hero trying to defeat great evil (focusing on the war against Summer)?

But at the end of the day, we believe that Cat will win. Because that is the unspoken compact between author (erraticerrata) and reader. If not, /why are we reading this/?
