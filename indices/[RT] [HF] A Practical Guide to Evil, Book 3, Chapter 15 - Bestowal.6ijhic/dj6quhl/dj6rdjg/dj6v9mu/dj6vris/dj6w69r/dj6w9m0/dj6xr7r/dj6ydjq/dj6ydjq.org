  We know, at the end of the day, that Cat will win. The question becomes - how does she win? What does she give up? For example, in today's chapter, she gave up her literal heart.
#+end_quote

And her third aspect; she's sacrificed whatever it might have been.

#+begin_quote
  So as the reader, we wonder: which story is the author going to "fit" this into? King setting an impossible task to get rid of a "faithless" steward (focusing on the relationship between the King and Cat, like Hercules or other Impossible Tasks)?
#+end_quote

That's a good possibility given the attitude of the Winter King.

#+begin_quote
  Group of people questing to save their friend (focusing on Cat's heart-loss)?

  Hero trying to defeat great evil (focusing on the war against Summer)?
#+end_quote

These two are virtual certainties.

#+begin_quote
  But at the end of the day, we believe that Cat will win. Because that is the unspoken compact between author (erraticerrata) and reader. If not, why are we reading this?
#+end_quote

Yes, indeed. It seems to me that Cat always loses something when she wins. I fully expect Killian to either betray Cat or die (or both) before the end of this story.

Whatever happens it's going to continue to be more complex and nuanced than can be captured in any one sentence story plot line. I think Heiress (or should I say, the Diabolist) is going to be part of the story to the end; and she always adds an unpredictable element in my view.
