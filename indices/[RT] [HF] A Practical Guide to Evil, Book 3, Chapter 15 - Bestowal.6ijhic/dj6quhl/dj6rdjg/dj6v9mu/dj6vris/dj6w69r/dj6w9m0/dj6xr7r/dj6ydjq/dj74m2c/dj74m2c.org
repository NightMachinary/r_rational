  And her third aspect; she's sacrificed whatever it might have been.

Am I missing something - does it say so explicitly? This is the part:

#+begin_quote
  Power pulsed in my chest, spreading through my veins. I felt the third part of my soul, the missing aspect I had yet to forge, fill with something old and too large to comprehend.

  “I stand by my oath, dead thing,” I rasped. “Before my days are done /I will see you unmade/.”
#+end_quote

It doesn't sound like she's sacrificed the third aspect - just that it's affected by Winter powers. Could she lay claim to the name "Make"? (It's repeated several times - she says she'll see the King unmade; the King charges her with the making of peace.) The third aspect was also triggered by the ice entering her heart. If she gets her heart back, does she get the third aspect back?

Alternatively - Masego did mention in Book II Chapter 27 (Cut) that the name of the Squire was permanently crippled - it would fit if she never gained that third aspect, with the winter powers being the replacement.

Another speculation - the Snow Queen fable can be about a girl with a shard of ice inside her heart. Would also fit into the idea of castle building and the image of Winter that Cat sees.
