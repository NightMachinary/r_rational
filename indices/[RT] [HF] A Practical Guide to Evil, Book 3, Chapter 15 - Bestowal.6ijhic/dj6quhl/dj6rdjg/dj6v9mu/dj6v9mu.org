Wow, just... Wow.

Loved the imagery. Summer is 100 x worse than any previous challenge Catherine has faced. Archer will be a good asset but I don't know how the hell Catherine is going to overcome. (And how Heiress is going to try to fuck it up for her.)

This is an awesome set up for the rest of this book.
