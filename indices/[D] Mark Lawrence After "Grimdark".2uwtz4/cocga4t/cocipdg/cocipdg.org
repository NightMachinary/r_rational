  I want my grimdark to be realistic, not just grim for the sake of grimness.

Yep. This is a good rule of thumb for pretty much any genre: I occasionally really enjoy books of the "romance" genre because in rare circumstance they happen to also include amazing world-building and character development and plots, and also because I like reading about sex done well rather than just completely ignored in fiction.

But there has to be a balance. Laurell K. Hamilton used to do a fantastic job with that balance in her Anita Blake series (which served as the mother to all the modern supernatural series, from Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood to Dresden Files), but eventually the books were filled with so much gratuitous and needless sex that it just crowded out everything else.

I've never heard anyone call A Song of Ice and Fire "grimdark," for example, even though it's full of cynicism, darkness, grit, and lots and lots of angst-inducing tragedy. Because it's also tempered with other things: namely humor, and hope.
