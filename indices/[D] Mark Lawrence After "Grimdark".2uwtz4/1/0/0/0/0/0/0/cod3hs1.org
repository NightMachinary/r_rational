It could be the neuro-atypicality. It could also be that villains are allowed to /do stuff/ instead of just being stand-in characters for telling society how great and noble its status-quo is </yeah-I-watched-Dr.-Horrible-once>. Or because much of the standard Hollywood tropes portray [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil][people]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyAmbiguousDoctorate][like]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad][us]] as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechnologyIsEvil][evil]], so eventually we just find the villains more similar to us than the heroes.

Or maybe it's just because villains are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muOVF89VfLw][so]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9y43UTKxuA][/deliciously/]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwkPkCyQpY][/HAMMY/]], in a way only a few [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqc_27cpQ80][truly]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=u8D95OJbMKw#t=100][epic]] heroes can match.

(Personally, it's the ham. Because heroes are always supposed to support the status-quo, I just find that all the really deliciously hammy hero speeches fall /totally flat/ in their subject matter. I try to say all those lines about love and justice and so on and just end up feeling like I'm disrespecting the side of Good by mapping it onto the mockery of a social order I see around me.)
