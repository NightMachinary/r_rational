An interesting discussion on genre, which is always a slippery thing. I recall a few conversations that we've had on this subreddit about the genre "rational" or "rationalist", and I think next time we have one of those I'll be able to come in with some fresh arguments cribbed from people who have thought about genre definitions more than I have.

As for grimdark ... I like it when it's an honest look at characters, and I hate it when it's just relentlessly dumping on the world. It's a very fine line to walk, and some authors are better than walking it than others. We're not at all at peak grit, but with the flood of people following in the wake of popular authors like Martin, we get those that aren't good at regulating mood, and end up with too much darkness to satisfy. I want my grimdark to be realistic, not just grim for the sake of grimness.
