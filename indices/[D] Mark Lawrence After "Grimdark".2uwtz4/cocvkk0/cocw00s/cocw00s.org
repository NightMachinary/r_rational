Grimdark is (as stated in the author responses) sort of a weird bucket. Popular stories which are dark by fantasy standards but not really in my personal conception of grimdark include:

- */A Song of Ice and Fire/* series by George RR Martin
- The */Gentleman Bastards/* series by Scott Lynch
- The */Powdermage Trilogy/* by Brian McClellan

I would recommend all of those - they're in roughly descending order of grimdarkness. For things that are dark enough that I would more comfortably place them as grimdark, and which I don't think I would get much disagreement on:

- */The Company/* by KJ Parker
- The */Fencer/* trilogy by KJ Parker
- */The Black Company/* series by Glen Cook

I can see where people would like these, but found them oppressively gritty. I liked /The Company/ best among those, but it was pretty unrelenting in its grimness - almost so that I couldn't see the point in continuing. Mostly what you need for proper grimdark is a reaction against heroism.
