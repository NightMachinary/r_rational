I've only skimmed the other parts so far, but you're right about that entry being great. I especially enjoyed this paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  To start with, where is it written that you have to tell stories of nobility and hope? For that matter, what is nobility? Beating seven shades of shit out of a horde of opponents on the battlefield (with all the actual blood and screams and pleading tastefully edited out) and then putting on a crown? Is that noble? Blowing up an entire planet-sized space station of people who happen to have chosen - or more likely have just ended up stuck on - the opposing side to you in a galactic war? Butchering a huge intelligent reptile who was, until you disturbed it, dozing rather peacefully in a hole in the ground and not bothering anyone? What kind of hope is it, exactly, that we're selling here? The hope that we can slaughter them before they can slaughter us? The hope that our brand of faith or politics can kick the living shit out of anybody else's? The hope that I'm a bigger, tougher motherfucker with a blade or a spell than anyone else in this neck of the woods?

It does put regular sci-fi and high fantasy in a new light. Thanks for posting this.
