I have an alternate theory: stories are heroin.

The evolutionary model has positive emotions when fitness levels are high, and negative emotions when fitness levels are low, but these emotional regulation mechanisms are prone to self-manipulation, or to manipulation by outside forces. Stories are like that.

There are lots of stories that are calculated towards increasing pleasure in the reader rather than increasing fitness in the reader - we don't tell these stories to communicate beliefs and mores, but rather because it feels good to tell them, and good to hear them. And it doesn't feel good to tell and hear them because that increases fitness, but because we're taking a shortcut towards pleasure pathways that serve other purposes.

The reason that you see stories about nobility and hope is because people are imaging themselves in the role of the hero. It would cause cognitive dissonance for the hero to violate social mores, and the story would be less pleasurable if the hero failed in his task.

So the cause and effect would be reversed - we tell stories to hook into parts of the brain that have other functions, in the same way that hard drugs do. But this is just a story about how it might be, it needs science of some sort to back it up.
