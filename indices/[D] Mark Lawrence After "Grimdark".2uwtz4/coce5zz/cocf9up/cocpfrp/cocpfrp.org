  where is it written that you have to tell stories of nobility and hope
#+end_quote

If you want to be literal about it, it's written somewhere in our genome. We tell stories in order to communicate social mores and tribal beliefs: we tell of the underdogs who live by the "moral" of the story and win, and of the dominators who ignore the moral to their peril. We also, sometimes, tell tragedies, where the protagonist is the one who ignores the moral, also to their peril.

We can tell other kinds of stories than these, sure, but the stories of "nobility" (planning your actions to fit with deontological principles even when the resulting actions don't seem consequentially sound) and "hope" (believing that these "principled" actions will benefit you in the long run, even though expected evidence is telling you they're harming you) are the stories that we are driven adaptively to consume---and, so, the stories we get most rewarded for creating.
