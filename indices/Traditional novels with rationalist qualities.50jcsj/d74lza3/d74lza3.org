The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson is pretty great and from what I remember it meets the criteria. It gets /really/ into speculative politics after the first book, which may or may not appeal to you - there's a lot of time spent later in the series with the characters trying to figure out what type of government Mars should use.
