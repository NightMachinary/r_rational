The first name that came to mind for me was /Blindsight/ by Peter Watts. Although on further reflection I can't really remember much about the characters' motivations or competency or even really the /plot/.

So I'm in an odd place where it's hard for me to say whether it really satisfies the characteristics of rational fiction, but something in my 'gut' is apparently pretty damn sure that it's the kind of book that an [[/r/rational]] reader might enjoy.

I think mostly what sticks in my head from that novel is an interesting central idea about consciousness... being told through a space-exploration alien-encounter story, also with vampires.
