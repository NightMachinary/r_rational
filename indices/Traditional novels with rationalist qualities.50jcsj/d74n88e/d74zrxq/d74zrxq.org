I'll second the recommendation of /Blindsight,/ there's a lot of good problem-solving and character interaction to go with the philosophy of mind and heavy dose of sci-fi-horror.

My recommendation would be Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosiverse novels. They definitely meet the first criteria. It's usually recommended to start with /The Warrior's Apprentice/ since that's the first one that really includes the main character from this universe. And apparently Harry James Potter Evans Verres largely came from Yudkowsky wondering what would happen if Miles Vorkosigan (that main character) went to Hogwarts.
