I found fist two thirds pretty interesting, but the last third (after the 5000 years time skip) horrible. I describe it as Anthropology Porn (by analogy with Scenery Porn, etc.). The author takes us on a tour through his weird utopia where he contrived for (ethnicity equals culture equals thought) to be true (to the point that at one point there's talk that maybe individuals from one "race" wouldn't actually like to isolate themselves, but their ethnicity=culture compels them). With some selective Luddism and Cybernetics Eat Your Soul (quote: "every augmentation is an amputation") thrown in for good measure. And then after some very plot-demanded (our heroes get sidetracked on their tour but happen to arrive exactly where they headed, and then some) grand revelations it just ends.
