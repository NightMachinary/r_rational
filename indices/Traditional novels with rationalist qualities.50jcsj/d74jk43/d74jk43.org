Neal Stephenson is a good one to look into(I recommend Seveneves). Andy Weir of course (The Martian is a great movie, but the book is better). I think a lot of semi-hard sci-fi can fit into this trope. The Niven+Pournelle joint novels (Mote in God's Eye, etc), Peter F. Hamilton (Pandora's Star), Ben Bova (Mars), Frank Herbert, maaaybe Asimov and Heinlein?
