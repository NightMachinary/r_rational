I found Seveneves really terible, every couple of chapters some new weirdness would throw me out of the story. I got the point where the girl was prophesizing that her decendants would be a seprate race because races only split the don't combine and just gave up.

In a better book I would have been intrigued by a character saying something so strange, hoping that the author would do something interesting with it..but here I just didn't have the patiance or trust for that.
