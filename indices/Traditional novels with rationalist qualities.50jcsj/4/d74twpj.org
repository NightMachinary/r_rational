/Rokka no Yuusha/ is a Japanese light novel series that's very rational, with largely solvable fair play mysteries.

Brian McClellan was one of Brandon Sanderson's students, and I've heard good things about his /Powder Mage/ books, but I haven't gotten into them myself yet.

Will Wight's /Unsouled/ is generally pretty rational, with a cunning character that demonstrates a lot of lateral thinking.

My own /War of Broken Mirrors/ books are rationalish hard fantasy, with a pretty similar style to Sanderson's. My characters actually do more active exploration of the magic system and optimization than Sanderson's do, but the pace is somewhat slower, especially at the beginning of the first book, [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554][Forging Divinity]]. There's a lot more of what I think [[/r/rational]] enjoys reading in the second book (a lot of tests with multiple possible solutions and magic optimization), and my third book will have even more of that.
