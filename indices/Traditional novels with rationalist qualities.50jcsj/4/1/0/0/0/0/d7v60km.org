I ended up reading it, and really enjoying it. Also, nearly in time for [[http://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent][the second book to come out]], apparently.

Like you said, there were a few things I had a problem with, but ultimately a pretty respectable story and the first Xianxia book I've been able to read more than a chapter from. Thanks for recommending it.
