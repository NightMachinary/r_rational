I loved it, the critiques are fairly acurate..but when reading I didn't care. Really I think it's a matter of are you okay with one fairly clever guy getting a bit of absurdly good luck and working really hard to 'cheat' so he doesn't die.

It is very shonen in structure, but has a very differnt ...ethics? I really liked it but I don't think its very rationalist, just well done very high magic fantasy with a Xia feel.

But then what I want out of fantasy would probably be more to this sub reddit tastes then what most people want.
