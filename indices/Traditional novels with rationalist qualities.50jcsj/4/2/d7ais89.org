I'm just over halfway through your first book, it's definitely picking up. I had trouble staying motivated to read chapters 1-3, but read 7-11 all in one go. I think it's related to the heavy exposition early on, and it's easier to dump it when at least one viewpoint character is a newbie, rather than having a full cast of intelligent, experienced badasses. It was so worth it though.
