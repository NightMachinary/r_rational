Yeah, I completely agree with your assessment. In future series, I plan to have someone who isn't already an experienced character to help the audience learn along with the characters more smoothly.

I'm glad you're enjoying it more now - I think most people tend to like it after around chapter 7 or 8, but I understand that the beginning is too slow for some readers.
