I'm curious - where are you seeing mixed reviews? It has a phenomenally good average on both amazon and goodreads.

I personally enjoyed it a lot, but you should be aware that there are some twists that could easily frustrate a reader if you don't enjoy them. I could go into detail, but it would require some fairly significant spoilers.
