Gotcha. I always assume that there's going to be a % of readers that won't like virtually any book out there.

I suspect /some/ of the people that disliked Unsouled probably just don't enjoy some of the tropes that come with the genre (it's a very heavily Xianxia inspired book).

There are a few things in Unsouled that I had a pretty strongly negative reaction to myself, though, and maybe those were deal breakers for other readers. I connected with the protagonist enough to keep reading even if I didn't enjoy some of the other story elements.

Edit: Also, just so it's clear, I'm talking about Will Wight's Unsouled, not Neal Shusterman's UnSouled.
