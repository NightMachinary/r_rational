I'll continue to carry water for a royal wedding between the First Prince and Cat in Practical Guide to Evil, but it seems a bit unlikely.

What I don't feel like we see enough of are positive, long term relationships in rational fiction. I don't think I've read a rational-adjacent fiction in which the main character is already married or in a long term relationship.

In real life, many people draw comfort, support, advice, and assistance from their significant other. Even for young people, a steady (noun)-friend can be a huge asset.

I think this is in part due to difficulty in portraying such a relationship, and in part due to the literary usefulness of crushing, propositioning, and dating.
