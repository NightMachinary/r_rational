It's not just rational-adjacent fiction. If protagonists are married, they're probably unhappily married. If they're in a long-term relationship (romantic or platonic), it's probably on the rocks. If a character has a relationship with their family, it's usually tense or distant... or, far too often, not a part of the story at all: orphans /de facto/, whether or not any lives have been lost.

Narrative runs on conflict, the more the better. Not that happy relationships are impossible. When it works, the positive long-term couple (or family) are written as joint protagonists, together against the world. Even then, though, it's more fun (and familiar) when they fight a little and make up than when they're 100% compatible and supportive.

Shipping, though? That's about UNRESOLVED TENSION, and resolving it isn't nearly as productive as keeping it suspended.
