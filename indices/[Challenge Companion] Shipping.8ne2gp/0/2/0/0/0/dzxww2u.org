It seems to me that you work hard to make sure that the story is about real people, not just characters floating in the void until they need to fight or fuck.

You include details down to but not including bathroom breaks, which is the perfect place to stop.

I did feel a little bit spun around with the last chapter. Seemed like it was missing some connective tissue between it and the previous one.

Thank you so much for providing a high quality rational cape-fic that can be positive and affirming as well as dangerous and dark.
