No.

The point of the challenge is to give people come incentive to write and to share that writing, to provide constraints that might help with creativity, and to get some community feedback for short stories or experimental fiction that might not otherwise get traction.

The problem with long-running, in-progress works is that most of that doesn't apply. Not only that, a long-runner isn't really playing on a level field when put up against short (or short-ish) fiction, which I'd anticipate would have a chilling effect on people writing for the competition.

If you want to share a story you've been working on that fits well within the theme or prompt of the challenge, one of these companion threads would be a good place to do it.
