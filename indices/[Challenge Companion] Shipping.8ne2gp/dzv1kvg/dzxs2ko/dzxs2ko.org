The self-promotion is probably bad form, but I'd like to mention my own story Delphic as another example here.

The main character's closest friend is his older sister, and the two of them are supported by their parents, who are themselves retirees in a loving long-term relationship. The Donnells are a pretty straightforward nuclear family (although biracial and with one kid adopted) and I have no plans to disrupt that in the near future.
