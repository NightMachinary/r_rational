Have you read the [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html][Dark Wizard of Donkerk]], by Alaxander Wales (OP)? The relationship between the MCs parents is wonderful (although I'm not 100% sure if it's romantic or not). I don't want to spoil too much, but the romantic subplot with the MC is important and rational enough.
