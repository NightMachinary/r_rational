One thing that irks me in many stories is that first other sex character the MC meets usually ends up as the love interest/long term SO/soulmate of the character. Either that or the first few characters they meet end up being MCs best friends/allies new family. I get why it's done for narrative purposes, you introduce the main characters early and get as much character development, screen time, and maybe world building with them as possible, but it seems so silly that in the big wide world the very first people you meet end up staying forever.
