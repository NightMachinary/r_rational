I imagine irrelevant meetings occurring outside the narrative: before the story starts, or concurrently with the story but just not shown.

It would be nice if more stories introduced multiple potential love interests, then had the MC actually have to make decisions about it. If fiction is simulated experience, we have way too much experience of things just working out on the first try, or things never being resolved.
