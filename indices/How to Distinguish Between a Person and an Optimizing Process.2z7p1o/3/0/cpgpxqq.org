Wow. You hit the main points of what I'm going for with my version of time travel. Paradoxical universes which are unstable time loops are excluded and their prior probabilities of occurring are "squeezed" into other potential time loops until a stable time loop reaches a higher probability over all other unstable time loops. After that is another step that I want to keep secret for now, because I'm not sure if it would make sense with the rest of the rules.

Still is this a case of great minds thinking alike, or the fact that this is the only /sane/ way (to me) to do stable time loops?
