Actually this is meant to be set in a world where time travel is common enough that the entire story is planned around a series of lectures in a graduate level course on Temporal Mechanics (albeit a course only given in the top, /top/ schools). Therefore, it occurs often enough that people are able to investigate using controlled experiments.

I'm writing the story this way, because I really want to focus on the meat of the story which is investigation of the rules behind time travel without getting distracted by some poorly-written plot. This story is simply to make it easy on me to do all of the world-building in a fun manner and if I ever decide to write a plot using the time travel, then it will be set in the same world. Basically build a sandbox to play around in now, and reap benefits later.

Before people ask the obvious question about why haven't someone created a super-long time loop putting them in control of the entire human history, it's because the length of the time loop is logarithmic with respect to probability of it occurring, or in simple English, loops longer than a few days are about as likely to happen as you winning the lottery and then getting struck by lightening immediately afterwards.
