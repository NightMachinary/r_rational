Any kind of branching or parallel timeline can create the /appearance/ of stable time loops, by having a self-causing event that happens in several "consecutive" timelines with few or no changes. It's very hard for the characters to tell the difference, if time travel is rare and expensive enough that doing controlled experiments isn't an option.

Theoretically, you could use this to retcon a single-stable-timeline setting into a multiple-branching-timeline setting, though I've never seen that done well so it's probably not a good idea.
