I can't offer a good theory, but in /practice/, the usual criteria for "personhood" that I've been using is something I call the "Trader's Definition": Can I bargain with it? Can I offer to exchange a banana for some backrubs, or some programming for some playtime? This has the advantage that anything that fails the definition, I have the incentive to treat /as if/ it weren't a person, while anything that passes, I have the incentive to treat it /as if/ it were.

For your Time Loops case, if the thing that selects time loops can be negotiated with, then whether it's an Optimization Process or not, then on a practical matter, there's good reason to treat it as if it has an intelligent mind; while if it pursues its agenda without regard to any such offers, then treating it as a non-sapient Optimization Process seems workable.

In short, to decide on which particular dividing line to use, first you should pick what difference the dividing line will make to your actions.
