Iterative single timeline is another simple one but it prevents self-causing events. You simply overwrite the past timeline, or fork a new one. There are major ethical issues in this that are usually ignored.

Another one I came up with involves two dimensions of time, an infinite discrete sequence of timelines with a few added restrictions to ensure convergence. A finite number of timelines have weird stuff in them but the limit provably always exists given the restrictions.

Most attempts of defining it don't actually work but the reasons they don't are subtle. A lot of people fall in the trap of saying "Oh, I got a prophesy to do x, so I'd better do it or something bad will happen!" or "I'd better do it because it's inevitable.", which is not wrong, but if you have a policy of not cooperating with "bad" prophesies then it makes bad prophesies less likely to happen.
