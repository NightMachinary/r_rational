Thanks. So if "this instead" means something that wouldn't make the prophecy come true, then the universe I described would force it to come true, by manipulating /something/. If something isn't well-defined, you could say that the minimum amount of manipulation required is what happens, for some definition of amount, perhaps involving energy.
