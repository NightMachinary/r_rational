I agree completely that this prevents strategies of precommitment from being useful. The only problem is that it doesn't fit my intuition of the prophesy having anything to do with the future. It's more like destiny than prophesy. The Gods decide something is going to happen, and they choose to tell somebody about it, then it happens.
