Oh, I think I get it.

(Probabilistic version) First it fixes a random prophesy (somehow) based on a prior distribution of possible futures, then it conditions random events on that prophesy being eventually fulfilled. That would work. It's not completely clear how you would define the distribution of possible prophesies though.
