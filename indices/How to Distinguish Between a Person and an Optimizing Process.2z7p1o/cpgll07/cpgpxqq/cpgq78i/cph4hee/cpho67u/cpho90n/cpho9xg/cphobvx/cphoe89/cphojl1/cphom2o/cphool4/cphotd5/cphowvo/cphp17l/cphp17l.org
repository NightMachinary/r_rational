Precommitting might still work. I don't know what it would do to the set of possible timelines. Selecting by energy or entropy might still have the same implications or it might have unpredictable results. I have no idea what it would mean for computationally-unbounded rational behavior in such a universe. It's not clear to me that your selection criteria evade rational precommitment strategies.
