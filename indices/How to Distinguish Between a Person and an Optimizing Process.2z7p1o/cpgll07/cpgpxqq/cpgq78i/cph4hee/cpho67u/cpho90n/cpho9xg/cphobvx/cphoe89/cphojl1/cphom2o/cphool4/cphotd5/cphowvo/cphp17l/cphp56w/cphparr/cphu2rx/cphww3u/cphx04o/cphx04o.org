  First it fixes a random prophesy (somehow) based on a prior distribution of possible futures, then it conditions random events on that prophesy being eventually fulfilled.

I'm not even doing that. I'm choosing random properties /apart from any simulation of the future/. If you used anything from the future, you are acausally interacting with it, and TDT strategies of pre-committing come into play.

I'm thinking of just "choose a random prophecy, perhaps using some cosmic Markov chain, and then make it come true". So absolutely no connection to future timelines, so commitments will not help.
