I'm not clear on the probabilistic mechanism for selecting the way in which paradoxes are averted, and I have absolutely no idea how to define such a mechanism in a deterministic way. The simplest probabilistic method is simply conditioning the (prior) distribution of timelines on there being zero paradoxes, which has the implications I described. I'm not sure what the implications would be of selecting the minimum/maximum energy or minimum/maximum entropy timeline in which no paradoxes happen, but that would be interesting.
