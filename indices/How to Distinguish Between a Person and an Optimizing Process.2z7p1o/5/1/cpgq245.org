That seems to be the main difference if I look at it from the theoretical perspective, but I don't quite get how it would be applicable in practice. Maybe by seeing if there are any sudden shifts in patterns to imply a person, and absence of these 'shifts' is weak evidence of an optimization process?

Thanks for helping.
