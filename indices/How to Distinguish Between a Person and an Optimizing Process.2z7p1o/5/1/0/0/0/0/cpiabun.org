  Yes, the Optimizer is selecting for as few time loops as possible.

I'd just like to point out that minimizers don't really exist in nature, except in service to maximizers. I was seeing your situation as paralleling evolution, but now I'm not sure whether that holds up. It's (more or less) tautologically true that genes which replicate more often become more common, but it's not tautologically true that genes which prevent others from replicating become more common. So it's difficult for me to imagine why an Optimizer such as this might exist.
