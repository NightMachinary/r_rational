Local maxima in the context of a time loop is simply the first possible /stable/ time loop the Optimizer finds which is closest (through hill-climbing) to the original timeline when the time traveler gained access to a time machine without any time traveling assistance (think HPMOR's Final Exam where the Time Turner didn't come into play unless there was a timeline where Harry got access without help).

If it was a /better/ Optimizer, then it would find the global maxima which is a timeline with no time loops, since the Optimizer would be influencing probability to prevent time travel from ever developing. Yes, the Optimizer is selecting for as few time loops as possible.
