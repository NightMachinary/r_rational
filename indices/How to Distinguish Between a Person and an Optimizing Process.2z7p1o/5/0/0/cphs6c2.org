Affirm. Natural selection and human intelligence will both have complicated signatures coming from the way they compute things. A law of physics that selects stable possibilities should give rise to stable loops that are (if you end up in a random one) just randomly selected from among all stable loops; there should be no visible signature of how the loop might've been reached, aside from "It's a random stable one."
