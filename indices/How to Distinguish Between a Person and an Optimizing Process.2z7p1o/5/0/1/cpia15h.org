Who said we were talking about a randomized selection, or law of physics? OP wants to talk about a situation in which a person can be distinguished from an optimizing process, and a situation where a time loop is chosen at random doesn't seem like optimization to me. Presumably all of the time loops have some quality in common which makes the idea of a designer appealing, but which also might make their stability more probable - survival of the fittest.

Suppose time loops can be triggered and there's a set of potential stable time loops set up and one of these loops is optimized along the criteria purported to be the designer's motivations, but requires non-incremental change to reach. Perhaps the time loops tend to maximize the color purple, and a situation is established where the best way for the time line to maximize purple is to first create several other colors in a particular sequence. If the purplemost time loop is the one selected, that's evidence for a designer rather than a gradual optimizing process.

There are non-gradual optimizing processes too, of course. But those reliably can't be distinguished from humans because humans are a subset of them, so I assumed they were irrelevant to what OP wanted to discuss.
