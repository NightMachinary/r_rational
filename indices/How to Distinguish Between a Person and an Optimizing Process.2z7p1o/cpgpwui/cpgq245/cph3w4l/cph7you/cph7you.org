Okay, thanks for clearing it up for me. I'm not confident in my ability to actually write (and understand) the consequences behind a /good/ optimization process, but your distinction between local optimizers and people is a good one and really useful. I'm intending the Optimization Process behind the time loops to be really simple in terms of complexity, but if I do this properly, it should appear more sophisticated than it really is due to how it can be influenced by people's actions and even their intentions for the future.
