I'm slightly confused by your post, but I'll try answering anyway.

The Optimizer is meant to be an inherent feature of the Time Loops where a Stable Time Loop is selected out of a pool of potential Stable Time Loops and the selection criteria is simplicity.

Now the twist here, which I probably stupidly left out of my explanation, is that present Time Loops can be affected by future potential Time Loops. Not only does the Optimizer select a Time Loop if it doesn't have paradoxes, it also checks if that Time Loop will in the future lead to Time Loops which are guaranteed to be unstable. This basically never happens in nature because a guaranteed paradox is nearly impossible to set up, but I have certain experiments in mind to illustrate this property.

The side-effect is that if there is a choice between a simple Stable Time Loop which leads to a very large number of complex Stable Time Loops or a more complex Stable Time Loop which leads to fewer simple Stable Time Loops, then the Optimizer will select for the second choice. But there is a constraint on the complexity of the Stable Time Loop to be allowed (probably scales exponentially). The Optimizer is trading off between the complexity and how common Stable Time Loops can be.

As a result, the earliest time travel researchers were plagued by improbabilities and lethal dangers, because what they would discover were assured of influencing future time loops. As knowledge of time travel spread, the probability manipulations became less extreme since an arbitrary person time looping became less likely to influence how other people approached future time loops.
