This is only true of gradient ascent optimizers and similar. There are plenty of non-person optimization processes capable of sudden change. All of the ones we generally deal with in AI are smarter than gradient ascent, but there also exist stupid ones:

#+begin_example
  State best = random(StateSpace)
  while (?) // However long we're allowed to execute
      State proposed = random(StateSpace)
      if (u(proposed) > u(best))
          best = proposed
  return best;
#+end_example
