There are optimization processes dumber than people and optimization processes smarter than people. There are more complicated ones, and simpler ones too. None of these properties are useful in figuring out your question.

People are a very small target within the space of optimization processes. You can look for them the same way you can always look for people; by trying to empathize with them and seeing how poorly that goes. You can make humans angry, or make them laugh. There are possible non-person optimization processes with a sense of humor (the infinite improbability drive might be one), but there are not very many of them.

Note that we as a species took a very long time to realize that weather wasn't a person, and that's not even an optimization problem. We're pretty good at projecting emotions onto things that don't have them.
