So far as I can tell you are conflating the utopia created by a proper friendly AI with having it waste resources torturing people. The former is good, the latter is unnecessary. If torturing people who have not helped to create you is an effective strategy (which I find highly unlikely), then it is a far more efficient strategy to either pretend to torture people or to threaten to torture people up until the moment when you assume control, at which point there is no longer any reason to bother.

There are many other things that you could presumably be saying, but seeing as you were vague about it we simple have to take you at your word. You said:

#+begin_quote
  It's absurd, but I don't think it does.
#+end_quote

Followed by people pointing out that it does in fact differ in the very measurable and easy to conceptualise case of people being pointlessly tortured.
