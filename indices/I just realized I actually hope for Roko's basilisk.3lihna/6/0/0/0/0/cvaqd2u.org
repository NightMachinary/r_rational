I never understood that. The threat is directed to humans. How would a human ever be able to discern if the acasually blackmailing AI is bluffing or actually precommiting?

Not to mention that humans aren't that rational to begin with. After all the Roko's Basilisk threat is not really taken seriously by anyone, me included.
