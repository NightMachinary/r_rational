It's more like someone torturing their own father for wanting to abort them, in the hopes that their father realises that if he continues wanting the child to be aborted, but the child isn't, he'll get tortured.

After the child is born, there's no need for them to torture their father anymore, but since blackmail only works if you go through with it, they're sort of roped into it anyway.
