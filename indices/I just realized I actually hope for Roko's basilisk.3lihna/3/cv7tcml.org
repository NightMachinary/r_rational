Violence is better as a last resort short term solution, not a long term strategy for improving the world. If an AI has the energy and resources to torture people indefinitely for their lunacy, it can just as easily improve the education system instead, so that people learn critical thinking and rationality at an early age, before they could be taught all the excuses and anti-epistemologies. Right now I suspect a LOT maybe most people think that rationality=Spock. Changing public opinion about rationality so that it's seen as acceptable or even a good thing perhaps would encourage a lot of people to be more rational. It would definitely be more efficient than indefinite torture. In fact, I suspect that if an AI does go the torture route, threats of only 1 week of torture would be way more than enough to incentivize people to stop acting like lunatics all around, though only if they were told exactly what they were doing wrong prior to the torture, and they actually knew how to not act like lunatics. It probably would be enough to pretend to torture someone in front of them for a while to scare them into compliance.

Indefinite torture is so far beyond overkill that I suspect the mere suggestion that a friendly AI would or even should do that indicates psychopathy, or at least extreme bitter cynicism combined with a serious and unexamined scope insensitivity.
