It does start off kind of slow, and I had the same trouble getting into it. The name changes bugged me.

Read chapters six and seven and maybe even eight before you give up on it. It turns out to be really, really, really clever. It's Harry Potter, but if arithmancy was the most important subject instead of never even explored at all. Magic is more blockchain and cryptography than incantations and wand waving.

For some reason, one of the things I really prize in fiction is the dawning realization that the author is smarter than me, and, as much as I'm mad that I didn't think of the cool, smart ideas myself, if I'm honest, I could never have come up with them on my own. So fiction that makes me jealous of the author's brain, I guess. This one really pays off in that department.
