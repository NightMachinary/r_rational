I can use this power to fly. Quite rapidly. If I am in danger, therefore, I can quickly get away.

Thus, I always fight at range.

I can protect myself from most ranged attacks with an invisible zone of altered gravity between me and the shooter. If I change the direction of the gravitational pull quickly and unpredictably, then I'm hard to hit (not impossible, faster and more massless missiles will be less affected, and I'd need a lot more power to be able to handle lasers, but it should handle thrown rocks).

I can also use my power to accelerate missiles. If I'm trying to be lethal and have no inhibitions, the answer is sewing needles dipped in poison; they're small enough to be extremely rapidly accelerated, cheap enough to buy in quantity, and the poison may not be necessary but may also help. (Major targets are eyes, throat, heart).

If I'm not trying to be lethal, then trying to pile enough gravity on the opponent to hold him down and cause him to black out is probably my best bet.
