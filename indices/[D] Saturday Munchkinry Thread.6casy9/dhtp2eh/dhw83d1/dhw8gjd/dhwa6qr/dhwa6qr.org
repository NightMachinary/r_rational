Guns already fire projectiles at way over terminal velocity. If you fired one from orbit straight down, the projectile would actually lose kinetic energy.

At best it could help you fire long distances accurately, if you make a hollow cylinder of outward gravity that reduces air pressure within it. Sort of like having an invisible really long rifle barrel.

Edit: though you could get a lot easier long range shots by counteracting downward gravity so there is no bullet drop over distance. And making the bullet fall toward your target would reduce wind drift on the bullet.

So, all in all, could be great with a sniper rifle.
