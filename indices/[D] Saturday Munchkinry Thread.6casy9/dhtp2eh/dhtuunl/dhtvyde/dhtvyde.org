  Can you split up the power on multiple areas at a time?
#+end_quote

As long as you can accurately visualize all of those areas and the major masses within them, yes. I haven't decided on what exactly the threshold for what constitutes a 'major mass' is yet, but furniture definitely is, the average contents of someone's pocket definitely isn't.

  Your power can easily move a small tank-like metal block/sphere for you to sit in. This may make you invincible against some opponents.

Hm, I like this. Hook up some cameras on the outside, and this could be useful.

  You can fly. With a spacesuit, to the moon, in about an hour. With some more run-up and proper targetting, you can orbitally bombard the enemy.

Flight is definitely possible. Re-entry's a bitch, though - it's either really hot or really boring.

  You do not need to be in line of sight with the enemy. Every camera feeding information to you can be used as a remotely operated drone. Anywhere you can "see", you can poltergeist around. Homing grenades come to mind.

I hadn't considered using wireless cameras as drones. Although you don't need line of "sight", you do need line of "effect", so it's got to be within a half kilometer, but that's still pretty potent.

  You are an earthbender and a waterbender. Do this.

Okay, that was pretty entertaining.
