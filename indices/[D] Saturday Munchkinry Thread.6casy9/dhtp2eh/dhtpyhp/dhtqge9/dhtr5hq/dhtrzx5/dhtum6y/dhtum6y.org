Oh... oh. That will be hard. The people in RWBY are just too hardy to be taken out by anything 7G worth of gravity would throw at them or them at, unless you have a loooot of space to accelerate. But then, seeing as you have to keep up with whatever you're accelerating in order to keep it within 0.5 kilometers distance of you, air resistance would burn you up. So you probably won't even be able to scratch them using conventional methods.

You're going to need some drastic measures.

First, you need to shoot yourself out into outer space. You will need to bring along a bubble of air around yourself, or you would suffocate or die from decompression. However, air is not solid, so it will constantly be trying to disperse. Nevertheless, 5G of gravity is enough to keep it around you by constantly changing the direction of gravity and applying it at the outer edges, effectively batting the ball of air back and forth around yourself. You will also need to compress it to heat it up so you don't freeze to death in outer space.

Now, fly yourself towards a large meteor, and push it towards Earth using your gravity. That, at last, will be enough to kill off your enemies (along with everyone you know and love).
