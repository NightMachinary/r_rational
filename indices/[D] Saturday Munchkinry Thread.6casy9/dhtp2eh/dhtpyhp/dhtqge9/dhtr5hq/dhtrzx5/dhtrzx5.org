That's entirely fair. For context, this would be in the RWBY universe; it's an OC's Semblance.

If that doesn't mean anything in particular to you, Semblances are varied and mostly unique to the character that has them, and everyone has Aura, which is like a personal forcefield that heals/protects/empowers themselves, right up until it runs out.

Guns that transform into melee weapons are common, a substance called Dust can be used to create ammunition that interacts with one's Semblance, and first year students at a military academy are routinely flung kilometers into the air, as an entrance exam, with the reasonable expectation they'll figure out how to land safely.
