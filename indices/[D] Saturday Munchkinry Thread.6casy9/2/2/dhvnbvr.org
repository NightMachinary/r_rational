The constructs themselves are made of hard light. But what the constructs /produce/ is not. (And I understand the ring has a database as well, including in amongst said database examples of alien technology... so I could try to query the database about whether or not there is a known machine that solves Problem X... which may or may not work for any given problem.)

So, I could use the ring to assemble non-Ring machinery and objects. Like a really long rope made of carbon nanotubes. (It shouldn't be /too/ difficult for me to get as far as a space elevator, which will then give me access to the mineral wealth of the asteroid belt... though having a Ring gives me access to that in any case, I guess...)

Also, on that subject, here's a really long fanfic describing what one can do with an /orange/ lantern ring in a DC universe:

(Orange rings run off greed instead of willpower, but are otherwise very similar)
