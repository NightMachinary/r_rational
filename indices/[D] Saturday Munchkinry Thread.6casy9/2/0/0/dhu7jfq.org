Honestly the biggest problem I have with visibly using the ring, letting others know about its existence, is that the ring can be stolen. It's a superpower that's inherent to the ring, not you. I.e., someone steals it, game over.

In a sense Green Lantern is the most useless superhero, everyone else is still something even when all their tools are taken away. Even batman has his bat brain. And Iron man has money. Hal has nothing at all. Nothing.
