I guess it depends on whether I'm still beholden to the Green Lantern Corps, or whether I have a hypothetical Green Lantern ring without all the baggage of being a Green Lantern in a world that's constantly beset by alien shenanigans.

If it's just normal Earth, then I guess I put my efforts toward space travel; I can make an enormous amount of money putting satellites into orbit, doing maintenance, and eliminating space junk. I can help to establish a Mars colony pretty easily. And if I remember Green Lantern well enough, I can travel well in excess of the speed of light, so I can aid in the understanding of our universe.

In terms of actually making stuff ... well, part of how I'd /start/ is using my wealth to hire a team of experts that would explain to me how certain things work, and who will help me to design things that I can imagine. Depending on the limits of the ring, I might be able to solve the nuclear waste problem, or clean the oceans of plastic, or a number of other things. Maybe I could single-handedly put a stop to climate change with the right sort of massive air purifier. You need to maintain concentration on what the ring creates, so the obvious workaround is to create lasting effects and/or infrastructure.
