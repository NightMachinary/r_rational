What would you do with a Green Lantern ring? From what I understand, the biggest limitations are that the constructs are made of hard light (so you can't make food or fuel or anything like that), they're limited by your imagination (so you can't summon "a machine that solves Problem X" without knowing what that machine would look like), and they disappear when not being actively maintained.
