In 24 hours you'll have the opportunity to create a number of duplicates of yourself, identical in every respect to how you are currently, with the exception of any new memories you obtain in the next 24h -- mostly so that, upon being generated, your duplicates aren't surprised by their apparent teleportation to a new location. If you prefer, you can generate duplicates with no 24h-updated memories. They'll appear instantly, standing next to you, but with no dangerous displacement of air or splinching/telefragging and with no greater density than one per 3 cubic meters. Furthermore, they will not appear in any immediately dangerous positions themselves unless they've exhausted all possible less-dangerous nearby 3m^{3} blocks within a 5,000 mi radius -- if you're standing in a highrise, duplicates will first fill your floor, then fill nearby floors, then spill out onto the streets below (but initially fill along the sidewalks, away from passing cars), and so on.

Duplicates will appear wearing a replicate of a typical outfit you'd wear during your day-to-day, or a plain black shirt, sneakers, and jeans; your choice. Your first 1,000,000 duplicates will have on their persons the equivalent of 1,000 USD in your local currency, acquired through completely legal and legitimate channels (i.e. not created ex nihilo or stolen), or a selection of world currencies. All duplicates beyond the first million will have the equivalent of 1,000 USD in precious metals at current spot prices. Duplicates are physically identical to the you reading this currently and persist in the world just as /you/ would -- in other words, they're "real" and permanent.

You can create any natural number of duplicates, from none at all to 10^{40} or more (which in the latter case would probably accrete into a black hole, or trigger a new big bang, or something, depending on the number you choose). You can only do this in 24h, and never again afterwards.

*1)* Given who you are and what your goals are now, how many duplicates do you create, if any? How well do the duplicates (including "yourself") cooperate with each other? What steps do you (in the plural) take to ensure cooperation? What do you set out to accomplish? What do you actually anticipate accomplishing, and how? In what way do governments and societies at large react to your new multiplicity?

*2)* Given the goal of WORLD DOMINATION, how many duplicates do you create and how do you go about achieving it? Are you ultimately successful? Let's say WORLD DOMINATION requires that the 97 most populous United Nations Member States formally recognize and cede power to you as global leader within 20-years time. At least thirty percent of humans alive today must also be alive then. If you do not succeed in this task, Unspecified Bad Things happen, so let's say you're very highly motivated but not completely “bloodlusted”. Additionally, what is the smallest number of duplicates that could conceivably succeed in this task at least 5/10 times?
