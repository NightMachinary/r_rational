Thank you for the very thorough answer!

  I'm tempted to create a Graham's Number of duplicates to vastly increase the universe's negentropy, pushing the Heat Death further away and giving hypothetical alien civilizations more much-needed time, as it may be the most altruistic use of this opportunity.

A risky gamble! I'm actually not sure what would happen if you spawned so much matter. Some quick back of the enveloping would put the mass of the universe in a sphere with radius ~70 lightyears -- I'd be curious how the system would evolve if that were to happen. And going to larger numbers would probably result in even more exotic effects!

  Step zero would be choosing a deserted-enough spot and moving to it, creating duplicates there so they don't become obvious to the world at large.
#+end_quote

The tricky bit here would be finding a spot that's remote enough to avoid detection, yet close enough to civilization to be able to obtain necessary supplies. The duplicates don't spawn with food/water/shelter/etc., and while it can be bought using the money they each carry, logistics for any spontaneous remote settlement would be a nightmare (large festivals have a hard enough time at it, without needing to be kept secret and with having more than 24h prep on a much larger budget)

  Then we're covertly moving to almost every city in my country, about ten duplicates per city.
#+end_quote

Getting to a city would be helpful w.r.t. not dying from starvation, but avoiding detection in cities would be much trickier without substantial disguises from the get-go, I'd think. And even then, across thousands of individuals I'd reckon you'd run into authority figures pretty quickly for entirely innocuous reasons, and (I'm not sure how law enforcement in Russia works nowadays) if there's any centralized information system, it might seem strange to get a citation in e.g. Omsk and Volgograd in the same day, and passersby might notice themselves passing the same person more often than anticipated unless they ran in entirely different circles, and eventually you'd find yourself on the news or something, even if accidentally.
