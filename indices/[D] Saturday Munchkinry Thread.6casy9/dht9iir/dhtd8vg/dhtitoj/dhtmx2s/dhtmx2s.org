  A risky gamble! I'm actually not sure what would happen if you spawned so much matter. Some quick back of the enveloping would put the mass of the universe in a sphere with radius ~70 lightyears -- I'd be curious how the system would evolve if that were to happen. And going to larger numbers would probably result in even more exotic effects!

I'm confused how you could do a back of the envelope calculation on that, since Graham's number is vastly too large to express with normal notation, like I don't even know how you could easily do calculations with it. Also I can say you are /*staggeringly*/ wrong in your calculation since the number of planck volumes in the observable universe is only a /mere/ 10^{186} (not even very long in normal notation systems!) so once you made that many clones the entire rest of the universe would be infinitesimally small in comparison (if anything that's an understatement).

Anyway with that many clones in such a small space (graham's number of literally /anything/ within any finite size space you can reasonably express with normal notation is going to be absurd) it's really hard to say whether the outwards pressure would counteract the force of gravity or not. Either way it would seem that you would have a wave of destruction travelling outwards at lightspeed, whether it was an event horizon or pure energy.\\
Except that since it would so totally dwarf the mass of the entire universe and be more energy dense than the entire universe when it occupied a planck volume it's hard to really say with much certainty that it /would/ actually be limited to lightspeed. In fact upon looking at wikipedia I strongly suspect such an energy density would cause a period of inflation on a scale and speed utterly dwarfing our own universes period of inflation. So it may end up creating something like an eternal (well not eternal but lasting so long as to be incomprehensible) inflation style cosmos even if such a thing didn't previously exist.\\
Of course there's also a case to be made that such an energy density is literally impossible so the entire scenario is just fundamentally wrong and unresolvable. Though whether trans-planckian scales are actually possible in this sense is probably impossible to say.

Anyway either way graham's number is just *so* large that there's probably no alien race that could ever encounter this wave of destructions in any form /other/ than by being outpaced and engulfed by it.
