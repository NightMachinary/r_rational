  A risky gamble! I'm actually not sure what would happen if you spawned so much matter

A ridiculously massive black hole? On second thoughts, it may be so massive, so /unprecedently/ massive, it would just break spacetime and collapse the universe into singularity. Um. I probably don't want that.

  The tricky bit here would be finding a spot that's remote enough to avoid detection, yet close enough to civilization to be able to obtain necessary supplies

We would be supposed to spend about a day or less here, sorting ourselves out, then leave the city by various means, ranging from trains to hitchhiking to buses. Are the duplicates' bodies created as mine was at the time of reading your message? I had a dinner not long before that, which is convenient, allowing my duplicates to easily live for a days or a three on snacks alone.

Still, the logistics of covertly distributing 10^{4} people in a timely manner is indeed the most tricky part. Hmm. I should probably spend part of these 24 hours figuring out the best place to situate them at, allowing transportation of large quantities of people, a sort of traffic hub.

I could burn all my money and ask for loans to equip every duplicate of mine with enough food to live a week and a train/bus ticket, and hope that we'll manage to send them all off to their destinations by that time.

Yep, it would probably still be necessary to cut my numbers by about a half just because of that. Fucking logistics.

  re: authority figures, centralized information system, passersby, news

Well, yes, but a likely response to that is "meh, it was probably a mistake or a lookalike, whatever", not "CLONES ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD NUKE EVERYTHING". If it's a murder case or a large money transfer or an interview or something, then of course someone may take notice, but myselves would deliberately /avoid/ those, running away or even commiting suicide if it's absolutely necessary.

Over large enough periods of time, someone of course would just /happen/ to notice and become unexpectedly interested, but by that time myselves would already have gone through cosmetic surgeries and/or became disguise experts.

Of course, over large enough periods of time, someone may notice even /that/, but by that time we're probably already a force to be reckoned with, and could take care of ourselves, one way or another.
