For (2), it depends what you mean by:

#+begin_quote
  Let's say WORLD DOMINATION requires that the 97 most populous United Nations Member States formally recognize and cede power to you as global leader within 20-years time.
#+end_quote

Are you allowed to kill/replace the current leaders of these 97 countries? If not, if one dies in the next second, you have already failed. If yes, what are the restrictions on replacing them?

In the best case, you could accomplish (2) with barely any blood spilled, just by making many duplicates of yourself and physically deporting all citizens in these 97 nations, then instating yourself as the leader of the country since you are the only remaining citizen and you have effectively taken over the country. (You can re-import the citizens back in afterwards so they don't die out in the wilderness.) Your global leadership would be highly temporarily and unrecognized by the world, but it would technically fulfill (2).
