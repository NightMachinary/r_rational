Hmm... I feel like accomplishing this with many fewer people might be difficult. I could probably reduce it by a bunch by locating myself somewhere in the Atlantic and producing enough copies to take over the US and Europe and using conventional means to take over the rest, but I would have to worry about China starting a nuclear war that would reduce the requisite population below the desired threshold. Maybe I could get around that by force-evacuating people from cities, putting them in bunkers and letting them live off of cannibalized extra-me copies.

But without putting in enough people to take a major country essentially by force, I think you are going to have problems. Its going to take a lot of people (even if smart and well coordinated) to take over the world unless they were already very well positioned (which these are not). Furthermore, if you located in a remotely advanced country, you will probably quickly run into problems with bureaucracy as most of the copies of you don't have/have only matching identification. Once it becomes officially recognized that there are a bazillion copies of you, things will probably get weird.

Actually, now that I think about it, if you want to win with many fewer people, you would probably need to do so by somehow leveraging the public reaction to this discovery.
