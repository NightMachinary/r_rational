  1) Given who you are and what your goals are now, how many duplicates do you create, if any? How well do the duplicates (including "yourself") cooperate with each other? What steps do you (in the plural) take to ensure cooperation? What do you set out to accomplish? What do you actually anticipate accomplishing, and how? In what way do governments and societies at large react to your new multiplicity?

Well, we'd immediately run into the problem that I have one wife and one child, who do not also duplicate. In other words, our collective is immediately faced with a very scarce resource. I think that would be something of a pain point, though maybe it could be overcome.

Given that, I'm tempted to go with a very low number of clones, especially since I'm not confident that having thousands of me would be a net improvement in my lives. I suppose the idea of being able to have lots of one-man startups, or play D&D with myself, or start a writing collective are all attractive, but ... well, if I wanted to leave my wife and son to go spend all day writing, I could do that /now/ (and I don't want to do that).

I'd also be extremely worried about the attention that would be brought down on me, both by the media and the government; all clones are probably not citizens. And $1000 starting cash isn't all that much, especially considering that we only have one SSN to share between us, making finding work quite difficult if we're not just fronting as though we were a single person.
