  I think that would be something of a pain point, though maybe it could be overcome.

On the bright side, it [[https://youtu.be/NHYpGYTyyag?t=26][would open up some interesting possibilities]]! You could learn Spanish! Do you think for small numbers of you your family would be ok with having a really unusual poly setup, or would it be easier to keep one copy with family and have the rest go off on their own? For sufficiently large numbers of you, would a subset of yous begin to pursue familial/romantic affection elsewhere?

  And $1000 starting cash isn't all that much, especially considering that we only have one SSN to share between us

Yah jobs would need to be found fast, though currentYou could ofc dip into savings and liquidate investments and such for more breathing room. I figured the $1000 would be enough for food in the short term and transport to some different city (where each you could check into a homeless shelter while getting on your feet), or a few weeks in a cheap motel. Jobs that can be done remotely from e.g. a library computer would be the most scalable.
