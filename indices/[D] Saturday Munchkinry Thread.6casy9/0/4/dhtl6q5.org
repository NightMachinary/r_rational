Well I'm going to go with the boring answer and say that like most people i'm really not going to be able to accomplish world domination with this power. I'm just not ever going to be willing enough to sacrifice my life for most such plans to succeed (plus if I have to create such an absurd number of clones that die in order to take over the world you'd have to go to pretty great lengths afterwards for that to morally justifiable).

As a result I'm just going to have to try to go to a somewhat less sinister government (as in I think many european countries are less likely to hold me prisoner than the US). Then I'm going to become extremely famous for my abilities (since I don't really think I have much chance of evading notice for too long while using my abilities in useful ways anyway). Obviously fame will directly get me money, though that along will likely be somewhat unimpressive when split among my selves. After that though I would probably do the sort of things Noumero mentions with trying out many different things so that the whole collective can reap the rewards.\\
In addition however I would likely be highly prized for certain professions or tasks since after a while people will get a very good idea of my skills and psychological profile and there will be a large appeal to employing someone when you know exactly what you can expect from them. Of course I won't create any clones to take jobs I would hate, though I can likely make jobs easier and save massive amounts of money by eating soylent, sharing living expenses and divvying up the time at work (though many jobs can't easily have workload just split with clones who weren't recently created). Plus I would absolutely run d&d games with myself and do that sort of thing because it sounds really interesting.

As for original me I would likely spend most of my time learning new skills that would be useful for my clones and doing physical training and the like (it says they're identical to you reading it right now so I'm not exactly clear whether this would work, but on the plus side that might mean my clones will never be old). Since the comment seems to imply only the original has this ability and thus they need to be the one to learn anything that they want to be imparted to any new clones.
