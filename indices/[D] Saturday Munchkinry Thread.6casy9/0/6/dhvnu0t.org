(1) - Honestly, the whole cloning thing is pretty fascinating. I think I'll need to create one or two - not more than three - of me just out of sheer curiosity. I suspect we'll cooperate pretty well at first - we'll eventually begin to diverge, but it'll take a while.

(2) - I create enough duplicates to be able to obtain enough votes in the next election to simply vote myself into the Presidency. Once I have reached the Presidency of /one/ country, I, um...

...

...can I just generate enough clones to simultaneously vote myself into the presidency of all the 97 most populous United Nations member states?

I believe this gets me WORLD DOMINATION with minimal casualties (though there will likely be a brief famine as all the clones also want to eat).
