Yep, this should work, so long as you're psychologically OK committing suicide under strong-but-not-absolute motivation (and I guess the bodies could be used as as biofuel! Energy crisis momentarily averted!), though there would still be some fiddly details to work out w.r.t. various nations recognizing the Distributed Nation of You as global hegemon.
