For (2), can you just clone enough copies to cover the globe and to immediately physically subdue essentially everyone who is not currently both alert and armed? You will probably need a bunch of copies to commit suicide and have the others resort to cannibalism to avoid an immediate mass-die off, and you'll need to reduce the number of copies down to at most several billion eventually anyway, but this seems like perhaps the most guaranteed way to achieve the stated goal.
