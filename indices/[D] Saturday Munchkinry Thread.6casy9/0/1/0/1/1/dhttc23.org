  Also I can say you are */staggeringly/* wrong in your calculation

Ah, I'd been referring to specifically a number of duplicates equivalent to the mass of the universe there

#+begin_quote
  ...put the mass of the universe in a sphere with radius ~70 lightyears...
#+end_quote

and not a Graham's Number of duplicates, since working with that would be tricky and its well beyond the point for me where all big numbers sorta look the same.

Specifically, I googled "mass of the universe" and [[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/101-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/general-questions/579-what-is-the-mass-of-the-universe-intermediate][this]] was the first result, which gives 3E55 g, which I misread as kg, so we're actually working with 3E52 kg. Assuming the average person commenting here weighs 75kg, we have 4E50 persons generated, which given the 1 person/3m^{3} stipulation, gives us 1.2E51 m^{3,} given an initial radius here of about [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=radius+of+sphere+with+volume+1.2E51+m%5E3+in+lightyears][7 ly]]. So off a bit from my initial hasty ballpark!

Incidentally, a black hole of that mass would have a Schwarzschild radius of 4.71 billion ly, so I'm not really sure how the whole thing would play out!

Sorry for any confusion!
