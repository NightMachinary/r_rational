I'm tempted to create a Graham's Number of duplicates to vastly increase the universe's negentropy, pushing the Heat Death further away and giving hypothetical alien civilizations more much-needed time, as it may be the most altruistic use of this opportunity.

Closer to the spirit of the question...

Our cooperation should be borderline inhuman. I'm pretty sure that no recently-diverged copy of mine would choose to act against my/our goals; moreover, they/I would be more likely to /tell/ other duplicates about any rebellious thoughts they would have instead, in fear of going rogue. Us having perfect cooperation is /the/ source of our strength, all of us being cooperative is preferable to alternatives, it's a typical timeless prisoner's dilemma situation, any duplicate of mine would know that, and so would do his utmost best to make sure he stayed loyal.

I think I'd settle on around 10,000 duplicates. Not as many as possible, but on the safer side.

Step zero would be choosing a deserted-enough spot and moving to it, creating duplicates there so they don't become obvious to the world at large.

We would then agree on means of long-range communication on the spot: using the Internet, and a website that would be created during the following weeks. We would agree on how we would distribute ourselves.

Then we would covertly move to almost every city in my country, about ten duplicates per city. 1,000 USD is a large enough sum of money in Russia, so they would be able to freely live on it for a few weeks at least. Upon arrival, they would rent an apartment, buy a laptop, get the Internet access, some would be tasked with creating the website for us. We would converse and plot.

Then we would enact [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/293753.html][/The Story of Emily and Control/]] on mass-scale: each of us would choose a different method of doing X or a different interest to pursue, rate how successful it was upon completion, then we would collectively adopt the most successful methods/goals.

I'm a programmer; some would be freelancing, some would be trying to get a programmer job, some would be trying to get an unrelated job, some would be doing independent research and living off the money my other selves earned, etc. We would be doing collective brainstorming sessions, where we would deliberately diverge our daily experiences, then think on the issue and discuss our thoughts online.

We would be open to new ideas, changing our strategy and tactics if better ideas become apparent. We would offer support to each other, ensure that we're all happy with the way we're moving forward.

The whole thing is bizarre and innocuous-looking from the outside enough that I don't expect us to be noticed by the government until it's too late; we /would/ deliberately try to avoid recognition, staying away from getting into noticeable positions/commiting crimes/being around too many cameras, wearing at least basic disguise when it's absolutely necessary and eventually going through —Åosmetic surgery, choosing to get a full-time job only at places where it wouldn't be necessarily included in some global database. Our website and other methods of communication, as well as money transfers, would be properly anonymized and protected soon enough.

I expect us to become a civilization-scale force in a decade or so. /How/, I don't know, since I lack the raw intelligence by definition. It could be through advanced software products, or scientific discoveries, or writing worldview-shattering books online, or hacking something important, or earning enough money to buy the world, or writing a FAI, or all of the above, or something else entirely, such as pushing one or a few of us into influential positions and letting them benefit off of the collectivemind's work.

Contingencies: I'm reasonably confident that, in such a situation, a duplicate of mine would willingly kill himself if the greater whole decides it's optimal^{1}, doubly so if our strategy would appear to be working. Suicide missions are possible as well.
