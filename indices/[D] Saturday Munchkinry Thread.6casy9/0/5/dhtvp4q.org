Boring answer: I'd create one, maybe two duplicates and we'd alternate which day we attend work. Maybe see if after a few weeks my duplicates are different enough from me that they'd be willing to each focus on a different one of my subgoals - have one attend university, another start a small business, the third focus on writing. Otherwise, split the subgoals between us as best we can (university would be most tricky as we can't equally split attending lectures or doing tests.

That said: it'll still make me less effective at my job since I won't remember conversations and meetings. Because my work is project-based, I'd assign my clones different projects and take copious notes of meetings and conversations. If someone comes up to me on YBJ day and asks about SECP, worst case I can say "sorry, I'm really pressed / sorry I'm not really sure let me double check", make a careful note of their SECP question, and have my SECP clone come back to them the next day for the discussion.

I'm poly so the impact on my family life, while no doubt a big deal, won't result in clone/s having to abandon my/their partners. Getting a second clone will probably require a third bedroom or fold out couch to be acquired.

All I anticipate accomplishing is working part-time whilst having a full-time income.
