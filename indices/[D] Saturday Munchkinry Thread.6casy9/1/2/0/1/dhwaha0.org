That gives me another idea. You never said the direction of gravity has to be in objective reference. You could make an object fall at 5g toward a moving person as its gravity point.

Carry a bunch of needles (either injections or acupuncture) and make them fall toward the nerve clusters of your enemies at 4g. While using 1g worth of force to make them effectively weightless. The gravity doesn't affect the person, it is just the point that objects fall toward.
