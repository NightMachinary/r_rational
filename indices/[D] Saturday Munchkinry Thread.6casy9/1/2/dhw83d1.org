I tried doing the math for a torus filled with steel BBs. Even at 1/5ths partial air pressure, and using micro areas of 5gravities to swing the BBs around like a makeshift railgun, with optimal conditions, I can only get them up to about 110km/h at terminal velocity. So you can make a fairly decent gun, but worse than you could just buy.

Worth trying just to see if the math works out. Unfortunately it does not.
