Well, you could certanly use it to hurl projectiles at great speed. Throw something at them, and then while it's in the air, create a gravitational field pulling it towards your target. If it accelerates for 4 meters at 1 g (9.8 m/s), then by the time it leaves the gravitational bubble it's going 39.2 m/s. You could do even better, though; you don't need a 4 meter sphere, just a narrow tube shaped space, so you could either make it a lot longer, use a higher G force, or both. (The exact best answer would depend on things like how much g force you get for how much volume, how aerodynamic the object you are throwing is, ect. ) And with practice you should be able to make it so your object would never miss, by making the gravity pull the object right to the target.
