Can you split up the power on multiple areas at a time?

Your power can easily move a small tank-like metal block/sphere for you to sit in. This may make you invincible against some opponents.

You can fly. With a spacesuit, to the moon, in about an hour. With some more run-up and proper targetting, you can orbitally bombard the enemy.

You do not need to be in line of sight with the enemy. Every camera feeding information to you can be used as a remotely operated drone. Anywhere you can "see", you can poltergeist around. Homing grenades come to mind.

You are an earthbender and a waterbender. [[https://youtu.be/J1EpAmjwfeY?t=223][Do this.]]
