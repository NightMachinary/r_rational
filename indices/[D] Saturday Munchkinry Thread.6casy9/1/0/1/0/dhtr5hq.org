Oh right, forgot about the half kilometer radius, hmm. Ok, new plan: again, shoot them upwards using maximum anti gravity, but now, before they leave your sphere of influence, adjust your gravity manipulation to the point where they simply float in midair, no movement in any direction.

Now that they are stuck in midair, they can't really move, since there's nothing solid near them for them to push themselves away from. They could blow air out of their mouths, but you can just counter that minor force by adjusting your gravity. They could throw stuff at you, but unless its something super fast (like bullets shot by a gun), it would be easy to shove the projectile out of the way in mid flight using gravity.

Now, if they have guns, then you'll need to work extra. I do not recommend using your gravity on the bullets, in most cases, it won't change their trajectories fast enough. Instead, if you're outdoors, you should pull up the ground to form an earth wall to block bullets. If you're indoors, you should just take cover behind furniture and stuff like a regular person. Then throw them out the building as before.

For more specific strategies, you're going to need to specify what superpowers you're fighting against.
