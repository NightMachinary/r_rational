You can't apply the anti-gravity to the person, just the space they occupy, so once they get farther than a half-kilometer away they've left your sphere of influence. You can certainly fling people into the air at high speeds, but anyone worth getting into a fight with is going to have powers of their own, and may or may not get hurt by a landing like that.

Flinging people out of doors and windows sounds like a neat plan, actually, but if you break line of sight you have to be able to predict where they are in space in relation to you and how they're moving; you don't gain any innate sensory knowledge of the space you're modifying, and if they can manage to get a body part outside of that space their own powers will allow them to act as though unaffected.

The blood flow thing, I didn't consider that, so that could be cool. I did modify the question from 'hand-to-hand' to 'personal combat', since you're right, not much point to getting up close and personal unless you want to show off.
