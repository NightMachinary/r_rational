Well, seeing as 5G - 1G = -4G, applying this anti-gravity on a person would cause them to fall straight upwards much much faster than you would regularly fall straight down.

So... why would you ever fight hand-to-hand? Just target them from far away, and once they are affected they are either off to outer space or stuck, desperately hanging on to the ground to avoid being sent to outer space. And now you can just throw rocks at them until they let go or die.

Alternatively, if for some reason you can't bring the fight outdoors, the question needs to be further defined. Are you restricted in the direction of this gravitational pull? For example, can you pull/push someone eastwards with your gravity? If so, push them out of the building then upwards into outer space.

If not, then pull them straight down instead. 5G + 1G = 6G, which is enough to give them severe blood flow problems, especially to their brain. They would be forced to adopt postures not friendly for combat, like lying on the ground, in order to keep pumping blood to their brains. Then, once again, you can just stand far away and throw stuff at them.
