You can create zones of altered gravity within a half-kilometer radius, essentially adding another vector to local conditions. You must be able to accurately visualize the area to be affected in detail (being able to see this area is best, but not strictly required if you know where all of the large masses in that area are and how they are moving at the time this power begins to affect them). The energy required to affect these changes comes from somewhere else, but the level of mental detail required is difficult to maintain for long periods of time.

You can affect about four cubic meters of space at a time, in any shape you desire, with a level of precision equal to about a centimeter. The level of gravitational change depends on how much space you are affecting at one time; affecting the full 4m^{3} would barely be able to counteract the effects of Earth's gravity (1G of change, essentially), and the effect scales logarithmically with area; a 1cm^{3} area could be increased to almost 7G of gravity.

These zones of increased gravity can affect objects and people alike, but due to interactions with other powers, in order to affect living beings and any objects held or worn by them, they must either be fully included within a zone or must be willing to be affected by the power; concentrating 7G on part of someone's heart won't work, so the most that can be applied to the average-sized adult is around 5 or 6G, evenly spread out across their body (depending on how accurately you can visualize the space they occupy and mentally predict their movements).

Given all of these caveats, how would you use this power in personal combat?
