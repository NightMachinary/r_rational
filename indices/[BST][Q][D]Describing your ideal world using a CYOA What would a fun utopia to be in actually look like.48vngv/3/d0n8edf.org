Minimum point-cost utopia, since I pretty quickly realized I was going to have some left over. My personal perfectly free utopia, on top of which you can add whatever:

[89] Area Increase 6

[86] Transient

[84] Division

[82] Magical Upgrade 1

[77] Technomagic

[75] Infrastructure

[72] Afterlife

[69] Fate

[67] Blessing

[57] Guidance 2

[56] Insertion

[55] Attitude Adjustment

[80] Trapped!

[105] Partnership!

[100] Technology Upgrade 5

Area Increase: may as well max this, but [Area Increase 6: 11pts] should be enough for the foreseeable future.

[Division: 2pts] and [Transient: 3pts] allow you to switch between location categories at will for arbitrary subsets of your territory, most notably [Insertion: 1pt].

Inhabitants: [Attitude Adjustment: 1pt] makes them universally benevolent. If you want them to outnumber pre-existing humanity, it might be worth springing for [Population Increase 9: 16 pts] or higher.

Magitech: [Magical Upgrade 1: 2pts] means there's a widespread population with powers "about as potent as what you might start with in the Powers section", which includes perfect healing and resurrection, breaking . [Technomagic: 5pts] makes it explicit that magic and technology can be combined. [Infrastructure: 2pts] reaches "across the globe", so free first-world everything everywhere. [Afterlife: 3pts] will catch anyone not saved by all the other safety nets; it's up to you, so just make it "reincarnation will all memories intact".

Future-proofing: [Fate: 3pts] means everything will be subtly but irresistibly guided into whatever. [Blessing: 2pts] guarentees that everything will be a utopia, which seems kind of broken but whatever. [Guidance 2: 10pts] contains "anything and everything that could be necessary to advance or improve oneself", but [Guidance 1: 4pts] grants "untold amounts of information and arcane guidance [...] guidance in any path you wish to take", and is also indestructible, so really this one's up to you.

Munchkinning: [Trapped!] isn't exactly a huge hardship, especially given you can move small parts of you territory into the real world and manipulate them at will. Neither is [Partnership!], given that you don't really need any extra personal benefits in this setting.

--------------

It's probably worth springing for [Secure], [Healthy], and [Public Education], all of which are 1pt each, just for that shiny new "Utopia" feel.

[Technology Upgrade 6: 6pts] gives you "singularity" levels of tech, whatever that means. [Automatons 2: 5pts] removes all menial labour, if that's not already covered (they're under your personal control.)

[Artifact!] is pretty much fine, although it may not be worth risking your [Blessing] for a measly 20pts. [Amnesia!] isn't too bad, either, especially given you have a magic book/library that'll tell you everything.
