  All complications may be resolved, provided you put forth sufficient time and effort into doing so. Complications have a lessened effect upon Familiars, and do not directly affect other companions at all.

hmmm...

[125] Trapped!

[150] Partnership!

[175] Artifact!

[200] Bound!

[225] Turmoil!

Free Points! Sure I'll have an evil split personality, but that's no problem because I'll have a partner to keep me in check. Also I'll be ditching my Power Artifact ASAP anyway. Who needs it? My familiar has a lesser form of all the powers I want anyway and eventually I'll outgrow the limitation.

[222] Familiar

[220] Inspiration

[218] Awareness

[216] Memory

[215] Tongues

[210] Dominion

[208] Conjuration

[206] Alchemy

[204] Healing

[202] Enchanting

[199] Nullification

[196] Time Manipulation

These ones all make sense for my familiar to be using. Conjuration and Alchemy together are specifically stated to directly violate the laws of thermodynamics, just in case Post-Singularity Tech proves insufficient.

[194] Division

One plane with one set of laws? Boring. Lets have... uh, all of them.

[190] Theme

[186] Pantheon

By the way. Pantheon + Dominion = Godbending. Avatar who?

[183] Fate

[180] Afterlife

Yeah, hows instantaneous reincarnation with all memories intact sound for an afterlife?

[179] Malice

[174] Dungeons 3

[172] Spirits

[167] Fauna & Flora 3

[164] Magical Phenomena

[161] Exceptional Materials

[159] Rich

[158] Fertile

[155] Landscape Adjustment

[153] Cosmic Adjustment

More word-building powers. Yawn. Ok now for the good stuff.

[152] Festival Affinity

[151] Warfare Affinity

[150] Sexual Affinity

[149] Gambling Affinity

[148] Food Affinity

[147] Sports Affinity

[146] Alcohol Affinity

[145] Gaming Affinity

[144] Mechanical Affinity

[143] Intellectual Affinity

[142] Nature Affinity

[141] Literature Affinity

[140] Art Affinity

[139] Occult Affinity

[138] Animation Affinity

[137] Theater Affinity

[136] Music Affinity

[135] Healthy

[134] Secure

[133] Sanitation

[131] Infrastructure

[126] Technomagic

[122] Mystical

[119] Industrial

[117] Wealthy

[115] Mercantile

[113] Diplomatic

[111] University

[110] Public Education

[108] Aesthetics

[98] Magical Upgrade 5

[92] Technology Upgrade 6

[88] Metahuman Population

[84] Extrahuman Population

[81] Population Longevity

[79] Pretty Population

[59] Population Increase 10

[44] Area Increase 8

Yeah, that sounds like a good Utopia suite for starters. And frankly, a solid utopia negates the need for most powers, since everyone effectively has most of them anyway. Who needs guaranteed wifus when there are a trillion people with post singularity tech and sexual affinity? Who needs guaranteed immortality when the society provides that for you? Who needs elemental affinities when magic and magitek are commonplace?

[41] Assimilation

[35] Protection 2

[32] Transient

[28] Portals

[23] Gateways 3

Planar Invincibility. Locomotion, etc.

[13] Divine Spark

Honestly, in spite of how breakable this whole thing is, it's still too limiting. I'm sure once I ascend to the level of whatever mad god set up this CYOA I'll have some more options accessible.

And as an afterthought, I'm not sure these make sense without my artifact on hand, but just in case I need to refresh my lifespan, or transform, or in case things go horribly horribly south...

[11] Immortality

[8] Spirit Walk

[3] Shape Shift 2

[1] Peak Condition

[0] Friendship 1

Oh right, giving all my friends my powers with no downside. Powers which include resurrection and violating thermodynamics. Seems good.
