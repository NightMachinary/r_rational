If I was trying to get everyone into the [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Beisutsukai][Beisutsukaiverse]] by connecting my demiplane to Earth (and then making myself a typical citizen after that):

Have everyone on Earth march through the gateways, which should take about a month, and you're as close as you're going to get using this CYOA. Plus Healing would let you pull off resurrections of dead people from Earth itself, so I threw that one in even though it's not Beisutsukai standard.
