Just as a joke I decided right off the bat to maximize my bauble number and took every single complication. However, knowing that I would have all of them, I "rolled" the randomizer to get 12*40 = 480 more baubles. I ended up clicking every single possible option and still had 300 baubles left over. This means that 280 baubles are sufficient to choose every possible option.

Just an interesting munchkin I found, but I think the starting baubles should be smaller to make the "story" better, because otherwise it's too easy to make a Heaven. So there must be some really terrifying monsters out there.
