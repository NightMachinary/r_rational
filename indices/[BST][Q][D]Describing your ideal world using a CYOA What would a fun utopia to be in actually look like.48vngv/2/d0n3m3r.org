I like the base premise, but the format seems kind of rigid. I took a few stabs at it, but each time gave up, feeling constrained. Not constrained, mind you, by the limited baubles - more by the alternately overly-discrete and maximally capped options. When imagining a fantasy world, I don't see the point in dithering around with unimaginably large quantities instead of jumping straight to infinity - an option consistently denied here. You can say that infinity's meaningless, and you can say that I should be satisfied with Graham's number or whatever, and I say, alright, but why am I expected to care about the difference between five times the size of the sun and a quarter the size of the sun for any reason except "hitting the highest number available"? "My fantasy world is thirty trillion square kilometers" is the nerd equivalent of "the streets of Heaven are paved with gold" - you're just offering up the material best thing you can imagine, and in the process demonstrating that you have a really terrible imagination. Yes, the amount of time required to fully exhaust the novelty of thirty trillion square kilometers cannot be meaningfully imagined by us, but this is [[/r/rational]], have we suddenly gone all deathist? As the linked Fun Theory sequence suggests, a common mark of bad theology - which is, let's face it, basically what we're doing here - is a critical failure to understand what the /eternal/, what the /infinite/, /means/.

Also, I never actually got so far in as to run short of baubles, but I weep for whoever spent their time contemplating, balancing, and assigning bauble values to various traits. What a waste of effort. Resource management and creativity can mix, but not, I feel, like this.

To be fair, I'm guessing some of this depends on knowledge of a specific tabletop setting with which I am unfamiliar.
