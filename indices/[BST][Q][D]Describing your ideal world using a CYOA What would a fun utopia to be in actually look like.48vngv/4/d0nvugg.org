I like this one. We see it on [[/r/makeyourchoice]] every now and then.

Does anyone happen to know if there are any tools that could be used to make my own interactive version of this? I've made a similar MYC set in my Fantasy world (so less world building and more carving out your own place in it), but since I don't have any artistic talent, I think the interactive version is the way to go.
