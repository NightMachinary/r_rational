I rolled five constraints, and that was enough to get absolutely everything I wanted with 38 points left over. It's easier to say what I didn't get than what I did:

Max Area increase, max Pop Increase, max Tech Upgrade, max Magic Upgrade. Did not get Attitude Adjustment or Population Demographics. Did not get Technomagic, it'll combine plenty without making things even weirder. Did not get Religious, Gambling, or Warfare Affinities. Did not get Magical Phenomena, that sounds horrible. Afterlife is volitional reincarnation (and if you come in from the outside, you are specifically given the option of undergoing this process, though it can of course happen at any time). Pantheon no way, Theme is eh and sounds monocultural. I only got Influence 1, although that seems undefined when I have Notorious. I don't have Equipment. I don't have Geas. No Harem or Familiar, though Waifu 2 seems to imply the same thing but with ideal partners.

Ambivalent complications: Partnership and Benevolent (can I make all inhabitants my partners?). Negative complications: Notorious and Exile (really hoping I would get Trapped instead of Exile, but it's finite anyway). Nightmare complications: Nightmare. The Nightmare is unspeakable, but named: he is also known as Donald Trump.

There, that was a much more useful and concise summary.
