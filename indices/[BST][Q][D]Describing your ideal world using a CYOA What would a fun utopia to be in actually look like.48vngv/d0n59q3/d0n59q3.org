Why does personal immortality only cost two when immortality for the entire population costs three? Do I not count as a citizen of my own realm?

The sadism option is interesting if you think about it for more than a second, because even if you need, say, 50,000 people in a giant torture machine to make it work, that's enough points to bring the total population up to a trillion and make them all fabulously wealthy (in addition to any other benefits you've given your subjects). Would be a more intriguing option if the point budget were tighter, since as is you kind of have enough to make a trillion people happy.
