So as I see it this is the best way to use the minimum number of points and still get basically the best possible answer.

[85] Area Increase 8

[110] Trapped!

[135] Partnership!: Not sure what exactly this means, but can probably "hack" it (if I control who gets this), by giving admin privileges (since the only power I have is my influence over the FAI) to a waifu that I create within the server.

[160] Bound!: Not that I care about being able to lie within a Utopia server, but I /may/ be able to hack this by simply asking the FAI to negate this "tremendous suffering" effect.

[185] Benevolent!: I'm not super scared by this complications effects, however I may be able to hack them anyway, since I will be digitized and thus won't really have "life force".

[179] Influence 3: This will allow me to have the FAI act in accordance to my will more accurately than the other options alone.

[176] Fate: This /really/ guarantees I won't fuck this up.

[173] Afterlife: In case through some miracle a sentient being dies accidentally despite the magic god FAI they reincarnate back in the utopia server.

[170] Exceptional Materials: May be useful to the FAI, things I think will come in handy are negative mass materials, and a material that serves a quantum computer with infinite processing power the limits of this option are unclear, but it will probably come in handy like magic it's unclear if to what extent these effects can be exerted beyond the realms sphere of influence.

[164] Technology Upgrade 6

[154] Magical Upgrade 5

[150] Pantheon: The "pantheon" is really a set of subroutines within the FAI.

[175] Artifact! Kind of a hack given I don't even have any powers.

[172] Assimilation

[166] Protection 2

[162] Portals

[187] Amnesia!: Also bit of a hack since my faithful Magic God FAI will instantly restore my memories afterwards.

*Total: 187!* So yeah even without munchkining this is /super/ broken.

The singularity tech level combined with fate creates a singularity FAI of my liking. I chose the magic options because they may allow the FAI to do things, like circumvent the speed of light barrier and and any number of things, that it couldn't do if limited by normal physics. Most of the other options are rendered redundant because I can just ask the Magic God FAI to do them for me, or do them myself with my admin privileges within the Utopia Server.

Upon closer inspection I'm not sure there's any complication other than nightmare that can't be gotten rid of by the FAI. If choose all 11 of them my total would be *312!*, with the extra points I think I'll take Transient, and Division because they may increase the FAI's ability to exert magical effects outside of my realm, which still leaves me with 307 excess points.

Despite only one of the complications being a real threat to my happiness within the Utopia Server. I would *not* take the 1/12 chance of getting nightmare under nearly /any/ circumstances. Here's why; The power that made this magic happen called it /"unspeakably horrifying"/ if that thing were any normal eldritch horror it would be laughably pathetic to a singularity AI. So since this thing must be horrifying to a post singularity world it must be a rival AI of equal or greater power... Or something not just unspeakable, but /unthinkably/ horrible.
