This one hits themes that we're interested in, and tackles it in a seriously interesting way, but it doesn't feel like "ratfic." I think a ratfic hero would have found a better way to handle the problem.

I suspect that if the story had included a few paragraphs calculating probabilities of alternate plans working and their failure modes, and changed nothing else, it would fit the ratfic feel? But that would have dulled the emotional punch at the end. And it would have felt very much like the author making excuses for the protag. Which makes writing ratfic a hell of a quandry. Does anyone else think it would have made the end weaker?
