It would feel more ratfic, but would totally ruin it. I can't imagine how it could be done well.

I don't quite understand this story, I think. Becker has a backdoor in her aug which shuts down her consciousness for 20-60 seconds following exposure to the radio signal, right? After which it no longer works, and she gets around that using a system clock change (lol as if). What's the motivation of the person/group who set up her killing the students?

And I agree, it seems like a weak way to address the problem. By this time mass shootings would have been occurring for a century, her actions wouldn't make a difference. I think. Certainly wouldn't stop China.
