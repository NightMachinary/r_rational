My understanding was that the first killings were set up in order to establish a precedent: something like this was going to happen sometime, so make it happen now, when you're ready, with the perfect candidate, so that people with sympathize and see things your way, and will therefore be much more likely to continue seeing it your way in future cases because the jury of public opinion has already agreed that these things just happen and they're sad industrial accidents rather than awful war crimes.
