Fun podcast, it's funny the things that they infer from the early parts of the story that turn out to be, well, maybe not fully correct.

Could I clear something up that's not a spoiler and will hopefully prevent a bunch of speculation about something that they misinterpret? There's no meaningful connection between the placement of the stats and the placement of the skills. The skills are mostly ordered so that the physical skills are at the top, mental in the middle, and social on the bottom, but that's the only real pattern. If woodworking was at the top instead of one handed weapons, or even if the skills were completely shuffled, nothing would change mechanically.
