That is a spoiler. I remember there being a connection and I remember eventually noticing the discrepancy of my assumption on my own. There's no reason to warn a new reader about it.

As for the reason why it is an even remotely meaningful spoiler, the only thing that truly reveals that this is a mistaken assumption is when said skills change. Spoiling this might make something like that happen a bit less surprising.
