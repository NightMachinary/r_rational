  Has he really slowed?

Absolutely. It's been last year things started to slow down. For your average writer it's still an okay speed, I think (going by the chapter spreadsheet the chapters coming in a few days were at a speed at roughly 400 words/day - before that he was at well over a thousand if my memory isn't going completely bonkers)
