You could have the ratio between a person's height (or some other measurement/quality, maybe related to their mind's extraphysicality) and the distance at which they can apply mathemagic be the e or the golden ratio or pi or 1 or something, although if you choose some measurement other than distance you're back to the problem of non-fundamental units (because the physical meaning of meters/flerg = 1 is entirely dependent on how much length one meter is or how much florp one flerg is (basically, changing your unit system should not cause the actual physical amount of whatever to change)).

Although... in a similar way as that one story where humanity had latent magical ability that shaped their culture (I forget the name, sorry), you could have it be that humanity chose the SI units to be the way they are because of the influence of their undiscovered mathemagicality, like meters being what they are just felt right because of this e-meters range result.
