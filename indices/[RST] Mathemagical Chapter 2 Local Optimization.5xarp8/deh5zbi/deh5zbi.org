Wait, "e meters"? Meters? Why not e yards, or e kilometers, or e atomic units, or e astronomical units, or e planck lengths? Unless it's another thing like only being able to move 'objects' from a human perspective, e meters is about as physically/mathematically significant as 3/14 being pi day.

Personal hang-ups aside, I am enjoying this story.
