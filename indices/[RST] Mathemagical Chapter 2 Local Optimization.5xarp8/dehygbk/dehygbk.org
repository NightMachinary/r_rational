Interesting beginning! I'm curious to see where this is going

Agreed with the other commenters on e meters being extremely weird, although there are plausibly justifiable explanations.

The whole Mei Fong interaction was extremely weird, eg. terminology like "the outside view" is not common parlance, so it seems odd that Mei Fong would use it naturally /and/ Sarah treat it as an entirely normal and unremarkable phrase. There are again plausible explanations for that though, like mind reading or just different linguistic evolution in this universe.

Typos:

  It looked like I'd be lucking out on this gamble.

In the context, this seems to be the exact opposite of what you intend

  My guess was on Dokan's *surprised* being genuine.
#+end_quote

Also, that whole section seems odd, since Dokan doesn't seem surprised at all. "a small smile" seems more smug/knowing than surprised
