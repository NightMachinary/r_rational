Hey everyone, The second chapter of Mathemagical is out, and I hope you enjoy reading it!

/[Story notes / thoughts below, feel free to skip unless interested.]/

In total, this chapter took me about 15 hours to write and edit. That seems like a long time, and if any writers want to chime in about their writing speed, I'd be interested. (My speed would be approximately 400 words per hour at this rate.)

When writing rationalist fiction, I'm always unsure what the ratio of actual rationality knowledge to fiction is, and I may have erred on the side of too much with this chapter.

I'm a big fan of people like Alexander Wales, who can write stories that seamlessly integrate good thinking processes into their characters. That's really awesome.

A lot of the inspiration for Mathemagical comes from HPMOR and Unsong, and there will likely be more nods and similarities as we move forward.

A lot of things happened this chapter, and I had somewhat considered breaking it into several chapters. But I personally like reading for plot, so I hope people are okay with the slightly faster pace (compared to other fics). Also as a result, I don't think that the entire story will total longer than 7-10 ish chapters at this rate.

We meet two new characters this time around. Mei Fong was a hard character to write; I'm still unsure about her characterization 100%, but I do think she's quite interesting.

If anyone wants to further some speculation about where this story is headed, I'd love to see some crazy/plausible things in the suggestions. I have a direction, but I suspect the hive mind here could give me some great ideas!
