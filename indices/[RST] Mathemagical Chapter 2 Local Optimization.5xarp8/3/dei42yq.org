Based on the risk of magic (and potential cosmic destruction) becoming more widely known, is Sarah really sure it's a wise idea to try to use her powers for something (and if the risks are more limited, is it even such a bad idea to have knowledge of magic spread)?

  Then things folded in on themselves rather neatly.

Sure they did. No reason to feel suspicious about this whatsoever.

  But the point remained that for the vast majority of the time, the distance between me and the object I was affecting was e.

The main issues with the unit meter have already been pointed out, but I'm sort of wondering why they get something that precise. 2.7 meters seems ok, but anything more precise is suspicious, and e could just be a number close to that that seems reasonable (rather like the golden ratio; any ratio close to 1.6 is often argued to be the golden ratio).

How is distance to Sarah even measured anyway? Closest point on her body in three dimensions? Distance to center of mass? Brain? Eyes? Likewise, how did they decide on how to measure the distance to Sarah. It seems odd to find e on their first guess of what range means. Did they do tests like having Sarah stand, having Sarah stand with one leg stretched towards the object, and measuring how that affected distance (that one should allow one to distinguish between distance to closest point on body and center of mass/brain at least, possibly between center of mass and brain as well)?

  "Sounds good. Except that if we become a battery, we'll probably be locked up somewhere, forced to do the same thing over and over until we die," my brain said.

Nah, they'd just force/persuade you to teach others to do it as well. It's known that people can learn to do this, so it'd be far more efficient to train many people. And the moment one of them figures out it's all math... well... let's just hope that cosmic destruction remains impossible. I'd be so tempted to apply more interesting transformations than mere translations... Just a little function f(x) = 1/x. How bad can it get?

  "I can assure you that I'm not working with the US government or anyone else but myself," Mei Fong said, as if reading my mind.

The rest of the conversation does little to disabuse us of that final notion. That or more likely spying on everything that has gone on so far, including the meeting with Andre. Really, mentioning the e thing the day Sarah found out about it? Very, very suspicious. Spying (possibly by magical/mathematical means, assuming Mei is indeed not working with anyone else) seems rather more plausible than mind-reading, since a mind-reader would have a lot more options to prove themselves.
