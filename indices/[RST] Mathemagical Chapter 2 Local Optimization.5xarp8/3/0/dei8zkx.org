Hey, thanks for pointing out things in the story that aren't working! I'm lowering my confidence in my ability to pull off a strong story; a lot of your questions are things I agree are not well thought out, like the weird unit being unclear, and how more interesting functions exist. I myself am admittedly not good at this whole "try to munchkin the universe" thing.
