I'm only a couple chapters in and screaming at him to experiment with magic more. He /flipped an effing coin/ to decide which way to go, at a moment I was thinking he should be trying "As surely as my name's not Wendell / Transport me to the village of Trendle". For that matter, "As I wish upon a star / duplicate this candy bar." I mean, /experiment/ a little FFS. :(

On this basis, I don't think James qualifies as even a level 1 intelligent character, as he fails the "does stuff the audience would instantly shout at him to do" test.
