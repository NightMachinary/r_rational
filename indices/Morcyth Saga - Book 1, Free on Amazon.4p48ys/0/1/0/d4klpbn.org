Same here, I've finished the book. It's a fun and quick read but there's multiple times when I wanted to shout at the character and tell him to do something.

He has magic but instead of using tried and true methods, he tends to try new impressive feats of magic without even knowing if they'll exhaust him or not. Just as an example, he already used once magic to kill 3 people in the same room almost instantly by throwing pieces of wood through their heart.

He's later confronted with four riders that he could just kill in the same way by throwing stones, instead he decides to create a tornado that nearly exhausts him.

It's also repeated that he might die of exhaustion by doing magic if he doesn't know the energy requirements of a spell but he repeatedly tries new and never tested spells during battles. A more clever character would have spent more time testing and exploring the limits of the magic system instead of just winging it.

That said, it's like schooled in magic (a barely rational book recommended in this sub recently), it's a good way to pass time without thinking much...

EDIT: I quite agree with the amazon review...
