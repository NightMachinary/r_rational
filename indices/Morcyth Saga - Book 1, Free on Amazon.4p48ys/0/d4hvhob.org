I read this book a while ago and I liked reading about a smart character transported to a new world as a newbie wizard. I /think/ this was one of the earlier books in the portal fantasy genre, so some of the tropes might be old hat to you (especially the D&D references). But I like how fast-paced it is and the main character is fairly clever in inventing uses for his magic as well as being somewhat rational in how he approaches dealing with the natives of the world. Side note, the magic is not the same as D&D magic, but it was based off of it.

It's slightly tricky for me to say if this is actually a rational story, but there are no moments where anyone is holding the idiot ball and this is a story I think people here would like. Also it's free so people aren't losing anything money-wise if they buy it. Although the other /six/ books in the series aren't free, so the first book is most likely free to entice you into buying it.

Let me know if anyone else has read it. I'm curious to hear if other people think the story has elements of rationality in it.

EDIT: Oops after a few comments, it looks people here don't agree with the idea that this is a good story to recommend to this subreddit. My apologies!
