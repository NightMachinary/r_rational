Well yes, I actually read all the books of Schooled in Magic. It's not rational and there's been a few times when I wanted to shout at Emily for being too emotional or behaving stupidly but it was still fun enough that I read all the books so it's got a point in it's favor :)

I don't think I'll read the next book of Morcyth saga though.
