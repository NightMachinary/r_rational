I bet that despite Amaryllis' statement that she would kill Fenn if they spent a month together alone in a small room, she and Fenn will likely attempt doing so for at least one of the remaining months if only because Fenn doesn't want Amaryllis to spend more time with Juniper.

I also have to comment on how Juniper comes off as a teenager in the last chapter during the conversation with Amaryllis rather than the young adult he's been earlier in the story. There's nothing too obvious, but it feels like he's having trouble dealing with the emotionally charged issues in a way that feels very teenager-like rather than adult-like and I have no idea why I have this impression. Something, something about not being very good at keeping things at an emotional distance?

As a general impression, Juniper has seemed fairly mature and competent when in dangerous situations and dealing with the game-quests. However, he has often fallen short and frequently stumbles when dealing with the social aspects of interactions which is only partially mitigated by the rest of the group being older, more worldly, and are aware that he's trying. I'd be curious to hear if anyone has a different understanding of his character.

Edit: Expanded on the first paragraph and grammar corrections.
