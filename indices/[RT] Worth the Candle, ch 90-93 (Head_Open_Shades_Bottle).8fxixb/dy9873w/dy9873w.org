I hadn't really expected /Groundhog Day/ to be relevant again. I think Arthur is being a bit too harsh on that beloved classic, but he's been through a lot. I'll give him a pass for that. Groundhog day is also about being able to /change/ anything you want and have none of it matter, raising profound philosophical doubts about what, if anything, has meaning in that kind of scenario. Then, of course, Phil Connors learns to play the piano.

...Maybe our heroes need to give the house an instrument. Not necessarily magically. Just hand one over.

Omar Antoun got a bad deal with his forge frenzy. In fairness, his was before they were well-known (if not well-/understood/.) If the magical nature of entads is verifiable, maybe the correct response is some sort of program to care for these people in exchange for the entads. It seems like an expensive and difficult thing to fake. The hardest part might be trying to determine how far back the effect started.

How long /was/ Omar affected? Was his whole life planned so that he'd be that guy making that house? Does the DM "inspire" frenzies directly?

We still haven't really answered Grak's technical question as to how Zona can operate as a warder.

  “You don't want to hear the end?” asked Zona[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDs_RPoAZX0][.]]

There's /more/?

What /should/ the outcome of Ropey + Zona be? What is Juniper thinking? Is Ropey supposed to stand in for friendliness?

-----

EDIT to restore:

oh, and we narrowly missed the moment where Juniper and Zona connected as DMs, in a way. Maybe he just needs to get some rest. Then he can teach the house to DM in ways that do not involve gruesome horror.

Hm, missed the update by nearly an entire day. Clearly I need a better notification system. No-tiff-ication.

Meta joke: I alt-tabbed to a streamer I follow, and we in chat were surprised when a cat appeared. I think browser tabs count as a book.
