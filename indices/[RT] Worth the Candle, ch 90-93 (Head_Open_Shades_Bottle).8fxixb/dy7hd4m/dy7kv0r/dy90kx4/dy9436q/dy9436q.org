It's a Tome of Cat Summoning, not a Tome of Cat Conjuring. Assuming that descriptor is accurate, the cats aren't created, they're brought from another plane of existence, and if they're killed or the Summoning spell is otherwise disrupted, they get sent back home to their own plane, completely unhurt.

So, no, they probably don't die.
