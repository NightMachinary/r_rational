I read this update with rapt attention, and time flew by. I was sad when there was no more, but I'm so excited to read this arc through. I also really love how your story doesn't cast itself into a particular mold and stick there, it really feels alive.

Also, I loved how tangible the interpersonal tension (as well as his inner conflict) felt, and found myself both rooting for Fenn and Juniper and Amaryllis all at the same time.

Thanks for the chapters. :)
