I also have a thing for dialogue that progresses a relationship, but still leaves the consequences open. And the interactions, moments where Joon made a social slip-up that revealed his thought processes to the others or snuck a clever message to Mary (via Aesopian language? not quite sure what the term is for this kind of double entendre) or the group's reading of Mary's uncharacteristic mistake coming out without armor, were my favorite parts.

Though I suspect things will come to a head in the time chamber sooner rather than later, with how things were between them on their first real day.
