Kinseys research was mainly based not on surveys, but on a huge body of interviews, which is both good - in that the lizardman constant is a lot lower when giving bullshit replies means you have to lie to a well trained interviewer to their face, and bad in that it put a lot of selection pressure on his data.

By the nature of the process, he got information about the sexual habits of people willing to sit down and tell a grad student about their sexuality, which is.. probably not a very representative sample of the population as a whole.

It also has not been replicated much, but that is mostly because people doing follow-up research just did not generally have the funds or the disciples to do in-person interviews by the thousands. So they used surveys instead.

What this means is that Kinseys numbers on how common various things are, are almost certainly wrong, due to sample bias.

That is not what Amarylis used his research for, however, and on things like "These are types of human sexuality that exists" Kinsey is a magnificent source. Because, well, he and his grad students talked to one heck of a lot of people.

Note that there /are/ no good data on how common various sexualities or kinks are - We have a hard lower bound (1.3 %) based on the rate of same sex marriages in jurisdictions where it has been legal for a long time - marrying someone of the same sex is a statement that says "I am queer" with a whole lot more credibility than any survey, and the numbers from year 10 though 15 after legalization sampling the entire population fairly without any "we have been living together for 20 years and it is legal now" effects.

However that number is unlikely to be even close to the real prevalance, because it only gets those members of the queer community who settle down into long-term monogamy and want to make that a legal commitment, which given the subcultures, uhm, yhea.

Surveys return answers all over the map, depending on how they are phrased. The highest numbers come from surveys that simply ask what gender your last sex partner was. These are the ones that sneak into double-digit percentages. Apparently there are a whole lot of people having same-sex sex without considering themselves anything other than straight.
