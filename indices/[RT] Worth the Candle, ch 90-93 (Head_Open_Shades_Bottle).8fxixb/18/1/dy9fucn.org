  Was his whole life planned so that he'd be that guy making that house? Does the DM "inspire" frenzies directly?

we dont know if the "npc" characters are full simulated human brains, like Joon seemingly is, or if they are simpler AI. (The former would require ridiculous amounts of processing power given the size of the world, but who knows.) The DM has already been shown to be able to implant information into minds, as with Joon's acquiring new knowledge and skills, so the forge frenzy would simply be that taken up to 11, with a single overpowering desire incorporated into it. If they're something more like the AI we make with modern techology its pretty trivial.
