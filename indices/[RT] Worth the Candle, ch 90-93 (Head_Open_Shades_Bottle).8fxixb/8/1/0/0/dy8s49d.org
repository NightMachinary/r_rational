She gave a non committal agreement that she was into girls, but said "You knew before I did?" when Joon said that she was asexual. I would read the engagement as her being a stressed and confused teenager regarding her sexuality, leaning somewhat heavily towards being not being interested in sex in general. I think she wants companionship more than anything, and she's latching onto the first person who likes her as a person rather than due to her heritage. It doesn't get brought up much, but she's an orphan, and definitively did not have a happy childhood after her parents died.
