ah, there we go! figured it might have been mentioned earlier, but couldn't recall. At ~4 days per hour you get the 40 week pregnancy done with in ~70 hours (or 280*(1+15)/60 = 74.7 hours, with no friction) -- too bad they're on such a time crunch or this might have been more easily manageable, and bought each of them several months of R&R too. A weekly rotation puts them at 40*(7+15)/60 = 14.7 h, vs the 10*(28+15)/60 = 7.2 h it's taking them now. Though I suppose they might need several years if the dryad emerges altricial (which would further cramp the chamber if companions tag along).

I wonder if the time dilation chamber works on the locus/bottle? Could help with their limited space problems in the future if so (or if there are other, generalized magics that could shrink them or expand space). Also, can the time dilation chamber slow time for its contents? They might have considered chucking the bottle in if so and buggering off on other quests, though that would not have been without risks.
