  “But if you can't stay stuck in a room with Amaryllis for a month without fucking her -- if I can't let you go into a room with her for a month without flipping my lid -- then yeah, I'm going to choose to believe the best of you, her, and myself.”

I love this part, and this chapter in general. I think this crystallizes what I was thinking about the speculation last thread, where people were saying that Joon couldn't go in the chamber with Mary because then he'd totally have sex with her.

  “Pregnancy hormones must be getting to me.” I pulled back from her. “You're not --” “It was a joke, Juniper,” said Fenn, laughing.

Jackass.

  “Is there ... some variation in pancakes across Aerb?” “They're crepes,” said Amaryllis.
#+end_quote

That made me laugh. But speaking as someone who eats crepes every so often, and ate pancakes a few times in the US... yeah, there's no comparison. Pancakes are just sooooo much better.

  The multitude of species on Aerb are also a problem -- sorry, not a problem, but a possible explanation for why we're progressing so slowly

I love how politically correct Mary is. I guess that's something she had to worry about a lot, working with the Empire of Common Cause.

  This was a slower method of distributing technologies, but it would reap us greater personal rewards, some of which would funnel back toward the ‘adventuring' side of things, if we still had cause to do that (which we both assumed would be the case).
#+end_quote

"But if we bring the world to a new technological, cultural and political revolution, we'll become the /best murderhobos ever/!!!" I like Mary's thinking here. So long as they don't stop meeting new people and almost getting killed in stupid ways. It worked for Uther!

  “The backpack doesn't allow me access to a computer, lap computer, or intelligent phone, but it does allow printouts of websites.”
#+end_quote

Oh wow. Is there anything the bagpack can't do? Doesn't affect the plot my ass.

(eheh, intelligent phone)

  "I've been in this room for longer than I've known you. Most of my time as a member of this group will have been spent waiting for the pregnancy to progress."

That's an interesting point, and something they usually don't consider when writing time-travel stories. I remember reading a summary of a game session of a time-travel RPG; and at one point, one character needed gun skills for a combat encounter, so she time-travelled out of the fight, spent two weeks on a range learning how to use a gun, then time-travelled back to the fight scene. I remember being really... I don't know, amused by this scene, and the fact that these two weeks were treated as a ten-seconds parenthesis and "now you have combat skills!". One of the players told me "well, that's the principle of the game, you can leverage your time powers", but I'm not sure he really got it; and that he got how /long/ two weeks are. Like, after the fight scene, the character would probably have forgotten any conversation they were having, would probably be a little hazy on the progress of their quest, they'd probably be dressed differently, etc.

  I'd have liked to believe that if Amaryllis had tried to seduce me, I would have pushed her off and left the time chamber early, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like I was just fantasizing instead of worrying.
#+end_quote

Oh, so Joon likes to fantasize about attractive young girls trying to seduce him and him maturely rejecting them? That is very weird! And I've never fantasized about it!

  “It makes me think,” I said, frowning slightly. “It makes me think about the choices that Arthur was faced with, and how he dealt with them.” I let out a shaky breath. “The thing I'm really worried about is that this is the tip of the iceberg. That it's a single grain of sand on the beach, that the further we probe, the more we're going to see, and I'm going to find that he was destroyed by this place, back from the dead but then scrubbed away.” I swallowed. “Or, maybe, something worse. I don't know.”

You know, I feel kind of weird speculating about Uther. My understanding is that, this being a SI story, Uther is at least somewhat based on a deceased childhood friend of the author. It's mostly fictional and all, but it's still kind of awkward to say "This guy is callous" or "This guy will probably turn out to be the villain" or comment on the stuff he ripped off from Earth culture, knowing that at least some of the personality I'm commenting on is based from a real person.

Also, I'm not sure what to say about the "Uther had sex with Zona" part that isn't obvious. It's... a creative way to introduce sexual exploitation in a story, I guess. Bleh.

Moving on, one thing I really like about this story is how big the world is.

Alot of fantasy and science fiction revolves around one community, usually a reintepretation of some aspect of American society that inspired the author. In Demolition Man, the world is Los Angeles; in 1984, the world is made of three variations of an uniform totalitarian dystopia; in DC and Marvel (and if we're honest, Worm), the world in changed by the rise of superheroes, 95% of which are American; in Stargate, every planet only has one town of relevance, within walking distance of its gate.

And that's fine, because all these works want to deliver their message or their escapism, and it's easier to do that with a narrow scope; but it also feels like something is lost on aggregation, like writers are collectively saying that the world is simple, and there's only ever one aspect of it that matters. Which makes me wish for works that say "no, the world is diverse and complicated, and you can't make broad statements about it because different places have different cultures".

I think this is something alexanderwales really nails in his works, and this one in particular; the cultures feel varied, which is reflect both in the exposition, and the fact that the protagonists can spend months going in a new country every week, and still remain continents away from the Empire that's after them.

Well, that's it for this chapter!
