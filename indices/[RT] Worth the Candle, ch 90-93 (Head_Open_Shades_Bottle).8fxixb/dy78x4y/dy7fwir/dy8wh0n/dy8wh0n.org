I actually tried it both ways, and when said aloud, "sentient square mile" sounded too alliterative - like it's almost, but not quite, a tongue twister. Or maybe off in some other way, like it was violating some intuitive aspect of adjective ordering. I've changed it to "square mile of sentient forest", which reads better, since you're technically correct (the best kind of correct).
