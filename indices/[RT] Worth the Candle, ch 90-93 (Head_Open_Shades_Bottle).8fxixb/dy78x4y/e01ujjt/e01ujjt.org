Ch. 92, Uther talks to *Raven* about /Groundhog Day/. But later in the same chapter Dolmada says that she "overheard him talking to *Vervain* about how his life was like a story". Not sure if this is an error or if it is meant to convey that Uther has talked about the story with more than one companion, so I am reporting it just in case.
