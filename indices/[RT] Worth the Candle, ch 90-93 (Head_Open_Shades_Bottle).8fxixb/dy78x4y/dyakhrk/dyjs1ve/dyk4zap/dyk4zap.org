I've always wondered about making a web site for authors specifically looking for typo feedback.

Say something that works like google docs. The author would paste their chapter and it would be open to the public to look through. They would find typos and be able to fix them as they go. On the main document that the author sees, the typo's people found would be highlighted in red and their suggestions would be highlighted in green. UI could be tweaked in any way to make this optimal, but basically a few key points: A way for the author to see the before-after of (multiple?) solutions people presented and the paragraph for context. Then clicking the suggested fix that the author likes best (Or pass if they all suck.) and the program skips over to the next typo found without scrolling or treasure hunting. Maybe even allow users to add details on why they picked that suggestion if it's some grammar involved.

Never sure if it would be worth the cand- effort to make though. Immediate problem would be trolls abusing this but there's plenty of solutions to that. Could be fixed by either implementing a vote system or giving permission keys to people the author trusts. It seems like a good idea for fanfic writers, although I'm 80% sure there's a reason I can't think of on why this idea wouldn't be practical.
