These chapters were just so...crushing...

I think it's kinda cuz like...Joon and Amaryllis /didn't/ do anything. That they /didn't/ succumb. Cuz if you did, you could say "ha it's just that typical trope" and like...you're accustomed to that stuff already. But now it's just like...like Amaryllis. There's this emotional suspense that just isn't gonna go away.

And that's all, like, after Arthur turns out to be kind of a deranged self-destructive deeplier-than-expected flawed individual.
