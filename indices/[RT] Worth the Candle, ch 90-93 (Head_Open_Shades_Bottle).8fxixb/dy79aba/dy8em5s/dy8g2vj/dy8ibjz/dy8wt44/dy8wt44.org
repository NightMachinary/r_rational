Sorry for getting personal, but I think you're having a problem with this because you're the kind of person who sees "brutally honest" as a virtue, and tends to focus more on the "brutal" than the "honest".

  There's no (good) solution here, because an author might genuinely feel that way (even about good criticism).

Being polite and charitable isn't a slippery slope. In 99% of situations you can be direct and to the point and not an hypocrite, and still be kind and charitable and respect the fact that you may be missing something in your criticism. Even saying stuff like "I know it's a small detail, but I wanted to point it out" can make criticism less unpleasant to read. (I mean, I'm not in the author head, this is just general etiquette)
