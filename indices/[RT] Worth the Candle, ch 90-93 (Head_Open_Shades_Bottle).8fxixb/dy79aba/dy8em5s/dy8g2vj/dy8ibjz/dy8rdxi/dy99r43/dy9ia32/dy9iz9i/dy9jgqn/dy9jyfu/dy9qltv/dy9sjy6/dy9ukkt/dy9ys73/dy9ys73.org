  I recognize the overall point you are making is that we shouldn't criticize others for offering criticisms.
#+end_quote

I'm not even saying that. I think it's a perfectly valid position to take that we shouldn't offer criticism if it will impact an author's motivation.

#+begin_quote
  But what I disagree with is its relevancy to this situation since I felt that particular user was not performing to the subreddit's standards. You think otherwise so agree to disagree. Not much else we can say about that.
#+end_quote

The only comment I saw seemed fine. I reacted only to the top comment that seemed to me to portray [[/r/rational]] as some subreddit plagued by too much criticism, poorly formed and written by multiple idiots.

#+begin_quote
  Now as to the overall point I was trying to make that you mostly ignored, it is that you are being insulting to others in this thread by insinuating that this subreddit is going downhill and I object to that.
#+end_quote

It's certainly an insult to say someone isn't up to what I think is the calibre of the subreddit so yes, I don't disagree that I was being insulting to that particular individual. Again, I'm not insinuating it, I am vocally stating it. I'm not trying to "ignore the point" and "pick at semantics" I am trying to clarify and avoid being tarnished by your insults.

#+begin_quote
  If you had not been insulting in your tone and attitude then I am sure I would never have been compelled to write anything at all and would have just considered your points.
#+end_quote

I prefer discussion over non-discussion and since my original comment that sparked this furious debate (my meandering thoughts on the moral obligations of commentary) which was apparently insulting (unintentionally so) then apparently there is a perverse incentive for me.

I can't say I would spark much of a discussion with something less insulting like this comment: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8fxixb/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_9093_headopenshadesbottle/dy7dgg1/]]

Just as an example.
