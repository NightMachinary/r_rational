#+begin_quote
  Are you an alt for the account in question?
#+end_quote

I am literally baffled that you would say this but it's pretty clear you haven't taken any sort of objective approach on this matter from your "bad faith" comments earlier.

#+begin_quote
  You have very similar writing styles... My apologies if not.
#+end_quote

I cannot possibly think you, a reader of [[/r/rational]], genuinely believe that people with similar writing styles (which by the way isn't the case, since that person doesn't even bother with correct capitalisation) are alts of each other. On top of me not even knowing what comment you were referring to until halfway down the thread.

I'll go with the old do not assign that to malice which can be assigned to incompetence and assume you've somehow forgotten that I had no idea what you were referring to at the start of this conversation.

#+begin_quote
  In any case, I'm not going to rehash the arguments here,
#+end_quote

It's hard for me not to respond with more confusion here because at no point have you ever made any arguments. There's no argument by you in another thread (you left a tiny comment calling him mean), and you've made a total of one point in your replies to me here and I doubt you consider that an argument. What exactly is being rehashed?

#+begin_quote
  I'm unlikely to respond to anything else you write here.
#+end_quote

I am saddened that users of this subreddit would respond to a discussion with this kind of comment.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like talking to you hasn't been very pleasant so far.
#+end_quote

I always make sure to close my ears when someone starts to suggest I might be in the wrong, because it's not pleasant to be wrong.

#+begin_quote
  Have a nice day.
#+end_quote

You too.
