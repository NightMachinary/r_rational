  I actually thought you were an alt for the aforementioned redditor at first as well since you are taking a hard stance on something you don't know anything about and doubling down with arguing your opinion in a similar manner.
#+end_quote

Well I guess you're an alt of the guy I was talking to /s

I didn't take any hard stance prior to quoting the original comment, did you read any of my previous comments? I mused.

#+begin_quote
  I can see how it can be annoying for many that you persist in insulting others in the thread by your passive aggressive comments suggesting this subreddit is falling below standards when that isn't the case.
#+end_quote

How is that passive aggressive? It seems quite direct to me.

#+begin_quote
  I think it is reasonable for people to not want an annoying heckler around who was adding nothing of value every week.
#+end_quote

The old, I don't agree with someone so they provide nothing of value one. I too could only dream of the days where everyone in this subreddit 100% agreed with everything I posted.

#+begin_quote
  The reason I say you don't know anything about what you are talking about is because you seem to be unaware of the situation because you only looked at the previous thread (after you already started your uniformed rant apparently)
#+end_quote

Well I read (and by that I mean skimmed) the previous thread when I originally read the chapters, but I did not read the subcomments within that thread. Also "rant"? What are you talking about? How can someone read that tone into my comment?

#+begin_quote
  and didn't look at all of the previous threads from the past couple of months where the person in question admitted to not liking the story but persisted in overtaking every thread with hundreds of comments with continuous nonconstructive negativity.
#+end_quote

No I did not do that at all. I binged this story and haven't read any of the other comment threads and certainly didn't stalk the users profile history.

#+begin_quote
  The continuous negative nitpicks, which almost everyone thought were not actually valid points, grated on almost everyone including the author and I think everyone was hoping that this thread would be better after the author addressed the issue in the last thread.
#+end_quote

I don't know if you expect me to go through what is apparently hundreds of comments of a user (which I just checked that user has indeed made in their entire reddit history a whole 102 comments on this subreddit, I presume they have done nothing but comment on worth the candle) to see if we all suddenly agree that they are "negative nitpicks" or whatever you classify criticism you disagree with as but the only point I read regarding the dragons seemed, if minor, a completely valid criticism which Alexander responded to with completely valid responses.

#+begin_quote
  Unfortunately, you are actively taking efforts to take his spot as the heckler in the back that ruins everyone's mood so I hope you can understand why no one is taking your insults to the subreddit seriously.
#+end_quote

I didn't intend to come across that I was confused or perplexed that other people have a problem with people criticising works they like. Because I am of the strong opinion that most people absolutely hate any form of criticism however well meaning against a work they enjoy. I am simply making the observation that when I was more active in this subreddit other people having different opinions than you on a story didn't "ruin everyone's mood". Certainly, I would never have expected a "backlash" against me going off topic and conceptualising about the optimal feedback where maximal fiction production is achieved a few years ago.
