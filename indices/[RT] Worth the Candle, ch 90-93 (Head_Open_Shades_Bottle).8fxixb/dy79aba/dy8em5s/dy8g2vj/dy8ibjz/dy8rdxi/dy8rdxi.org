  Well it's weird because you said plural idiots and "poorly formed criticism" is not a defence...

I didn't write the word "idiots" anywhere -- I think you meant to respond to the original commenter.

Re: your second paragraph, my diagnosis is that this isn't what's happening. There was one (or maybe two) commenters who (IMHO) were just plain mean; in general, the author seems to take criticism well. I think it's fine to object to mean commentary, and welcome well-intentioned commentary; admittedly, it's subjective, but at least in this case, I think the situation has been pretty clear-cut.
