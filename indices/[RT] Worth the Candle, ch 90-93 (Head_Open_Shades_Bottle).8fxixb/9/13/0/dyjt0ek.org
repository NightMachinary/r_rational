Fixed those, thanks.

I think I disagree with that last one? "have been" refers to the glasses, which are plural. Compare:

#+begin_quote
  There have been birds on the lake.
#+end_quote

Or

#+begin_quote
  There has been birds on the lake.
#+end_quote

Shouldn't "have" be in agreement with "glasses", which is plural?
