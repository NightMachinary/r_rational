Fixed those, thanks.

I really do appreciate the typo corrections, it's just one of those things that I would automate away if I could, because it's basically data entry. (Well, maybe 90% data entry for the stuff that's obviously wrong when it's pointed out to me, and 10% mildly fun stuff like learning new language rules or searching out etymology/usage.)

For example, the form of the idiom "worse for the wear". I can find cites for it both ways (though mine is definitely less common), so I'll probably keep it, since I don't want to just scrub out absolutely all of my idiolect. (Funny enough, you can see [[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=the+worse+for+the+wear%2C+worse+for+wear&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cthe%20worse%20for%20the%20wear%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cworse%20for%20wear%3B%2Cc0][one winning out over the other]] in Google's n-gram viewer back in the 1820s.)
