  There's a difference between her saying "no" and Joon needing four paragraphs to explain what a gift economy is, and then giving her time to digest the concept, and her saying "yes" and needing a sentence just to (Watsonian-reason) verify that they do have the same concept in mind and (Doylist-reason) explain it to the readers briefly.

Maybe, that summary seems to do it justice well enough though. What more would you need to add?

  Probably at least all those who are at the same time kings.

Yeah someone already said "she learned it from Arthur" and I already responded to why I didn't think that. Maybe I misunderstood the whole child abuse thing.

  Until such time you're being needlessly aggressively, by merely assuming that the house must by-default be ignorant in regards to economics, and that there must be an explicit reason if she's not ignorant.

Aggressive? Can you explain why you think that's an appropriate word choice for someone thinking that a character knowledge feels out of place? Of all things you could have described the comment as, you went with aggressive? Really?

If you really think the comment is aggressive then I don't really think the problem lies with the precise details of what /personally/ broke my immersion.

I generally assume everyone is ignorant of gift economies. A dungeon master has an explicit reason not to be, but even then I would imagine a survey of dungeon masters would make it rare, but my suspension of disbelief is fine with stretching that far.
