  If there's no point in having her know what the gift economy is, have her say no to the answer.
#+end_quote

There's a difference between her saying "no" and Joon needing four paragraphs to explain what a gift economy is, and then giving her time to digest the concept, and her saying "yes" and needing a sentence just to (Watsonian-reason) verify that they do have the same concept in mind and (Doylist-reason) explain it to the readers briefly.

  How many adventurers and magic users study economics in this world?
#+end_quote

Probably at least all those who are at the same time kings.

  What's the purpose of the character knowing that?
#+end_quote

That's the sort of thing you can ask at the end of the story, if no Doylist purpose was revealed.

Until such time you're being needlessly aggressively, by merely assuming that the house must by-default be ignorant in regards to economics, and that there must be an explicit reason if she's not ignorant.
