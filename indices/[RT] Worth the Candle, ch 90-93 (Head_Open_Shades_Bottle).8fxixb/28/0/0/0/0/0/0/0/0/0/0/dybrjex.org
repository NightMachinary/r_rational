  Your original comments were sarcastic which makes them inherently mocking.
#+end_quote

I don't think I said it wasn't sarcastic/mocking.

#+begin_quote
  You didn't offer a solution, you were only offering sarcasm to the way something was worded so it could easily be perceived as aggression to the author.
#+end_quote

Someone sarcastically commenting about something is not aggression. My solution that I was suggesting was quite clear to me (that is for her not to know), I even reinforce this by pointing out that he explained it anyway. I could have explicitly stated it but I thought it was obvious.

#+begin_quote
  You could have easily worded your original point in a constructive manner and not gotten so much criticism for it.
#+end_quote

I could have. I don't mind criticism of my comments, if anything your responses have improved my opinion of the subreddit after Mr "Annoying at Movie Theatres"

Sarcasm isn't aggression still.
