  It also can't be both passive aggressive and aggressive since those are mutually exclusive.

That's true enough in a logical sense. But even still, one person could perceive a comment as aggressive and another could perceive it as passive aggressive at the same time if it is unclear enough though.

Thanks, that would help a lot. I also like seeing good topics, but unclear comments can become toxic since they are easily open to misinterpretation. I think niceness in a critique goes a long way to conveying intent that you want an earnest discussion and having it taken seriously. It also shields a criticism from several derailing discussions as has happen in this very comment chain. And these are just the practical reasons why a nice approach works well.
