  Yeah, that's a thing I do all the time. Maybe it's annoying, but it ensure clear communication, and most people seem fine with it. You didn't have to act sarcastic like this a proof of incredibly poor writing.

I never called it incredibly poor writing, nor was I even being sarcastic at him explaining. I simply pointed out that you're stretching a character's knowledge (how many random people that I quiz in the street will have a heard of gift economy, and the intellectual capacity of this world has meant to have been sapped by the alternative routes of magic) and then doing it needlessly on top of it.

If there's no point in having her know what the gift economy is, have her say no to the answer.

I didn't point out his explanation as being an absurd part of his character, I pointed it out as being pointless for the story that she knows that. If she did know it and he didn't explain it at least he would have saved some lines of text.

How many adventurers and magic users study economics in this world? And then even how many economic classes actually go into gift economies (in my degree in Economics I never spoke or heard the words once for example).

What's the purpose of the character knowing that? Are there economic implications we're meant to take away from the general knowledge of economics being much better known in this world?
