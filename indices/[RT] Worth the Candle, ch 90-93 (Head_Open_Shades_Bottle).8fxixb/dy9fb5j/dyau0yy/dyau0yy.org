I /very nearly/ included a bit about Grak having put up a standing sound ward in the specific place where the film projector sits, but couldn't /quite/ find a place where it didn't feel out of place, and since it didn't really push characterization, I left it out. But yes, film projectors are loud enough that if you were sitting next to one (which you'd almost have to be in a room that size) it would be uncomfortably loud. Presumably the sound is then wired to a speaker that's outside the sound-cancelling ward.

(I'm hoping that I don't make many mistakes with this, but might, since film is more of a hobby for me than an area of expertise.)
