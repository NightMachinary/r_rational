The character interaction in these four chapters was really enjoyable; characters becoming aware of their problems due to introspection, and then facing them, is probable the greatest impact this story will have on me personally.

For something completely different: As someone who worked for a long time as a part-time projectionist in movie theatres, I want to point out that these devices are /loud/. Modern digital projectors are loud due to the many fans and ventilation required to keep the projector cool, and analogue projectors are loud for to the mechanical interactions; shutter, sprockets, wheels, and simply the clatter of jerking through the reel. Due to the slack before and after the aperture the preceding and following reel is moving at constant speeds, but around the aperture it's start-stopping 24 times per second. On the other hand, my experience is biased towards professional big screen projectors, I never had to deal with small, home-scale projectors likely used here.

So it's loud.
