Huh. No idea how to help you with that other than maybe giving a little insigt on why some people read your whole story and then seemingly only project a superficial and negative opinion.

Personally, I'm not good at analyzing a story to explain why exactly I like it. So when a story is very good in general (as yours is) then I often just give some generic praise after reading the last chapter, if even that. Other times I just feel good about having read what I read but immediately move on to the next thing to scratch my itch.

But when something small is out of place inan otherwise perfect story/chapter it stays with me and I want to share it, either in the hope that I actually help the author improve on and perfect something that in my opinion is worth being as good as possible, or (and I'm not proud of this) to have an easy way to discuss an aspect of this thing I generally enjoy with others. And especially if the imperfection is jarring (something that never happened to me with Worth the Candle) I may become passionate in a negative way.

But all that is only possible if there is something keeping me interested in the story in question in the first place. A great thing with a (real or perceived) flaw can be much more frustrating that something that isn't worth my time.

tl:dr ~ Your story is great. Please don't stop.
