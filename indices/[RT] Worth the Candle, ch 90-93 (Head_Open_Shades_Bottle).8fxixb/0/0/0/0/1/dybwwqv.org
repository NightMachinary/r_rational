I read through that whole thread. Man I'm sorry it's so emotionally draining to write for an on demand audience. I really like your work with wtc, It's become the highlight of my weekly reading. I think the effort you've put in has created something with great thematic integrity. Wtc has even made it onto my re-reading list alongside Dresden files.

The story just works on a lot of levels and I find my self showing up in these threads every week to make predictions and argue with my co-workers about where the plot is going.

Next on my rational reading list is likely to be metropolitan man since brodski audiobooked it. I generally don't like Superman as a rule, but I trust your ability as a writer and want to hear the story you tell.
