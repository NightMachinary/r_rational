The popularity of your post hopefully speaks to the author of the goodwill from the bulk of us readers and that outspoken dissent is still a minority (and perhaps shouldn't be weighed as heavily!).

However, I'm with [[/u/RMcD94]] in that I'm against name-calling and this type of public shaming for people with dissenting opinions. I don't believe that fosters a healthy and fun discussion forum like [[/r/rational]] ideally is (and has always been, in my opinion). I mean, I even had a very heated discussion with a critic where the word 'stupid' may have been thrown around, but at the end of the day I hope he continues thinking about the story and offering controversial criticism because that's far preferable to a comment circlejerk where only "safe" opinions get constructive attention. There may be criticism that gets stuck in the author's mind, for better or worse, but I'd like to think this whole episode has been a learning experience for everyone. And maybe there will be less frivolous criticism now?

tldr; readers, don't get discouraged from posting criticism!
