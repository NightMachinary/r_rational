I think I agree with you about public shaming -- in particular, I object to the use of the word "idiots" in the original post. But I don't think it's off-base to call out aggressive, mean, or bad-faith criticism (or just unkind behavior in general). Also, I think it's worth noting that as far as I can tell, no users critical of commenters on past threads have actually mentioned them by name here -- instead, they have only been mentioned obliquely, or by their defenders! So any public shaming that's happened has been of a pretty mild sort.

That said, if [[/u/mojojo46]] feels like moderating their tone, it would certainly be consistent with the enforcement of norms of niceness.

My guess is that much of the disagreement on this thread comes from people talking past each other. It feels to me like the argument has been "this post isn't nice" vs. "you're trying to quash any and all criticism." But, at least in my view, its perfectly possible to be both nice and critical.

The norm I would advocate for is: all criticism is OK, but also all posts must be /nice/. Probably the subjectivity of that last word is where the problem lies -- it seems that my views of niceness are more rigid than some of the other commenters here, and that my sensitivity to tone is much greater.
