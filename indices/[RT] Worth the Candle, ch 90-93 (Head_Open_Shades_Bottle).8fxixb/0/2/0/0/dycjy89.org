It's oblique but anyone who's followed the threads knows the intended recipient of the jab. And it's fair to expect tit for tat if you're being aggressive. I did mean it as a general caution. It's easy to take "idiots with poorly formed criticism" as addressed to any critic because who's to judge what's "poorly formed" when it's only in your mind? (Bearing in mind that not everyone is introspective enough to play devil's advocate with oneself)

The subjectivity of what's critical yet nice is funny. Besides the headache of discerning tone on the internet and what our definitions of "nice" are, /nice criticism/ seems like an oxymoron. Maybe it's at the root of why criticism bothers us more than praise (as CRJ alluded to). Polite, well-meaning criticism is still an attack of sorts, which may be why it's rare to find many people who can deliver it with genuine niceness.
