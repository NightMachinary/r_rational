I don't think criticism is being disparaged in general; in a past thread, there was a particular commenter who (IMHO) wasn't giving critiques in good faith. The author mentioned being pretty discouraged by these comments. I think it's fair to dismiss "poorly formed criticism," while still acknowledging thoughtful and kind critique.
