  "people are disparaged for criticism" and "one should leave no feedback that could ever be in anyway remotely viewed as negative" is not thinking more on a subject, it's demagogy.
#+end_quote

It wasn't a demagogy, it was a thought experiment. I took the initial thought (criticism impacting production) and followed it through as anyone here is more than capable of doing. It was, what I thought, the beginning of an interesting discussion on how the feedback of a community relates to a creative work but apparently [[/r/rational]] has become opposed to such things.

This kind of discussion is the whole reason I enjoy this subreddit, and indeed it wouldn't shock me if the deconstructionist main character we're reading ends up talking about the DM's motivation or something at some point.

  I am not saying you are overreacting because of your overall theme, I even agree with you that people shouldn't hold their constructive criticism back. I'm saying you are overreacting because of the OP strawmanning and slippery slope arguments you are making.
#+end_quote

You can't agree with me on that because I didn't take that position. I'm also not making any argument so trying to fallacy of fallacy me doesn't do anything since who exactly do you think I'm arguing with?

Edit: To be honest I should have realised the subreddit was different when the top comment is referring to completely to the nebulous "them" and having read the previous comment thread at the time and again after that comment I've still yet to see anything that could be called "mean", written by "idiots" or "poorly formed".
