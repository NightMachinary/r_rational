I don't think you should take the top post as proof that "[[/r/rational]] has become opposed to such things." I think its position as the top post and rating are the result of readers being worried that this long delay was caused by vocal criticism and trying to reassure the author in the same /sentiment/ as the OP, rather than just trying to create a divide between "us" and "them"/"idiots". I'd optimistically take it as a gushy welcome back and encouragement for the author.

About the old threads, I don't think it was directly mean or idiotic, but it was definitely poorly formed and many points of critique did lack a charity in interpretation.
