Can we not argue all the time? At this point, it's just arguing for the sake of argument...and that never goes anywhere. I think Gilgalad7 already summed up the morals of the day:

- we shouldn't criticize others for offering criticisms
- it's only fair that critics should expect criticism of their criticism, but not in an insulting or derogatory way
- in the same vein, both sides shouldn't marginalize or generalize. You worry that [[/r/rational]] is lumping any critic into the "idiots" group, but you're also generalizing all of us as people who think that way.

Also, I responded above with my thoughts on why the top comment is so popular.
