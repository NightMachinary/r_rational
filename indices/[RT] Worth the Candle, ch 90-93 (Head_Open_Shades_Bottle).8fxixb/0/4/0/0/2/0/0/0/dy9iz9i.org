Well I guess it's not surprising I didn't see it since it's buried in subthreads and not even posted as a main response to the story but a response to someone else's response. I naively assumed that something that apparently is such a big deal as to be damaging the potential of this story's continuation would be at the top.

  I still think Dragons were added as an after thought, because the party needed to be on a train, cause story would not work on an airplane. Every chapter prior to train showed 0 evidence that dragons were somehow a problem with flight transportation\use, in fact helicopters\airplanes were used pretty freely. If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.

This is the "idiots" (again singular case!) which the OP is referring to? Even though the dragon thing doesn't bother me at all, I don't look at that person's comments and think "wow what poorly formed criticism".

Who not only then goes on to immediately clarify that:

  I never tried to insult you personally or say that you are incompetent or dumb, even if i hated the story i would not do that. You do great work writing and creating your world.

If anything this completely reinforces my thought experiment as being not far fetched at all.

And by poorly formed criticism this is probably one of the only pieces of criticism this story gets, skimming over this chapter's comment thread I don't see a single piece of criticism, excluding my own minor nitpick (which is downvoted at the bottom of the thread, because that's how people use votes in this subreddit). So it seems I was in fact ignorant in my preceding comments, it's already the case that people don't review things critically on this subreddit. A collective decision on my thought problem was reached before I even posited it.

This is true of almost every single story posted here, criticism is never found in snippets, only en masse. Perhaps it's a reddit thing, perhaps it's a human thing, but if you look at MoL you won't see any criticism and then suddenly one chapter gets a lot of criticism.

Also you completely misrepresented that person by saying they were giving critiques in bad faith when clearly they do actually have a problem with dragons they are not making up an issue just to give criticism.

Edit: Seriously, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8bhjwe/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8889_solitudeface/dxitghb/]] How can you think he wasn't making comments in good faith?
