Well it's weird because you said plural idiots and "poorly formed criticism" is not a defence that I like because there's not some objective standard for criticism which means that people who write well formed criticism will never have it be called poorly formed criticism. That is to say it is very easy to say all criticism and any criticism is poorly formed if you understand me.

The author being disparaged by the works probably to me is almost worst because now everyone has to couch what they say because we're really saying here that if you enjoy this story at all, or think there's any net positive then to avoid the chance of a comment leading to the author stopping one should leave no feedback that could ever be in anyway remotely viewed as negative or not in good wait, and yes that includes completely genuine and helpful constructive criticism.

There's no (good) solution here, because an author might genuinely feel that way (even about good criticism). Motivation, especially for creative works, is hardly under conscious control so the solution is that nobody leaves any criticism (for is the author likely to admit constructive criticism kills their motivation due to the social pressure) or for the author not to read the comments (again problematic if that is how they are motivated to begin with).
