Loving these chapters.

Really glad that they are taking the isolation seriously now after Amaryllis jumping in on her own at first. Her having a session with each of the others gives a good opportunity for character development. I still tihnk they're rushing things too much, given they don't have much in the way of external time pressure iirc, there's now reason they couldn't take a day between sessions

Interesting to see our impressons of Adult!Arthur fleshed out, with him interacting with his party and the house. [[#s][spoilers]]
