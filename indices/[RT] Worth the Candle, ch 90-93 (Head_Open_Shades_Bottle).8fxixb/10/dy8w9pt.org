So did anybody notice the mild parallels between the protagonist in Uthar's Ground Hogs day rip off and the man himself. I'm doing a lot of reading between the lines here but I can't help but wonder if he's acting the way he is because he thinks if he makes himself irredeemable the DM might leave him alone. His relationship with his wife and children is distant and given how things seem to go around him I can't help but think that's for their protection.

Also, anybody notice Uthar is diving into a bottomless pit and presumably staring into the abyss for weeks on end ... I wonder if he's seen it staring back. The symbolism is strong with this one.
