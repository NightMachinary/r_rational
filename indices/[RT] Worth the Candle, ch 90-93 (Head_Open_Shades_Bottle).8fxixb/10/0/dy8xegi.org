My read was that he feels like he's been fighting for years to make the world a better place, but that the dreaded narrative keeps finding ways to torture him, or to destroy what he's built. I don't know that he's trying to make himself irredeemable -- just that he feels that since his actions have no consequences (in the long term), they have no moral weight. So he might as well act without regard to moral considerations.
