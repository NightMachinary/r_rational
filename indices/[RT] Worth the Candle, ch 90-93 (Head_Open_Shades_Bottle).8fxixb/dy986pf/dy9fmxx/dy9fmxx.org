Re engineers, you have a starting infrastrucure problem. Knowing modern 21st century technology isnt going to make you able to rebuild it all from scratch. An electrical engineer probably doesn't know how to mine and refine copper and mass manufacture wiring for example. Whereas Amarylis can look for specific bits of knowledge she needs to bridge the gap
