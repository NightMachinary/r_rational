Very nicely resolved all the critiques I had on Amaryllis going in alone being a stupid plan.

Also, I'm rooting on Amaryllis taking over the world. She feels like the natural protagonist, for quite some time: Where Joon, Fenn and Grak are mostly going with the flow, she actually has an endgame she is working for. And handing the world-breaking super-powers not to her directly but rather to a companion, who is also the narrator, is pure genius.

edit: With this, I mean that Amaryllis is the character with most agency in all of the story, so far. Adding in that she knows that she and her personal history were retro-causally created for the sole purpose of appealing to Joon makes it even better, since she copes pretty well with this potential existential crisis.
