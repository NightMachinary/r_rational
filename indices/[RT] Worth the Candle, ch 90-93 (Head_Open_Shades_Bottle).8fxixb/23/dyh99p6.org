It's been a while since I've posted long obsessive stream-of-thought feedback. Well, wait no more, for I am tired and I have nothing better to do! (well, that was the case when I started writing it; turns out those take some time, actually)

#+begin_quote
  "She reminds me of him, [...] Headstrong. Fearless."
#+end_quote

Is that a disguised insult? We know from Zona's story that she has no love at all for Uther. Maybe she's saying that she sees the same arrogance in his great-granddaughter.

#+begin_quote
  some of it was the tint of unreality that still sometimes seemed to hang over everything like a fog
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think it hasn't quite sunk in how many times they avoided death by pure luck in the last few weeks. I'm probably gonna make a count of it at some point.

#+begin_quote
  "Usually I would leave one alive, or two if I could separate them without too much trouble, then appear before them and make them answer my questions about the state of the world."

  “Oh, certainly I've done things like that,” said Zona. “A door slams shut, trapping one member of a party away from the others, and I go to work making a display of their death to whatever extent I'm able, so that when the main group comes to the rescue of their fellow, he's a macabre display of arteries and organs. You'll have to clean up a few of those, they're scattered around the rooms, which is another point in favor of my having permanent residents again, I suppose.”
#+end_quote

The more Zona talks about the people she killed, the more I wonder: did she let anyone leave? I don't know how many adventurers made their way in the fortress, if she was taking her time and being dramatic, there must have been at least a few who tried begging for their life or negotiating? Someone could have offered to fetch an entad for her in exchange for the release of a hostage, or something similar. I don't think that's likely, because if people had survived Kuum Doona, then they would have spread the word, unless Zona had some way to swear them to secrecy.

It's interesting that the group is considering the possibility of living in Kuum Doona, even though the fortress has shown both the ability and the willingness to kill them all at any moment. It draws a lot of parallels with Fallatehr, who they were unwilling to have such an arrangement with. I wonder how much of it is the insidiousness of soul magic, how much of that is that Kuum Doona already had an opportunity to kill them and didn't take it, and how much is that Zona looks like a cute girl.

#+begin_quote
  "but I kind of wonder what would happen if we had a sentient magic item to give to her"

  “Here, if this entad were intelligent, if it were a thinking thing, you're saying that there would be no legal repercussions for me injuring it?”
#+end_quote

Joon isn't being very subtle about Ropey. I think he gave the game away, but I don't think Zona wants to try eating a sentient item anyway.

#+begin_quote
  “He was dream-skewered,” said Zona. [...] “It doesn't make any sense.”
#+end_quote

Mary said at some point that Uther being dream-skewered was a widely accepted theory among scholars. If nothing else, it would have been pretty hard to ignore once the other dream-skewered started to notice "Hey, this guy just copied over Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and stuff". That suggests that her information about the outside world is at least somewhat limited.

#+begin_quote
  "Whenever you open up a book and read from it, a cat will appear, sitting on the pages."
#+end_quote

How do the Tomes of Cat Summoning work? Does a cat appear every single time you open any book, even a backpack-summoned book? Do they disappear when you close the book? If you open and close a book multiple times, does it keep spawning cats, or does the same cat appear and disappear every time? If you open a book, injure/kill/give a ribbon to the cat, then close the book and open it again, is the cat still injured/dead/dastardly fashionable? WE NEED ANSWERS!

#+begin_quote
  And that was when Uther Penndraig entered the picture.
#+end_quote

He gave the man just enough funds to build his fortress, went there once and used it mostly as an underage sex slave, then proceeded to never talk about it to anyone ever again. The End.

But seriously, did Omar Antoun even get any money out of his deal with Uther? The chapter only mentions materials and workers. Presumably he was at least fed during the building process, and he probably got a reputation boost to his business (assuming he got it back) afterwards, but still. Poor guy.

We still don't know why Mary had bad intel about Kuum Doona not being sentient; but it looks like the answer boils down to "Uther was ashamed of it", which would be why the place was abandoned in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Things flowed more smoothly once Uther joined in the work; the King of Anglecynn and Secretary General of the First Empire did menial labor on the orders of a man most people thought was insane.
#+end_quote

"Secretary General"? Wow, Mary was not kidding about Uther stealing a ton of stuff from Earth culture. Which... makes sense, honestly, because if you have this immense comparative advantage, why not exploit it? But it suggests that Uther wasn't a very imaginative person; or at least, that he didn't feel the need to stretch his imagination muscles. Also, we know that he wrote a few books on literary theory, so maybe he was more of an "analysis" kind of guy?

#+begin_quote
  It was one of his spare weapons, one of many, the Butterfly Knife, capable of creating butterflies as it swept through the air.
#+end_quote

"Never did they realize the true power of the Butterfly Knife, which was that it could kill anyone, anything, in one stab, provided you stabbed the person in the back while they were looking away from you." Nice pun though!

And I really like the picture this paints of Uther, of this guy who spent so long adventuring, and has collected so many items, he's basically treating most of them like trash by now. He has a dozen magic knives and swords, what's one more or less?

#+begin_quote
  “We could make this place mobile,” said Vervain. “Feed it the portal ring?” asked Raven.
#+end_quote

I assume they did give it some teleporting item, probably the ring. So why is it stuck in the Boundless Pit? Is it because the fortress was built in the pit and is fundamentally tied there? If so, I wonder if they could give it some sort of remote hologram projector to interact with the outside world.

#+begin_quote
  "Uther had solved that problem in the space of a free afternoon by coercing the senators into temporarily reinstating the monarchy with supreme power vested in prisoner set to be executed, a task which he accomplished while the ink on the law was still wet".
#+end_quote

That must have been an interesting afternoon for the citizens of Palmain. Also, you kind of have to wonder what kind of life Uther lived that he found time to do stuff like this, but none to talk with his wife or children.

The magic sword had limited intelligence, while Zona became smarter over time. I wonder if this is a result of her expanding the effects of the magic items she eats, or if she had to eat multiple sentient items to get there.

#+begin_quote
  “I met with Omar Antoun, my creator, a few years after Uther had abandoned me,”
#+end_quote

I wonder how that meeting went. Was he proud of her? Bitter? Curious? This would have been before she started murdering everyone who tried to enter.

#+begin_quote
  "The ability to shrink, or otherwise adjust my shape, possibly enough that I could disguise myself as one of the mortal species."
#+end_quote

Companion quest hook! I'm split. One the one hand, I really like Zona and I wouldn't mind her as a permanent character. On the other hand, I feel that she has very similar character beats to [Null Pointer Exception], and adding her as a character would take some spotlight away from Null.

#+begin_quote
  “But with every passing day, I care less about how the truth pains you.”

  <I am a house,> replied Kuum Doona. <For living in.> Uther kept looking at his book, not deigning to respond to that.

  It had been instructed not to speak with Uther unless they were having a conversation
#+end_quote

Okay, I wanna give Uther the benefit of the doubt, but wow. If the narration is accurate (and it would be kind of a cheat if it weren't), then the guy became really callous after all these years of adventuring.

#+begin_quote
  Uther returned after a month in the Pit. His portal opened in the study, blasting wind, and he collapsed to one knee as soon as he was through it. He was bloodied and gasping for air, but eventually found his feet.
#+end_quote

WHAT WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT?
