Fenn is my favourite character but yet I'm on team Joonaryliss. And, well, from a narrative standpoint it feels like if they don't hook up in the time chamber (which it doesn't seem like they will) then they won't ever. Sad times. I hope the ill informed criticism that would follow were that to happen had no influence on that outcome.

And somehow WtC has turned me from someone who looked down on other shippers in other fandoms in bemusement to somebody writing comments about characters they want shipped.
