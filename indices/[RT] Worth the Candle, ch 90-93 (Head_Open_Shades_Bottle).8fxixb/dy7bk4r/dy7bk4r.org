Fuck yes.

I started reading this story like 4 days ago, blazed through it all, and today I read the final few chapters available. This story is incredible and I was sooooo sad I'd have to wait for more now. I was just about to go try Mother of Learning out, checked this sub again, and boom. Perfect timing, thank you so much for your hard work, I /really/ appreciate it!
