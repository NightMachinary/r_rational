  This means every single person reading it can interpret it differently since you didn't explicitly follow up your sarcastic comments with an actual point or solution even if you had one in your head. I could easily see how someone can read your direct sarcasm as a passive aggressive dig to the author's writing skill.

In the future I'll be sure to clarify. It also can't be both passive aggressive and aggressive since those are mutually exclusive. I wouldn't call criticising an author's writing skill aggressive anyway.

  Sarcasm and aggression can have overlap, they aren't mutually exclusive.
#+end_quote

Sure but sarcasm still isn't aggression. You can be aggressive and also be being sarcastic but the sarcasm has nothing to do with it.

  Commenting in such an abrasive manner than turning around and saying the standards of the subreddit are going downhill (in several places throughout this whole thread), this is what rubs me the wrong way.
#+end_quote

I don't (didn't?) value this subreddit because of its niceness I value it because of its willingness to ask questions. The comment threads were always enjoyable to read because they made me aware of things that I had missed in the text or things that I hadn't viewed from that angle. While I appreciate your consistency downvotes only bother me insomuch as they represent someone not responding to me. When someone agrees with someone else an upvote can usually summarise everything a comment would, but a disagreement (which is sadly what people use upvoting and downvoting for) cannot be encapsulated by a downvote. Even if people used it for its original intention as a way to keep things on topic there would still be times when it wasn't clear a digression had actually occurred.
