I don't see how that's relevant enough to be included. Certainly could have just said I'll explain later but suffice to say and then repeat what he said. If what he said is enough to explain the concept to ignorant readers why wouldn't it be enough for ignorant characters?

I don't see how multiple questions can be aggressive, that's how things work, it's not like I just have one question and move on to the next one, maybe if we were having a real time chat. What alternative is there? See that's another question in this comment, I am still not intentionally being aggressive.

I don't think a complaint no matter how nitpicky can be called aggressive. At least not because it is a complaint. What part of complaining about something small makes something aggressive? Can you define what you mean by aggressive because I don't think we can possibly be operating under the same definition? If in reading a chapter the only problem I had was with a single line then if anything that seems complimentary.

And finally I don't know about demanding but yes any information in the story reveals more information about the world than explicitly said. There are a number of possibilities, perhaps the entire medieval world was educated in Economics etc
