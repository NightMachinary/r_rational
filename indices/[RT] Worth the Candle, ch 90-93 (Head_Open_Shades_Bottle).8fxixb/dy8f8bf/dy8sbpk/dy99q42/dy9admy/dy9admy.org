Sorry, I'm being aggressive.

Re this being [[/r/rational][r/rational]]: I'm not saying you should shut off your brain and just accept everything, but you're being really, really annoyingly nitpicking. For instance:

#+begin_quote
  And after asking is she knew what it was he then explains it anyway
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's a thing I do all the time. Maybe it's annoying, but it ensure clear communication, and most people seem fine with it. You didn't have to act sarcastic like this a proof of incredibly poor writing.
