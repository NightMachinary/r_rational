The bottle is enchanted, not an entad, I think. Locus has a soul, so not an entad either.

Anyblade+Teleportation Key+Sable would be a funny combination, since it probably holds maximum sentimental value.

If TK is actually one sharded entad and feeding one piece kills all others, that would be some drama.
