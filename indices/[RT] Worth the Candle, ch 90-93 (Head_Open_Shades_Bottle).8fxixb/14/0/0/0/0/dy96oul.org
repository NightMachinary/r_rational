Depends on what is the source of the magic. Does the magic specify a blade regardless of the source entad? Or does it specify a blade because the source entad is a blade?

The Anyblade is a magic entad that can become any blade, that happens to be a blade.

vs

The Anyblade is a magic blade that can change itself (as long as it remains a blade, because it is a blade).

If the latter, then by feedubf the Anyblade to Zona, you turn it into a magic house that can change itself into any house.
