Ah, that makes sense. I was aware that there was a subversion there, but I wasn't sure what level I was supposed to be interpreting it on. It's a little bit more funny now that I know there's not something deeper I should be worrying about.

Thanks very much for clarifying!

(And, of course, thanks very much for the chapters! This was the highlight of my day, and I spent the hour or two during and after reading it in a good mood.)
