Wow. I was hoping for a new chapter soon, but wasn't expecting to get 4 at once.

A lot of information about Arthur in this update. We have had hints that Arthur may not be as perfect as Joon sees him for a while now, but this really doesn't paint him in the best light.

It sounds like Arthur had been extremely worn down by the constant conflict during his time on Aerb. Given what had happened to him and his family during that time, I think that seems fair enough. What most stuck out to me here was that Arthur apparently didn't know his children that well. It honestly gives me the impression that he still didn't consider his time on Aerb to be his "real" life; especially when combined with the Groundhog Day discussion and his willingness to just arbitrarily spend a few months exploring the pit.

Also, unrelated note but Amaryllis development of technology during that time is to be honest kind of terrifying. They are going to absolutely destroy the economy if they introduce all of this stuff at the same time.

Edit: Also, important question but what happened to all the Cats that Amaryllis creates every-time she reads a book? Is there a tidal wave of cats every time the time chamber opens?
