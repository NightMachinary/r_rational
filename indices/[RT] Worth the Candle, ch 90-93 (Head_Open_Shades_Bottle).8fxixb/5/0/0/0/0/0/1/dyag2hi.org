I have, but they were fairly lazy cats and rarely moved from their spots on the couch for anything other than food or bathroom. As a child I liked to follow them and as I grew up, I often followed them into locked rooms with me getting stuck behind as the door shut behind them without an adult noticing. I've figured out how they do their teleporting trick a long time ago. ;)
