Oh wow, what a couple of chapters! A few thoughts:

- Wow, Arthur is messed up. He's clearly in a bad place, and has done wrong by both his wife and Zona. The DM said that Arthur would be changed. I think we're starting to see the scope of that. As [[/u/NoYouTryAnother][u/NoYouTryAnother]] said, it's quickly looking like Arthur is going to be the final boss. Since he's been gone for the last 500 years, it seems like their first priority should be *not looking for arthur* in fear of waking him up. This principle applies to all of the nasty exclusion zones -- they're not getting worse and they're not going anywhere, so it's a good time to power up before taking them on!
- Speaking of which, we just learned a bit about how entads bind to owners -- it looks like you have to be in their presence...or something... in the first time period after it is created, and it will be yours forevermore. So it's not, say, that the maker owns it or something. That makes sense, I guess
- Related, I wonder what will happen when Arthur comes back? All of those entads which are held by Amaryliss might become his! They would be well-advised to prepare for this eventuality, and do some research into what might happen.
- Don't see a way for them to get out of this keeping the anyblade. Hopefully they can convinze zona to come along -- she would be a huge asset if she got a bit more socialized.
- On a related note, it's super important to be defensive of Ropey. Although feeding him to zona is tempting, it's definitely in their best interest to convince zona that entads are people and have rights. Feeding another sentient entad to her is a good way to lose trust.
- That said, there's a great partnership between Zona and the crew. They already have plenty of entads for zona from the Prentiss saga. I think they all have Zona's name on them. You could trade her hanging out with them for a slow but steady flow of entads! That would likely be more than worth the loss of the Anyblade, I suspect.
- I bet you a flying fortress would make travel through the Glassy Fields exclusion zone much easier. I bet dragons are not inclined to patrol that area, and I wouldn't be surprised if a fortress-turned-ring could travel by teleport key (or by bulk teleport?)
- I still think that most of the magics should still be extremely easy to unlock. A sufficient bribe to a revision mage, combined with the promise that it's not THAT much knowledge, would probably convince the mage to give a tip or two, all you really need to unlock the magic. With such a huge world, they only need to find one mage who is desparate for money and they'll be good to go. In the case of Skin Magic, Joon didn't even need a tutorial to unlock. It sounds like a brief description from a book was enough for gem magic. The bar for most magics should be very low indeed.
- I agree with amaryliss. The social and magical skills are much harder to come by, and pushing those to the teammates has considerable advantage. Also, who would expect you to be a mage 14 times over, all with ~level 30 skill potential. That would be a powerful element of surprise
- In a real sense, writing rational characters just got somewhat harder for our fearless author. Now that Amaryllis has spent nearly a year in the time chamber planning, every contingency and every concieveable plan should be pretty much figured out. This sets the bar very high!
- I'm pretty surprised that the technology gap is so large on Aerb, now that I think about it. All these dream-skewered, they should have picked up an engineer or five. One in 100 or so americans are engineers, and there were 1000 or so skewered individuals. If they're all from america, we'll get 10 engineers or so (but probably somewhat less if we sample from the whole world). That should be enough for the academics to jump-start modern technology.
