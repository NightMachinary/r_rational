Well if I was going to rank entads, I'd say: -Entads they can use directly -Entads owned by the family, which can be traded for ones they can use directly -Entads they won't ever be able to use

They should at least try to trade the family entads for usable ones. Aumanns are looking an awful lot like food right now though
