Post-script upon reconsideration: Wow, mentally reframing the entire story with Amaryllis as the protagonist makes me like it even more. Pretty late to make this click, and not sure whether [[/u/cthuluraejepsen]] actually intended this, but that's my headcanon now. I should re-read it with that framing.
