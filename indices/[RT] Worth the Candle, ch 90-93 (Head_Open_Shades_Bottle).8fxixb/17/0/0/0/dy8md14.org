  I wonder if the time dilation chamber works on the locus/bottle? Could help with their limited space problems in the future if so (or if there are other, generalized magics that could shrink them or expand space). Also, can the time dilation chamber slow time for its contents? They might have considered chucking the bottle in if so and buggering off on other quests, though that would not have been without risks.

I guess it depends on whether the space inside the bottle counts as additional area for the time dilation chamber. It seems like it's limited by volume, otherwise it would have been made bigger, but it's kind of unknown at this point. They can't test it until they have Solace back either, because the whole point is that the Locus is dying quickly.

I rather doubt that it can make things go more slowly in addition to the function we see here. It seems too powerful for a single thing to do both. In addition, I don't think it would be a good idea to do that even if they could. So far, they've had one party member killed and a few nearly so in the course of a few months. It isn't likely that Amaryllis could carry a baby to term even if the Locus wasn't a concern.
