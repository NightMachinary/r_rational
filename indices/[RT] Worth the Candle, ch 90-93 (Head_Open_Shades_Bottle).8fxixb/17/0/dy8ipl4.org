  “Time to cycle up and down?” asked Amaryllis.

  “Five minutes and ten minutes, respectively,” said Zona.

  “And the maximum rate it can attain?” asked Amaryllis, still looking at the chamber.

  “One day every minute,” said Zona.

From "Face of the Place"

Using it for a day at a time would give you a little less than 4 days per hour if you don't spend any time at all swapping people. Drastically worse than their current average of over 30 days per hour, although we don't know the precise amount of time spent when Amaryllis is outside the chamber. It's not an efficient use of time comparatively. I would say that using it for a week at a time is the lowest you should go for effective use.

I don't think that they need to be super strict about swapping in order to avoid interpersonal conflict. Anyone can end the time dilation at any time from the inside, so it's best to just keep it running until there's a problem. The only reason to limit it to a month at a time is to do check ups.
