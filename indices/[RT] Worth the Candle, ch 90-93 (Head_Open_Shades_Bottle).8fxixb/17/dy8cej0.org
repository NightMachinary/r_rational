Are there sufficiently large fixed startup and cooldown costs to using the time dilation chamber (either in units time or magical energy?)? If there aren't, why not use it for periods of a day (or two), alternating companions each day? From the perspective of everyone but Amaryllis they'd be spending ~3 months straight cooped up with her, though that's easily solved by having each of them spend a day in the chamber alone every so often to recuperate (Amaryllis, meanwhile, would have to wait for 1-2 minutes outside; you could occasionally even pair up e.g. Fenn and Juniper for a day, I doubt they'd mind the opportunity). The transitions could be dialed in to reduce friction and unless the chamber needs substantial real-world time to start, it doesn't seem like it would delay them substantially.
