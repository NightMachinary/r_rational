I don't think so since Black thinks about looking a millisecond into the future to see the entire world as it is currently. If he could only see what his future self sees then I don't think that trick would work.

  Also, a millisecond in the future is pretty indistinguishable from the present, so “seeing” a millisecond into the future gives you pretty much complete knowledge about the current state of the world.
