The problem with this theory is the shroud of Turin itself. Black states in the story that the shroud is "A perfect photographic representation of Jesus Christ, created by some unknown technology in the first century."

Now, I do agree that it doesn't mean that Jesus is literally god, but there would still have to be something really funky going on with him for there to be a camera+printer equivalent around to make the shroud.
