Wow, this interview was great and like Klein says, you can hear through his answers why Chiang's writing is so compelling. The themes that they discuss (and that are popular here) are moving more and more into the public mainstream, but often when people talk about them I'll feel "Yeah, alright, I've heard this. Tell me something I don't know." I rarely felt that way while listening to the podcast. During most of it, I was either impressed at Chiang's ability to clearly articulate things I've had vague feelings about (e.g. how superhero stories all work based on the principle of maintaining the status quo) or blown away by a point I hadn't ever considered (like how we should not be working towards creating sentient software because of the incredible amount of suffering we'd impose on the initial creations on the way to morally autonomous machines).

Highly recommended read or listen. Heads up that the audio version includes Facebook propaganda (ads) on how they're so invested in bringing comprehensive regulation to the internet.
