This is why I found /Worm/ much more engaging than /Ward/ (though I still liked /Ward/); at the end of /Worm/, Wildbow broke the world. The sequel is set in ... somewhere? It's not exactly clear where, maybe some sort of hastily planned city in some parallel Earth, the point being that it's not anywhere we naturally would know or care about.

Whereas Brockton Bay has meaning. It's not a real-world place but it's an obvious trope-soup of real-world places.
