Thank you for sharing.

Ezra's comment on interviewing some people as “painting with watercolors” reminded me of the Six Eyed Doe, whereas the comment about talking with Ted Chiang was like carving with Marble --- sounded like how Juniper talks at times.

Speaking with heavy, weighty and thoughtful words.

Rationalist Authors carve their words in marble, I guess is what I am trying to say --- and most people just say things with flighty fanciful flavor.
