To my mind, coming up with good, believable specific ideas about how to improve society seems like it lives at about the same level of difficulty as coming up with good, believable specific ideas about how to rationalize the status quo.

The point you're making with the parenthetical is partly what I was hoping to get at. We suspend our disbelief to entertain the idea that a good status quo would have problems. So why would we find it harder to suspend our disbelief to entertain the idea that a good future would also have problems?

I agree that it's easier to describe existing things than it is to imagine and then describe nonexisting things. However, if we first condition on someone imagining a system in detail, I don't think that remains true.

If someone can't imagine interesting conflicts occurring in a dramatically politically improved society, to me that suggests they aren't really thinking about that society at all, only fantasizing about it. I would not expect such authors to become more successful if they switched to writing books about more conservative political societies, because the real problem in such scenarios is a lack of respect for attention to detail, and that problem would persist in other ways even after a change in setting.
