I assume that there's two core issues. The first is that it's easy to place an unknown in your reality and observe/interact with that, because you have familiarity with your reality, so you are better able to envision what "your town but some kid can shoot lasers from her eyes" might look like. It's much harder to envision what an entire world that is fundamentally different from our own, even in mundane ways, would look like, which is what a "actually fix problems rather than maintaining the current shitty status quo" would likely end up looking like.

The second is finding an audience - most people seem more interested in consuming media that they can see themselves in, and the more speculative and weirder it gets, the more easily they're likely to find problems with and/or simply not be interest in it.

(On your note about a "beneficial status quo", I think the comment made about constant threats to personal safety in order to justify perpetual violence in those stories is indicative of the status quo clearly not being beneficial for everyone, even if it's given a backdrop claiming as much.)
