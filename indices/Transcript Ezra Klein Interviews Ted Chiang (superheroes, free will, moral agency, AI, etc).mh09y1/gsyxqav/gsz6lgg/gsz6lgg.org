Heh, give it a try!

Constant re-emergence of the same conflict is a trope of supers stories, eg supervillains escaping custody, or some other villain with the same powers threatening the hero. Not having that trope, having genuine resolution of problems in continuity, would be a different kind of story from the standard.

Genuinely progressive superheroes would inevitably feel the need to similarly empower others; the notion of raising /everyone's/ quality of life is a fundamental of progressive political philosophy. Progressive Steve Rogers would make and train more supersoldiers, progressive Green Lantern would expand the corps, and so on.

Individual exceptionalism wins out in the stories whenever they do, but in my view that's the authors' hand on the scales.
