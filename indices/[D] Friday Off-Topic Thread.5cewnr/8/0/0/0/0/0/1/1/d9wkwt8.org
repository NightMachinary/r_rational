The abortion debate is the only one where I concede that the opposition has a point. I disagree with them, but it's a philosophical difference that cannot be settled through argument.

Every other debate, /literally all of them/, is fact-based, and these people are /objectively wrong on every count./ Either they are massively ignorant or, more likely, they choose to make the world objectively worse for personal power. If that isn't a solid working definition of evil, I don't know what is.
