Republicans are against: single-payer healthcare, climate change, economic regulations meant to prevent banking fraud, effective sex ed, gun control of any kind, and other things like that.

Republicans are in favor of: Gay conversion therapy, voter ID against in-person voter fraud that does not happen, the war on drugs, the war on terror, teaching "the controversy" on evolution, and other things like that.

It seems odd I'm sure, from the outside, but American politics is quite literally separated into a party which believes in facts and a party which does not. This isn't helped by the fact that Republicans tend to be less educated and religious.
