Isn't that the whole fucking point? Everyone has things they care about! You think Mister Evil Politician goes around thinking "Hmm, I really like hurting those innocent homosexual people! I really don't think they deserve it, but by God I'm going to make them suffer for no reason".

That's why everyone needs perspective. Everyone has enemies, and clear reason to hate their enemies and think their enemies are evil. General principles like "not calling your enemies evil" is not for everyone, it's for *you*!

General principles don't apply to abstract situations, they apply to concrete situations. "Respect your enemies and don't dehumanize them" doesn't apply to "your enemies", it applies to homosexual-hating scum.
