So, with Donald Trump as president, I decided to hope for the best...and hope the worst didn't come. I am not entirely sure what I would do with a nuclear apocalypse.

I am reasonably sure that Trump won't kill us all...

I am glad I voted, even though it's one vote in the sea of million. I wasn't voting in any of the swing state unfortunately.
