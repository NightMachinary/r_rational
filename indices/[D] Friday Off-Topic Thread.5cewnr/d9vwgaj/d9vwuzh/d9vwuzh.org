/Preach!/ I hate it when people do this. My usual rebuttal is:

"If you understood your argument as well as you think you do, you wouldn't have a problem explaining it in an easily digestible way."

Seriously, I've never met someone who actually knew what they're talking about who couldn't use an analogy or break down their own point of view. Most of the time, people who say this are just arguing for the sake of protecting their ego. If they /really/ wanted to have a productive discussion, /they'd/ be the ones trying to see things from your perspective. That way, they could potentially identify where they're not getting their point across.
