Ha! Touch√©, I didn't consider that. Still, I was referring to people who act incredibly sure of themselves when talking about something subjective or nuanced. If I started arguing about economic policy with a person that possesses a PhD in economics, it's pretty obvious that they know what they're talking about. I'd give more weight to their opinion and I'd try to see where they're coming from. But if it's a discussion over something where we're on equal footing, then the way they argue their points is more important to me. If they're not afraid of having their points dissected, then they wouldn't resort to saying "if you understood the argument, you'd agree with me". They'd try to explain themselves better. I guess I just don't respect the opinion of someone who thinks it's more likely that I can't understand them over the possibility that they're wrong.
