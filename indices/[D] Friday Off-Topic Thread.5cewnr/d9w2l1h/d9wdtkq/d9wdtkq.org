  Here are some articles that helped me understand why people voted for Trump:

Without looking at the sites, how many of them said something along the lines of:

- Gary Johnson underperformed by about 2 percentage points
- Where trump won swing states, it was often within 2 percentage points.
- Therefore Trump won because voters reluctantly switched from GJ to him to prevent a hillary win.

That's my personal theory, so I'm just putting it out there so it can be falsified. I was looking at 538 graphs for the majority of the election, and I saw Hilllary's share of the electorate stay largely equal through the scandals, but Trump eke away at GJ's the worse hillary seemed.
