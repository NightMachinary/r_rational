I've been pretty active the past few days, so this post is going to be in three parts that are independent of each other even if they're all related to politics. I apologize that I didn't make the format prettier but it's been a long week.

--------------

Here's what I posted on Facebook the day after the election that people seemed to like:

I slept through the election because I cared more too much about getting enough rest to endure the anxiety of watching the results come in. Now I'm trying to reassure myself that the world hasn't ended and that we have no reason to stop trying even if things look bad. If anything we need to work harder, but not on winning.

In Colbert's video where he tries to make sense of this, he mentions a Pew study indicating that both republicans and democrats are terrified of one another and convinced the other side is a danger to the country. I think that speaks volumes as to how Trump got elected, we have allowed ourselves to be ruled by hate instead of love.

It's not just between liberals and conservatives, though. Tons of Bernie supporters are already blaming other democrats for nominating an unelectable candidate. Is that really what we do when we lose a election? We're just going to turn on each other when we need each other more than ever? Well I'm not doing that.

Yesterday I saw a girl at SSU wearing a Trump t-shirt. If I see her again today, I'm going to show her nothing but compassion because she is a human being and I can't think of a better way to show her how I want to be treated. I'm not going to write off my country, or even half of it, as insane or stupid or evil because that just further divides us.

We're not living in a new world, the bubble many of us live in just got popped. So I'm not going to build a new bubble for myself that encourages the biases and prejudices that I have been guilty of, I am going to walk freely and encourage others to do as well. I'm still afraid, but I will not let that fear rule me or ruin me.

It's hard to try, it really is, and it's hard not to get angry. But if we decide that it is okay not to try or okay to be angry instead of doing what's right, then we'll just be stuck where we are and things will get worse in the meantime. Yes the world can be ugly and dangerous, but we need to face the darkness without giving into its temptation.

We can't give up, we can't give in, but we can find the courage to fight the darkness with kindness and face it within ourselves. The road ahead is not easy, but it never has been. We've already come so far and our children may yet go further, but not without being shown the way. I will show them a path forward better than the one that brought us here, and I will show them not to be discouraged by the dangers ahead.

Here are some articles that helped me understand why people voted for Trump:

The comments on this Facebook post are the first example I've seen of a liberal and conservative having a civil conversation about politics and arriving at an agreement since the election: [[https://www.facebook.com/ashleigh.r.walker/posts/1423573394321328]]

Finally, this is a post I made on [[/r/conservative][r/conservative]] with over a hundred comments where I spoke with actual Trump voters about politics to try and learn about the half of the country that I clearly do not understand. I'm not exactly sure what the result of it was besides giving me anecdotal evidence for things I already believed, but somebody is going to read the damn thing after the amount of time and brainpower I have dedicated to it!
