"If you understood the argument, you would agree with me" is one of the most frustrating things to hear when having a conversation with a person.

I get the general principle, which is that if you want to argue against someone you should first fully understand what /their/ argument is, but over the last few days I've kept running into people who think that "you don't understand" is a perfectly valid way to shut down conversation -- since they are so clearly in the right, which any person could see if they applied a little objectivity.
