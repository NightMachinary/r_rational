I've definitely met people who knew what they were talking about but could not explain it worth a damn. In the field of software engineering there are loads of /demonstrably/ more talented coders than me, many who I worked with, as proven by their ability to make code fast and efficient (or sometimes work at all). That ability doesn't translate to being able to communicate what they're doing though, as many frustrating meetings have shown me.

It's hard for me to assume that this is the case with non-technical things though. I can fully believe that my doctor knows how to perform open heart surgery without being able to break it down for me in an easily digestible way ... but for something like philosophy or politics, where there's not an easy metric to /show/ domain knowledge, I don't see how you separate out the people who know what they're talking about but are shitty at explaining it from the people who just don't know what they're talking about. Getting basic facts wrong, I guess?
