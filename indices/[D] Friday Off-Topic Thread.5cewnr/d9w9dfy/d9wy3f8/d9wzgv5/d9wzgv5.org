It sounds like you are just taking as a given that knowledge of the eldritch guarantees insanity/evilness, but being a rationalist requires training to accept harsh truths and learning how to continue on any way. Thus the main character builds up his 'will' and mental fortitude so he can handle horrific knowledge and work to make the world better anyway. There's nothing supernatural to drive people insane, just the horror alone is considered enough to break them. If you think human minds shouldn't be able to snap so easily, then maybe the supernatural aspect of is that people are forced to accept the horror as a truth and cannot lie to themselves in any way to pretend it's not real or something like that?

The epistemic part will be accepting the truths (and then communicating it safely to others) while the instrumental part is to use the horrific truths to better handle the horrors.
