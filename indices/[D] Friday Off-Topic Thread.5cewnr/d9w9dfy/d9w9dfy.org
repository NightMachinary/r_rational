I've been imagining rationality as eldritch knowledge in the Lovecraftian mythos.

You don't need to do anything special/supernatural to make rationality into something out of the Necronomicon. If you already live in a world with Cthulhu, and eldritch beings have been manipulating or affecting human society for generations, then rationality will be demanding you to accept horrific truths.

Just learning about the Old Ones will break anyone and signs of people refusing to accept such a horrific truth can be made into the same as how people react so badly to books like the Necronomicon in Lovecraft's tales. I would term accepting the horrific truth and moving past it a bitter enlightenment. I have already described it in another of my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5cewnr/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d9w8x4p/][comments]] about the election. It'd be something similar but with a larger scope.

Rationality in Lovecraft demands following the Fridge Logic and accepting the truth. It would look like an eldritch art as one uses their knowledge of the eldritch to do amazing things.
