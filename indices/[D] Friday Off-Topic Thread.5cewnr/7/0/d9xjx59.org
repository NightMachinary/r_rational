My greatest fear politically in the next eight years is that Trump's populism inspires the Democrats to try to out-populist him, and they succeed.

In other words, there've been two celebrity presidents now, Reagan and Trump, and they've both been Republicans. Doesn't that strike you as a little /odd/? The kind of thing likely to /collapse/?
