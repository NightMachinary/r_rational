I'm starting to feel what EY must have felt when he wrote the "Politics is the Mind-Killer" article. (probably a lot of others articles too; the Sequences strike me as something mostly written out of frustration)

It's this obvious pattern, where, as soon as people start caring about the outcome of the debate, and especially when the debate is political... everyone becomes a liar. If you want to make a political opinion for yourself, every single source of information you can find is your enemy. Nobody wants to help you become wise, nobody wants to become wiser, they just want to recruit you.

I have no idea who I'm going to vote for in the next French Presidential election. How the hell am I supposed to choose, when every source of information I know is unreliable? For every argument a peer can give me that would steer me in one direction, there's another peer who can give me a convincing counter-argument!

That's not what frustrates me most, though, and I don't think it's what bothered EY most (or bothers; s'not like he's a dead prophet :p). It's the way I can see reason and epistemology loosing again and again. The way I see people advance their arguments like they're (shit, find a metaphor that isn't soldiers) flags that hey can wave, and say "Look at how many arguments I have! Look at how bright they shine! How can you disagree with me?", and these people never consider that things might be complicated, that smart people can know about their amazing arguments and /still/ disagree with them, that policy debates are /not/ one-sided AND SHOULD NOT APPEAR SO! (heh, I feel like I just reinvented long-known math theorems on my own, except with epistemology instead of math)

I think I do it too. I know I've thrown way too many anti-Trumps arguments I wasn't actually confident about. I'm ~80% confident that my brain is trustworthy-ish regarding politics, but that doesn't keep me from killing it from times to times. Got to sacrifice your own rationality for the sake of trying to convince other people to be smart, at least from times to times, I guess.

Well, it's out of my system. While I'm ranting, here's a confession: I totally stalk alexanderwales' profile for insightful political comments, because he's literally the only person I know who I trust to keep a semi-clear head when dealing with politics. So, um, if you're reading this, sorry for the internet stalking. Also you're great.
