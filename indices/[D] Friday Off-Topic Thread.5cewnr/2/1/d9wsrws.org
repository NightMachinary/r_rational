Purely strategically, depends on your goals. If you like Le Pen, vote Le Pen. If you don't like Le Pen, vote for your favorite major party candidate who isn't Hollande. Vote in the UMP primary if you prefer Juppe or Sarkozy to the other.

My prediction is Juppe wins the primary and beats Le Pen in the runoff... probably. Sarkozy can also beat Le Pen though socialists, greens, and communists might have lower turnout. Hollande is underrated as a politician but he would probably lose to Le Pen so don't vote him unless you support Le Pen and are sure she will make the runoff.

Who /should/ you support? That's not my business.
