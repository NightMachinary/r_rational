  In other words, there've been two celebrity presidents now, Reagan and Trump, and they've both been Republicans. Doesn't that strike you as a little odd? The kind of thing likely to collapse?

Yeah, it does seem like celebrities do exceedingly well in elections. They've got name recognition before they even start campaigning, they're comfortable in front of cameras, typically charismatic, and the media pays a lot of attention to them.

Similar to how we have been in a lesser-of-two-evils cycle for quite some time now, we could quite easily end up in a cycle where each side competes to present the most popular celebrities to represent their parties.

For example, if the Democratic front-runner for 2020 were Brad Pitt or Morgan Freeman, I expect Donald Trump would have good odds of losing the election. The Republicans would then have to find an even more popular Republican-leaning celebrity to stand a chance against the Democratic incumbent in the 2024 elections. Old style career politicians as presidential candidates would quickly become untenable, but I don't think that would necessarily lead the country to collapse. It would probably cause a rather significant power shift towards congress and away from the presidency.
