Kanye West just confirmed that he's running in 2020. I'd say he has a pretty good shot iff he wins the Democrat nomination, and has some shot at winning the Democrat nomination iff he runs as a Democrat (it's currently unclear if he intends to run as a Democrat or as a third party candidate; if he runs as a third party candidate then he /might/ actually ironically ensure Trump a second term).
