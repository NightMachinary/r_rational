I'm interested in what will happen in the next eight years. Here's my expectations:

- Starting in 2017, tax cuts for the rich seem very likely. Slashes to welfare seem probable. Reversal of the Affordable Care Act seems possible, despite Trump's recent flip-flopping on that, since the Republican congress may want to push ahead with it anyway.

- Republican opposition to Trump seemed to collapse once he took the nomination, but I suspect this may have been merely to help him win the presidency, much as Democratic opposition to Hillary grew silent around the same time. Now that he's secured the nomination, opposition to him can resume, but it risks making an enemy out of him. His reaction to opposition in the first few months will be quite telling. If he destroys his opposition ("draining the swamp", but targeted exclusively at anyone who opposes him), congress will quietly fall in line. If he brushes it off or makes deals with his opponents, congress will eventually break him in.

- It looks like a pretty good bet that the US Senate will still be controlled by Republicans in 2018, as I explained [[https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/5c7qhm/trump_picks_top_climate_skeptic_to_lead_epa/d9v36x2/?context=3][here]]. There's actually a small but realistic threat that the Republicans could even take a 2/3rds majority.

- The US House of Representatives in 2018? There's a good chance they'll stay Republican as well. Based on the absurdly long lines to vote in this election, the effect of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder][Shelby County v. Holder]] on the Voting Rights Act was disastrous, and we can expect that it will probably be increasingly difficult for minorities and Democrats to vote in Republican-controlled states, which will almost certainly suppress participation. The fact that Democrats tend to have lower turnout in midterm elections (as illustrated [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/24/the-democrats-midterm-turnout-problem-in-6-charts/][here]]) just adds fuel to the fire.

- Unless there's a drastic change of DNC leadership, like [[https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/keith-ellison-dnc?source=em161110][Bernie's plan]] to make Keith Ellison the DNC chair, the 2020 election will almost certainly go to Trump again. The combination of the incumbent effect plus the same old failures from the DNC would make it exceedingly likely.

- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2020][2020 senate elections]] /may/ swing Democrat. It's not a midterm election, and there will be 22 Republican seats up for election as opposed to 11 Democrat seats up for election. As per usual, congressional races also tend to favor whichever party is not in control of the executive branch.

- The 2020 House of Representatives probably has about even odds of going either Democrat or Republican. It will face the same issues as 2018 with impediments to voting under the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, but it won't be a midterm election.

- By 2024, probably about 5-6% of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016#Voter_demographics][Trump's base]] in the 65+ age range will be dead. Meanwhile, 8 more years of young voters will have been introduced. On top of this, population growth will leave a larger portion of the country in urban centers (which tend to vote Democrat). Due to these factors, and eight years of dealing with Trump, this election will almost certainly go to the Democrats.
