One (of the many many many things) that bugged me about Dishonored's story was the involvement of a guild of Assassins.

There is one guy named Daud, who has the mark of the Outsider, and can give his followers some of his powers (mostly teleportation and weak telekinesis). He used this ability to build a mercenary band, who mostly gets involved in high-profile assassinations. From a gameplay perspective, this is great: high level mooks with the same powers a you!

But I'm preeeetty sure it doesn't make any sense. From what we've seen, there's around fifty assassins in Daud's guild, who have been operating for months at the very least, and are implied to have worked been in place for years, maybe decades. Now, the question his: how the hell do 50+ high-grade assassins find months' worth of work in a city ravaged by pest, let alone the years before?

I mean, Dishonored is kind of a crappy world and a socialist's nightmare, with tons of evil aristocrats and capitalists ready to oppress the poor, stab each other in the back at a moment's notice, but even if every single nobleman and rich man is evil... wouldn't you run out of rich men to kill after some time. The assassins can clearly go through almost any defense (they killed the empress with next to no inside help), and are implied to have a pretty active schedule, so...

I guess my question is, how many magical unstoppable assassins could a capital city like Dunwall reliably support for several months, taking into account that the authorities are undermined by plague and high criminality?
