It doesn't really make a great deal of sense to have that many of them all be assassins operating constantly as assassins.

I don't know the precise scale of Dunwall, but for comparison in 1800 London was ~1 million people, if Dunwall was similar then they could support quite a large criminal element. It would make more sense if they were not specifically 'just' assassin but were generally thugs, murderers, and otherwise in charge of or profiting from various criminal activities of all types - sort of like the Jhereg from Steven Brust's Dragaeran books, a criminal group that performs assassinations fairly often but also supported themselves by larceny, running illegal businesses, fencing stolen goods, protection rackets, etc. If Daud's followers were somewhat similar to that, they could occasionally work as assassins but at other times make money kneecapping people who don't pay up to loan sharks, telling businesses about how it would "be a shame if the whole place caught fire", and otherwise acting as general-purpose thugs, then I think they could quite likely support themselves.

A reputation as "crazy magical killers who can and do kill anyone with magic powers" would probably prove quite helpful in many criminal enterprises, so taking a name like "guild of assassins" and having them all dress the same and so forth while they /sometimes/ kill important people for money but get to spend most of their time profiting from other criminal enterprises seems reasonable enough as backstory goes.
