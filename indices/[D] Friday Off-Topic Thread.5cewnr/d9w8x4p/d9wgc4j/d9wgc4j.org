It's funny, I remember learning about the results of the elections, and having a huge, enlightening update chain going the other way. I thought "Crap, now we're going to have World War III", then "No, wait, I don't actually believe this at all".

I'm not sure exactly what to believe, and I don't want to pretend to be confident about it (because politics are complicated and people make it worse when they're persuaded /they/ get it), but I think we have a serious tendency to exaggerate the negative consequences of an election not going our way. Again, I'm not confident about this, because existential risks are a thing, and I obviously wouldn't recognize the announcing signs of the world being about to end; and presidents of the USA /do/ have the power to harm millions of people; but I really don't expect him to destroy the world. The world survived an actor being president of the United States during the Cold War, it'll probably survive Trump; the "probably" is the bothering part.

As for democracy and people in general being awful and stupid, I think slatestarcodex put it best (or at least helped me see the pattern I felt was there). You can see it as a machine for safety and prosperity and helping poor people, with bad things as an exceptional byproduct; or you can see it as a machine for oppressing people and making elites richer and putting lying schemers in power, with good things being incidental; but really, it's not a binary thing, and if you want an accurate model of democracy you must account for the fact that it reliably produces both the safety/prosperity and the corruption.
