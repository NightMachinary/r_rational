  I'm sort of against any one holistic explanation of elections, since a whole lot of people voted and a whole lot of things were important to them. Clinton would have won with higher turnout, or if Trump had lower turnout, or if she'd been able to sway a demographic better, or if people hadn't gone third party, and if you just say "this election was about women" or "this election was about the working class" or "this election was about change" then you're missing the forest for the trees.

That's a very good point. So I guess we could "holistically" say: this election is about how the American electoral system doesn't generate a strongly nonrandom signal anymore, if it ever did?
