I am sure that I will see this continuously until the end of time, but I have to point out that Sanders never experienced the full brunt of Republican negative campaigning, which he would have had he been in the general. Look at [[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html][Hillary Clinton's favorable/unfavorable spread]], then back it out the graph to a two year timeframe. As late as February 2015, she had +9 favorability. Back in 2013, she had +30 favorability.

The incredible drop in favorability of Hillary Clinton can be attributed to a few factors, but one of the common threads is that she was running for President. That explains numerous Benghazi hearings, the FBI investigation into her private server (a result of those hearings), every negative piece of information that came out of Judicial Watch FOIA requests, impact from the DNC leaks, impact from Podesta leaks, talking heads on CNN, etc. */I am not saying that Clinton did nothing wrong/*, before someone once again calls me a "ctr paid shill". I am saying that if she had decided not to run for President, she would probably still have high favorability ratings.

By contrast, Sanders' favorability ratings at least partly reflect that not only has he not been attacked by Democrats (recently - you can see that his poll numbers are lower when he was in the primaries) but that he's been boosted by Republicans attempting to sow division within the left in order to get Trump elected.

It's completely counterfactual, but I expect that if Bernie Sanders were to have run for President, he would have been smeared into the ground by the Republicans over whatever true or false stuff that they could find to hit him on. And then we'd be talking about how the Democrats should never have run someone with such low favorability.
