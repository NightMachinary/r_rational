This Wednesday was an eye-opener for me.

When I saw Trump win, I thought to myself, /Oh crap, we're screwed./

Then something I've been training myself to do for years kicked in automatically. I imagined what the people on the opposite side (Trump supporters) would think if the opposite had happened (Clinton winning), /Oh crap, we're screwed./

That's when something in my brain went /something's wrong here/. People on both sides of an election genuinely believed there will be a World War III, the US will be destroyed, there will be thousands ruined for life, and other horrific scenarios were likely to happen which were not fear-mongering or exaggeration by journalists.

*If most people on BOTH sides of an election believe the other candidate will actually destroy the nation if elected, then you've got a problem with the entire system of election!*

Enlightenment is about gaining a new insight into the working of some important matter, but what I felt is something I would call a *bitter enlightenment*.

I realized that when it came to my beliefs in democracy, they were childish. I grew up believing that democracy was the best form of government and that no other form could compare because they didn't allow for everyone to have a say in important affairs. While my belief has gotten tarnished over the years seeing all of the corruption of our leaders, ways people are prevented from actually having a say (electoral college vs the popular vote), and how it's probably not a good idea to allow those ignorant and untrained to vote on issues requiring experts, I retained that belief for years unconsciously defending it.

That sensation of sickening realization of having a fundamental belief crack and crumble away as I gained a dreadful insight into human nature and governments would be what I call a bitter enlightenment. It was an insight I didn't want to know (left a 'bitter' taste in my mouth) and tried to make excuses for /this was just an outlier, next election will show everyone returning to their senses/, but once you learn a truth you can't unlearn it. It forced me to update on what makes a good system of government, how necessary it is to allow freedom of speech, how nasty people can be on both sides of a losing arguments/"correcting" those in the wrong, and just how deeply flawed my mind is.

Before Wednesday November 9th, I always had the unconscious visualization of the human mind as a shining pearl with some warps and dents in it as if we were nearly perfect only with some deviations from perfect rationality. But with the destruction of one of my fundamental beliefs, it felt as if I saw a glimpse into a mirror showing myself as a hodge-podge of widely different materials all straining to rip apart from each other. It was as if my mind was made of many disgusting parts, all deeply warped and bent, barely cooperating together to make something that sometimes equaled to a greater whole and sometimes equaled to less than any single part. I felt on a visceral level the human mind /is/ made of flaws as if we were nothing more than a collection of numerous error-prone algorithms switching out programs for the best algorithms with the fewest errors for any given solution.

This experience demanded I STOP and rethink everything. No continuing on with false beliefs and don't do anything until I have updated.

I don't know yet what I'm going to do from here on out, but I wanted to share the experience to convey what it feels like to dramatically reevaluate a fundamental belief.

EDIT: After [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] pointed out that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment][dark enlightenment]] was already used, I renamed it to 'bitter enlightenment' which might be a better name, because calling something 'dark' brings up gothic tones and implies 'Evil is Cool'. Bitter enlightenment is more descriptive of explaining the distaste in reaching this particular enlightened state I found myself in.
