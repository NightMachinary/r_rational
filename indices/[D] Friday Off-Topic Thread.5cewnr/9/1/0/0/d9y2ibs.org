That's a large deviation from canon that I personally don't like.

I think there is truth to the idea that sufficient indifference in the universe can hurt people's sanity. People who are exposed to violence, for example, often are traumatized by their recognition that reality is gross and people are fragile.

Perhaps a sort of gradual exposure therapy could be done. But thrusting someone into an aggressively uncaring universe when they haven't already developed the psychological tools to handle it would just straight up damage them. I don't think rationality should be portrayed as a mutation or superpower.
