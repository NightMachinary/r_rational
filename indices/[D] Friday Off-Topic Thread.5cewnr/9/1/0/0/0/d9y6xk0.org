  I don't think rationality should be portrayed as a mutation or superpower.

Okay, you have a fair point about that and I didn't realize I was edging towards that. But I would be really interested in a story where a character knows he's going to face a very traumatic event and deliberately prepares himself for it using psychological tools like gradual exposure therapy. It would be a very unusual and interesting challenge.
