I'm actually exploring this in my new story! In this world, magic is only as strong as the person believes it to be. The better you understand something, the stronger your belief in it. That's why people who aren't trained in the arcane go mad when they get powers. Only someone who's already a bit crazy or broken can wield magic effectively, otherwise you risk losing your sanity. I even have a type of priest called inquisitors that are trained by the church to question reality from an early age. It's literally weaponized rationality in the form of eldritch knowledge.
