That sounds like a very interesting story to read, but you are talking about a magic system which is affected by belief.

I wanted to point out that in the setting I envisioned, rationality is exactly the same as in our world and magic isn't affected by how much of a rationalist the user is. Instead rationality affects the individual's perception on the setting and makes them better able to handle sanity-breaking truths and to use the eldritch knowledge without going mad a la [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages][Sanity Has Advantages]].

This is slightly different from your idea where rationality impacts the magic directly which is still a cool idea.

However, if magic is affected by belief, it shouldn't be controlled by understanding alone. Telling someone from birth that the spell Godicus Modus is the most powerful spell in existence will create a strong belief which is not true.

Sorry if the post's not very clear. I'm in a rush.
