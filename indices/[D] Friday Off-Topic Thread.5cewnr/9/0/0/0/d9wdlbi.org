Oh no, belief isn't the only thing that shapes it. Otherwise, a person who thinks they're invincible would literally never lose. It's just a really important aspect of it. Psychological strength is the key factor, since the more suited you are to understanding the mind breaking truths, the stronger you are. That's why I compared it to what you said.

Someone believing in someone else wouldn't make the latter person stronger. Unless they /know/ the person believes in them and they believe in their belief. Fuck. This is getting confusing. I swear it makes sense. I think /I'm/ the one who's not being clear here.
