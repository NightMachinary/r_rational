If your are haven't trouble explaining how your magic works, try writing down examples of where it works as well as counter-examples where it doesn't work.

Also, it seems as if you have multiple factors affecting the magic and only came up with the case of people who have everything working together in harmony. Try outlining the examples where some people only have one of the factors missing and explain how it affects the magic and why it isn't the case for those who retains the 'missing' factor.
