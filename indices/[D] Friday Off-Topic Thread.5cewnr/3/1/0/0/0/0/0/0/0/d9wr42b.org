Oh, I didn't realize that you meant African Americans for all of them. In that case, [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/205059/percentage-of-poor-black-families--in-the-us/][here's poverty rates for African American families]]. It decreased from 1990 to 2000, increased sharply until 2003, and then stayed basically constant until 2010, and has been on a downward trend since then. 2015 rate is 1.6% lower than 2009.

And on [[http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html][this page]], Median and mean income for African Americans were $38,439 in 2002 (constant 2015 dollars), fell a bit 2008-2010, where it ended up at $34,957. From there, it's been steadily increasing. In 2015, it was $37,211.

So, it's lower than it was in 2002 (the earliest year I could find), but there's been roughly a 10% increase in real terms in 5 years.
