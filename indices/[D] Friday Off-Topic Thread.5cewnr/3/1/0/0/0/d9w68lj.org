I totally get what you're saying and agree with what you are getting at--that some people still have it quite tough! I would like to also add, though, that this isn't the case for everyone.

When Obama was sworn in, in early 2009, Black unemployment was rising and had hit 13%. Within a couple of months it capped out at 16%, and over the course of 8 years it slowly came back down, finally dipping down to 8% recently. It has only ever been this low right before the financial crisis, and during the Clinton administration.

This is why, by the way, people of color massively went for Clinton in the primary. Sanders came in and said "the system is broken, we need to fix it" just when it's finally starting to work (or be less bad) for a lot of people. This is also why, despite the problems of current economic conditions, blacks still feel more optimistic [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/03/black-unemployment-remains-very-high-but-nobody-is-more-optimistic-about-the-economy-why/][(link)]] in general about the future.

This doesn't mean there aren't economic problems--there are a lot of them--but this is on the list of things to think about when we try to suss out how the economy helps various groups of people and harms others. America is a great country, and also a large country. Lots of people live in different areas, different economic conditions, and so on. We have diversity of situations and even the diversity of situations in the Black community isn't captured by the stuff I put in here.

In addition to fighting for our rights, it's important that as a country we sit down and listen to each other. We're all Americans and we're all in this together. People who disagree with you on politics aren't the enemy, they're the opposition. And yes, I oppose those who would curtail my liberties, but they are still my countrymen, and America is great.
