  People are very doom-and-gloom after the election outcome. I know Trump has said some very discouraging things. But, and I feel like maybe this is just my patriotism talking, this is America. We'll survive, no matter what Trump does or who he turns out to be. Why? We'll survive because as a democratic republic, we can change our leaders with elections. We'll servive because the American ideal is bigger than any one person. We'll survive because Trump hasn't been elected King, just President.

No, we won't. If American institutions and customs hadn't been rotten, this would never have happened. There wouldn't be a slate consisting of the two most hated people current politics could locate.

For God's sakes, the President-elected receives mostly unfavorable ratings /from his own voters/, and the Democrats apparently consider the letter of the Electoral College far more important than keeping a fascist demagogue out of office -- just as they considered Hillary's connections more important than putting up a candidate the public at large would actually want to vote for.

The veil of legitimacy over American neoliberal proceduralism has dropped, and behind that veil is a turd.

And as stated in another reply to you above me, there's climate change to consider. Or UFAI, or nuclear war, if you think that could happen in the next eight years (or the next eight /decades/, if the radical Left doesn't get off its ass and depose neoliberal hegemony). There are genuinely existential, life-or-death issues where society cannot afford to /work through its issues/ by punching itself in the face repeatedly!
