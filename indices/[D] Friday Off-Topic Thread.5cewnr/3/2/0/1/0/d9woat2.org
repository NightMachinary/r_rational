Technically, the President has the sole authority. In reality, the Secretary of Defense can refuse to authenticate the President's nuclear codes. The President can't order a launch unless the codes have been authenticated by the Secretary of Defense.

However, the President has the sole authority to fire the Secretary of Defense. But, then he would need to present the Secreatary's replacement to Congress, and have them approved. That may be difficult when the reason for the dismissal became known.

I'm not sure what would happen if the President physically flew to a nuclear launch site, and gave the order in person. I would think he wouldn't need codes then, but who knows? Seriously, who knows? I don't.
