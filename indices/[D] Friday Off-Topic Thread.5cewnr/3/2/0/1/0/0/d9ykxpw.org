  I'm not sure what would happen if the President physically flew to a nuclear launch site, and gave the order in person. I would think he wouldn't need codes then, but who knows? Seriously, who knows? I don't.

That would make for an amazing short story. The President arrives at a nuclear silo, demanding the launch of a nuclear missile for some insane reason, loudly berating a Secretary of Defense that refused to authenticate the codes.
