It is politically important in the irrational strategy to winning global thermonuclear war (I'm referencing war games: the only way to win is not to play) to be thought willing to play. A precomittment to never actually play even if the other player does (President B. Clinton) is noble, but a vulnerability if it is known, and the other guy is willing to accept the cost of a ruined earth.
