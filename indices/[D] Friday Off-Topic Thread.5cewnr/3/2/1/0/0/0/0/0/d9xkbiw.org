I really don't, but you're nitpicking the hypothetical. It's a stand-in for "the next time something happens that makes a country worried that the US is planning a nuclear strike". We've had sunlight reflected on clouds, simulation treated as the real thing /Wargames/-style, a bear intruder at a military base etc. and some have gone very close to launch indeed. And I expect these have been patched, so if nuclear war ever starts by accident, it will be something else.

We'd also need tension to build up to cold-war level first. But a president perceived as /too/ unpredictable and vindictive is part of what makes tension build, for all that too little is dangerous prisoner's-dilemma-wise too.

I don't otherwise disagree with your post.
