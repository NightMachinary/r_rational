My point is the likelihood of everything happening. Clinton has proven herself to be a warhawk already on the world stage, making her getting into stupid wars much more likely. The threat of Clinton getting involved in some war we have no business is much more real than trump, because of her speeches and track record.

While i cannot rule out Trump getting involved in stupid wars, his actual rhetoric has not been that which would make me think he's a war hawk, and so makes me rate him as much less likely than Clinton.
