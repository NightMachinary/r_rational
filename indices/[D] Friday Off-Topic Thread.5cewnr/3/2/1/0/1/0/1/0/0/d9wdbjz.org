You say constantly. Have you listened to any of his Townhall speeches? Has it shown that he is actually a war hawk? At the very least, he'll likely attempt to deal with ISIS, which he ought to be doing, to help stabilize the gvt and country of Iraq...

Trump is a bit of an antithesis to the current politician who thinks about every thing they're going to do, carefully plans out their exact talking points, and don't deviate from the script, even if they have to lie and cheat to get there. Obama, Romney, McCain, Hillary, and other 'establishment' politicians are like this. When it comes to warhawking, [[http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/][Clinton qualifies]] and even suggested a [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zone-third-debate_us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53][no fly zone]] over Syria, leaving me [[http://www.salon.com/2016/10/21/hillary-clinton-admitted-in-2013-that-a-no-fly-zone-would-kill-a-lot-of-syrians-but-still-wants-one/][more afraid of what she would do]] than Trump, who can merely be portrayed as having a loud mouth.

A track record of actually starting wars and wanting to get involved in conflicts we shouldn't, is worse than someone with a loud mouth, right?

That's exactly what I'm saying has happened.

  can you actually tell me anything about Trump to make me less nervous about him having control over the nukes?
#+end_quote

Not likely, but i'll try. While you might disagree with the actual policies [[https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf][read his 100 day plan]] and notice that there is not a mention of military intervention anywhere.

Additionally, Trump would long be out of business if he were as over the top as dramatised.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hnaf5Pq7-2P8ZAkp4MHk5AcBQoB06lqc08z_xVA_w8Y/edit?usp=sharing][I also wrote a really crappy paper]] on why I think voting for Trump is fairly rational. The main point being Eliezer Yudkowsky is pretty elitist.
