True, but what I'm thinking is that if someone makes an accusation of something you didn't do and everyone is convinced that you are the kind of person who would do something like that, doesn't it say something about you?

Another way to put it is that Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be impulsive, very aggressive, and constantly calling for war against other countries. The obvious follow-up question is /is this the sort of person we want in charge of the nukes?/ This is why people find it so easy to believe he's the sort of person to say "if we have nukes, why can't we use them?"

  But can you identify that that is not just what he's been portrayed as?

You have me there, since people can often be portrayed as someone completely different from who they actually are. But can you actually tell me anything about Trump to make me less nervous about him having control over the nukes? I'm willing to accept alternative views of Trump if you can explain why you believe these views.
