Okay, thank you. This election has been very stressful and opened my eyes to understand that I'm biased due to the people I'm surrounded by and live with (urban vs rural, upper-class vs lower-class), and it affects what sort of news I hear and listen to.

I doubt my opinion will change before I read the links you sent me, but I do believe it will help me better understand the opposing side's perspective and what conflicts with my knowledge of Trump. When I say that my opinion won't change, I mean that I still believe Trump is a terrible choice for president, but I do believe more strongly that Clinton is a terrible choice for president and is only /barely/ a better choice.

Thank you for taking the time to explain.
