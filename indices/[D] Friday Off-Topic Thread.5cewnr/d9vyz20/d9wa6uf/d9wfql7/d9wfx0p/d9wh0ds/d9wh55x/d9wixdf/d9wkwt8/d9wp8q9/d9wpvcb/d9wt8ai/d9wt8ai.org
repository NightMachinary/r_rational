Democrats are against: punishing crinimals, more money to the military, individual rights, proper protection against crime, and other things like that.

Democrats are in favor of: higher taxes, the war on terror, the war on drugs, new agey religions, abortion, and other things like that.

People are not stupid, if it was merely a difference between a party that relies on facts and one that makes stupid decisions, the public would find it incredibly obvious. People have good reasons for picking one party over the other and it is not an simple choice. I know people from both parties who are virtually indistinguishable and are equally wonderful persons I am grateful to know. My mother was a Democrat, my father was a Republican.

Even if the debates were fact based, most debates are settled through opinion. Many debates aren't something we can apply only facts too. They are more about stating plans on how to solve problems.

Even then, this is about choosing a president and it's not as simple as choosing who's part of your party. As this election showed many people on either side were concerned. 10% of Clinton's voters were worried about her becoming president while 17% of Trump's voters were also deeply concerned about him ([[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/][source]]).

What I'm trying to say is that everything you think about Republicans, /they think exactly the same things about you!/

EDIT: Added in some points.
