Calling your political opponents evil is precisely the kind of things you shouldn't do when discussing politics, and the fact that people do it all the time anyway is the reason why "Politics is the Mind-Killer".

I mean, it sounds snappy and it intuitively makes sense, "right, LE is bad news but at least they're reliable!", but reality doesn't give a shit about D&D labels. If you model someone as "Lawful Evil" or "Chaotic Neutral", you make an inaccurate model because real people never hold "hurting people" or "being chaotic" as a terminal value (or at least, it's rare enough that any attempt to detect them will just give you false positives). Real right-wing politicians will take decisions that can't be predicted by saying "he's LE".
