Readings for this week:

- /The Simple Truth/ by [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]

- the epilogue to HPMoR, by same

- /Following the Phoenix/, by one of our resident authors

Intended lesson: the truth is not complicated, does not come from the heavens, and mostly does not even require any great cleverness. In fact, a /temptation to cleverness/ and a /liking/ for sophistication can mask utter evil.

Sometimes you really need to admit that the world /is/ that simple, that Dark Lords are bad, that Defense Profeasors who love to play at being Dark Lords are bad, and phoenixes are good. Grab the phoenix, and go where it takes you.

When you don't, people can and will die. And that's /bad/.

And yes, this is intended as commentary on current events, because apparently people can't hear the plain truth if you just tell them to their faces, so you have to veil it in stories that yes, Captain Planet villains are still Captain Planet villains after Tuesdays. Both of them.
