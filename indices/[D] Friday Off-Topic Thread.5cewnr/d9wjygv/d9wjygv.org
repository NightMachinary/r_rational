So, because I like to be different, I'm doing JaNoWriMo (january novel writing month). Me and my long-time roleplaying partner will each be writing a novel, based on our roleplaying universe, which, thanks to the amazing [[/u/ccc_037]], has been fleshed out quite a bit and is now a kind of hopefully mostly rational "vampires and werewolves, oh my!" setting.

So I'm planning on writing a pretty straightforward romance story of Red (human) and William (1500 yo vampire).

Act 1: They meet, fall in love, tasty human is tasty (c. 1942).

Act 2: Red becomes an immortal vampire servant (ghoul), dynamic with that (c. 1950).

Act 3: Red becomes a vampire, relationship almost strains to its breaking point (c. 2016).

Act 4: Red is now a mature vampire, everything is perfect, the end (c. 2050). Probably going to have no or only minor antagonists. The characters will have good communication, of course.

In the meantime, I need to plan the structure a bit more, work out the major events in each part (I know most of act 3, and the highlights of act 1, but act 2 and 4 are murky), probably roleplaying the major things with my partner so we know where the signposts are.

I love the community here and would love to share the story either as I write it or in parts after it's finished, but I'm a bit worried that it's not "rational enough" because it really is about two guys kissing and not about teenagers saving the world, superheroes, or anything like that that is really "rationalisable". (I guess, looking back to the sidebar, my story would be rational, but not rational/ist/)

So here's my questions I guess:

1) Does anyone have advice for how to do JaNoWriMo, based on their lessions from doing NaNoWriMo now or in the past? I already plan to use beeminder for my word count, and make it a priority, and collaborate with my roleplaying partner to check each other's work (she will also write something, a friendship/action type novel in the same universe).

2) Does anyone have feedback on the story itself as I've laid it out? What sorts of things might be interesting to explore? What things do you think are lame and should be avoided?

3) Do you think it would be appropriate to share the completed or in progress story on here? Regardless of whether it's appropriate, do you think people would be interested in it? I feel like the demographics of "rational fiction" and "gay vampires kissing fiction" have a small overlap, but "true crime" fans are overwhelmingly women, so I could be wrong here.
