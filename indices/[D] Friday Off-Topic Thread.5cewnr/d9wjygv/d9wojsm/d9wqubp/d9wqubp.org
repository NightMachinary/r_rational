Thankyou so much for your reply! I really appreciate you taking the time to respond to me like this.

  in the rationalist genre we've largely looked at How To Power Game with Vampire Magic rather than more... emotional things, which is something of a missed opportunity

This is exactly it, and all the emotional stuff, the instincts, the predation, etc are things I really like exploring.

  Not exactly sure what ideas and themes Act 2 is going to explore that Act 1 and Act 3 couldn't have
#+end_quote

You're right. I might end up putting Act 1 and 2 together and just having 3 acts. I'm trying to decide whether a 1500 year old vampire would immediately take a liking to a human and decide to ghoul him for a few decades and see how things go, or if he'd wait a few years before that. Ghouling is not difficult so I suppose there's no reason that it need happen 10 years later, and canonically the ghouling happens within 6 months of them first meeting. That would probably be better structure, thankyou!

  It feels like you're cribbing a bit from World of Darkness with the 'ghoul' thing though

Yeah, WoD is one of the places where the "rules" came from. I think the only things that remain from it that are potentially WoD-specific are the concepts of ghouls, being fed upon being pleasurable (and addictive, and nootropic - people who regularly feed vampires are called jannisaries), vulnerability to fire, stake to the heart merely paralyzing (...maybe that's a bit much?). Everything else is general vampire lore (sunlight), or original stuff. (My personal favourite: zombie legends actually come from vampire bodies that have grown a new head after being beheaded. The new head has only the most basest instincts, so it operates much like a fast!zombie.)

[[http://pastebin.com/w77NDT3H][Here's a little (~600 word) side-fic I wrote recently]], that sort of covers the "untapped corners of vampires" that you mentioned. It's devoid of context: broadly, William has just turned Red, and their relationship has grown most distant as a result. Note that Our Vampires have a /thing/ about giving gifts and writing letters. They have a very rigid set of social norms, and if it is disrupted, the result is often rather bloody.
