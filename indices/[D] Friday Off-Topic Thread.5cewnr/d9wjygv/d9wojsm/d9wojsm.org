I'm going to tackle your questions in reverse order, because I'm contradictory like that.

3) Yes, do share please. I think many people here are interested in a variety of of fiction. IMO, fiction by people /aware of things like [[/r/rational]]'s ethos/ is very frequently interesting even if it's not at all 'rational', however you choose to define that - if for no other reason than that it usually means that if characters are behaving extremely irrationally, it is done for a purpose and a reason rather than not. The fact that an author thinks about things like this, even if they choose not to write in the genre exactly, tends to add a lot and make things more interesting even if they are outside of whatever you consider 'rational'.

I also think more people would be interested than you expect, and that the overlap in the Venn diagram of '[[/r/rational]]' and 'gay vampires kissing fiction' will actually be sorta high. I mean, Nostalgebraist's two major fics Floornight and The Northern Caves were both quite well received here, and they are both quite high in the 'gay kissing' quotient. BenedictSC's Cordyceps has plenty of LGBT romance stuff too. For the vampire side of things, Alicorn's Twilight fic Luminosity is about 1/3rd or more vampire romance and is way, way up there in 'rational canon' too. However, for vampirism in previous works in the rationalist genre we've largely looked at How To Power Game with Vampire Magic rather than more... emotional things, which is something of a missed opportunity - vampires have traditionally been used to tap into a lot very primal concepts, such as (to quote someone else):

#+begin_quote

  - Loss of Innocence
  - Fear of Death
  - Danger and Lure of Intimacy
  - Moral Nostalgia
  - Regret
#+end_quote

And I think your story sounds like it could get right into some of that quite thoroughly.

2) Beyond what I said above... I think the story seems pretty interesting. I don't have much criticism here because it's so vague. Not exactly sure what ideas and themes Act 2 is going to explore that Act 1 and Act 3 couldn't have - but hey Heather Poe and Mercurio were pretty amazing and I am totally in favour of ghouls in general. It feels like you're cribbing a bit from World of Darkness with the 'ghoul' thing though (perhaps this may be because of the RP origin?). If you're not planning to publish or sell or whatever, you should consider whether or not to actually make it World of Darkness fiction explicitly (if you want to actually make money selling it or whatever, the answer is clearly 'no', just take vampire themes and ideas without using any exact names from White Wolf IP that don't show up elsewhere).

1) I don't have much advice here, save that you try to budget time specifically to write in.
