Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

So I got very little done this week.  I almost don't even want to make this post, but if experience is any indicator that will lead the death spiral of the project, so here I am.

Mostly this is due to the election this week; I spent Monday researching my local ballot, Tuesday nervously staying up all night to see the results of the vote, and then the last few days doing my best non-alcoholic impression of someone drinking their woes away.  I imagine it won't be hard to get sympathy for this position.

I /think/ I've come to terms with it.  While I don't think the current president-elect will be the cure-all his supporters seem to rabidly insist he is, I'm willing to wait for actions to object to.  This is probably just a defense mechanism, but I'll take what I can get if it leaves me functioning.
