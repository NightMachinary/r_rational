Personally, as someone who enthusiastically voted for Trump because Clinton seemed so much worse to me, I think we need, proportionally speaking, a lot less talk about how Trump won and a lot more talk about how Clinton lost. The analyses I've read have focused on the silent demographics and feelings Trump tapped into. While that is valid, I think there's been much too little focus on how Hillary scared people the way the media wanted Trump to scare people.

There's been some talk of how voters rejected Hillary as a symbol of their rejecting the establishment. I think this is kind of true, but really pulls its punches towards Hillary. I didn't reject Hillary because she was an establishment politician - I rejected Hillary because /she's the type of politician that makes me reject the establishment/. She's /the thing I'm afraid of the establishment producing/. If the establishment is the common cold, Hillary's the Spanish Flu. To overextend this analogy, Trump is a tapeworm and hypothetical evil Trump is at best a Guinea worm and at worst a Xenomorph.

For the record, contrary to leftist dogma, I think the child sex trafficking allegations against Hillary Clinton are much more credible and plausible than the rape allegations against Donald Trump. Even if they were equally credible and plausible, which I don't think they are, I would consider the allegations against Hillary Clinton much more serious because of their magnitude. The left dismisses these allegations too easily because they cannot possibly imagine Their Girl being an evil shitbag. This is not even to mention the way that Hillary constantly tried to paint Donald Trump as an existential risk on the basis of his temperament, all while being the most hawkish candidate in ages, promising to directly militarily engage with the other foremost nuclear power in the world over a dispute in some fucking third-world hellhole, and generally /deliberately antagonizing Russia as much as possible for social justice points what the fuck is wrong with you/
