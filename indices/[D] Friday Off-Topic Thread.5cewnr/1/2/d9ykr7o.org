I was actually just reading an interesting [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/11/duelling-essentially-a-bloody-.html#more][article on dueling]] the other day which cited 4,000 French gentlemen killed by duels during the 57 year reign of Henry IV. That's roughly 70 murders per year.

We might posit a society in which dueling is almost entirely replaced by assassination (though this is not the case in Dunwall, because there's a duel in Dishonored). When someone besmirches your name, you don't challenge them to a duel, you send an assassin after them. This isn't /entirely/ stupid, or at least not much more stupid than entering into a duel.

Given that an assassin's guild in Dunwall might service a region much larger than just Dunwall itself (being able to outcompete other upstart assassins by assassinating them), it might be possible for them to match the epidemic of gentlemen dueling. 15th century France had a population of ~10 million, but Gristol and the Empire of the Isles seems further along, so ~30 million isn't unreasonable. That gives us a lot more gentlemen having a lot more duels, but with those duels replaced by assassinations.

So figure Daud's guild makes roughly 210 murders per year. With a 50 assassin guild, that's 4 assassinations per assassin per year. Depending on pay, which might actually be quite low, *this isn't entirely unreasonable*. Lower tier MMA fighters don't actually get paid that much, and they have roughly as many fights per year (maybe a bit more), with the rest of their time spent training and preparing. Add in that many assassinations would have more than one assassin working them (as with the Empress) and it's almost reasonable. Then add in all the assassinations that don't involve gentlemen (since our number of duels just comes from there).

Naturally this analysis makes some generous assumptions, largely in the realm of worldbuilding. Assassination as a replacement for dueling doesn't work in Dishonored, because there's still dueling. It gets a little sketchy /in general/ because you have to look at the psychological reasons for duels existing in the first place, which seem to me to be more about heat-of-the-moment machismo than anything else, but I guess that could be explained away with transference. And naturally duels don't cost money, but I'm thinking of assassination as something rich people hire the underclass for.
