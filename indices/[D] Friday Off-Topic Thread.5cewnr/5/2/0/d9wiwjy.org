Maybe you are right that democracy is one of the best forms of government (sorry if I'm exaggerating what you said), but the core underpinning of the belief I had was that "democracy is perfect!" with a bunch of caveats and exceptions protecting it from crumbling.

What I was trying to say is that I learned democracy failed to live up to my desires and I see it more as a failure to understand how democracy actually works rather than outside forces creating an unusual situation.

I failed to predict or comprehend that democracy doesn't choose the best candidate for the job, it chooses the candidate who can best convince others he's the best person for the job.

Right now, I'm not saying that democracy is a horrible choice of government, but the way America has implemented it is flawed and I believe that we can do better. For pete's sake, this government was first created in the 1700s! There are parts of it which are centuries out of date and need updating!

I'm thinking over how I thought democracy worked and calibrating to (hopefully) better predict how it actually behaves in real life.
