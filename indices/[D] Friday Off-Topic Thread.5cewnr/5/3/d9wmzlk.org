Well said, but one correction: it's a republic not a democracy. Democracy is to be avoided at all costs as is oligarchy. This is part of the general founding principle that it is often better if people fix things (think Space X or the DMV.org not .gov websites you use to avoid the DMV) and government is too gridlocked, but unfortunately we have federal regulations.
