Thank you! Your points nearly-perfectly described basically everything I found wrong about the election and have been trying to comprehend, but better and more well-informed.

Thank you for explaining why the government election is not reflective of a democracy. I was thinking that this is a democracy and we needed something better, but didn't have enough knowledge about politics to understand how it was flawed and how it should be improved.

Thank you for explaining why it's so hard to properly reason at all about the candidates with the reliability of all of my evidence being brought down to zero.

Thank you for the encouragement for having real value.

I will get up tomorrow and move on with my life. I will continue improving myself in every way possible. I will reach out and help others to learn and grow while respecting their wishes and desires. I will keep looking up out to the stars at the future of humanity as we spread across the universe.

Thank you.
