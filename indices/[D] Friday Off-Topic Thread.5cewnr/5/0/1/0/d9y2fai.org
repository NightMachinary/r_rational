  Thank you for explaining why the government election is not reflective of a democracy. I was thinking that this is a democracy and we needed something better, but didn't have enough knowledge about politics to understand how it was flawed and how it should be improved.

I mean, if you're just gonna replace another Platonic concept of Democracy with the one I articulated, the problem is still Platonic concepts. It's like Eliezer once said when someone tried to associate him with neoreactionaries: the wheel of history turns for materialistic, naturalistic reasons, and it only turns one way. We have democracy because it moves goal information from the voters to the officials. Someday, we will probably have something very different. It will still be different in virtue of /how/ it obtains and utilizes that goal information, rather than in virtue of throwing that information away and going with some kind of Platonic form spouted by a wannabe philosopher-king.

  I will get up tomorrow and move on with my life. I will continue improving myself in every way possible. I will reach out and help others to learn and grow while respecting their wishes and desires. I will keep looking up out to the stars at the future of humanity as we spread across the universe.

Thank /you/. It's a lot easier to keep that up myself knowing there are other people doing it too. These are our people, and we will yet bring them to the heavens.

I've been so stressed and on-edge this whole damn week, and have only recovered the ability to process anything over days. /Just/ getting to that CV composing now and coping with the Latex and XML issues. Partly filled in the actual application; still have to corral the letters of recommendation, write the statement of purpose to show how I'm not really a shitty student, and retake the GRE.

Meanwhile, the week's evenings were taken up in emergency demonstrations and meetings.

Oy gevalt.
