  Then something I've been training myself to do for years kicked in automatically. I imagined what the people on the opposite side (Trump supporters) would think if the opposite had happened (Clinton winning), Oh crap, we're screwed.

  That's when something in my brain went something's wrong here. People on both sides of an election genuinely there will be a World War III, the US will be destroyed, there will be thousands ruined for life, and other horrific scenarios many people believed were likely to happen which were not fear-mongering or exaggeration by journalists.

Who says they're wrong? Both candidates can be horrible. The world is not obligated to provide us with United States Presidents who actually want to serve the people well and keep the country in a good shape.

I expected beforehand that Trump would be a fascist dictator and Hillary would be such a thoroughly awful elitist neoliberal that a Trump figure would get elected in 2020 if he didn't make it in 2016. I think that letting /social reconciliation after a loss/ override the /probability of bad things happening/ is itself irrational. Trump can win and then be /exactly/ as bad as we all expected him to be. Or worse. Clinton can win, and be /exactly/ as bad as we all expected her to be. Or worse.

We have not yet woven our human and moral needs into the fabric of history. There is no reason we /can't/ be completely fucked when all the evidence says we're completely fucked.

  I realized that when it came to my beliefs in democracy, they were childish. I grew up believing that democracy was the best form of government and that no other form could compare because they didn't allow for everyone to have a say in important affairs. While my belief has gotten tarnished over the years seeing all of the corruption of our leaders, ways people are prevented from actually having a say (electoral college vs the popular vote), and how it's probably not a good idea to allow those ignorant and untrained to vote on issues requiring experts, I retained that belief for years unconsciously defending it.

I'm going to give my defensive counterpoint first, followed by my even grimmer counterpoint. Defensive counterpoint:

- The United States simply doesn't have what most of the Western world would recognize as democracy, that is, a multi-party system in which elections are high-entropy random variables with actual causal influence upon governance.

- You can claim that Trump's victory is a sign of variance/entropy in the American electoral process, except that his Cabinet picks already show that the downstream influence on governance is near-null (he's going with completely conventional Republicans and already starting to walk back various previous positions).

- If you /think/ you're being sufficiently cynical by viewing democracy as a schoolyard popularity contest, you're not. To repeat myself from last week, the most /popular/ presidential contender, whose positions were quite reasonable, was shunted from the ballots by Inner Party shenanigans /months/ before anyone could actually vote for him.

- The two candidates who /were/ on the ballot were deeply unpopular, and neither won a majority vote. The majority of the American people voted /fuck those two and fuck this noise/ by voting third party and staying home on Election Day, which is in fact the correct response.

- The "victories" were separated into a "popular vote" and the Electoral College. This means that the "winner", the ork, got fewer votes than the "loser", which is basically not how a /democratic/ system works.

- The "loser" then /conceded/, because 200-year-old procedure is more important to her than both the mandate of the people and /preventing a fascist takeover/. Again, not how a /democratic/ system works.

- The Voting Rights Act was gutted this past year, which resulted in /certain places/ (read: black areas of the South) having orders of magnitude fewer polling-places than last election.

So in summary, you shouldn't claim to be losing faith in democracy because /this shit ain't democracy/. I've voted in /democratic/ elections, and seen the guy I hated ascend to power. That was extremely different: that other system has universal registration for all citizens, a wide-open field of parties that actually changes almost every election season, proportional representation, and coalition governments that guarantee the government in power has some level of support from the majority of voters -- even when I personally despise the shit out of it.

Now comes the /grim/ stuff:

- This election cycle isn't really about the human mind-design. Sorry, but even a computationally omniscient Bayesian reasoner who doesn't have to resort to approximations can still be /information-theoretically/ screwed-over if their sensory signals are ambiguous. We all know P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), right? But what if P(E|H) doesn't vary much based on H, and P(E) is actually pretty high?

- As an example, [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/anti-semitism-is-no-longer-an-undertone-of-trumps-campaign-its-the-melody/2016/11/07/b1ad6e22-a50a-11e6-8042-f4d111c862d1_story.html][take the ad in this article.]] Actually watch it. Then ask yourself: if you were primed with anti-capitalism, would you see it as antisemitic? If you belonged to the white working class and weren't primed to see antisemitism, would you see it as antisemitic? The answers are not really, and definitely not. Now, if you're either a lefty SJW type or a Jew yourself, do you see this as antisemitic? Definitely! When you receive an inherently ambiguous signal, you're forced to rely on your own priors, and when the subject matter is "far away", you can't resolve the ambiguities through experimental actions.

- This is a major failure mode for /any Bayesian social reasoner/, approximate, bounded, or otherwise. People need common priors and hierarchical hyperpriors to make social reasoning possible /at all/; otherwise we all drift apart into our own little worlds.

- /Some people/ have basically been pissing in the swimming pool and sending the precisions of their communications to near-zero. That's not just the Trump campaign! If the /Clinton/ campaign and the liberal media hadn't been /willfully deluding themselves/, the voting public would have had much clearer information with which to both make their choice and with which to predict Tuesday's events. Decades of media consolidation have also helped degrade our information environment by reducing the number of independent information sources whose correlation would provide evidence for the veracity of events.

  It was as if my mind was made of many disgusting parts, all deeply warped and bent, barely cooperating together to make something that sometimes equaled to a greater whole and sometimes equaled to less than any single part. I felt on a visceral level the human mind is made of flaws as if we were nothing more than a collection of numerous error-prone algorithms switching out programs for the best algorithms with the fewest errors for any given solution.

You are better than this. However, as a living organism, as a /statistical/ reasoner, you do not receive truth from heaven. In my view, this is what makes you /count/ as a /real person/: you don't take orders from Above, you take the fight /to/ Above. You are an embodied, material being.

That means you have real value rather than being the drone-man of some thirsting god. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k2/a_priori/][It also means you are dependent on finding precise signals in order to reason, just as you depend upon nutritious biomass being inserted into your digestive tract in order to metabolize.]]

  Bitter enlightenment is more descriptive of explaining the distaste in reaching this particular enlightened state I found myself in.

And yet tomorrow you have to get up and continue on in the world we have now, with the people we have now, for the people who are still alive.

Speaking of which, I'm going to get back to composing my CV for my PhD application, and meeting my friend for our organizing meeting, and writing my damned cog/neuro-sci material for Nate. Because I crossed the Bitter and Crazy Line /years/ ago, and now it's just politeness that stops me from yelling cult slogans cribbed from Warhammer 40K in the streets.
