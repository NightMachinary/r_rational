I meant Bernie Sanders. I realize it's totally a counterfactual, but let's put it this way:

- [[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html][Polls for potential general-election races during the primary showed Sanders beating Trump by a landslide]], with the RCP average linked here being +10.4 percentage points of margin for Sanders. They showed Clinton beating Trump by a small but comfortable margin.

- In actuality, Clinton lost to Trump by a tiny margin.

- My reasoning is: Sanders would not /actually/ have won against Trump with some massive historical landslide, but he would have /bothered/ to fight over the working-class segment of Trump's base. He wouldn't have said "basket of deplorables" or anything like that. He would have fought the race in a way that is more appropriate to /this specific race/ rather than to Democratic presidential campaigns in the past 30 years in general.

- So Sanders would /probably/ have beaten Trump /at all/, with a better margin than Clinton could have or did, just because that's what the available data says.

Further, yes, among the actually-existing Presidential contenders, Bernie is the most popular in terms of "% favorable - % unfavorable". Trump actually has a [[http://www.nationalreview.com/election-night/441951/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unfavorable-exit-polls][net-unfavorable rating]], despite being the technical winner. I'd like to find data on views among his actual voters, because, yeah, the guy is /historically/ unpopular for having won the election. The data shows that voters really did consider this "election" to be pulling the lever for one lesser evil or another.

In contrast, since [[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/sanders_favorableunfavorable-5263.html][Sanders has fairly positive favorable/unfavorable balance]], supposedly the best in the country, I consider that evidence that /given a choice/ between Sanders, Trump, and Clinton, voters would largely have broken for Sanders. They also would have had all kinds of ideological problems with him, because Americans really aren't /such/ huge fans of socialism or social-democracy /yet/, but Americans also /do/ tend to vote on personality, where Sanders has a clear advantage.

So yeah. Despite not being at all a perfect candidate, I think Sanders is the most popular guy in the race this year, and the fact that /he/ got thrown out of the process at the primary stage while /both/ actual major-party candidates were /really deeply hated/ shows a systemic problem.
