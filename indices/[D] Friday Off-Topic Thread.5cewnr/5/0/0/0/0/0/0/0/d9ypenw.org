  I'm not arguing against Sanders being a better candidate than Clinton, only against the specific argument that he would have done better because he has such better favorability, or because polling for hypothetical matchups between Sanders and Trump show Sanders as favored. They're enormously flawed arguments (which I think I'll probably be hearing for years).

Ok, so you think the favorability ratings are imprecise evidence, or possibly even imprecise /counter/-evidence.

Questions: how do you think Trump could have lost, and what evidence do you consider precise enough to point to how he could have lost (or how he could lose in the future)?
