No, my argument is that looking at favorability ratings of people who did not run in the general and comparing them against people who /did/ run in the general is not terribly instructive because it ignores how the general election impacts favorability ratings.

I'm not arguing against Sanders being a better candidate than Clinton, only against the specific argument that he would have done better because he has such better favorability, or because polling for hypothetical matchups between Sanders and Trump show Sanders as favored. They're enormously flawed arguments (which I think I'll probably be hearing for years).
