  Questions: how do you think Trump could have lost, and what evidence do you consider precise enough to point to how he could have lost (or how he could lose in the future)?
#+end_quote

Clinton lost on a margin of 1% in a few swing states. I think something as insignificant as the weather might have made the difference.

I also think Sanders was a better candidate than her, specifically because "change" was the most important thing to a lot of people and that was not something that Clinton could credibly offer. I think that's something that Sanders would have been attacked on, same as Clinton was, "Bernie Sanders had 30 years to change things and he didn't", but it would probably have been less effective because his name hasn't been in the news for 30 years.

Defeating Trump /this time/ could have been done by focusing on /winning/ rather than positioning for a blowout by going after places like Texas and Arizona. Data journalists like Nate Silver were saying that for a long time.

Clinton could also have handled her private e-mail server better, or just not set it up in the first place, though I think that it's mostly a big deal because Republicans A) pushed hard enough to actually find it and B) convinced a lot of people that it was super important. Evidence I'd use for that is a comparison to the Bush White House e-mail server, which most people don't know or care about.

I'm sort of against any one holistic explanation of elections, since a whole lot of people voted and a whole lot of things were important to them. Clinton would have won with higher turnout, or if Trump had lower turnout, or if she'd been able to sway a demographic better, or if people hadn't gone third party, and if you just say "this election was about women" or "this election was about the working class" or "this election was about change" then you're missing the forest for the trees.
