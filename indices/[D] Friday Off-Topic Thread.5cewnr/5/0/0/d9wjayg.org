Who are you saying was the most popular presidential contender? My best guess is Joe Biden? I know things were rigged against Bernie Sanders, but I think he probably would have done worse than his base expects in a general election, and he wasn't "shunted from the ballots", exactly. He still /technically/ could have won, the deck was just stacked against him.
