My problem with those articles are that all these sites which were so certain Trump would lose, are the ones telling us why Trump won.

Edit: It doesn't invalidate what they might be saying but as we read these articles be skeptical as they will likely be extremely biased. Photographs of only white men with tight jaw lines for Trump and pictures of effeminates as representative of the other party are signs of that bias, and reason to be even more skeptical.
