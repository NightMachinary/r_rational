Maybe you were, but I don't think that line of reasoning is productive. Whenever people talk about people voting differently than they wanted them to, it sounds to me like they're saying "If only everyone believed what I wanted them to." As much as us rationalists would like everyone to agree on things, you ultimately can't control what people think. You have to deal with the fact that people disagree with you for reasons they think are reasonable.
