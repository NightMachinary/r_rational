If you're interested in commentated TASs, I highly recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkoek2012/videos][every video by pannenkoek]]. He also has a [[https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkeok2012][secondary channel]] for less polished videos, often lacking commentary.

All 393 videos are for Super Mario 64 (I think), and they go quite in depth about mechanics most players would never have dreamed of, including parallel universes, unbounded momentum accumulation, RNG manipulation, and cloning entities in distant locations. Some are voiced commentary, others are text-based.

His thing is the "0x A press challenge", where the goal is to complete SM64 without ever pressing the A button (used for jumping, launching from cannons, and a few other things). That goal is believed to be impossible at the moment, but I think the minimum is only 33 A presses (I'm not sure if that's for 100% or minimal completion).

His most famous video is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A][SM64 - Watch for Rolling Rocks - 0.5x A Presses (Commentated)]], featuring the phrase "But first, we need to talk about parallel universes." which has since become a meme in some circles.

He is probably the world's foremost expert on Super Mario 64, including as competition the people who programmed the game.
