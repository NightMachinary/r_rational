I had some fun with constructing [[http://i.imgur.com/iUh7PGC.png][a strawman]] out of [[http://i.imgur.com/drML9fD.png][someone's opinion]].

It's an interesting question, though: Are text-based let's-plays economically viable for a content creator on YouTube, in comparison to live-commentated ones? The one to which I referred in the imaginary conversation was [[http://lparchive.org/Amnesia-The-Dark-Descent/][a playthrough of /Amnesia: The Dark Descent/]]. I've also seen [[http://tasvideos.org/3343S.html][one or two tool-assisted speedruns]] in which the speedrunners added textual commentary to the video. [[https://www.youtube.com/user/HCBailly/videos][HCBailly]] is an expert at seamlessly adding post-commentary to his videos, and he's achieved some very modest success.
