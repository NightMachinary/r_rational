I started writing last week, not really as part of NaNoWriMo but just because I thought it was time... and my academic performance dropped like the Dow Jones in 2008. I'll get back to it in December, hopefully. ðŸ˜… Mostly I'm disappointed that I can't finish on the timetable I wanted to, but this is clearly something I can't do.
