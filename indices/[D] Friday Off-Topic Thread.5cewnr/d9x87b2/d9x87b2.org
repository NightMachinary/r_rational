I believe I know a real cognitohazard in the form of a certain proof that will dramatically raise the lifetime risk of suicide for a certain subset of the population.

As for why I haven't killed myself, it's because certain memes I have function to give me weak immunity. However, this immunity requires a belief in the truth value of these memes, which - given their subjectivity - cannot be forced, and in any case is likely to engender suicidal ideation, also. It also obligates you to set the worth of most values to null to attain consistency. Eg, another cognitohazard, albeit one less dangerous since there's no obligation to believe it, which is why I'm offering as much detail as I am.

I am, of course, not planning on releasing the cognitohazards, but felt like making this post since the strain of living with it is starting to grate.

Oh, and this isn't some kind of stealth RP. I'm not a fun enough individual for something like that, given as I care about very, very, very little.
