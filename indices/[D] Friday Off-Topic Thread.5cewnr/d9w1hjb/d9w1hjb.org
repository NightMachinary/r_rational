People are very doom-and-gloom after the election outcome. I know Trump has said some very discouraging things. But, and I feel like maybe this is just my patriotism talking, this is /America/. We'll survive, no matter what Trump does or who he turns out to be. Why? We'll survive because as a democratic republic, we can change our leaders with elections. We'll servive because the American ideal is bigger than any one person. We'll survive because Trump hasn't been elected King, just President.

Yes, there may be damage to our civil liberties. I won't downplay that.

But, we'll survive because we'll keep fighting. We know this isn't the end. We can win. The civil libertarian movement won't bow its head before anyone, won't stop defending rights, won't stop fighting the good fight. The ACLU didn't fold when the PATRIOT act passed, and should Trump and the Republicans try any funny business with people's rights, we will be there to defend the weak. Even if Trump cows the members of his own party, he won't cow them all. The most principled defenders of civil liberties in the Republican party will stand against him, and all the Democrats will as well if only because they are the opposition.

There are things you can do as well.

I'll call my Senators and my Congressperson if a bad bill about this comes up, and let them know they have my vote, and I'll have their back if they have to vote in an obstructionist way to defend our liberties. The election is over, and the actual work of governance will soon begin, with all that it entails. The process continues, and America is strong. We are strong because of our freedoms and our belief in the American ideal. America isn't some concept caught in the past. America is a project, ever growing, something we can believe in and bring into the world. We'll make it. We always have.
