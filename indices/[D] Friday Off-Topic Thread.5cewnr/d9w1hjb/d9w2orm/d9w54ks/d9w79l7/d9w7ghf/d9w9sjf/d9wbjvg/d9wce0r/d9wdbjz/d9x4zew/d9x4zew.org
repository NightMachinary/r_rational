I think you're being asymmetrically rigorous, or at least asymmetrically charitable. If we assume that Trump isn't a madman who will actually order Iranian boats to be blown up like he said he would, shouldn't we also assume that Clinton isn't a mad woman who would have razed Syria and started Word War III?
