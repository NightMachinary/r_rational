/sigh/ It's veteran's day, I've had a quarter of a bottle of scotch, and I'm giving myself a free pass to make an argument from authority.

Authority credentials: 4 years at a service academy, 10 years active duty service as a commissioned officer working as middle management (aka commissioned officer) where to handling things at the lowest possible level is a sign of /basic/ competence, to whit /calling the boss is an admission of failure/.

*Please check your Dunning Kruger at the door. You don't know what you are talking about, and are making the worst type of straw man argument.* /You obviously have no/ *idea* /how seriously an out of area even is planned against, how much things are sent up to prevent it, and seem (this is probably my bias/intoxication talking and not you) to have no respect for the competence of the people who do this shit as a living/ *Training events* conducted in the vicinity of someone else's national territoriality are not *'training events'* they are operational events, with the most stone cold highly prepared people conducting them, probably requested by people with black passports if not higher. * facepalm shakes-head *

Lets just put it this way; asking why we can't use nukes is playing by the rules for leaders in the big strategy game. *We don't want to use nukes. The other guy doesn't want to use nukes,* /we hope,/ barring Grand Ayatolla Ali Khamenei, the game is played so both leaders are/pretend they are willing to use nukes until we can either get rid of them (unfeasible, someone will cheat) or can reliably shoot them all down from the sky at greater than five nines accuracy, yes the much derided star wars is now AEGIS-1 TBMD, google it.

I'm going to back up from my rage and try to recommend something that might be communicative here: [[/u/docfuture]] (sorry to pull you into this) has a great discussion of how corporations are UFAI incubators using people as a computational substrate optimizing for their profit somewhere in his "Maker's ark" novel, nations aren't all that different, but they optimize for survival and influence ( a long term prerequisite survival). Part of influence, when you both are amoeba with big poisonous spines that kill the other guy, and can still be launched, and will generally hit, when you are already impaled and *will die*, oh an yeah the poison will probably eventually slowly kill every amoeba in this puddle; is regularly signaling that you have said death spine. You don't want to use it, lets be honest outside of good SI fanfiction, you have no idea how you'd cross dry land to the next puddle, but if you don't someone else might be stupid enough to use it on you.

Try thinking iterated prisoner's dilemma. We discovered defecting in 1945 when only one party had the defect button; *nobody,* not even an actor, has defected since then the vetting, and or assassination processes, are no-where as weak as you think.
