I really loved the 50% of the show when the executives stopped meddling and let the writers give us some damned good cyberpunk. /Dollhouse/ is basically everything cyberpunk /should/ be; it's only a wonder Topher never attempted to build a recursively self-improving Doll (and even then... those Epitaph episodes...).

Oh, and the identity of the Big Bad is one of the greatest, most retrospectively sensible ass-pulls (in the sense that Joss admitted they /didn't actually plan it ahead of time/) in all of fiction. It really succeeds wonderfully in giving me that "I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING BUT DIDN'T!" feeling. The sheer Magnificent Bastardry of it all is on a level with /Following the Phoenix/'s Quirrellmort's two-day war-starting.
