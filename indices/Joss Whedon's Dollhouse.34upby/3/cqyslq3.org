This is one of the things I liked most about Dollhouse. Initially it seems like the premise is just being used as a plot device to have Imprint of the Week adventures, but after the first 5 episodes or so (presumably when the executives stopped paying attention) it starts to really explore the horrifying implications of the technology.

Also, Epitaph One was downright chilling.
