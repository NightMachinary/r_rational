I really liked Dollhouse. The season one finale ("Epitaph One"), with its flashforwards, was absolutely brilliant - there are all these implications of the technology that have been built up over the course of the season that just hammered home one by one over the course of an hour.

And yes, it's a little uneven at times. I wish that they'd gotten a better actress for the lead, since she's outshined by the other two main dolls (Enver Gjokaj is amazing). I wish that they'd been able to skip some of the more procedural aspects that were forced on them by Fox at the beginning - episodes that you could cut entirely and it wouldn't make any difference at all. But it's still a great premise that gets pretty thoroughly explored, and I've watched it through three times now.
