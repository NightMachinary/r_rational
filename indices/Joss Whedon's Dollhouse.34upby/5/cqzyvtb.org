  TL;DR If you like Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel, Firefly), then you should not miss Dollhouse. Otherwise, it might be a gamble.

Damn. I knew about the existence of Dollhouse before I discovered the gems that are Buffy and Firefly and it never sounded interesting enough to watch just based on summaries and recommendations. I probably heard that it was made by Josh Whedon but it came in a time before that name meant anything to me so I completely failed to update. Now I know what to watch next.
