I don't know about this one. I really liked Firefly and then retroactively reevaluated Buffy and Angel, which I'd blown off for a long time.

Buffy was hugely sprawling and had the usual serial fiction cancers of lack of direction and threat of the week, but was still very interestingly constructed and powerfully implemented modern fantasy soap opera.

Angel was pure monster mystery schlock, but it hit the points it seemed to be aiming for and was entirely watchable in a Scooby-Doo sort of way. Wolfram and Hart is still one of the best supernatural modern fantasy organizations /ever/.

My point is, all three of those aren't very rational (Firefly did it best), but are great for what they were.

I never felt like Dollhouse was great for what it was. It certainly wasn't more rational than his previous works and it suffered from really poor world building. Early episodes were almost unwatchable and it didn't ever get much better. It certainly wasn't very rationally plotted and seemed to follow Lost-style plotting along with some poorly done rule-of-cool.

It felt like a lot of my time as a viewer was being wasted with loving and overly long shots of scantily clad people with little plot or coherent character development. Senselessly wasting the audience's time is a cardinal cinematic sin that I can't forgive. Dollhouse wasn't good softcore porn or sci-fi drama.

I don't think I even watched the last couple of episodes. Maybe that makes up for the rest of it. I sort of doubt that, though.
