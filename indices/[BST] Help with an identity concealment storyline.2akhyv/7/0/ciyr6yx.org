I like the thought. It is a bit unpredictable as it depends on the homeowners not being nutty about parking. (I have, if nothing else, complete faith in the suburbanite ability to turn minor parking annoyances into apocalyptic threats to all they hold dear and precious.) That said it is, barring outliers, a great idea if you choose the location wisely.
