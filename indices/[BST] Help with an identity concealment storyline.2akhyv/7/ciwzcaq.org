I don't know how common this is in other countries but in Melbourne, Australia parking on the side of the street is common in suburbia. So just park it behind another car in a random backstreet. Each household assumes it belongs to one of the others near by, bystander effect means it wont get reported for a month at least if it is in reasonable condition (i.e. it hasn't been in a gun fight). Then you walk to the nearest bus or train stop and disappear.
