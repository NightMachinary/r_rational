Easiest way would probably be for someone with a vested interest in not revealing its origins to take ownership of the car. So ... arrange for the car to be stolen.

Leave the keys in the ignition and the car running in a bad neighborhood, put a post on Craig's List, contact known criminals, etc. Depending on the level of technology you have available, it wouldn't be all that difficult to anonymously set up someone to take it. They would never have to see your face, and so couldn't reveal information about you if they were caught (which they wouldn't be, assuming that you can hand over the paperwork).
