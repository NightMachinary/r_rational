How much time do we have to hide the car?

If we have a warning of a day or something I still think driving out to the middle of no where, ditching it, finding a road and hitchhiking (or walking back). Then when you need to get the car back you either hitchhike back out, or take another car but burn that car when you get there. If you don't have to get the car back you can just burn it in the woods, or drive it into a pond or the sea.

It doesn't have to be impossible to find, just unlikely, chances of someone walking through a forest in the middle of nowhere have to be damn low, you could also just put it in a storage garage.

--------------

1. Buy the car you're going to escape with, find someone on craigslist, show up in a balaclava, buy it in cash. Buy a new set of clothes and put it in this car.\\
2. Take that car and put it outside of town, somewhere no one will find it for a few hours, out the road and hidden.\\
3. Come back into town, walking or cycling or hitchhiking, take your old car out there.\\
4. Get out your old car, throw all your clothes into it and burn it.
5. Simply get into the car you bought earlier that day, literally seconds between switching transport.
