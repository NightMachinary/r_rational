Sneak into a junk yard, put the car in the crusher and call it good. You can bribe someone to do it for you, swap the car for the one that is supposed to be destroyed, whatever.

Alternatively, drive it into a deep lake / old quarry. Just make sure you erase the tire tracks from where it went in.

Alternatively, drop it off in the bad part of town with the doors open and engine running. It'll be stolen and run through a chop shop in minutes. For extra paranoia points, buy a lot of paint and give the car a new paintjob before you drop it off.

If you're really in a hurry, just take the plates off and torch the car -- soak it in gas inside and out, toss a road flare in. The shell will be found but there won't be any fingerprints, DNA, etc. You'll probably want to scratch out the VIN too.

Getting a new car -

Cover yourself up (e.g. hoodie and sunglasses, keep your head down) and hire someone to go into a junkyard and buy you a wreck. The junkyard owner (who is easily findable) knows nothing about you. The random citizen who bought it for you is not easily findable (being utterly random with no obvious connection to you or the junkyard) and never saw you enough to identify you.

How moral is our protagonist? If you did the 'hire someone' option above, you could kill them and bring their body with you until you can dispose of it.

Alternatively, you could carjack a person in a deserted area, kill them, and bring the body until it can be disposed of.

Ways to dispose of a body:

- Best way is to dump it in a barrel of nitro-hydrochloric acid; it will even dissolve the gold fillings in their teeth and their wedding band, let alone their flesh and teeth. Failing convenient chemical stores, you can:

- bury it in the woods

- tie a few cinder blocks to it and throw it in the ocean. Ideally puncture the stomach first so that gas buildup doesn't make it more buoyant after a few days

- throw it in an incinerator

- knock out the teeth to prevent dental matching, then pour gas on it and torch it to destroy face and fingerprints
