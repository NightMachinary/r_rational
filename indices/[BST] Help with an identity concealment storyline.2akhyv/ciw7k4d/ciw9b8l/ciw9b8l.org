They have enough money to buy a small house, but that is the entirety of their resources and they want to use it efficiently. This will likely be necessary later in the escape so it needs to be done as cheaply as possible. They have the van itself. That is it. The threat is an attack by someone that they do not know but who they fear has a great deal of resources at their disposal to track them down .They don't want to give out any information, including which of the group survived the attack, if at all possible. The car can be found, but ideally no one can report seeing them and it won't be for two weeks, though a week would be sufficient.

They want to transfer to anonymous transportation as soon as possible because they fear the unknown assailant has put the car's plates into the police's database or will soon do so.

They are operating without knowledge of the assailants capabilities and are assuming the worst due to certain elements of the attack, including a belief that the attacker might be able to track them if they are in the area near the attack for too long regardless of how anonymous they are. They want to be out of the state, in anonymous transportation, with their old van rendered unfindable for one to two weeks, using as few resources as possible.
