One thing you could do that's pretty simple: paint the van in hippy signs and switch the plates with any random car on the street.

Painting it like a hippy van has several advantages: painting a van a different color is hard to do without it being obvious that it's been repainted (paint isn't quite even, little splotches on the chrome, etc. Painting it as a hippy van, no one is surprised if there's a few glitches in the paint job. It's greatly distinct from its original appearance, and no one is paying attention to the faces of the people in / around it, because they're too busy looking at the van.
