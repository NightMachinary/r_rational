Well, with no prior plan in place, you're pretty much stuck with having some unpleasant problems, it's just a matter of picking your poison. Give the constraints you've outlined elsewhere in the thread, I think sticking the car in a parking garage is probably sufficient - that would likely give you around a week. I know the parking garages that I've used in the past don't tow until three or four days have passed, and even then the van ends up in an impound instead of being registered with the police, IIRC. Long-term parking at an airport would actually be my recommendation, since airports generally connect to bus lines and have a plethora of taxi cabs ready and waiting (assuming they don't have the resources to fake their way onto a plane).

If they're in a big enough city, it would be pretty easy to ditch the car in the hopes that it got stolen and then simply walk to the nearest bus stop or train station.

If they're worried about the plates being run, and they judge they have sufficient time, they could stop in a random parking lot somewhere and swap their plates with someone else before ditching the car, which buys even more time, and likely goes unnoticed for a significant length of time.
