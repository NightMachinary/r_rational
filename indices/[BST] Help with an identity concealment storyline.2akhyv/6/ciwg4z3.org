Why do I have to switch cars? Are the police watching for this particular car? If so, I'd probably just switch plates, drive along country roads, and give my car a crappy spray paint job.

If I really need a different mode of transportation, hm. Carjacking or identity theft seem too difficult for me. Probably the easiest would be to look up someone who's selling a used car, and then lie through my teeth (sob story, fake name on bill of sale, pay with cash or forge check). Alternately, maybe I could acquire a fake ID and buy train tickets with cash.

Of course, this is a very "lifeboat" scenario - all alone in the middle of the ocean. How about borrowing a friend's car? Having a friend buy your train tickets / rent a car. Call up my parents and get them to buy me a plane ticket - or even come pick me up.
