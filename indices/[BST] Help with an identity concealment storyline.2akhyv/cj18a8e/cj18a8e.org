If I might offer a late entry to the mix. Buy a tarp for cars, bring the car to someplace semi-public pull into a driveway for a house that has a for rent sign. If you can manage it talk to the person you of the building for rent if you could rent the place for a few days and cover the vehicle with the tarp. Call for a taxi or take a bus or other form of public transportation. The tarp stops the car from being readily id'd and stops most people from lifting the tarp to see what is under it. Rent is a lot cheaper than buying a house outright, even for one month. Pay in cash and you are almost untraceable as you can get. The person you rent the house from might be able to ID you but for the short term you are golden.
