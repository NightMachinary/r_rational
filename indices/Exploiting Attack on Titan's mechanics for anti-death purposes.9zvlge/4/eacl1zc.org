Attack on Titan has the most inconsistent universe. Most of the rules about how Titans work are designed for maximum drama, and clear that they never thought of them when the earlier episodes were being written.

I'm sure if the humans ever figured out a way to harness energy from a Titan, a magical teleporting titan would show up just to smash it all and disappear again.
