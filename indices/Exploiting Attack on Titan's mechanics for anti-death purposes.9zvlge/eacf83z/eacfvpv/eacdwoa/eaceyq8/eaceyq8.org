Titan mass is destroyed when severed from the titan. The only exception to this is the titan crystal, which only shifters can use at will. (Or titans with the capability given the directive by the Coordinate power, as seen with the walls.) You could use this for building really fast, but not much else. The only other thing I think is viable is using the heat given off by their regeneration as a source of energy, or just harnessing the colossal titan's steam release ability. Those both have resource costs (wasting the materials that can damage titan skin, building a colossal titan sized steam plant, etc.)
