I agree about the inconsistency of it all. One of the biggest plot holes is that it's once stated that the Titans are really low density and light (which I suppose is sort of meant to obviate the fact that this mass is created from nowhere? Perhaps we should really believe it's just condensed sunlight?), but then when they attack they totally seem massive and cause comparable damage. If they really were light they could be knocked over with no effort by all the cannonballs they instead tank without a problem.
