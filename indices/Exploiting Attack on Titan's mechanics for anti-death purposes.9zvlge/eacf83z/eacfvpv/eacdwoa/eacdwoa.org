With their technology and population, it seems pretty hard to exploit this mechanic. But its true, you can get infinite flesh aka mass from these titans, free energy? You could also build a hamster wheel type structure which you can get energy from. Using wild titans seems hard but human hybrids can be exploited in many ways because of their size-changing nature, they could be transformed in an enclosure(underground?) which only has a human-sized exit, once you have them there im sure they can be used in one way or another.

I don't think titans can walk under the sea but its possible, they already ignore so many laws.
