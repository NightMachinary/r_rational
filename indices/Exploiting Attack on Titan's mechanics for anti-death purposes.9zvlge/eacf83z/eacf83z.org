Not needing to eat + predictable behavior + wanting to eat humans = free energy. Any design which harnesses zombies for power should work with titans scaled up with sufficiently durable materials assuming no hostile special titans (which gives the series an excuse, sort of). But you only really need a few titans in a secure facility to produce a lot of power, which isn't a huge security risk. You can have it underground for more special titan security or outside the walls for better scalability
