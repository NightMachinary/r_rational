Just a few things: there are 9 unique titan shifters, not 7. Mindless titans need at least some amount of solar energy to operate, even though the amount required isn't the same from one individual to another, so it's not like they produce energy out of nowhere. Also, while the mechanism of "eating a shifter to become one" has been covered in the anime, the 13y curse and 9 unique shifters are not yet revealed so be careful with spoilers.\\
Other than that, very interesting ideas.
