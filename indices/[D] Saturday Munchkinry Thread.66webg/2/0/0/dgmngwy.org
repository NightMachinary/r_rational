Probably, though you have to do the work to move the boulder. Since I was asking this based on my personal urban fantasy universe, you're a supernatural creature with an unimaginable amount of inertia, so you can physically lift it. But repeatedly moving it might wear you out. Still likely possible on some scale though - though all your own energy comes from the sun, so it's probably not /proper/ free energy, but it's away to use the "arbitrarily powerful solar panels" on your body to make electricity, so that's pretty neat.

Yep. Would definitely be possible.

  Put stuff in stasis

Not people, but probably organs and definitely sensitive instruments and medicine.

Drug mueling could definitely be in your future.

The character in my urban fantasy setting who has this hammerspace is a 4D creature (as are vampires and werewolves), so if he were to simply talk to a physicist he'd probably be able to blow their mind...
