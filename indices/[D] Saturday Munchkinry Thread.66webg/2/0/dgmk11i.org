Arbitrarily large, you say? My first thoughts are:

- Free energy: Any time I can cheat gravity by producing more energy going downwards than it takes to move me back up, there's potential for free energy. Even something as simple as a type of revolving platform where I stand and spawn / despawn a huge boulder would work.

- Efficient transportation: Rockets are very weight sensitive, could I be used to bring massive quantities of rocket fuel out of earth's gravity well for free? Can I bring massive containers full of food and water to areas that need it?

- Put stuff in stasis: Does stuff in hammerspace experience time? How about environmental effects like oxygen? Can I save a dying person or organ by putting them in hammer space and bringing them to a hospital? Can I transport sensitive instruments, medicine, and other things with special conditions without disturbing them?

- Illicit activities: Someone with this ability could become a perfect smuggler, get past any kind of security checkpoint, perform all kinds of spying / corporate espionage. The criminal route could be used to make jaw-dropping amounts of money, which could then be put to whatever other kind of use you need (buying political influence?)

- Messing with material physics: What /exactly/ happens when I put stuff in hammerspace and take it out? How does it interact with gasses? Can I abuse it to fuse things together? Can I take reacting thermite and put it in the middle of an enclosed space to cause an explosion? I'm sure there's a lot of things that I don't know about here, I'd consult a real material physicist and get them to develop good experiments

- Learn the secrets of other-dimensional physics: By getting help from real physicists, experiment to find out exactly how my hammerspace power works. Make devices to replicate it, if possible. If things get put in hammerspace instantly, figure out to abuse the FTL transportation to make some kind of signalling system that can get information from the future and win at everything. If not, the idea of inter-dimensional spaces is interesting enough. Maybe we could learn to fold space in interesting ways, that has more than a few uses.
