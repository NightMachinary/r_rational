That depends on the nature and properties of the hammerspace. Does time flow there? Is it one large space, an arbitrary number of pocket universes, one for each item, or something in between? Does time flow in hammerspace? Is there an atmosphere in hammerspace, or can you change that? Can living things enter hammerspace? How does gravity work in hammerspace? What's the topology of hammerspace? Does it have an entrance, or do thing's simply appear? What happens when an entrance intersects something, or when something tries to appear where something else is? What /is/ and object? Is an explosion an object?

Assuming an ideal kind of situation, that is, a controllable atmosphere, pocket universes, toroidal and/or flat topology, controllable gravity, entrances between spaces allowed to be constructed, the best idea is to found a new universe, with infinitely falling mass drivers as easy sources of energy, and basically go around scooping up all the stuff in the universe, to give to humanity as easily accessible resources.
