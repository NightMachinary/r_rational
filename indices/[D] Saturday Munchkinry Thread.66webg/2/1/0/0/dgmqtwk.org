  Basically, you wouldn't be able to pull something out of hammerspace and into something else anymore than you can park two cars in the same parking spot. That is to say, you could probably displace the thing you want to displace, but you'd end up with a damaged car in the next parking spot over.

That's useful, and definitely a point of interest for further research. Cars are the most dangerous things people interact with on a daily basis, after all. It's pretty much an instant ko for anything you drop something on, and since large rocks are not rare, it's not like you'll have a lack of anything to drop. Also, it's likely to be useful for resolving aoe effects. The colision obviously imparts some kind of 4 dimensional momentum onto whatever gets hit, but how does that eventually resolve? Does the boulder and whatever it's sitting on start chemically fusing together? Do they slide off each other? Do they just sit there, locked in place?

  Not sure. I'd assume it wouldn't exist, or if it did, it would cause things you're carrying in hammerspace to want to fall towards the centre of the earth if you were to "let them go".

Gravity in 4 dimensions follows r^{3} instead of r^{2,} so unless you invoke magic bullshit^{tm} gravity shouldn't bleed into the 4th dimension.

What happens when you start doing more exotic constructions with 4space? Can you, for example, weld together a hypercube? can you make a 4 dimensional ramp so people can move themselves into hyperspace?
