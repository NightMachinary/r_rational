Let's do this in reverse order:

#+begin_quote
  so people can move themselves into hyperspace
#+end_quote

Well, crap. People would be able to put on space suits and go into hammerspace~hyperspace, wouldn't they? I suppose there's not much to do there. Great way to hide out from the cops for a few hours, though. I'd also imagine it would be pretty cold so you'd need a heated suit.

#+begin_quote
  Can you, for example, weld together a hypercube
#+end_quote

Yep, though I think welding itself requires oxygen; you'd be able to produce a hypercube through whatever modalities would work in this universe though.

#+begin_quote
  gravity shouldn't bleed into the 4th dimension
#+end_quote

Thanks; I think this came up before and that was why my first instinct was that there'd be no gravity, but I was a bit scared it would have some unforeseen consequences.

#+begin_quote
  invoke magic bullshit
#+end_quote

my husband has assured me that using the particular type of 4D physics he has in mind means you can basically do any magic you want. I'm not 100% sure how this is, but I'm not trying to make the magic too logical, just logical enough that it's not obviously problematic: tons of stuff can still happen under the hood.

#+begin_quote
  The colision obviously imparts some kind of 4 dimensional momentum onto whatever gets hit, but how does that eventually resolve?
#+end_quote

I always go back to Flatland to inform my intuition here. Suppose I have a poker chip on my table. If I press on the edge of it, the opposite edge will be displaced upwards (so: 3D object would have its other side "disappear"). If I press on it down and sidewards, it will move in the direction I pushed it (so: 3D object that is displaced will move in whatever direction the displacing object was moved in from). I press down on the centre of it with my finger, perfectly vertically with no horizontal component, and I'm strong enough, I end up punching a hole through my table that the poker chip falls through (so: a 3D object that is displaced with velocity ONLY in the 4th dimension will seem to disappear altogether [really: floats around in hyperspace] and be replaced by whatever displaced it.)

#+begin_quote
  Does the boulder and whatever it's sitting on start chemically fusing together? Do they slide off each other? Do they just sit there, locked in place?
#+end_quote

So, per the above, they slide off each other. I think it would be very difficult to impart force in such a way as to be able to "pop" an object out of the 3rd dimension, as e.g. pushing a rock down, the shape of the rock would be enough to impart a lateral velocity on whatever it was displacing.
