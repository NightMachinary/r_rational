You are a group of vampire hunters in an Urban Fantasy version of 2017 Chicago.

Vampires are a shadowy power controlling government, law enforcement and the letter agencies by manipulating or enthralling humans from behind the scenes. So they have access to all the tools of these institutions - warrants, arrest orders, satellites, undercover agents, forensics, cell phone tracking, internet surveillance, GPS trackers, SWAT, black ops teams, media spin, etc. etc. They will spend considerable intelligent, rational effort to eliminate you, including "enhanced" interrogation and faking gas explosions to destroy entire buildings full of civilians. Going to the media or scientists with proof of the supernatural will get you nowhere but six feet under.

Vampires occasionally take direct action in which case they are about three times as powerful as a well prepared and equipped hunter, or six times as strong if the hunter is poorly prepared and equipped.

Vampires can be found alone or in small groups when they are out getting some blood.

You have these goals:

- Maintain a headquarter where you have the equipment, books and mystical artifacts needed give hunters what they need to be considered "well-equipped". This could be but does not need to be a fixed location. The HQ is considered to fit in a shipping container or eighteen wheeler if needed. Hunters need to restock after each fight.
- Avoid detection as your hunters dispatch vampires and visit the HQ to resupply. The vampires are as smart and knowledgeable as you are, have numerical advantage over you and have access to the above mentioned human resources and technology.\\

For this exercise we ignore magic, both hunter and vampire.
