As others have pointed out ansibles allow infinite computing and anti telephone communication to any point after you create the first one.\\
However if you're using it for infinite computing you can also pull some hypercomputer anthropic tricks. For instance running many simulation of yourself that are the same except they are being deluded about the external world, and really they live in a universe that is much more convenient in some way. Basically this lets you have near total control over external reality (except for the one top level iteration of you, but they can just keep making more simulation and running them at infinite speed since as a FAI you're not selfish, hell even let the humans at top level emigrate to these lower levels and you will be basically totally safe from external threats).

Also having an antitelephone can be leveraged into free energy. Just use energy to get information about a system a-la Maxwell's Demon, then send that info back so you can use that info to get free energy without having to spend any energy obtaining it. With the right setup I'm confident you could get arbitrary energy this way, maybe with the end result (perfected over many iterations) looking like a bizarre butterfly effect exploit. As you slightly nudge some gas and suddenly have it sort itself into hot and cold portions.
