I'm pretty sure you can get information-based time travel by putting the other ansible on a space ship and having it continually accelerate in some manner. (I /think/ it has to accelerate away from Earth, with the effect magnified by how far away the other ship is, but I'm not completely sure). You won't be able to send messages back to before you got your local receiver station (well, you will be able to send it, but there will be nothing around to pick them up so it's difficult to affect anything).
