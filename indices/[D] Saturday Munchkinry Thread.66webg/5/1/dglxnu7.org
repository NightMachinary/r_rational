I'm assuming that the objects don't glow brilliant white or anything like that when they aren't being actively used. My goals would then be to only empower items that I can use and carry in every situation without raising suspicions.

Empower a handgun, with the possible prerequisite of moving to the US and getting a concealed carry permit.

Also empower an undershirt (for armor) and dress shoes and a belt for other utility.
