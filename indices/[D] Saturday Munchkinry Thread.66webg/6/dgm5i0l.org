You are capable of generating a substance that instantly implements all non-mental processes an organism would undergo over some span of time given healthy conditions. So if you give ten years' worth to a one-year-old, you'll wind up with an infant mind in an eleven-year-old body. If you give the right amount to someone with a fresh wound, then if they were capable of recovering from it, they will (at the cost of physically being older by however much time it would have taken them to recover naturally). The substance can't regenerate, say, amputated limbs in humans, because humans don't naturally regenerate their amputated limbs; however, if you, say, find a lizard that regenerates its tail when it's chopped off, you can use it to regenerate that, and you can use it on humans to regenerate things that humans naturally regenerate, like blood or the liver.

There are several obvious health risks posed by the substance: of course it can kill you if you take enough of it to age to death; and amounts that naively seem safe can still give you any health problem that could randomly develop in the equivalent amount of time, like cancer. Also be careful giving it to pregnant women - it'll skip over time for both the mother and the fetus, which is good within reasonable bounds, but leads to body horror stuff if you go over those reasonable bounds.

How do you optimize benefit to society from this substance? There are surely some good uses on humans, but there seem to be much more unambiguously good uses in food production.
