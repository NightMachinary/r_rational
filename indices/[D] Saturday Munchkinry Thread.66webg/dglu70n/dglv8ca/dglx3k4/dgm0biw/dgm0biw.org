Ansibles can be used to instantly find the answer to a problem where it's quicker to check the correctness of the answer than to find the answer. (Example: finding a new prime number, decrypting a message). You still need to put in the processing power to verify the answer before sending it back in time (or else you'll likely just get plausible-looking random noise from the time loop) but it'll certainly speed things up.
