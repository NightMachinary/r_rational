#+begin_quote
  Does time flow there
#+end_quote

Yes, in 1:1

#+begin_quote
  Is it one large space, an arbitrary number of pocket universes, one for each item, or something in between?
#+end_quote

It is one large space, but you can e.g. create an arbitrarily large number of bags to put your items in (but the bags have to be large enough to fit the items: the bags aren't hammerspace)

#+begin_quote
  Is there an atmosphere in hammerspace, or can you change that?
#+end_quote

Not sure on this one. Things in hammerspace don't get destroyed, they are put in a sort of suspended animation. If you put a living thing in hammerspace it would asphyxiate, so it's definitely not a breathable atmosphere.

#+begin_quote
  How does gravity work in hammerspace?
#+end_quote

Not sure. I'd assume it wouldn't exist, or if it did, it would cause things you're carrying in hammerspace to want to fall towards the centre of the earth if you were to "let them go".

#+begin_quote
  What's the topology of hammerspace?
#+end_quote

Hammerspace is a 4D hyperplane(???? I can give you a proper answer if you really want, husband's a mathematician) upon which the 3D universe is one "slice" - so you store things in hammerspace by putting them "perpendicular to reality" and holding them there (you yourself are a 4D being who is living in the 3D world, so your items in hammerspace are being stored elsewhere on your 4D form in a series of backpacks/etc). The 4D universe is barren though; there's nothing of interest to you there. It's just been constructed by Magic because it can let you do a bunch of magical things (e.g. hammerspace). i.e. the 3D universe is where it's at.

#+begin_quote
  Does it have an entrance, or do thing's simply appear?
#+end_quote

You make things appear and disappear by pulling them into and out of hammerspace using your 4D arms

#+begin_quote
  What happens when an entrance intersects something, or when something tries to appear where something else is?
#+end_quote

Basically, you wouldn't be able to pull something out of hammerspace and into something else anymore than you can park two cars in the same parking spot. That is to say, you could probably displace the thing you want to displace, but you'd end up with a damaged car in the next parking spot over.

#+begin_quote
  What is and object? Is an explosion an object?
#+end_quote

Anything you can grab and manipulate. Weight is not an issue, though - as a 4D being you have unimaginable inerta. So an explosion is not an object, no, since you can't pick it up.
