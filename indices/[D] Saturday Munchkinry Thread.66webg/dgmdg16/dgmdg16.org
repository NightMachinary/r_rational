I meant to ask this last week, but here we go:

/Beauty and the Beast/. Enchanted castle where the servants are all objects, and the master of the house is a hideous beast. He needs true love's first kiss (or something) in order for everyone to be turned back into their human forms.

How do you munchkin from your choice of:

- The beast

- A random piece of furniture (or: which piece of furniture would be best to be transformed into, and why?)

- You're Gaston. How would you ensure you got to marry Belle?
