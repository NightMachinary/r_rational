Glad you liked it! It definately is a very different and modern way to house a vampire setting. I've put some more thought into this since, I hope you don't mind me spouting more thoughts xD

Regarding sensitive/valuable artifacts: The longer running this organization is, the more seniority and rank can play into things. After all, if you've been participating in raids for a decade without capture, it's rather unlikely you're compromised!

Regarding Face to Face interaction: The main problem with this is the possibility of being tracked by satellite. I've put some thought into this specifically. You'll want a large underground area, the bigger the better but minimum a couple block to a side. Members use random entrances, there are multiple meetup locations inside. Even if the vampires were tracking one member, it would be difficult to figure out who else in a multi-block area they were meeting with. Keeps one compromised character from compromising others :).

Anyother thing is that you could use such an underground system for is housing. Enter underground, take an elevator up into an apartment building on the surface. You could even have multiple hunters living in the same building for team/companionship reasons. Nnever more than 3-4 I'd say, and never knowing where other groups live. If one person moves out, everyone switches building.

This solution somewhat depends on how realistic a Chicago you want. Less realistic and I'd say have the majority of the underground be hollowed out with subways and tunnels and caves. More realistic, and you might have the docks area and it's underside be hunter living grounds. I still argue face to face interaction should be minimized, but (and I'm assuming this is to be a book/rpg) you do want character moments.

Ambush parties: You could definately run this exact same system, but replace individual hunters with small groups and have it work exactly the same. Basically, you get better capture reporting and coordination traded off for worse survivability outside of combat. Which one is better depends on a lot of factors, and if you're writing it you can easily make small groups make more sense than individuals :)

Unrelated improvements/thoughts:

I think it would be safer to change the box movement time from 3 days to directly after a raid. Milly reduces the chance of a capture being use to get into the system.

One of the things I was thinking about was that your hunters would benefit from lots of individual/small group transportation options. Motorcycles galore, I would expect (handlebar mounted shotguns optional).

Another danger is that adding new groups/members to such a system is by design very difficult. Only the most trusted hunters should be able to do so, if it's allowed at all. Safer would be to remake the entire hubs system outside the city every few years. Also would be safer to only recruit new hunters from outside of city, and have training facilities outside the city.
