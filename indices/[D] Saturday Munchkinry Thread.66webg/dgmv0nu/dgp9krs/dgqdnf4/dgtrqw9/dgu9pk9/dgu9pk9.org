That's basically my way of giving feedback myself :) Brainstorming is great for tickling the idea nerve.

Senior members keeping the "good stuff" is a good idea. They can either be elite squads that handle tougher cases, or perhaps cooperate with regular (trusted) teams as needed.

Regarding satellite tracking, staying indoors/underground, changing clothes and group size, traveling in vehicles/trains etc. can all be used to at least complicate tracking.

For hand-offs and brief meetings, large crowded places are good, and can also be used to see if a member is being followed. If only one member is compromised, the others can safely observe them before making contact. For longer meetings/socializing, paths can be taken that makes following obvious or at least extremely difficult/risky for the pursuer.

Definitely going to go with small teams of 3-4, that work solo some of the time but gather when needed for non-trivial missions or as backup when things go south. Teams make sense for many reasons; standing guard while sleeping, identity verification, human contact/bonding/loyalty, different people can go get food to avoid patterns, etc.

Motorcycles are good, but cars have the advantage that you can't see who's in it from a satellite or rooftop, so both are useful.

New members could be recruited either by very trusted hunters (which exposes the most valuable members) or by the teams themselves, and access to the network granted only after multiple successful missions. Until they are accepted they communicate with burner phones, notes, or a specific "recruitment wifi" that is handled much in the same way as the main network but is separated from it and only used to communicate with new recruits.

Thanks again for the good ideas!
