Thank you for a ton of good ideas! I especially liked the alternate login as a flag for capture.

I also like the "temporary private wifi" solution for communication off the normal internet/phone systems that can presumed to be monitored.

I originally wanted the headquarters to be a location for character interaction, and a cool setting with old books and strange objects in glass boxes, but perhaps a distributed solution is more plausible. It would also be a very different setup from most similar stories.

I have a few spontaneous thoughts/questions:

Not all members of the organization will be trusted with the most valuable assets (ancient books and artifacts). Perhaps not a problem - for example the "library team" could have the books split between them in vans or small trucks and be isolated from the most exposed members by layers of increasingly more trusted members.

I do need opportunity for characters to have interactions face to face. Meetings, mission planning/debriefing, socializing etc.

Since vampires are best confronted in an ambush type of situation and with numerical superiority of around three to one. I guess instead of individual hunters there could be small hunter teams of 3-4 people instead. If they minimize their group activity outside missions and switch clothes and phones often (and other counter-surveillance tactics) they could be almost as safe as a single hunter, have more equipment on hand at short notice and also have face-to-face knowledge that can spot imposters that would otherwise look credible from just wifi chats. They can also redundantly report missing/compromised/rogue hunters.

You have given me lots to think about!
