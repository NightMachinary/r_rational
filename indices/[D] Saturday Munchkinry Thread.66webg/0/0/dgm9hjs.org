Escape the planet's gravity well? Hmmm. I presume we don't need to escape it in any particular direction - that is, as long as we don't aim ourselves at the nearest star, we can pretty much point ourselves any-which-way and just pour on enough speed? That already eliminates a /lot/ of tricky mathematical difficulties at the end there.

Alright. So, basically, the aim is to build a box - with air and food - big enough for everyone, and then throw it really hard off the planet. Ability to /land/ again is kind of optional.

But getting off the planet is not the /difficult/ part of this challenge. The difficult part is surviving the first few months. Once we've resolved the issues of food, shelter, and dangerous creature(s), the rest is more or less just a matter of time - especially if I bring along a geologist and a metallurgist. So, at first, I want a few Survivalist types - the sort of person who are actually /happy/ being thrown into an alien wilderness with nothing - to help the rest of us through that starting period.. Then, as I'd mentioned, a geologist and a metallurgist - they should between them be able to figure out how to get hold of and handle metals. Add in a chemical engineer to solve the problem of fuel. And then, just because, I'll volunteer the entire staff of NASA - they have a lot of experience with getting things into space. A lot of fitters and turners and so on. Mixed gender, around 50% male, 50% female, if any of the team is married their spouse comes with as well (this might very well be a multigeneration thing). Cooks, farmers, architects - all the people who, in one way or another, keep our civilisation working.

And when we build the ship, we'll leave behind us a viable Earth colony. Because having humans living on two planets is better for long-term survival of the race.

(In easy mode, I can afford to be less picky about my team's qualifications. In hard mode, I might try to volunteer the entire human population of Earth - it shouldn't be too hard to find enough people to form a group and work together (No, wait, on second thoughts that's a bad idea. We don't want small babies being randomly shuffled to random locations.)).
