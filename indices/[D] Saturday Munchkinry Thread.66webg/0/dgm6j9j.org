A representative of an alien race comes to you and informs you that, as part of a test of mankind's capabilities, you will be transported to an alien planet, and will be tasked with escaping from that planet. You have one year to assemble a team, at which point you will all be teleported to this new planet.

*RULES:*

- You're not allowed to bring anything with you, just your team. You arrive naked and carrying nothing, and will have to work your way up from very simple tools.
- It's heavily implied that the survival of the species is on the line, so you more or less have your pick of anyone you want to join your crew.
- Because of the gravity of the situation, things like state secrets aren't an issue; you have access to any classified information which you can give a reasonable justification for needing.
- However, because you can't bring anything, the information you take with is limited by how much you and your team can collectively memorize.
- The destination planet has been selected as one that can easily support human life. It has a mostly temperate climate, and most of the flora and fauna are edible, but exactly which ones you'll need to figure out for yourself.
- There's no hard time limit, but escaping quickly will result in a higher score, and therefore a higher chance of survival.
- There's no strict cap on your group's size, but a group that succeeds with fewer people in the same amount of time gets a higher score. In addition, there are the typical difficulties with scale as the size of your group increases.
- Simply getting out of the atmosphere, or even into orbit, doesn't count; you need to escape the planet's gravity well.
- Furthermore, you have to be alive when this happens, and your aim is to get as large a percentage of the team off the planet as possible.
- In the event that this becomes a multigenerational effort, "the team" will be considered to consist of the entire human population of the planet. You're free to reproduce like mad in an attempt to up your labor force, but keep in mind that this would also mean you need to transport that many more people off of the planet.
- The aliens are watching, and don't take kindly to cheaters and wise guys. If, for example, you genocide everyone but the pilot just before launch and try to argue that 100% of your team escaped, humanity will be immediately disqualified, with whatever consequences that entails.

How would you plan your escape? Whom would you add to your team, what information would you endeavor to collect, and what steps would you take upon arriving on the alien planet in order to eventually get off? You have the benefit of modern science and engineering, but don't start with modern equipment.

*EASY MODE:*

Disregard the memorization requirement. The aliens provide you with a read-only archive of the Internet as of the day you left Earth. This isn't intended as a "tool" /per se/, but rather as a catalog of humanity's accumulated knowledge. As such, Google Calculator won't work, but a lookup table will.

*HARD MODE:*

Your team arrives scattered randomly across the land of the planet. You need to find each other first before you can get much done.
