As the beast I'd use espionage to angle for political power. With an extremely loyal corps of servants who can blend seamlessly as inanimate objects, information gathering, blackmail, and assassination straight to the top of French Nobility and beyond should be trivial.

As one of the servants/objects, I think it would be a similar gambit. Either advise and work with the Beast on the Espionage campaign or mutiny against him and lead the other servants myself.

In either case, the nature of the curse is relevant to the end-game. If everybody becomes inanimate when the curse runs out, then getting the Beast some therapy and on the dating circuit in the meantime is a major priority. If the countdown just ends with everyone being stuck as they are...so be it. Better a potentially immortal bookcase ruling Continental Europe than a mortal meat bag emptying Monsieur et Madam's chamber pots for the rest of my life.

As Gaston, how about not being a supreme dickhead? I mean, /ensuring/ I get to marry Belle might be a bit of a stretch, but I bet I could up my odds by having a personality that's not Gaston's.

She's into books; I'm into books. She wants to go on adventures; I'm a wealthy 7-foot mesomorph who can /make that happen/.
