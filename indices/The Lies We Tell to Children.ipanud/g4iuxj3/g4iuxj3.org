  When Twilight is awake, Celestia is her teacher, and she a faithful student. But when Twilight shuts her eyes, another mare approaches, who teaches her a very different lesson.

The author is a long-time participant in the rationalist community, so I think this story belongs here. Again and again, it poses the question: should one prefer the cynical truth, or ignorant happiness? In this fic, Luna represents the colder side of rationality, the temptation to say emotions don't matter, that even a child can and should be burdened with the most terrible facts of the world. Celestia, meanwhile, is an incrementalist. Their battle-by-proxy over a single person is one that shows the advantages and the downsides to both approaches.
