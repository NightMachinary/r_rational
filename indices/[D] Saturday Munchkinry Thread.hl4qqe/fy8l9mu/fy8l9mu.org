*Time Loop and WW2 era Poland:*

On September 1 , 1939 Poland was attacked by the Nazis, and 2 weeks later by the Soviets.

Imagine if the second the clock ticks 12 PM , on September 30, 1939, every Pole was sent back to September 1, with all the knowledge they got since. (For the sake of the argument, this is purely mental time travel like in *Mother of Learning*).

How could Poland use that power to fend of the Nazis and the Soviets and keep their independence? How many loops would it take until they could win decisively? What would be your strategy if you were the leader of the Polish army and knew about the Loop?
