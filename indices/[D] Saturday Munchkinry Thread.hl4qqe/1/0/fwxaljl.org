The solution to belief-based powers is almost always starting a cult.

In this case, it is a little tricky because only the beliefs of your enemies count, your followers beliefs don't matter. So you would either need to convince your cult that you are the enemy, or get a cooperator to start a cult and designate you as the enemy of their god, then ascribe all kinds of supernatural powers to you as reasons for why god has not killed you yet and why none of the cultists should try.
