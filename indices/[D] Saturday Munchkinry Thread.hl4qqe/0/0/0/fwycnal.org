I really appreciate the idea of curating text messaging friendships in order to "naturally" receive stock and natural disaster tips. Because you're right, future seeing powers are so hideously broken that the best choice you have is to try and unbreak it.

(also by "text message" I meant any sort of texting-adjacent service so Signal, Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc... though then you get in easy to munchkin territory by just joining the biggest group chats you can find)
