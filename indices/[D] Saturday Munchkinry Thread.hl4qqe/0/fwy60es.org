I had a dream last night that I could see text messages from the future.

That's easy to munchkin: just sign up for a service that tells you the best performing stock for the next day, or have a friend text you once a day with the most important thing you'd need to know in the past. Or have a second phone and text it to yourself. Like the black pill(?) in that SSC story.

So, for something a little more interesting, it should be limited (or, at least, I'm saying that I don't want 100 different variations of "play the stock market" or "predict sports": assume that well is tapped unless you have something really innovative). You can see text messages from the future, but only messages that aren't sent in an attempt to "use" your power. (Ignore the fact that the definition of this sort of thing is more "I know it when I see it" than objective.)

So you can just see the "normal" messages your friends or spouses send you. Also, things like medical test results or appointment reminders. IDK.

(In my dream, FWIW, I used the power to determine whether I should be sending my ex text messages or not based on whether I was getting good responses, because dreams are dreams.)
