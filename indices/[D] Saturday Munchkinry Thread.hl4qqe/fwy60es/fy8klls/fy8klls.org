not really a powerful munchkin, but consider:

- write fiction is small, SMS sized increments

- send it to a professional editor/ghost writer to polish it.

- have them send it to you back as a text message

due to the way this future power works, you would just be getting constant stream of decent quality writing, without actually having to write anything or pay for anything, just the intent to do so would be enough to "trigger" the texts.
