  You can see text messages from the future, but only messages that aren't sent in an attempt to "use" your power. (Ignore the fact that the definition of this sort of thing is more "I know it when I see it" than objective.)

  So you can just see the "normal" messages your friends or spouses send you. Also, things like medical test results or appointment reminders. IDK.

I don't really get a lot of normal texts. Like basically zero other than for communicating instructions or immediately relevant information. If the power has a built in censor that shuts down deliberate manipulation, I'd have to actively go out of my way to make friends on [[/r/wallstreetbets]] or something in hopes of making a few friends who would naturally text about stock market movements. You could also seek out the kind of conspiracy theorists who will text incessantly about things that happen and what they /really/ mean. You should be able to gleam some general information about events, once you discard their personal spin on it. But that just gets us back to circumventing the rules you set.

If you could subscribe to major news sites and have them text you breaking news stories, you could use that to decide whether to pull the trigger on assassinations, major crimes, etc.

Really it all comes down to the censor, and what they decide to block. If you're allowed to seek out people who naturally talk a lot about specific topics, that helps. If I'm limited to going through my daily routines until I get information I can act on, the power is basically useless for me. Although I suppose it could still serve as some kind of disaster detector, since friends and family would be quite likely to text if they or I were present at the scene of some major natural disaster or similar.
