Tell your allies all about how great you are and how your powers can help them, then betray them to make enemies. Tell everyone slightly different details so that they don't know your actual power, since only the parts they agree on count.

Alternatively, be extremely benevolent and kind to make as few enemies as possible, and ruthless in the shadows to take out the few enemies you do make, so that the majority of your enemies are a harem of exes you cultivate, who are still a little bit in love with you. It's a more fragile state against sudden groups of enemies but it comes with better utility powers, since the love bitsjust make you better at everything.

Second alterative: just go full ham on being a psycho so everyone believes you're capable of anything, then build on that legend.
