Given this hypothetical, the most efficient way I can think of is some sort of JigSaw involving orphans, probably. It would be something like:

Capture a bunch of orphans (attack an orphanage or immorally abuse the foster care system until you get a good amount of orphans).

Convince that bunch of kids that they need to defeat their captor in a death game to escape. Technically the captor would be you, so you would be the enemy, but you would also be acting as a third party in opposition of the "captor". This way any abilities that they attribute to the captor or the helpful third party both apply to you.

Start convincing them of supernatural abilities and look to snowball in power.

First would be ability to detect lies. This will help "refine" the power source.

Then some ability with the capability to deal visible damage or kill. Use ability to detect lies to "root out" the most skeptical. Using this ability on the most skeptical will solidify the supernatural into far more believability.

Then some ability with the capability to help. With supernatural belief solidified, one should probably be able to convince them that the third party has the ability to strengthen them or heal wounds.

After that, I think it's a good enough foundation to eventually get to some power that would make any remaining problems trivial.

Memory rewriting, reality warping, time stop, precognition, omniscience, omnipotent, etc.
