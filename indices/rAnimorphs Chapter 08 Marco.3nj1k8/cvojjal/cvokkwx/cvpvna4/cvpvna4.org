I wonder to what degree the sensation of fear or pain in a host organism can be considered pleasant. If humans can enjoy the fear which comes from a horror film, how much more could a Yeerk enjoy the fear response?

Imagine a Yeerk putting its host in a situation which appears life-threatening, but which the Yeerk (and the Yeerk alone) knows is safe.
