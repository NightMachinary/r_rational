Oh right, I forgot about the time matrix. If Cassie actually has unusual morphing powers (has that actually been shown?) then I expect that will make a difference at some point in the series.

The issue with having the Ellimist/Crayak is that you either end up with a Rube Goldberg contraption of events leading to the finale, which seems unlikely to make sense in an explicitly rational fic, or he's vastly underpowered for some unknown reason.

But I suppose we'll see as it continues.
