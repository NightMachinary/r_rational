Agreed. It seems pretty obvious that Crayak would have set up Esplin and Alloran during the 'setup phase' so to speak, given the unlikelihood of such a thing occurring. Not only is an Andalite-Controller nigh unheard of in canon, Alloran himself is literally the worst possible Andalite for the Yeerks to have captured, at least among the set of Andalites Esplin has met. It screams of a Crayak move: "The best Andalite mind in your army is captured by the Yeerks, and is mine now. Your move Ellimist. No tagbacks, remember?."

As for moves 'on camera' ... I may have to read what's been done so far again. It may also be possible, as I mentioned earlier, that the Ellimist gets more 'moves' than Crayak, as he clearly controls the weaker side in this conflict. Depending on your definition of 'on camera', I wouldn't be surprised if Crayak disabled Elfangor's planet-killer to prevent an Ellimist win. Or perhaps both sides agreed this would be done in order to set the stage for the conflict.

I love the fic so far, by the way. The combination of rationality, speed, and lethality is amazing. I follow along with very few fics, normally preferring to read it when it's completed, but I'm definitely looking forward to participating in the ongoing theorycrafting with this one. This is something I NEVER do, for fear of spoiling the story, but I don't think that'll be a problem here. Even if we solve some of the mysteries, the story itself will still have twists and turns we couldn't or didn't see coming.
