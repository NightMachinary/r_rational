The Ellimist almost certainly exists in The Reckoning, and has already affected the outcome of the story twice, probably three times.

Elfangor said the seven of them (Elfangor + Animorphs) had been moved into place by what the Animorphs might call God. If even half of the coincidences in the original book (Cassie has unusual morphing powers (True), Tobias is Elfangor's son, Visser One is Marco's mother (Probable)) are true, this is too unlikely to be coincidence.

Even in canon, this is not coincidence; when Crayak agreed the Ellimist could have six champions, the Ellimist stacked the deck. Then Tobias randomly finds a sperm whale of all things just lying on the beach. In addition, the Ellimist deciding that the six should have unusual cognitive abilities is probably a thing.

The other thing that could help is the Time Matrix, but that's so OP that I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist in The Reckoning.
