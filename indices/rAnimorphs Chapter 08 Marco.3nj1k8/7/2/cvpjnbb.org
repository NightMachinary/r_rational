I have no idea what I'm talking about but: How about the people in the cages? Say they got a little bird into the weapons locker, changed into a gorilla, gathered up as many weapons as they could then ran them over to the cages. Some of the people in those cages would understand immediately, start shooting. The ones who didn't get it could be used as cover. The demons would be quickly outnumbered.
