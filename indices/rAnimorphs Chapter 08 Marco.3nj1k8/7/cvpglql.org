So to counteract the terrible mood of this chapter, let's list out the possible positive sources of help that haven't been explored thus far:

Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill, and whatever remains of the crashed dome ship. (Personal expectation: He could very well be dead, the Andalite structure could be different and he not have been left alone, or the Yeerks could be en route to recover the Andalite technology from the remains. Outlook: Not good.)

Erek King and the Chee. (Personal expectation: Might not exist, might not be friendly, or might be restricted from interfering in any way due to their programming. If they exist in any form similar to the originals, this might be their best bet. Outlook: Unknown, but possibly positive.)

Visser One/Visser Three political infighting. (Personal expectation: I actually thought the original series was pretty accurate in terms of showing a large organization dealing with political in fighting, from my experience with corporate culture. That having been said, given everything we've seen, the author seems willing to change enough from canon that this simply might not exist or they might just work together. That said, the focus on Marco's mother this chapter makes me think Visser One is likely to play a part in the future of the plot. Outlook: Could go either way.)

The Ellimist and the Crayak. (Personal expectation: Probably doesn't exist, if they do, it remains to be seen what if any impact on reality they have. Outlook: Probably irrelevant.)

Things that could help the Animorphs but likely won't:

Yeerks in their native form are vulnerable to high temperatures and oatmeal. (Unknown how this information would be acquired.)

Kandrona Ray requires a high amount of power, possible to disrupt the feeding source by knocking out the power feed and somehow disrupting the generators.

Yeerks may not be intrinsically evil, so maybe they'll encounter that one host/symbiote species to allow them to stop the spread of abduction?

That's what I've got so far. Amy other ideas from others who have read the original books?
