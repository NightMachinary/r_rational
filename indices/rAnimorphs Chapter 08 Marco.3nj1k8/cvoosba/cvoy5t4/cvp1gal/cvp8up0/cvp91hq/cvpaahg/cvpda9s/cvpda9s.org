On thinking about it for a while, I'm surprised none of them have gone "So all of you have acquired me, so let's bring back Elfangor and hope that when this is all over there'll be a body left over to bring me back." Morphs have resonance, but I presume there's no problem with (eventually) mindcloning an ordinary (trans)human(ist) and only giving one version the morphing power, who then would sacrifice themselves to resurrect some other acquired shape.

You'd have to do a bit of a dance - you can't acquire from morphs, so designate the person who has the original sacrifice backed up "backup one", designate our sacrificial fork "throwaway" - Throwaway would acquire Backup One, then Backup One would permamorph into the original sacrifice, resurrecting them - then Throwaway would permamorph into Backup One, resurrecting them in turn.
