It's the actual life experiences that I'm talking about though. A pair of two-year-olds from the same city will be more similar to each other than a pair of forty-year-olds from the same city. I don't advocate manufacturing our ammunition out of toddlers, but if I had to choose between sacrificing a toddler and sacrificing an adult, and achieve the same effect either way, then I'd pick the toddler.
