The alien species I was thinking of was the Iskoort, not the Leerans. They biologically engineered a species that required the parasitic species to live, but similarly engineered themselves to be dependant upon that species, preventing them from taking over any other species.

Seems a bit of a long shot, but I figured I'd cover any/all bases I could think of that existed in canon.

If there are any of these that we're both unlikely to encounter in the story and also don't exist, feel free to share if you'd like.
