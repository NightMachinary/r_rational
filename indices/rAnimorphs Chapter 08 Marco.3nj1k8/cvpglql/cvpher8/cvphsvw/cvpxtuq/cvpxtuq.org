In Cassie's viewpoint chapter, she morphed an elephant in a very specific series of steps in order to hide it from her mother for as long as possible.

Technically, it has not been determined that this is not a standard feature of Reckoning morph technology, but I'd say there's an excellent chance this is a nod towards Cassie's canon ability.

In canon, the Ellimist and Crayak agree to rules in their contest, as they almost destroyed the galaxy in their battle during the Ellimist Chronicles. I imagine similar rules apply here. My current guess:

Each side is allowed a certain number of setup moves, which have occurred before the fic began. The Ellimist, having the weaker side, might be allowed a certain number of extra moves within the game itself, or perhaps he set up the sperm whale during the set-up phase, and it didn't finish until the 'game' had already begun.
