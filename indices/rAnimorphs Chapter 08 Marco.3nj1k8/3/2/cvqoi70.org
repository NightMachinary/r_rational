My memory is supplying "if you stay morphed too long then the pocket dimension with your original form collapses and disappears and only the morph-form remains"

But how that works when you've morphed into yourself is as yet undefined. Whether we'll have a blank-slate new Jake from the moment he was acquired (maximum optimism), or an even blanker slate with the mind of a child (as a default for 'human') or if something else will happen... seems likely that it can't be good though, or Elfangor would have had reason to try it.
