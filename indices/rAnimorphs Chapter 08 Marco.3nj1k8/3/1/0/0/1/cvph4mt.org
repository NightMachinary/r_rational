I haven't thought about the logistical difficulties, but I have thought about the moral ones. Yes, it's murder. The Animorphs would have to be desperate; but they are actually trying to win, and the situation IS desperate. As Marco and Tobias have both said, what's one life compared to the entire world? It's nothing.

That said, it's still a large step to make. My prediction; even if this does work, they won't do it until at least one of the six dies. Then they'll overcome their reluctance to sacrifice a human, or one of the Animorphs will sacrifice themselves.
