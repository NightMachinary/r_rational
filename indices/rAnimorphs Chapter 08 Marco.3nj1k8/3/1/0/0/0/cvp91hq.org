I would not be surprised to learn that your readership is dominated by consequentialists. That being so, it's easy to conclude that a resurrected Elfangor is more valuable than a random human.

Heck, depending on what the size limit is, you could just grab a toddler and do it. Kids are cute, but the replacement cost on a two-year-old's minimal life experiences is, well, minimal.

Edit: if there weren't the resonance problem your best bet would probably be to just kidnap a bunch of people and turn them all into Elfangor. These people would come to shitty ends anyway if the war were lost, so you may as well kill them. You could make a hundred copies of Elfangor, and the minds you destroyed would still pale in comparison to the millions and millions that you saved (or, as Tobias points out, the quintillions in the rest of the Galaxy who would be saved by denying Earth to the Yeerks).
