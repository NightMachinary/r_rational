Oh wow, that's a really good question. In canon, an ANT was able to morph a human after it acquired the morphing cube by accident, but I imagine this is not Reckoning!canon; morphing does require an actual act of will to both morph and acquire. So canonically, any animal can morph. In practice, not every animal will morph; and you can't force an animal to stay morphed with threats / idealism like you could a human.
