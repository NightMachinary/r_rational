When re-reading Chapter 7 in preparation for this chapter, I got to wondering how the "overwrite" process would work with intelligent creatures. If Jake does get his consciousness back from this, I came up with an exploit; someone can morph Elfangor (or a civilian can be forced to morph Elfangor), and stay in there until Elfangor's mind overwrites their own. Then they have his knowledge and skills.

I think there's a reasonable chance this is a possibility, because that would explain why the author made the "resonance" exist; it ensures that they can only have one Elfangor, not dozens or hundreds.

However, I also wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work, because it would fit into the current "You're all fucked" mood of the fic.
