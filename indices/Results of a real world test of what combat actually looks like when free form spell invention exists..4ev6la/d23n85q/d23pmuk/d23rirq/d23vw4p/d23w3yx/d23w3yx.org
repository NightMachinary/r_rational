  And second, it was mentioned that in a head to head battle if a mage cast an instant-death spell their opponent generally had time to also cast one.

Yeah but if I understood right then it seems that if they expect a telepathic battle of wills they won't start casting their own insta-death spell. And if you use the shortest one they can't possibly both notice what you're doing and do it themselves too except if they are insanely more skilled than you, in which case they shouldn't have had an incentive to tele-battle you first.

I'm not saying this should always work, just that it should in a case where your opponent thinks you're going to do the sensible thing and you decide not to. Prisoner's Dilemma pretty much.
