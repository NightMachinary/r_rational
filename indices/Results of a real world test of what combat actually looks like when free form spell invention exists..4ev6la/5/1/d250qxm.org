Download the latest version of psi. figure out what version of the game it's for. Download the corresponding version of forge. Run it, and install the client version. Open your minecraft launcher and change the version of the game it loads to the forge version that should now be in your versions list. Run minecraft. Close minecraft. Go to %appdata% and open your roaming folder. Open your .minecraft folder. Open your mods folder. Drag and drop psi into said folder. Run minecraft.

If that doesn't work, watch a tutorial on youtube.
