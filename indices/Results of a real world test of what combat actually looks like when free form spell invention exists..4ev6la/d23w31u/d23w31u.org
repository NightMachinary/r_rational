Thank you for sharing the link. Reading a story with laws like this would indeed be very interesting.

Regarding your title, however: it still isn't strictly a real-world experiment, since the laws of the system can easily be redefined. For instance, most magical systems work around this issue by introducing resistance to magic for magical creatures. Usually it's something about having first to overwhelm the opponent's mind\mana to be able to directly influence the physical space\body they are occupying (often it's even easier to kill somebody then modify them magically with\out their consent).

In [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/,]] for a non-obvious example, the monsters which were technogenic in nature and lacked magic and “soul” could be killed simply by violating their body structure (no magic = no defence against magical interruption). The author didn't use it to its full potential, but it was there. Similarly, in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][/Dungeon Keeper Ami/]] one's body was considered one's own “magical territory” --- meaning that its owner had more power over it in some aspects than anybody else.
