The primary reason for this thing happening is that offensive power entirely outclasses defensive power within the strict radii. A single successful hit can either cripple or outright kill the opponent, and within 64 metres, targeting is extremely strong. Within 32 metres, entirely /passive/ effects are deadly, no aiming required. This situation only arises when both combatants have these capabilities and are aware of each other.

As with nearly any setting where this kind of power is available, however, the element of surprise is virtually insurmountable.
