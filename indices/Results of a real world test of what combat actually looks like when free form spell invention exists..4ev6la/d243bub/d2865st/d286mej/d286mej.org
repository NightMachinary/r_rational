That'd make for some devastating strike teams - one group uses psi to carry everyone in at speed, maybe based on a disc arrangement, then one player ports out of the spell area-of-effect and engages enemy at close range - except the enemy has just been spending psi trying to snipe the group from the sky, so the paratrooper has psi advantage. Or if it's a defend-the-objective thing, setting up a 64/3/3 block tower in midair to plant a spell circle on top of for placing a LOT of TNT, then lightning to set it off.
