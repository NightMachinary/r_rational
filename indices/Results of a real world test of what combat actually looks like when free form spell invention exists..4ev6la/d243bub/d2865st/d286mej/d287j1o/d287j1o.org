Spell circles don't actually require a sensible-sized target; the side of a single block of sand about to fall will do just as well as a 3*3 platform.

Your mention of paratroopers reminds me: you can actually turn invisible, and there's a couple ways to cancel fall damage. Being inside each other's kill radius /usually/ goes in favor of whoever has the best regeneration and health potions. So you can fly into the sky, turn invisible, take off your pants, parachute down, then put your pants back on to kill everyone.

...

/Man/ that sentence sounds weird out of context.
