Yes about the chains. Mana cost and complexity and potency add up, though, and there's a hard cap on summed potency in a single cast that you could use on three effects, or you could use it on one (Complexity usually doesn't come into play, but you can't make the logic /too/ complicated). What do you mean about guided spells?
