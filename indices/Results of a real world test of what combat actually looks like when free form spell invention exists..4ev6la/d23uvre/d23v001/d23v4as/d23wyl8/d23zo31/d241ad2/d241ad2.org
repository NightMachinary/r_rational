In air-to-ground engagements, you can manually shoot projectiles in a rough square pattern; four shots per second, and between four and ten shots in a volley. There's no way to automate or alter the aiming of projectile spells.

Unfortunately, any sensible opponent will be way up in the air on a moving platform. *Projectile spells can't have an effect unless they hit something*. Unless there are targets every 32-64 blocks, you can't really carpet someone who's flying.
