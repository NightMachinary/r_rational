Intention:

Guided-missile launcher platform with another person acting as shielder and a third person acting as targeting, if necessary.

Launcher just fires fire-ball type missiles into the air. Shielder protects him from incoming magic. Targeter points and actively or passively tracks a target. Missiles fall on target.

Basically, applying modern weaponry to Psi.
