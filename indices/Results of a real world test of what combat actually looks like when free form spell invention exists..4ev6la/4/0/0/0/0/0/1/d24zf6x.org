Could you make a spell that materials something small but solid to use as a target, projects it horizontally and upwards at a fixed angle, and then shoots a projectile that explodes on contact with your initial small target?

So it sends off the target at 30m/s at a 30 degree angle to the player, then sends an explosive spell that will impact the target 2 seconds later, based on precalculations predicting where your target should be?

With a range of spells covering various angles and with various timers, it seems like carpetting the air could still be somewhat effective
