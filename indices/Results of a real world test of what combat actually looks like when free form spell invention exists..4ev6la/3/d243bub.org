So, a properly equipped player is an aerial teleporting artillery sniper with a kill radius... But that's only the archmages. The less powerful might only be able to sustain a few teleports, or a single projectile. Army tactics might focus around training people until they can use projectiles, then graduating a few to specialize in killzone spells and act as a living minefield to keep the enemy from closing and activating spell circles. Stealth and extraction specialists might infiltrate and trigger spell circles within enemy fortifications, so frequent landscaping spells to destroy all cover within the Spheres they might use to hide while teleporting would be important. You might even have a balance of combatants who use the spells and engineers/researchers who build them. Another valid method might be decieving enemies into triggering spells and wasting Psi, then closing for a close-range kill once the effect expires.
