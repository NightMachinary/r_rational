That's the jist of things.

When there's more than one player per side, things get a bit more interesting. There is a trick (spell effect) that teleports all entities in a certain list (say, all nearby players) forward in the directions they are individually spacing, and another that adds momentum to a list of entities in an arbitrary direction. You can make mass flight spells, that'll effectively grow stronger as the group grows, like the Yangban from Worm. That's actually quite a good analogy.
