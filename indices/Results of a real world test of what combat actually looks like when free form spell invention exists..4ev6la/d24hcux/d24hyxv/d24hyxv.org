If you're new to mods, I recommend using mod packs. They gather together a collection of most of the most cool mods and also make sure that they work together well. I've moved on to building my own using Forge and the specific mods I like, so I don't know which packs have Psi in them. Every pack has a mod list though so you should be able to find one.

If you want to play around with Psi by itself, you just install Forge, edit your profile in the minecraft launcher to use the Forge "version" of minecraft, and put the Psi jar file in a /mods/ folder in the directory where your forge install is.

The [[http://www.feed-the-beast.com/][Feed The Beast launcher]] is the most popular. Another is the [[https://www.atlauncher.com/downloads][AT Launcher]]. I would have stopped playing minecraft a long time ago if it weren't for mods. As is, I probably have more hours playing it than any other game. Psi is relatively new though, so I haven't played it much at all yet.
