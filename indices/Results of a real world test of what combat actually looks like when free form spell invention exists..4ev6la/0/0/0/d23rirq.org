I never understood what happens if you decide to defect from that prisoner's dilemma. Like, cast an insta-death spell as your opponent is still trying to dominate your mind. I mean if you do it out in the open you become a priority target for all enemy mages but if you do it in private no one ever needs to know about what appears to be near suicidal ruthlessness.
