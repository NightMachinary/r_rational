Reminds me of the Eragon series. In that magic system, there were a multitude of ways to kill someone instantly, but in the time taken for a mage to pronounce a spell and for it to take effect, your opponent could get one off too, leading to instant mutually assured destruction. So combat between mages became a matter of battling telepathically (which could be done wordlessly) to gain control over the opponent's body and prevent them from being able to enunciate spells.
