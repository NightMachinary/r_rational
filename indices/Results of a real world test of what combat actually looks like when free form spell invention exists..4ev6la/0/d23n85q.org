For those that aren't familiar with Psi, it's a mod for the game Minecraft that allows you to create spells based on linking effects ('tricks') with operators and constants to create an effect.

To simplify it a bit, the mana ('psi') cost is related to the number and strength of tricks, and the ability to cast it is based on the caster's psi, the complexity of the spell and some limits on effect radius.

This post discusses the results of this person's experience with combat in the game using Psi. The interesting part is that they had to throw out the whole concept of classic fantasy mage spells when confronted with the reality of using inventable magical effects to target and kill other players.
