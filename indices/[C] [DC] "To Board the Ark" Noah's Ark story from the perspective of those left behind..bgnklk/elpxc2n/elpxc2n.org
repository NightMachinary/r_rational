I like. It is a very interesting and rather disturbing story, but, I have to ask... where you /trying/ to do a little give and take for both sides of what was going on, or were you focused on only expressing one point of view?

'Cause man, I gotta tell you, most of the people in this story are *DENSE*. When Tel asks Noah what is god is the god /of/, I half expect him to answer with "Natural Selection".
