Why do you say they're dense? Monotheism wasn't all that common in the past - in fact, early Jews were probably /henotheists/, meaning they believed there were other gods, and JHVH was merely their own, in outright competition with the others to make his people triumph. So it's pretty natural for a person of that time to imagine a god to be god of... something, like storms, sea, or whatever, given this display of power over weather and water.
