You're assuming I'm saying they're dense because of that one question, but that is not the case. I say they are dense because of /everything else that had happened up until that point/. They repeatedly do downright boneheaded things, then terrible things happen to them, then they go right back to doing boneheaded or hypocritical things. I mean, seriously, I could make a comprehensive list of the stupid if you like. The "what is the nature of your god" question and its assumption is surprisingly reasonable given everything else that has occurred.

Also, technically these people weren't Jews yet. Only the later descendants of one of the brothers would qualify for that, down the line. But it's alright, because in the OT, they end up pretty dense as well. Being rescued from bondage out of Egypt only to turn around and make a giant golden calf to worship, for instance, was perhaps not the brightest of ideas. Which actually makes this story /better/, as it seems to reinforce the theme found in the source material that people often make some poor life decisions. Although this one seems to focus less on the 'evil' bit and just portray them all as confused people.
