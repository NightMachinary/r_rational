You don't have to throw millions of soldiers all at once. The republic can simply outlast the Shinobi. Chakra users take years to train and that investment can be thrown away in a short amount of time. The republic can train soldiers in a shorter amount of time and still be effective.

Also the ships in WWI are well armored(Ironclads existed during the civil war). You can bet that water techniques are gonna have a hard time destroying them. The ships are also better equipped to attack from a distance. One jonin can't really take on dozens and dozens of ships like these.
