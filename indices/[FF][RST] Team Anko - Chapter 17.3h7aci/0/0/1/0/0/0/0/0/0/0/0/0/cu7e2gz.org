  Doesn't matter when you can throw millions of bodies and weapons at the shinobi.

That's what I'm getting at: You /cannot do that/ at WWI tech levels. WWI required a heavy, *heavy* network of preexisting rail lines built up over years to enable effective logisitics. One of the main reasons for the beginning of the war happening the way it did was because of the need to strike out at Russia before it could mobilize. Those rail lines took decades to build, in areas completely under their own control, and there were large standing armies waiting at the borders. None of that is possible here on a separate landmass. And at WWI tech levels, one water-specialist Jonin can seriously hinder or destroy entire fleets of transport ships (not getting into the crazy logistics on bringing a million strong army over an entire ocean - D Day was over a tiny channel and 1/4th of the men, thirty years later!) - at least submarine level fire, at a time when the early German U-boats had to surface to fire.

You're seriously overestimating turn of the 20th century technology. These are not easy problems to solve.
