Doesn't matter when you can throw millions of bodies and weapons at the shinobi. The shinobi are not that large in population. Also whatever you may think, the overpowered shinobi are probably in the handful range.

On top of that, you can bet that elemental nations would not very readily unite. They had to be convinced of a world ending threat to even work against akatsuki. You can bet that the republic can easily pick at the nations one by one and if necessary, ally themselves with one village or the other to share some spoils of war. That is how the native Americans were conquered anyway.
