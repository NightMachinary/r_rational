Well, it can decimate the civilian population, but do remember that the shinobi have invisibility, supersonic movement on the tactical level, giant fuckoff summoned monsters, unkillable zombies, near infinite effectively free suicide bombers (clones), and massive area of effect damage potential.

While WWI era tech could go through most Genin and lower easily enough, it lacks the strategic reach (other than some Artillery) to effectively deal with even a small team of high-tier ninja. The only halfway decent transportation method available is railroad, which can be outpaced and easily sabotaged by even powerful Genin level ninja, and whose tracks are logistically impossible to be guarded along their entire length.

That's not even including what is now my favorite new way to win a Darwin Award, also known as 'trench warfare against earthbenders'.

Flight is low altitude wood and paper based, and your opponents can breathe seeking fire dragons.

Your best bet is incendiary rounds, except some of your opponents can also breathe lakes of water, so that's out.

It isn't until massive high altitude strategic bombing, long range flight logistics, and effective long range ground transport shows up in WWII that the superiority truly shifts to the Tech side.
