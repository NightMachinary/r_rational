Since the m16 exists in the story, you pretty much have to admit that we are looking at Vietnam war era military technology. Now I don't know about you but I'm gonna low ball the length of the war. Wars four times the length of WWII or more is a little unbelievable. You could probably flatten every city and town on earth in less than ten years(lets assume no nuclear weapons).

WWI era tech can decimate the shinobi population. No way are the shinobi even a threat. The American civil war had the gatling gun so they could go toe to toe against the shinobi too. There is no excuse for the elemental nations to be this isolated from advancements in military technology.
