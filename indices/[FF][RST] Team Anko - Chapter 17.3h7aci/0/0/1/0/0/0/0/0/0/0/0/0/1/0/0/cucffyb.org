Ah, right. Yeah, that's not getting it done against ninja; trench warfare was effective only because it took long enough for the bad guys to charge across no-man's land that the good guys could get a few rifle volleys and a gatling-gun stonk off. Ninja wouldn't even be seen coming, and once they're in the trench with you, you're dead.
