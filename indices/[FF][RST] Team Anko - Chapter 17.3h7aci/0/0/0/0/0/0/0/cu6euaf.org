Yea, I mean, even as a regular, non-isolationist nation, I'd be wary of trying to colonize a place where the people are faster than sound and throwing around the elements. Shit, depending on the level of religious permeation of the Republic, they could've been stuck in thinking of the EN as a place of demonic men. It's what I'd think if I sent out explorers who either never make it back or come back bearing tales of lightning firing men, or men with blood red eyes that could kill you with a glance.

That goes double if they ever land and encounter a bijuu. Any theocracy worth its salt could use the bijuu's existence to promote their agenda. Just look at us now. There are several places that still buy into voodoo, witchcraft, demon possession, etc. with ZERO evidence. Imagine if you actually had some photos of a giant fox that let off this concentrated aura of malice.

Edit: Zero TANGIBLE evidence. As we know, there are more than enough "real" accounts of these things by people.
