  I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief that in your world you have supersonic strategic bombers, but no enterprising explorer has thought to exploit the natives of the elemental nations for their natural resources.

My assumption at this point is that the Republic literally doesn't know about the EN, that their discovery is very recent -- just in the last few years.

  Though, there's not a lot you can do when thrown into a world where the setting doesn't make sense in the first place.

True, that. And, of course, there's the whole thing about "if the Republic has satellites, why haven't the EN turned up on them?"

The best thing I've come up with so far is "because the Sage set up a muggle-repelling field over the EN". It's feasible, since this is the guy who [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Moon][literally created the moon]] so he certainly had the power levels. I'm not thrilled with it, but this setting is so completely whack that I'm having to buy a lot of plot-hole-filler. The cloak, of course, would be breaking down because it's been a thousand years and it's running out of energy.

I'm still looking for a better answer, but that's the best I've got so far -- the Republic is highly isolationist so they didn't do much boots-on-the-ground or long-range-aerial exploration, there's a lot of naval navigational hazards between here and there to keep ships away, and the magic chakra cloak kept eyes in the sky from spotting the EN.

It would have been simpler had I put the Republic's tech level earlier as I had originally intended, but then I wouldn't be doing the setting that Kishimoto created, which is what I'm trying to rationalize. As you can see, it's non-trivial.
