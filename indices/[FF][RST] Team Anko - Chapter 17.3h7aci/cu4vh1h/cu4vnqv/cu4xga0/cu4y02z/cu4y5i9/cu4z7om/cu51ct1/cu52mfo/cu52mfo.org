Let's define terms: by 'god', I'm talking about an essentially immortal with few if any limits. By 'battle' I mean a confrontation centered around physical violence.

Onscreen god battles can be great scenery, but they make for boring plot elements; humans and heroes can't meaningfully participate in god battles, so your protagonists are left standing to one side watching. You can try to put heroes up against gods in a dramatic struggle, but then there's only two stories you can tell:

- God wins instantly.
- God is an idiot (or picks up the idiot ball) and loses. Probably after a long, drawn-out battle that causes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][DarknessInducedAudienceApathy]].

Superman and Batman are arguably the two most iconic superheroes of all time. Batman is a dark and brooding human being who suffers actual pain that readers can relate to. ("Oh my god, he fell off the building, that must have hurt!") You can understand Batman's limits and intuit whether he's doing well or badly in a fight, how much damage he's taken, and what effect that's going to have on him. More importantly, he is someone that, at least in theory, the reader could /be/ -- if you train hard enough and were determined enough, you could be an awesome martial artist, expert linguist, etc. (I'm obviously exaggerating a little because Batman is a billionaire, has /all/ the skills, and can sustain comic-book no-permanent-damage injuries, but you take my point.) He's had ridiculous numbers of cartoons, movies, comics, graphic novels, etc done about him because he's interesting.

Superman, on the other hand, is more or less a god. Nothing that really exists can challenge him in a fight, so in order to provide opponents for him you have to bring in other gods. You can't tell how he's doing in a fight because his ability to absorb damage is "as much as the plot requires." There's never much tension because it's not something the audience can really relate to from personal experience.

[[/u/alexanderwales]] managed to write an interesting Superman story by never having a battle and primarily focusing on Luthor instead of Superman. Superman's onscreen time was mostly to showcase his unadmirable qualities and show his moral decay. Again, no battles, and the story was really about a different character.
