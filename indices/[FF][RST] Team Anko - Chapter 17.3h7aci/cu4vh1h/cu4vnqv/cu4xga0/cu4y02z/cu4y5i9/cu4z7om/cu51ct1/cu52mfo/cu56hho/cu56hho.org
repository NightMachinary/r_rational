Have you read City of Stairs? It manages to make battles with gods both plausible and interesting, even with only one side having the gods. Not rational, precisely, but the we-don't-see-all-the-rules-of-the-world-clearly kind of not rational rather than the people-act-stupidly kind of not-rational.
