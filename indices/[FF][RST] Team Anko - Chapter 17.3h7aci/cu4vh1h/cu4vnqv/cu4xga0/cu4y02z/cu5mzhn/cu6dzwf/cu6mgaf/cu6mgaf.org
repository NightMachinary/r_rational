I was just drawing parallels, not claiming direct inspiration. And both of those examples are on firmer ground than claiming Taylor's personality is like Shino's or that there's a link between Orochimaru and Glaistig Uaine.

Certainly there's a lot less evidence than the theory (I don't know if there's been author confirmation) that the Triumvirate (and Hero) have Golden Age Superman's powers divided between them.
