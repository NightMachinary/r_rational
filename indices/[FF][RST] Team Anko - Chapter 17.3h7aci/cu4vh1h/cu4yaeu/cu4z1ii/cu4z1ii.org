Yep. The Elemental Nations are already trading seals to them in exchange for mechanismic gear.

"[[#s][]]"

Yes, although not easily. I had to do some world-building as to what stuff he could clone and, among other restrictions, he's got to be physically carrying it when he clones himself. (i.e., it can't be beside him or in a sealing scroll) That puts a weight limit on what he can produce.

There is the [[#s][]] but I haven't decided if I'm going to let it exist in my world. It's such a ridiculous game-changer if it does.

EDIT: I should add that, so far, the Republic is pretty much ignorant of the existence of the Elemental Nations. They're still very isolationist and only slowly opening up. A very few adventurous entrepreneurs have gone exploring and are conducting trade with the EN, but it's all being smuggled and treated as a very closely-guarded trade secret, as they don't want to lose their monopoly.
