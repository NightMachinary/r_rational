I guess you're keeping things around the Wave Arc power levels for this? Speeds ranged from 80~m/s for the Genin up to about 120~ m/s for someone like Zabuza swinging his sword.

By contrast, Gaara's sand shuriken are mach 14~ and things only scale massively up from there are the series progresses (4-5 digit mach at the end)

It's worth noting that Zabuza (and thus scalable to Jounin if sticking to wave arc power levels) displayed durability enough to be completely bullet proof. Ballparking somewhere between a building to a city block level explosive to outright kill them without looking up specific feats. Again, this goes through massive powerscaling as the series progresses (multi-city block for Gambunta and high+ tiers in the chuunin exams, up to moon level for God Tiers like Naruto and Kaguya at the end).
