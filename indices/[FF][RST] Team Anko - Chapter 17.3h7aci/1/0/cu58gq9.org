  Speeds ranged from 80~m/s for the Genin up to about 120~ m/s for someone like Zabuza swinging his sword.

Where did those numbers come from? Are they movement speeds or attack speeds? 80 m/s is 163 mph, which is kinda crazy.

I wasn't aware of that info, so I spitballed some movement speeds -- I'd have to check my notes for exactly what they were, but you can figure it out from the speed at which they covered ground when they first left Konoha.

  4-5 digit mach at the end

Wow. That's orders of magnitude more than orbital velocity.

  It's worth noting that Zabuza (and thus scalable to Jounin if sticking to wave arc power levels) displayed durability enough to be completely bullet proof.

When I was watching the anime I only managed to sit through part of the Wave Arc...I think I bailed out somewhere during the bridge fight, although I don't remember exactly. I'd be curious to know what happened that showed such durability, but I'm still going with the ruling that most ninja are glass cannons.
