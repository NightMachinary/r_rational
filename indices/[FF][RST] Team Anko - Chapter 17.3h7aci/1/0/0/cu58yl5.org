Seriously? I mean, we know shinobi are fast, but those are speeds approaching 0.01c easy. There's the teleportation time/space jutsu used, which we can assume bypasses the normal laws of physics. But if ninja are really moving that fast, shouldn't they be being continuously set on fire by the friction they generate? And inflicting massive damage where they move, not just where they take off from?

Also, where are these numbers coming?
