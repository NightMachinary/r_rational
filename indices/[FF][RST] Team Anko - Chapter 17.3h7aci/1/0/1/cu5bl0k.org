Calcs. I'd have to dig through them, but Zabuzas durability probably comes from not dying from the water dragon.

While one can debate specific numbers and such, the displayed feats consistently scale up and up and up as the series progresses, so at best you can say they're between point a and b where that point is rediculous ly high by the end. The Sage made the moon to hold the juubi body for example. In the last movie, naruto basically blows the moon up. Etc.

Reading character debates and calculations for such things is one of my hobbies.

In the end, they're really not glass canons. Wave arc shows Jounin with sufficent durability to ignore conventional firearms. Gambunta and a weakened shuukaku in the exams demand a decent level of ordinance. At some point anything that can be scaled to some level of naruto tailed beast mode can shrug off nukes casually.

It's a shounin. That's how these things tend to work. Bleach was stuck at mach 20something for a few years which made it hilariously slow compared to the others.

That said, do what works best for your fic. Even if Zabuzas levels of Shinobi and up can tank or even dodge bullets demanding military levels of pay grade to deal with them, how many Zabuza level Shinobi are there at the end of the day? Not many I'd imagine.

So the Republic is still terrifying because they could murder all but something like 1% of the elemental countries. At which point it becomes mutually assured destruction. They could nuke the ninja to basically non-existence, but the few that are capable of surviving are beyond their ability to put down.
