I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief that in your world you have supersonic strategic bombers, but no enterprising explorer has thought to exploit the natives of the elemental nations for their natural resources. Maybe it could be explained away by saying chakra somehow affects their actions to make them more isolationist?

Though, there's not a lot you can do when thrown into a world where the setting doesn't make sense in the first place.
