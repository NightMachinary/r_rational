How is this even a reasonable ignorance of technology. If assault rifles exist and airplanes exist then the technology gap is absurd to have not been noticed. Also to think that a capitalist republic that got to where it's at by exploiting material resources not trading or invading new lands is absurd(google countries not invaded by Britain). Both sides are developed militarily. They show no signs of pacifism that would lead them away from conquest. The elemental nations should have been conquered a 100 years ago.
