Do you mean [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kaguya_Clan][the Kaguya clan]]? I wasn't familiar with them, but the wiki says that they're all dead.

Side topic: I hadn't realized just how much of Worm was lifted from the Naruto-verse. Many of Skitter's tricks (calling bugs, controlling bugs, bug clones, probably more) come from Shino, and her personality is even a bit like I understand his to be. Apparently the bone-manipulation powers of Panacea's dad were taken from the Kaguya. Orochimaru keeps souls of his prior victims in his head, similar to Glaistig Uaine's ability.
