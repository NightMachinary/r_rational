I think that's more coincidence than anything else. Wildbow had literally hundreds of different capes with different powers. Something as common place as short range teleportation kind of HAD to show up.

And cloning isn't all that unique either. I would hesitate to say he copied the shadow clone ability at all. I'm not saying it's impossible, but the power is a very generic one, and it's more than plausible he used it as it's a common power, as opposed to drawing it from a specific source.
