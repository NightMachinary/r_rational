Be careful with Kaguya and Black Zetsu in general; Kishimoto ended up making them the root cause for basically everything. If they are near their canon characterizations, Black Zetsu has been running around for nearly a millennium being "Kaguya's Will," spying on high-tier ninja and orchestrating complex manipulations of those ninja. Even keeping Naruto low-tier isn't defense against Black Zetsu, as one of his powers makes Naruto and Sasuke prime candidates for him to pay attention to.
