It's a major plot point.

This was actually supposed to be primarily a romance story about a developing relationship and the coming of age of the people involved. Then Orochimaru came on stage, laughed in my face, and told me what was /really/ going to happen. Still, the romance will still be there, it will just be set against a rather different backdrop.
