First, the answer I have to give is "Not that I know of".

That sounds like it would be terribly hard to structure as a story. /Every/ includes a whole lot of ships, and with the varying power and sanity levels, it seems like you'd be five seconds away from 90% of the ships being obliterated.

Storywise, you'd have to follow five or six main characters, and preferably those that survive the initial "someone shooting at everyone". Since most of those ships have heavy FTL, I'd suggest putting them in a place that's more mysterious than a random planet - possibly a lone planet with a lone star and /nothing else around them/ because otherwise the smart ones are going to kick their engines to max and fly as far away as possible.

If I had to write it, first act is everyone getting teleported into place and having a giant clusterfuck of a fight, second act is communication and the formation of coalitions, and the third act is coalition warfare over something valuable.
