well, I didn't necessarily mean everything - a couple dozen or more is actually what I had in mind. Basically, without it skipping straight to boom boom I imagine it would be "interesting" to say the least. Think of all the drama and the rush to get weapons built back up, the intrigue, etc. Then think of the fantasy-novel people on the surface zapping eachother with spells as these huge ships float about desperate to open fire on eachother.
