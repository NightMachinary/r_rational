I thought I was pretty clear that when they were attending school, Allen and Marza had experimented quite a lot, trying pretty much everything that wasn't actual intercourse. (They would have walked back and forth to school in the morning and afternoon - plenty of opportunities to sneak off for short adventures.) After they graduated from school, their families drastically reduced the free time that they could spend alone together. Contraceptives are available, but they aren't given away for free, and the grocer would certainly make sure that the parents of pre-adults buying them knew that they were being bought.

Marza is more than aware of when she could probably have sex and get away with it. So are Marza's female relatives. She lives with them. Their cycles will be aligned, and during those times when it would be safest for her to have sex, her relatives will be watching even closer than normal.

Farming is an always-on job, especially in a low-tech environment. From before dawn to after dark, there's always something to do. It isn't hard for their families to keep them busy enough to not give them an opportunity to sneak off alone. Both families approve of the relationship, but neither family would appreciate Allen and Marza having a child before they have a home of their own.
