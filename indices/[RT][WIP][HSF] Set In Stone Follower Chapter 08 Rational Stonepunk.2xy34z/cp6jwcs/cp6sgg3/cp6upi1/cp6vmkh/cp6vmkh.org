The world came first, then the characters and the setting. The morality is a result of the culture, the circumstances, and the characters. If I had been writing about a town family or a city family, or even a different set of farm families, things could easily have been different. The world isn't a monolithic culture, though it's a lot less varied than our world. Albert's experiment has been going on for several thousand years without technological advancement, and there has been a lot more movement of families than would be normal for an agrarian society because they have good roads, passable ships, and a common language.

I've tried to make the point that Allen is seeing the world from the view of a farm family. I also tried to make it clear that town families and especially town children might be a bit less conservative about sex fairly early, when I had Jen create a situation where she had the ability to slap Allen on the ass as he ran by her. She's the Countyman's daughter, and Allen was angry at her for what she did, because of how she contrived it.

Allen and Marza are both intelligent, and their elder family members are also (mostly) very smart and very observant. They are living a life which makes it very easy for their parents to monitor them.

As you said earlier, Allen and Marza are familiar with animal breeding. If you have more animals than you can support, you cull them. You can't do that with children. Not in any society that I'm willing to write about. Abortion is a potential option, there are herbs which can be made into teas to stop a pregnancy. The problem is that these herbs are poisons. They are not very reliable in dosages that won't hurt the woman, and if taken in larger concentrations that are guaranteed to end a pregnancy, can cause the woman drinking them to become very ill - perhaps chronically. Doctor-assisted abortion is almost unheard of in farm communities.

Thank you for forcing me to look at what I've done with Allen and Marza's sexual relationship closely, but I am happy with it. If others agree that I should put more detail into the story to explain, then I can certainly go back and add a bit more detail to the bits and pieces where references to sexuality have been made.

EDIT ADD - Also I would like to point out that they ARE chafing and eager to get to the point in their lives where they can start to have sex.
