Hmm... I thought that a website could actually help to /grow/ the community.

It could gather all the information and resources in one place, to make it more available for new members, also it could have features reddit doesn't. For example it seems that for discussions something like [[http://www.discourse.org][discourse]] forum would be very fun and convenient, and blog/wiki would help us organize all the info we already have =)
