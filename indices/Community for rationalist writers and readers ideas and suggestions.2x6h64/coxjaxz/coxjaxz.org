I like the ideas, though I think some of them would fit fine here on the subreddit, and the various writing subreddits have many useful resources too. I'm writing a Fantasy book series (Almost done with book 1), but while I itch to get feedback on some ideas I am hesitant to share too much lest it become world building by committee, and book 1 is most certainly is not rationalist, though it hopefully lays the foundation for a series that gradually becomes it.
