By the way, here's some thoughts on what kind of articles we could have on our wiki/blog:

- What is rational/rationalist fiction? Definition, tropes, etc.
- Best rational fiction books/stories/fanfics. What do you read once you've finished HPMOR and want more awesomeness?
- Rational nonfiction to read - nonfiction books people here might be interested in.
- Rational writer's resources(collection of books/tutorials that will help us to learn how to write like EY, everything in one place)
- Collection of the coolest fiction/fanfics written by people in our community
- Rational/transhumanist/etc blogs to follow, articles to read, etc
- List of books mentioned in HPMOR

Feel free to suggest what else you would like to read about =)
