Between the ages of 17 and 21 I did a fair bit of hitchhiking, and a few days ago I touched up a short [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/06/02/guide-to-hitchhiking/][guide to hitchhiking]] I'd written last year. It won't teach you how to make a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, but it will teach you some of the strategies I'd found effective at getting strangers to drive me around for free. Most of it's commonsensical, but I think I go into a bit more depth than similar guides I've seen scattered across the internet, and it's good sometimes to confirm your suspicions w.r.t the obvious.

I don't imagine /too/ many here would be interested in hitchhiking (or cocktails, for that matter ;]), but I figure knowing how to do it could be at least somewhat useful in a pinch; e.g. if your car runs out of fuel and you need to hitchhike to get more, or you're strapped for cash and need to be somewhere soon-ish, or you're traveling in or to an area with very limited access to public/hired transport, like a remote trailhead or lodge. I also found it helpful in the development of other, important skills, like entertaining + making friends with people very different from myself through conversation, empowering myself to ask for help from others in peculiar social contexts, and accepting rejection and denial with aplomb. Plus, hitchhiking gives you some good stories, and is one of the cheaper ways to travel (depending on your competence, personal assessment of risk, and accounting of opportunity costs).
