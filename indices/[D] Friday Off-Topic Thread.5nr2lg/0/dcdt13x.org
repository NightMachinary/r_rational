I got laid off from my job. This was profoundly, horribly painful for precisely one day, and then I just kinda felt... normal again.

The projects we were getting were just less and less of a match for my skills, and we'd already lost the /big/ project I was originally brought on for in September. They say they're gonna provide nice references, keep me on health-insurance a few months, and cashing out my PTO/sick days pays me for January.

The basic plan is to use this first week or two to get my shit more together than it was this past while, and /then/ look for a job. The awkward thing is that I've got two PhD applications in, and at least one of them might seriously actually say yes. If either does, I'd really like to go, but they obviously won't until mid-Spring.

So it goes? Anyone looking for an embedded/systems or machine-learning programmer/engineer in the areas of: Boston, non-insane Anglo countries, or Israel?
