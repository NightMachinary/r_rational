  Nowhere is as good as the US, to my knowledge.

Nowhere is as good as the Bay Area, but the Bay Area is also insane in its own ways and bubble-driven. I couldn't move my wife there, since she's not in tech. We just wouldn't be able to feel secure being completely dependent on a bubble-driven tech income for our housing, since she's trying to be a teacher.
