I've lived there before, and while it's by no means paradise, nowhere on this planet is. There are also different kinds of crazy: some that show up in headlines, and some that make daily life extremely difficult. Israel has shit-tons of the former, and relatively ok amounts of the latter. It's objectively a lower standard of living than elsewhere, but it also does a lot to pass the "one bad break" test (that is, one stroke of bad luck or one bad life decision stands little chance of ruining your life in a permanent way).

My wife would definitely prefer an Anglo country. She'd also prefer not to move at all, and to stay as close as possible to family.

Overall, if someone can recommend a magic land of sunshine and smiles where there's no crazy suffering at all and nobody even dies, I'm totally open to that, but extremely skeptical of any such thing existing at all ;-).
