I'll be helping lead a group of eclipse hunters out to Wyoming for the solar eclipse this August! As the resident astronomer for a bus full of affluent space enthusiasts, I'll probably be fielding a ton of questions. I'd like to be prepared for them by having encountered and answered them before.

Anyone have questions about the Sun-Earth system, eclipses, or astronomy in general they'd like to ask?
