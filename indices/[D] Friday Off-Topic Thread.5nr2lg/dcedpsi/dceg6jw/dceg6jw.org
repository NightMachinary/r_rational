[[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][Order of the Stick's]] characters, especially the bard, will break the wall fairly regularly for humorous purposes. It's nothing particularly innovative, but the comic as a whole is pretty good.

It starts off quite gag-a-day oriented, but grows a beard after a while.
