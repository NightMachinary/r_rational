There's a planned [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5n5els/would_you_like_to_help_debate_with_rcollapse_on/][debate]] coming up between [[/r/Futurology]] and [[/r/collapse]].

Anyone have thoughts on what a steelmanned version of the collapse argument (which centers mainly on resource depletion) looks like? I'm mostly interested in the idea of decentralized production for non-collapse-related reasons (it works better in space, for example), but it is sort of relevant since they worry about centralization and bottlenecks and so on.
