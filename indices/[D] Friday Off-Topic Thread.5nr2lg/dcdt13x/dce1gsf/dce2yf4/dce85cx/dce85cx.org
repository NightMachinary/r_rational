The Future (/maybe/). You'll have to buy a ticket with Alcor Express to get there though. >:P

(This sparks the idea of a world where it's very easy and very cheap to send people into the future. How many people would jump into the future, confident that civilization is going down a desirable path and just impatient to get there, and how many of those people would have to jump into the future before it suddenly went down a /different/ path because all the people who would have made it into that sort of world have temporarily vacated it?)
