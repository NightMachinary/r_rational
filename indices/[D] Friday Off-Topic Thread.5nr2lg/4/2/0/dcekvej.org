The company I'm gonna be working for sent out an email to a professor in my department and he forwarded it to the grad student email list xD

The plan for my group is to take a day-trip. We'll leave super early, drive the multiple bus-loads of enthusiasts out to the centerline. We'll watch the eclipse, then have a picnic lunch and finally head back. They have a bunch of other programs like a week-long road trip around the midwest, or a weekend trip for those with more time and money.

Really, if you're interested just look online, I'm sure there's tons of groups doing similar things! PM me if you want the company's info or stuff.
