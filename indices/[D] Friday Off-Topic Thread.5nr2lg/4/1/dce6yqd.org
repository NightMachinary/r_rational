I've read that, if there were a bustling extraterrestrial tourist community, the earth would be a pretty hot spot to visit because the proportions and distances between the earth, moon, and sun are fairly unique, enabling hybrid/annular/total solar eclipses. Approximately how unique are they? What proportion of planets have satellites that occasionally obscure parts of their star (I'd guess both orbital planes need to be fairly aligned? Is that common? How often would obstruction happen if they weren't?)? What proportion of those have similarly sized stars and moons, from the perspective of a viewer on the surface of the planet?

Thanks!
