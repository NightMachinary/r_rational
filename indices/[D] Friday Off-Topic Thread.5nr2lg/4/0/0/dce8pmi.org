While eclipse hunting may be a fun and fulfilling way to spend your time and money, there are definitely still some issues with the practice. The most pressing one, in my opinion, is the fact that total solar eclipses are bad for solar power. We already know that solar panels leech out some of the Sun's energy, making it burn out quicker, so imagine how much damage the moon can cause! The moon absorbs basically a whole continent's worth of sunlight over the course of a day, and that can lead to massive outages and all of the dangerous consequences of those.

Always get a license! Only licensed eclipse hunters can participate in expeditions like this, so be sure to not miss out.
