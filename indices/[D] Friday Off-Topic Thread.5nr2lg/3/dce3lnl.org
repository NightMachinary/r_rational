To anyone who's interested: As of today, I've finished plotting out all of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracted]] to the level of knowing exactly what I'll be writing; all I've got left to do is to actually write it out. Or, put another way, it's very likely I've broken through my usual failure mode of keeping on writing until I fade away without finishing the actual story.

(I'm afraid that I won't be adding any narrative today, though; I'm still feeling overly-sleepy after yesterday's blood donation. Prolonged doziness: apparently good for creativity, not so much for execution.)
