You are just pattern-matching to your theory.

Even in your main example - Worm, there are characters who dont improve under pressure (e.g Panacea and Glory Girl), and this is even more so the case in Ward. And if you look at the rest of Wildbow's works your theory makes even less sense - in Pact for example overwhelming odds often make the protagonist weaker.
