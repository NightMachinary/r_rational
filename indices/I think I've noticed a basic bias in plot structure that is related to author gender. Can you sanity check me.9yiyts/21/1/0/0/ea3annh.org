What? No he doesn't.

It takes literal years of grueling work, only made possible by incredibly unusual circumstances, dies due to his own failures /many/ times, is forced to flee for an entire book, and even at the peak of his power cannot "blow up cities on a whim". His greatest assets are subtler kinds of magic like mind manipulation and psychically synchronized simulacra.

We are talking about a guy who makes and then wears an explosive necklace programmed to trigger and kill him if anyone gets past his mental barriers or manages to capture him.

It is ultimately still a power fantasy, but a /very/ different kind of one then you would find in a shounen.
