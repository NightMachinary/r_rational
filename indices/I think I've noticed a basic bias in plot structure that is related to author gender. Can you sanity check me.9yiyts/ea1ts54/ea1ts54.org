There are enough examples and counter-examples that you can choose to see any trend you like. Broadly speaking, though, I think /on average/ it's true that protagonists of stories written by male authors have noticeable differences from protagonists of stories written by female authors, and that can manifest in many ways.

Again, though, since this vague feeling of averages is just a quick internal survey of the examples you can think of, it depends on the kinds of media you consume.
