I don't think you're the first to notice this. Hell, in Japan, the entire genre wherein a plucky male hero barely scrapes out a series of inevitable wins against increasingly powerful opponents due to increasingly contrived power gains in their increasingly most desperate hour is called... "boy" (shounen).

It's gotten to the point where it's refreshing to see a young male protagonist actually lose at something meaningful.
