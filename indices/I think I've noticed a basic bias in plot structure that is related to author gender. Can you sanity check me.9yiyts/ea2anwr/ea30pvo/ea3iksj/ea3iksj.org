Okay, there are many criticisms to point at HP, but this is not one of them. He's doing exactly what his mother did for him. At the very least (and that happened too) everyone he died for will be protected from Voldemort and his death eaters' curses, so they might at least defeat his side of the war, if not Voldemort himself.
