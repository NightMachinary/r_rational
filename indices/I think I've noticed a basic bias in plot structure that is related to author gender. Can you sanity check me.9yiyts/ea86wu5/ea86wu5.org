Other people have replied to the main point, but I just wanted to respond to one minor remark...

> especially in the "rational" writing community, which is, presumably, almost exclusively male

Really?

Do you have any numbers for this? Or could it be that this is a bias, in that you assume that people whose gender you don't know are male?

(I am genuinely interested in this, as I do not know the gender of most people here but would think that while a _majority_ is male, it isn't so much as to warrant the phrase "almost exclusively".)
