Honestly, I feel you are reaching. There are enough works out there now that you can pin any kind of trend you want and have no shortage of examples.

You used /Worm/ as an example, and yet the sequel /Ward/ features a protagonist who is an excellent counter example, someone who wasn't empowered by being broken but instead has required four years of intensive therapy just to get to being /functional/ after what happened to them in /Worm/. Not to mention that the unconnected work the same author wrote immediately after /Worm/, /Pact/ is one I lost interest in for the same reason as you did with many of your counterexamples

  I am, sadly, in general less able to offer examples of this than of the "overwhelming odds produces superhuman performance" plot, as I have a tendency to quit and discard stories with too much failure and helplessness and too little superhuman performance.
