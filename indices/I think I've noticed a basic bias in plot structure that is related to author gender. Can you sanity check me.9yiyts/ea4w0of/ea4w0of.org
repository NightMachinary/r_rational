What you're referring to is a general trope where characters learn from bad experiences and get better at action during crises. Comparable to leveling up in games.

In Worm getting powers is usually a traumatic event that isn't of immediate benefit. Taylor getting her powers only ended up with her in the hospital for days. There was no fighting back then, only the suffering. She didn't get to use her powers against her tormentors until much later when she fought against the Wards. And it's suggested that capes are drawn toward similar crises that resulted in their trigger event. Anyone undergoing a trigger event results in nearby parahumans becoming incapacitated and suffering momentary memory loss so those conflict situations still aren't easy.

Same thing with HPMOR, where a rational Harry Potter takes stock after a traumatic event, listing all the ways he could have reacted differently to prepare himself for the next crisis.
