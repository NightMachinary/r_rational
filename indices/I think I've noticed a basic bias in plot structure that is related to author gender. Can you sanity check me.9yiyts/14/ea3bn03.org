Another counter-example: Miles Vorkosigan, written by a female author, and who is a protagonist very much of the first type you cite (he's even explicitly conscious that he does much better under pressure, and eagerly piles on constraints during conflicts because it 'activates' his super-awareness while hobbling his opponents).

Even in the book where he fails hard, gets fired from his job (though there is conveniently no permanent casualty), breaks up with his girlfriend and ends up depressed with no apparent future, he turns things around spectacularly, saves his former boss' life, lands an even better job in the end and gets the girl.
