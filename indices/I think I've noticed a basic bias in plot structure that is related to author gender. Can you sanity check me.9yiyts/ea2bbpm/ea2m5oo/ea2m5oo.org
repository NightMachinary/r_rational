I can see why it might appear offensive, but in my opinion, their decision to talk about it wasn't a poor one. they did not initiate this conversation with the intent to offend, nor to spread an offensive ideology. As it stands, what they shared was an observation and a conversation starter.

Poor language skills? Perhaps, but that's hardly a deal-breaker. I prefer that they offered this, accidentally offensive, than to continue thinking about it without external confirmation.

If you feel that they should improve their communication, then you could offer suggestions in order to tell them what made their comment disrespectful.
