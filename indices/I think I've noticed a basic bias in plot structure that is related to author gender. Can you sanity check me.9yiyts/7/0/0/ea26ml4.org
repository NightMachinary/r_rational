Susannah fights back each time, though. Like bad things happen to her, but she never just breaks down and "takes it," which is how I interpreted your post. Like even when the demon was raping her, she let Odetta "out" to use that personality to fight back and hold him in place when he tried to escape.

/shrugs/ Beverly starts in abusive relationships with both her dad and husband, but her first scene ends with a limit break, and she eventually limit breaks against her dad? Pretty sure the wife in the Shining fought back when Jack went nuts. Protag in Rose Madder starts the book fleeing an abusive relationship, but when he shows up again she kills him.

Maybe that's more what you mean, an enduring first rather than Limit Breaking right away. But you may be confusing "bad stuff happens to women" with "women are rendered helpless?" I know you said they eventually turn it around, but when we're talking about /on-screen time/ I think King's women tend to spend more of it fighting back than enduring.

Agreed with Anita Blake, it has good parts to it but the bad ultimately outweighed it for me. Was still a guilty pleasure for awhile.
