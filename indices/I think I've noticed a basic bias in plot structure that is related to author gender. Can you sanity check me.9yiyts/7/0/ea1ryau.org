Pretty much every single female character he's ever written, including Susannah in the Dark Tower, who I think he actually meant as an intentional counter example, but which still didn't come across that way for me. Consider how much of the story she spends with her mind broken in one way or another, repeatedly acting as the antagonist, /and/ being hijacked by being pregnant with another antagonist. None of the male characters were nearly so likely to being rendered helpless or subject to being hijacked by outside forces, body and mind.

And have you noticed the death rates of male vs female chars in his books?

I did consider mentioning LKH's Anita Blake as a counter example, but then I would have had to admit that I actually read those things. After a while the mechanical elements of the antagonist being introduced as the most powerful thing ever and then the protag leveling up and casually swatting the antag at the end via unearned power really started to bug me, and that was /before/ it turned into a porn series.
