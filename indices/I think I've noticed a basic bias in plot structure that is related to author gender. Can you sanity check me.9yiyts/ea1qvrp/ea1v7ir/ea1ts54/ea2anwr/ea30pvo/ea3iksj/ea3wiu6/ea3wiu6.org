If that was all it took then the Killing Curse wouldn't be considered unblockable. Basically there must be some sort of head canon to explain why this doesn't happen all the time. It's also not clear if death eaters were included in the protection, and while it made voldemort's status effects wear off quicker (stun, silence), I doubt decapitation would wear off.
