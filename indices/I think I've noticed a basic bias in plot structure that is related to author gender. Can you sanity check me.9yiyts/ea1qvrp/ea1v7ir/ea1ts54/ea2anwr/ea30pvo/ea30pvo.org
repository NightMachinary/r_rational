I think one of the major criticisms that I have seen of the Harry Potter series is somewhat in line with the thoughts outlined in this post. I've seen repeated many times on a predominantly male forum (which shall remain nameless) that there was this shift in tone between book 1-4 and 6-7, with 5 being a transition between the two.

In the beginning, the story plays out like a typical boyish fantasy, with Harry being set up as the archetypal hero figure, performing amazing feats and overcoming incredible challenges against all odds. In these books the plots revolve around Harry (+friends) acting independently and trying to resolve their own problems; he has a boatload of agency, and the authority figures are often the main antagonists. And then in book 5 he is sidelined by these same authority figures, and when he eventually rebels and acts independently it goes awful.

Book 6 is Harry trying to recover from the slapdown life gave him, and he just goes along for the ride with dumbledore, and his attempts at independence go awfully. Book 7 is just Harry reacting to plot and doing what dumbledore or some other person tells him to do(read: hermione), with the anti-climactic grand finale being to surrender in a dumb christ parallel /to the literal/ (figurative) /devil/ (which, lets be honest, was an awful idea. What if it didn't work? Harry is dead, voldemort proceeds to kill all the mudbloods and rules britain with an iron fist).

Also, they complain that this shift in tone is accompanied by Hermione going from helpful sidekick to kingmaker. :shrug:

I don't agree on all points, and I definitely don't think it's simply because Rowling is a woman that it played out this way. What I do agree with is that I felt the books became increasingly unsatisfying to me as I was reading them, even though I couldn't say why that was. It is the main reason I gave HPMOR a shot and eventually found my way here, so I'm thankful for that.
