I agree. Japanese media has a tendency to target very specific demographics in ways that you don't see in the west as starkly, which does present some juicy data points up for interpretation.

I think he's somewhat right about the male portion of his analysis, mostly in that genre fiction tends to be where men go to live out their power fantasies, and those fantasies tend to echo each other.

He's way off in the female portion, I think because the specifics he provides, which indicates he probably does not read a lot of fiction authored by women, and because his examples seem to be drawing a false equivalence. I do think women have their own power fantasies that differ from men's, but I don't know precisely what they are.
