I haven't read most of the works in your analysis. Off the top of my head, some major sci fi/fantasy books involving a realistic depiction of trauma and ptsd are

Harry Potter (Rowling, female) is kinda a superpowered revenge fantasy against the Durseleys right at the start (albeit, he doesn't gain powers via torture, they torture him because of his powers). He revisits this dynamic with Malfoy and Umbridge to some extent (Malfoy's bullying gets Harry the broom, etc)

Animorphs (applegate, female) tend to become more formidable the more they are tortured. Although, sometimes this ruthlessness is arguably bad and leading to worse decisions. Much of the serious is ghostwritten.

Winston from 1984 break under torture (Orwell, male). But the whole story is a tragedy, which shifts the dynamic.

Ender's game (card, male) confirms your hypothesis by getting more formidable the more he is tortured (but it was all a mistake in the end, and ultimately most of the people he hurt were not the ones who hurt him).

Matilda (Dahl, male) confirms your hypothesis with her psychic powers being triggered by anger.

So far I'm not convinced. That said, all these works are so popular that they filter more for success than any artifacts of the author's gender's psychology. If you wanna make generalizations about gender it might be more helpful to see what books boys and girls /read/ rather than /write/.

  Stephan King also represents a counter example of sorts, though an odd one, in that his male characters seem to generally follow the normal pattern of increased capabilities under pressure, while his female characters instead seem to have a tendency to show hidden depths of weakness and helplessness when the chips are down.

Don't forget Carrie, she's kind of like the horror version of Matilda, albeit she does have to sit there and be tortured until the final breaking point.
