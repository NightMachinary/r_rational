You are absolutely correct. It comes down to wish fulfilment fantasies. Men want power and domination, women want gradual empowerment.

First Fifteen Lives of Harry August is writen by a female, and character literally spends FIFTEEN lives to stop the antagonist from the shadows. I can't see a man writing something like that. I have issues with seeing what female perspective in wish fulfillment in fantazy is, but all of us just want to be Goku.
