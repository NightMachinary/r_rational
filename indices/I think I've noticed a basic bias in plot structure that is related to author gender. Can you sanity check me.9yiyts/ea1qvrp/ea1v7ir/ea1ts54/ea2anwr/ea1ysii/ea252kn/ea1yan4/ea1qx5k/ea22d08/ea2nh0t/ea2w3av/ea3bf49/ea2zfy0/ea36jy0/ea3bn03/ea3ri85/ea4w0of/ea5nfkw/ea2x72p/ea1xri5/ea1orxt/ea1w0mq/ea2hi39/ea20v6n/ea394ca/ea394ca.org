In Groundhog Day (screenplay written by two men), Phil Connors literally spends a thousand years to get a woman to fall in love with him.

In The Fountain (film by Darren Aronofsky), a man and woman try to find each other over the course of centuries.

Replay (novel by Ken Grimwood) also time loops over many lifetimes.
