  Like you said it is a power fantazy where main character at the end is closer to Goku then Harry August.

  Both Harry and Zorian are in time loop. Zorian ends up destroying cities to get a single piece of artifact and crushing Kings palace defenses in 5 years of time loop, while Harry doesn't defeat a single dude in combat in 15 lives of 80+ years.

  Differences in time loop story is are astounding. Like i said it comes down to wish fullfulment, and men in the end wish to be Goku like.
