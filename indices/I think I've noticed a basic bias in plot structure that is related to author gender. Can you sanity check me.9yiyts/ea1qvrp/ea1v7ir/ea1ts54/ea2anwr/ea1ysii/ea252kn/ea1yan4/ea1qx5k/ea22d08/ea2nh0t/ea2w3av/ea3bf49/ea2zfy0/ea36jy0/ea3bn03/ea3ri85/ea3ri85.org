I'd reccomend reading some Anne Mccaffery. The Rowan series has a few examples of both your patterns in stories. Some times within the same characters. Pretty long series though each book is mie like a diary/series in itself for a given character then a conventional plot.

The pern series is more about powerful relationships giving you power in my experience (dragon bonding). Both series are sci fi although science marches on happened to a lot of the psychic stuff its no more out there then dune.

For a direct fantasy try the enchanted forest chronicles. Its actually a pretty fun fantasy/fairy tale deconstruction. Although I think it was written backwards so the last book ends up being oner of the weaker ones.

However power and ability is not exponential and not strictly speaking what any of the stories are about.

Ursula k leguin tends not to focus on exponential power much at all in my experience and although trauma and stress might give characters a boost its just as likely to destroy them.

A further counter to where this trend is coming from could need made with the Lauren Faust MLP reboot. Her contributions and push for the show was more of a action/adventure pattern and less slice of life. So the bias you might be seeing is in publishers (who are often established people from an older era with their own bias bundle) and readers favoring a familiar pattern rather then an inherent bias in the authors on gender lines.
