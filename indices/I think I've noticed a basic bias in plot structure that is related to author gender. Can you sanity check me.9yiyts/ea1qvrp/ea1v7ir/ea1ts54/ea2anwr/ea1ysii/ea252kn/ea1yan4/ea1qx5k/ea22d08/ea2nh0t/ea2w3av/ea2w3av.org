There is definitely a male voice and a female voice when it comes to writing. It just makes sense considering that men and women on the whole see the world in different ways. However, whether or not you can detect this really comes down to the authors writing style.

If you're reading a lot of fan works or personal projects then I suspect that the vast majority of the writers are not going to bother trying to write in a way that would obfuscate their gender, but a skilled writer could definitely do so, or even write in a way that people might perceive as more masculine or feminine, intentionally.

Like others have said, trying to pin this down to specific buzzwords or concepts, like some sort of mathematical formula, is likely to be an endeavor fraught with mistakes. Instead, I think a study of the characters and settings would be able to reveal much of the authors worldview and then you may be able to infer a gender (or even a race or class) from there. At least, that's how we did it back when I was in college, so many eons ago.
