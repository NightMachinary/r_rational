I think a good sanity check might be thinking about random books written by women and seeing how they compare to this.

I'm having trouble coming up with these myself, but probably one of the biggest modern fantasy novels by a woman is Harry Potter. This is a counterexample (Harry routinely does superhuman feats when pressed, rather than fail).
