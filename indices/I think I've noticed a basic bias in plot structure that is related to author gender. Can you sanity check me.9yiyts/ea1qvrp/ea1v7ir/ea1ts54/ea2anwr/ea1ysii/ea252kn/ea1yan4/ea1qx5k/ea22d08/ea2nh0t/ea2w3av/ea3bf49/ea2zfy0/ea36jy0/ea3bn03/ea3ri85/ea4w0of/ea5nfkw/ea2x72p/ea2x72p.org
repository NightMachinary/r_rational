I definitely understand what you're getting at, but I don't think it's a certain general-case.

What I've experienced in Male vs. Female authors is that with female authors, the books tend to have more "It's ok to stick around at our current level of power and write slice-of-life stuff."

Male writers seem to be more interested in getting to the point, and going above and beyond. Male story-telling seems to revolve around getting somewhere, going places, and being ambitious as hell. With female authors, the characters go to the same places, get around the same areas, and they ascend to the same levels as male-written ambitious characters, it's just not /about/ the getting there.

It's surprisingly similar to how men and women look at sex. With men, there's a slow build-up, and you're slowly but surely /focusing/ on that one bit of release at the end, when you're above everything else. With women, it's more about the build-up, the sexyness beforehand, during, after, etc...

Men seem to also be a lot less accepting of defeat and submission because of hormones and the like.

TL;DR: Guys and girls write books like how they have sex, but not in the way you've implied, in my opinion.
