Which books are you thinking of, for King?

Counter example is Terry Goodkind in Wizard's First Rule, before the protag became a massive Mary Sue, and I think Patricia Briggs Lionheart series? Also LKH's Anita Blake series. May be worth differentiating not just gender of writer but "class" of character. I would be surprised if females writing female warriors didn't give them that Limit Break.
