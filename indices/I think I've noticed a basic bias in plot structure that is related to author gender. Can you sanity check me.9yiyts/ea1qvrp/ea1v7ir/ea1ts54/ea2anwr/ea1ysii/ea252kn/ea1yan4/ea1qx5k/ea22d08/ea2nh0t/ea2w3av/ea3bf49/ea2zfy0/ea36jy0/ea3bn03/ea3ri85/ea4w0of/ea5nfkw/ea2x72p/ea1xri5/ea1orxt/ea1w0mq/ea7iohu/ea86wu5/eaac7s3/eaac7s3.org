Some jears ago, I got the impression, that with inexperienced/uncreativ/bad writers I can tell the gender, because they reproduce a lot of stereotypes unreflected, while the works of experienced authors contain much more nuances and variations.

That said: It seams to me my library contains a lot of male authors:

Lem, Strugatzki, Martin, Brin, Pratchett, Noon, Gaiman, Tolkien, Moers... and then Yudovsky, DaystarEld, Velorien, cthulhuraejepsen, D. D. Webb, Exterminatus, Wildbow

Well, I need some more datapoints :-)

Could you tell me some female fiction writers, that aproximatly match my taste? :-)

(I have some M. Z. Bradley, but do not like it that much)
