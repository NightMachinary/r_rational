Lois McMaster Bujold's characters have gained skills and abilities during torture and subjugation on several occasions. The most obvious example is Mark's torture on Jackson's Whole in /Mirror Dance/, where he gains the ability to perfectly compartmentalize his psyche to resist the torture indefinitely and then kill his torturer.

So, no, I don't think there's a gender pattern here. I would instead expect that "the hero struggles and overcomes torture" is a common trope, and it just happens that the couple of trope-breakers the OP is familiar with are by female authors.
