hmm. i've read them all. pact and twig feature male protagonists (ish), which could be a confound. and they also feature escalation but it's weird and not protagonist-centric. i think wildbow is the worst author to use as an example here because he so consciously writes outside the establishes boundaries of genre fiction.

i'm sort of with you that op's theory is a reach, but at the same time wouldn't be surprised if it's true. i wonder how many men write romance novels, and if anyone has ever broken the plots down by author gender. some data with a more concise parameter shed some light.
