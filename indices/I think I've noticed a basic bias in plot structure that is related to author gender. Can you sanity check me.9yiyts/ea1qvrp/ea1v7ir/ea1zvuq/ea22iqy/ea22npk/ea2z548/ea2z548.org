I think that's pacing - I stopped so I could read it all at once, since that's how I read Worm*. Doing a bunch of characters can requires a fair amount of setup and time if you're doing a bunch of POV characters. It might also be about a hook versus slowness, although with the Parahumans series Wildbow goes really epic, and lots of characters /and/ speed would probably be pretty hard.

*When I read something all at once it's easier to keep track of the characters. And Epics have /so many characters/. Worm feels like it has 47 characters or more whose names I know.
