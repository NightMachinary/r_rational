[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/9oexpn/ward_spoilers_frustration_with_the_state_of_the/e7tprmt/?context=3][I've written on /r/Parahumans]] about how Ward, with its acknowledgement that people don't instantly "bounce back" from trauma, represents a much more mature outlook than the largely-optimistic "teenage" outlook of Worm. And that, I think, may be at the root of what we're seeing here.

Without overly generalizing, it's within reason that many female science fiction authors, who have generally had to show the maturity to succeed in a male-dominated subindustry (and an industry based on imagination, to boot!), may tend to write characters who similarly have to mature before they can display agency.
