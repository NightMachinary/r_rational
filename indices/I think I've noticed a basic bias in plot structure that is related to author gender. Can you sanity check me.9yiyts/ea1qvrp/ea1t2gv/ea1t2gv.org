  While reading this, though, I couldn't help but think that the latter example of failing, having horrible things happen to you, and having to pick up the pieces is more rational and realistic. People don't suddenly gain new abilities when the chips are down. If you fight in the face of overwhelming odds you'll probably lose.

Another interesting thought is to wonder if male readers like the power trip fantasy of the unrealistic plot more, while female readers prefer the "realistic" one. Is is interesting to notice that almost all "rational" fiction follows the unrealistic irrational power trip plotline.
