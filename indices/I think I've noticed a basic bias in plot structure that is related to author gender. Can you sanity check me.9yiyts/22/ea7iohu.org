(While not relevant to the central question, throwing out the line of thought that while overwhelming odds brining Deus Ex Machina is frustrating, and overwhelming odds bringing use of a remembered power that should have been already known about and used even more so--actually, this sentence is getting too long.)

​

As I think of three examples of what I want to bring to mind, I realise to some dismay that they also count as 'suddenly using a power that a normal person couldn't use'. Specifically: Arachnid manga, Prisma Illya anime, Zerozaki Soushiki no Ningen Shiken manga (and presumably light novel too).

​

The part I've enjoyed, and the part I think I would enjoy even without special powers that others couldn't use, is the suggestion that the critical thing is actually something being given up in the person's mental state--ethical constraints especially, but in general self-limiting 'constraints' to do with how one behaves in a social fashion, with self-awareness, when interacting with society. Whether hung up on being 'normal', or for purely practical reasons--

​

I love the moment when a character realises "I'm going to die unless I kill" and drops /everything/ in favour of survival. No thoughts for others (ethical behaviour, 'fighting fair', behaving in an upright fashion that police or teachers or friends or family might approve of later), no thoughts for the persona usually shown for others, no thought for anything at all--except stopping life signs of the threat in front by the fastest, most direct route possible. No hesitation, no buying-time, only an unrelenting onslaught of actions for which the sole consideration is their effectiveness in killing the other.

​

Reading the above paragraph, I'm somewhat concerned that it gives the impression that I'm obsessed with the action of killing itself, whereas my perception is that I'm fairly uninterested in the methods and more interested in that (portrayed) mental state of someone who is driven to the brink and reacts (instead of with only despair or with their thoughts falling into panicked chaos) by discarding everything they're used to that's holding them back and narrowing their focus to a single line of driven ruthlessness.
