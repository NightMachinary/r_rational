There's part of me that's hoping that it's Kairos who gets the crown, and then, /somehow/, Irritant/Traitorous's his way out of death (and losing most/all of the power with it).

Unlikely, but he's made a life out of surviving fate.

Or, Cat, and then somehow she comes back /anyway/, and it's either 2 of 3 out of 3 "resurrections" - although I count three life-transitions already: mugging the angels, becoming ~Fae, becoming mortal again.

Or, the pattern is weirder than that: She got dead, then alive again; she got immortal, and then mortal again. Although, she can't do the dead/alive again... maybe god to named, and we're something like full circle?

I'm with the comment on the chapter tho, it'll be Laurence. The only other person with enough oomph in this particular story (except Masego, who's narrativium is now spent) outside of the band of five is Amadeus, but he's not got enough in it - he wasn't even a side quest in all of this, just bonus loot, basically.

It's got to be of the band of five, and I think in that it definitely comes down to Laurence or Tariq.

If it's Tariq, they smother him with that pillow.
