Man Larat might turn out to be the only character with a relatively good ending the way things are looking to turn out. At the same time tho as Pilgrim said dawn approaches and he does have the ability to revive a single person once a day. Granted it might actually be a "day" as in sun up sun down, but even then it's kind of unclear that it might still be on the table. There is something kind of really gaming the story at that point to the extent it might not work.
