From a negotiation standpoint, it can sometimes be beneficial to not know how to lose. (Some people have speculated Quirrell has selfish sinister reasons he wants Harry to become familiar with losing rather than escalating.)

I bring this up because it demonstrates how emotions are subtle evolved heuristics that quite often are smarter than they seem. Divorcing ourselves from our emotions while reasoning about a problem can be an important part of the process. But the end goal should be to have emotions which coordinate with our thoughts, and so we should try to avoid "robotic" behavior.

Oftentimes, I find that after a few moments thought I am able to couch my rational arguments in more emotional terms (though they still involve functional arguments), which makes this sort of dispute easier for everyone. I've actually found that doing this helps me to bring otherwise unseen contextual ideas into prominence, which helps prevent hidden assumptions from controlling the conversation.

This might or might not be helpful to you when talking with your girlfriend. I figure that there's no significant cost to putting this idea out there for you, at least.
