Perhaps it was not clear, but the point of the article was to highlight differences in viewpoints and how important it is to able to lose with grace. I'm not pushing the MBTI model as a "valid" interpretation of reality, in the sense that you ask for, but I will say that for qualitative research, the theory of MBTI merely needs to be useful with components of trustworthiness (paralleling internal validity) and transferability (paralleling external validity), as well as dependability (paralleling reliability.) This is not to say that it doesn't meet a "higher standard" that a positivist/post-positivist would ask for with quantitative confirmation... merely that it fulfills a different set of standards since it is a different paradigm.

My point about heated arguments is that I use "Rationalization" as a defense mechanism. At the time, I might THINK I am trying to calm down and be rational, but if I reflect back on old patterns of behavior, I only justified a flawed position and made excuses.

I recognize that there are people here who are more level-headed than I am. It was nice to see that Harry Potter and by proxy, Eliezer Yudkowsky, can sympathize with me. (Granted, when HP gets angry, he gets smarter whereas I get dumber.)
