I worry that you ove rappreciate the predictive power of the mbti-model. The model may be useful similarly to hogwarts houses or the powers of friendship, that is letting you more clearly reflect on and communicate the clusters in personality space they mark out, but there are few, if any, statistical correlations to learn something you didn't already know. As far as I know the mbti has a pretty lousy reliability as well as validity, and has never really been empirically supported.

Moreover, how is trying to calm down in an argument a rationalization? Do you see it as such because it puts you in a non-representative state of mind were you attempt to not care about things that actually matter to you? I would assume that most arguments become more productive if the involved parties are level headed, given that everybody are able to remember what they originally became upset about and what problems they feel need solving.
