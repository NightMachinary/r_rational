I'd like to but Alexander, who wrote WtC, has concerns which he voiced and though I've tried turning clarify what it would take for the project to go ahead with his blessing, no response yet. See below:

I have a lot of concerns about an audiobook project, partly in terms of quality, partly in terms of the inevitable liberties that are taken with the work in any adaptation. I'm not going to be involved in any audiobook project (no time or interest), so it would be kind of scary to have something out there with my name on it which I haven't vetted and don't control, more so with an audiobook than with something like fanfic, which is more explicitly separate from the main work.

There's also the question of rights; as others in this thread have pointed out, /Worth the Candle/ is a copyrighted work, same as any other published work, it's just that it's also free online, and my legal department is non-existent. The primary concern there /for me/ is that proliferation of the work means that it will effectively be impossible/difficult to monetize. It would be a bummer if a professional audiobook couldn't be made because it would be in direct competition with a freely available fan-produced one. (How much of a bummer that ends up being really depends on contrast in quality; in my experience, things produced for free are usually of lower quality than the things that are produced by paid professionals. Yes, that includes /Worth the Candle/ itself, which would probably be quite a bit better if it had the attention of an editor that I can in no way afford without a publication company backing me.)

Okay, all that said, there's no way that I would actively (or passively) stop someone from doing an audiobook, especially when there's no financial incentive for me to do so, and no prospect of me doing a competing audiobook anytime soon, free or otherwise. I'd just hope that every effort was made to ensure that it tried to adhere to the heart of the work and maintained an appropriate level of quality.

(I'm glossing over the upsides of having an audiobook version of the work, I know, but those are less important than the potential downsides.)
