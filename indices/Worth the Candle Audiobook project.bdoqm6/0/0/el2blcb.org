Well I can't say I'm not disappointed, but I understand your reservations and you make valid points. Is there any amount of money you think you'd be happy for a professional voice acting group to be paid through a KickStarter for you to not be unhappy with an audiobook being created? Alternatively, any amount of money given to you for the liberty of using your work to create an audiobook by this community, to compensate for the money you would receive for a professional audiobook creation (now stymied as you say through competition with the free version)? Perhaps in this case, we'd do the first chapter and before publishing it, get your approval that the quality was sufficient?

Thanks for responding, and sorry if this is a headache you didn't want to deal with ðŸ˜¬
