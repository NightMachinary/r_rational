HPMoR is fanfiction; Worth the Candle is original fiction. Technically both have copyright, but since HPMoR is a derivative work, it would be sort of hypocritical for big Yud to be against recursively derivative works (provided they make no money), and indeed there are a number of HPMoR fanfics. WtC, however, being original, confers no such expectation that the author is OK with derivative works, monetized or otherwise. I don't /think/ Alexander Wales would be against your project, but you better ask him just to be sure.
