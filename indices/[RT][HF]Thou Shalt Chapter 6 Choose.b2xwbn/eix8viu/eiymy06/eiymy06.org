I enjoyed it. It looks like the central conflict is finally being established, which is a large part of what I though was missing from the first few chapters.

One thing that sat oddly: it's strange that Learn omits the "I" from his sentences only when it would begin a new paragraph. New sentences only, I could understand, but new paragraphs is a bit weird.

Other than that, though, it feels like this is finally getting rolling, and I'm excited to see what happens next!
