Presumably the station will contain some sort of system for accelerating the ring fragments, to compensate for losses in the deflection system and air friction (200km is not high enough to ignore atmospheric drag). You could use that. It would push the station backwards, but it could correct by launching the next payload in the other direction.

Or the payloads could bring their own reaction mass, like you suggest.

Or - if you'll pardon a completely bonkers suggestion - you could build a second loop at a higher altitude, to lift the payload into an even higher orbit. Higher altitude loops go slower, so they would need less energy to maintain (but more mass to build in the first place). With enough of these, you could lift a payload all the way to geostationary orbit.

... not to say that any of this is remotely practical. For one thing, spaceflight this cheap is an invitation to drop tungsten rods on cities you don't like.
