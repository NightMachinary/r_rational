  With enough of these, you could lift a payload all the way to geostationary orbit.

An easier way to get to geosynchronous is to put up some fuel and use a cheap chemical rocket or electric thrusters... it's only a few thousand km/'s worth of delta vee, and you can change your velocity slowly.

Just saying, the bulk of the utility of the system is being able to get to LEO inexpensively. I'm not sure it would be worth getting more elaborate for purposes other than safety and greater capacity to LEO.

But there are some interesting thought experiments for these kinds of ring structures... you could in principle have a space station around a planet that has a spinning side facing in, and a stationary side facing out, separated by magnetic forces. If you were to put one in LEO, the outer side would be nearly a full earth gee. Unlike Niven rings, these would not experience unreasonable tensile stress, due to the influence of gravity on the stationary mass.

  For one thing, spaceflight this cheap is an invitation to drop tungsten rods on cities you don't like.

Isn't that more a problem for the military to worry about rather than a practical issue with the proposal? It's not like you can't counter that particular threat relatively easily with conventional missiles, and presumably the military would be among the first customers, so you'd have space based counters too.
