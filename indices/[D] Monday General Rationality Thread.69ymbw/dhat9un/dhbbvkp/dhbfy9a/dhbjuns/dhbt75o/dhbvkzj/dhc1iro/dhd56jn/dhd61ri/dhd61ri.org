  With a tether compromised, this could easily cascade to full kessler syndrome in minutes!

I think you might be hyperventilating a bit there. Easy breaths.

The grains would continue to orbit along nearly the same near circular path they were following before if the tethers were lost without backup. Kessler syndrome involves high speed collisions breaking big satellites into small ones, and in this situation the only high speed collision is with a stationary object that falls straight down.

The mass stream would also be far too low in the atmosphere to last long without powered assistance. The grains would vaporize as soon as they got low enough to compress air enough to exceed the boiling point of metal, so you'd be fine.

Remember, the earth is bombarded with hundreds of tons of tiny grains every day at 30 km/s. We don't all die in a fire because of that because the atmosphere is really good at causing high speed stuff to self immolate.
