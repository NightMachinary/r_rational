And the reason for that is because space, even the smallest part of space (low LEO), is mind bogglingly big. A few grains being in places they aren't supposed to be will /not/ be enough to cause Kessler syndrome. They have to actually hit something in a high enough orbit to matter, at a relative velocity high enough to matter.
