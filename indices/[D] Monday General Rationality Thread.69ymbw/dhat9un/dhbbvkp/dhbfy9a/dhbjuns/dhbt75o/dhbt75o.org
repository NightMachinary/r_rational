I thought I did explain that the inertia comes from the ring? Which, being thousands of times more massive than the payload, only shrinks very slightly when you subtract momentum. Its main purpose other than holding up the tether is as a momentum bank. The tether is attached to the ring by a maglev with a mass driver that adds momentum, using the earth as reaction mass.

Without a tether it's going to be somewhat more complicated because you have to add thrust in some other way (which isn't going to be as cheap), but that might be a good tradeoff to knock orders of magnitude off the starter ring cost.
