I think you are not paranoid enough. In the event of a failure, the stream of debris making up the ring will interact with the failed tether, and with any object on the "rail" when its trajectory changes, and with any object that thought it was safe to orbit over the ring where the tether should have protected them, and with any individual grains that are not exactly where they should be - for example, grains that were perturbed by tearing apart a tether. There are a million ways to turn a coherent stream of projectiles into a shotgun.
