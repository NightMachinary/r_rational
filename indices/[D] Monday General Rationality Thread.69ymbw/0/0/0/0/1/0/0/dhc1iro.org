1: The individual components do not need to be larger, in fact they can be tiny grains. They are moving past at a rate of 8000 meters worth per second, so they don't individually have time to be affected very much. It takes a lot of energy to divert a stream.

In the discontinuous mass version of the ring, you could still include mechanisms where they can transfer momentum to neighboring components (magnetic, for example). If the ring components collide with each other, they do so at low speed because they are always moving at close to the same velocity.

2: In Birch's design, the ring gets its inertia from the mass driver at the top of the tether, which uses the earth (by way of the tether) as reaction mass. The starter ring would get its momentum from rockets of course, but you wouldn't build the entire thing that way because rockets are expensive whereas electricity is cheap.

Tetherless designs using electric thrusters to replenish lost inertia are also worth considering. There's actually a pretty broad design space to consider in terms of possible structures along these lines and mechanisms to use. Tethers are mainly interesting as a cheap way to transfer loads from the ground /and/ use the ground as reaction mass for the ring.
