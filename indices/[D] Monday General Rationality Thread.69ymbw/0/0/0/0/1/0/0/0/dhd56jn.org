That sounds /terrifying./ It takes very little energy to divert a single droplet of a stream. If the momentum transfer system loses track of any of the trillion grains, then one grain is fully capable of punching a hole in the tether. With a tether compromised, this could easily cascade to full kessler syndrome in /minutes!/

It would be less scary with a more passive momentum transfer system (that is, a solid ring), but it would still have a lot of moving parts relative to the cost of failure. I think I understand how you'd take off from it without needing to bring your own remass and maybe without needing your own power, if the ring can supply that... but I think I do not want one of these over my head.
