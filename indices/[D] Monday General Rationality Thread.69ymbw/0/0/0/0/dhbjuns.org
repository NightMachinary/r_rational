I generally don't think that adding complexity to a fundamentally unstable system is a good idea, but it is sometimes unavoidable. However, I'm still not clear on how you actually get to orbit once you're on top of the unstable tether. You're only going, like, 0.5 km/s up there, and you need to reach 7 km/s to be in orbit. Where do you get that delta-v?

If you steal momentum from the ring of remass that the tethers are tossing back and forth, then that momentum is no longer available to hold up the death platforms. Worse, pushing off from a fragment of the ring puts that fragment into a lower orbit, which sounds like a good way to hit the tether on the other side. Even if you take just a little bit of energy from a huge portion of the ring (without just falling to Earth partway through, when you're not actually in orbit... and how much more massive do the ring fragments need to be than the payload?), you would still eventually need to re-accelerate the ring before it loses enough energy to kill everyone. And if you have to replace the energy in the ring anyway, why not just launch vehicles with whatever you're using for that?

Clearly I'm missing something. So... what remass do you use to actually go to space, without destabilizing the orbital ring?
