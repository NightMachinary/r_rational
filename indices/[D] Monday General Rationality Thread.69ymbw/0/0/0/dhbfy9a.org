I don't think so. First, it's only a couple hundred kilometres high, so maybe a forty thousand square kilometer area around each tether. Second, for a system with trillions per year in economic value, you'd easily be putting in all kinds of fail safe mechanisms to keep it from failing catastrophically, because even a few minutes of being down is super expensive.

People would want to live near a tether base to benefit from the transit opportunities, so rather than keeping the base clear and uninhabited, we'd probably over engineer everything to be as safe as possible. There'd be parachutes, a controlled descent path, emergency rockets capable of ensuring stability of the ring for a number of minutes, backup tethers and weights in orbit ready to deploy, and so on. It takes a while to fail, so there is time for corrective measures and redundancies to kick in.
