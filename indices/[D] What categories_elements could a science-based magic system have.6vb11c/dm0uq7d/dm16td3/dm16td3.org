That works except for the fire-plasma bit, since only a relatively tiny amount of the material that makes up a fire is actually ionized and it just generally seems as though manipulating/creating plasma would just not resemble firebending in nearly /any/ regards.\\
Still that's not a bad thing since it makes the system unique. More realistically plasma control would potentially look very similar to electricity control in many regards since you can do a lot of stuff like that with relatively little creation of plasma. Of course if you allowed significant amounts of plasma to be created then plasma control seems as though it would have destructive potential vastly exceeding the other schools, though that might depend on the specifics of the other schools and in what ways you want them to be balanced.

There's also the question of to what degree the schools should operate differently. For instance plasma can't work just by manipulating existing plasma so it must be capable of changing some amount of existing matter into plasma. However if you allow that with plasma then it opens up a slew of new applications in the other schools and to some extent gives them control over the other elements insofar as it involves turning them into other phases of matter and /any/ form of matter can be turned into any other with the right temperature/pressure manipulations.\\
Plus of course there's questions about what types of manipulations can be performed, since you obviously need to be able to control temperature to make plasma control workable but if you want consistency you would have to do the same for the other elements in addition to large scale kinetic manipulation (plus of course you need temperature manipulation for many phase changes mentioned prior).

So my point is that even without modern scientific knowledge a system based around phases of matter will be much more complex and extremely different from one based around your "standard" elemental control /especially/ if you don't arbitrarily make the type of ways you can manipulate your "elements" different for each element.\\
Also you're likely to get more than 4 elements pretty quickly depending on what kinds of pressure and temperate control can be mustered through your magic. For instance temperature control is likely to produce super solids and super liquids relatively easily (though those elements may be less useful) and exerting enough pressure ought to be able to create electron degenerate matter though using a strict definition of stages of matter you aren't likely to get too many more unless your magic can exert force with staggering precision or can generate truly apocalyptic amounts of energy.
