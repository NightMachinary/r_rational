I don't think anyone's actually mentioned just doing the fundamental forces normally because they don't seem balanced, but I think that's just a result of thinking about it the wrong way. Simply make magic something which necessitates significant specialization (provided people don't have forever to keep learning new types).\\
So while electromagnetism is the most broadly useful force that doesn't matter because nobody can specialize in /all/ the uses of that school.\\
So nobody's actual specialization would be in just "electromagnetism" it would always be more specific than that, which means there's no reason the forces need to be balanced against each other unless you are requiring people only pick specialization from one force. Hell even then I bet you could still balance 3 of the forces in utility (I still can't seem to get a good answer anywhere on what the weak force /does/) given a limited number of applications one can select.
