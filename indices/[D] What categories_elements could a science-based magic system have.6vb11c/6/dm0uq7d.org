One way on rationalizing the Four Elements is basing them on the Four States of Matter. Fire-Plasma, Air-Gas, Water-Liquid, and Earth-Solid. It could be used as a backstory, a better understanding of the four elements results in the discovery that it's about the four states of matter, then the discovery of other states of matter and the resulting research frenzy on their potential uses.
