It's unclear what specifically you're referring to in my comment. For instance I said plasma control would never look anything like firebending so i'm not sure what you mean when talking about fire being a lesser element version of plasma.\\
The reason for this is that there's only really a tiny amount of plasma in fire and controlling it isn't going to really let you control the large scale phenomenon of fire because the plasma is just a side effect of the fire. Plus there's going to be some microscopic amount of ions ie plasma all over the place not just in fire due to all kind of chemical reactions and UV ionization so fire's not even /that/ special as a source of ionized matter.
