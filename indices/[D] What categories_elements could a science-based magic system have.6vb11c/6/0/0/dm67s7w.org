That could be a plot point though - the misunderstanding leads fire to be maligned as hard to control and good for nothing except destruction, until the discovery. Then the entire system is turned on its head, and now instead of four equal elements it's actually three lesser elements and one greater one that's much harder to control and work with, but allows you to do almost anything the lesser elements can do - though in almost every case it would be easier to manipulate the sub-element directly. Alternatively, the greater plasma element can't be properly interacted with without making use of the others.
