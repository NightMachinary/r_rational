I've thought about this for some time, and though ive come up with a nice split, the aftershocks of this throughout society are hard to gauge.

My split is matter/energy and space/time the four are distinct enough to be their own brands but are linked in strong ways which can lead to interesting effects. The real question for me is whether this is a programmable system, add heat here, take it from there, Or an intelligent one ala harry potter, maybe a bit of both, spell engines using shifts in energy to mimic logic centers that you can reference in massive spells to manipulate large forces carefully?
