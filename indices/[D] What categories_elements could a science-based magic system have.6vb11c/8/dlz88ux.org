I once did a science fantasy story where the classical elements were just the ways that the fundamental forces expressed themselves magically. The electromagnetic force was associated with classical fire, gravity with water, the strong nuclear force with earth, and the weak nuclear force with air. This allowed magic to have a scientific feel while preventing the magic schools from feeling too imbalanced - even though the weak nuclear force has nothing to do with flight in reality, the magic side of it did because it was /magic/. I still made it so that fire was immensely powerful compared to the other schools and that water was weak, requiring patience to use effectively.
