Three major schools: Matter, energy, and information

Subcategorize matter into phase states, and energy into kinetic, heat, chemical, potential etc.

As each concept is discovered, so is the corresponding branch of magic. So in the distant past, the only magic available /was/ the classic elements, because those three Matters and one Energy were all anyone understood intuitively. As more accurate models are developed, more powerful wizards arise who are capable of using them properly. The recent discovery of a particularly revolutionary mage class could drive a plot pretty well, too.

edit: To get higher-order magical effects, like a Biology or Social manipulation, you'd have to combine the three fundamental schools in proportion, the same way reality does it.
