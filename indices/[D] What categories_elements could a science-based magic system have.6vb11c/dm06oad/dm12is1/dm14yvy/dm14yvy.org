You could just combine the weak force into the electroweak force and have it serve as a mediocre version of some application of the strong force, or something similar. For mages who are more specialized in electroweak specializations.\\
Combining it with soul related stuff does seem like kind of a bad idea, because it only really serves to remove the weak force and replace it with something else similar only in name. In fact /any/ fundamental change to the weak force that would make it more relevant in this sort of context would always by necessity make it no longer the weak force, so I'm more in favor of lumping it into an electroweak school for magical purposes.
