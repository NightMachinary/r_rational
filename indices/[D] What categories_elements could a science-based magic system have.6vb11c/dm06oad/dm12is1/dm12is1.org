The Weak Force is never well explained in any way other than "it transfigures one particle to another". So my uses for it, whenever it comes up, is dependant on range, etc. On the one hand, a Weakmage who can reach cosmic rays can mess with their decay rates/paths, and then you have to figure out what happens when you have an abnormal amount of Lambda particles or Muons in the atmosphere. (For similar such uses of manipulating Weak decay, check out Qntm's "How Destroy The Earth" list.)

A rather stranger thing happened when I decided I wanted a world with souls to reassign the Weak Force to Soul duty. This world has gods to keep things from falling apart as a result, but then I wondered what would happen to a person from that world if they should appear in ours, ceterus paribus. My first executive decision was that Soul stuff has to have a slower decay rate, maybe due to the Weak Force something something stronger in the middle, otherwise, they'd become a person-sized cloud of Mesons or Neutrinos or something in a fraction of a second, and the best case for the surrounding area would be a big burst of Cerincov[sic] radiation. A giant Weak field like that would, if it doesn't decay immediately, probably do fun things to matter that gets close to it. I mostly just think of it as "block the neutrinos or you'll get Soul Cancer!".

For most practical purposes, control over the Weak Force probably looks like a much less efficient, horribly imprecise version of control over electromagnetism. At best, someone might be able to bruit force it to transmute atoms, but IIUC, the reason that doesn't happen anyway has some to do with the Strong force overpowering the Weak within nuclei. But, as said earlier, the Weak Force is hard to find sufficient explanations for so as to clarify that.
