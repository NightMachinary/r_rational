I was thinking individual spells would generally work along similar lines as Unsounded, The Beginner's Guide to Magical Site Licensing, or any number of similar HF systems that have passed through this sub. Mages would shift or reinforce physical properties individually or in concert to change reality based on their knowledge of how it /does/ and /could/ work. A Solids-focused mage would probably be best at enchanting effects, e.g. making solid armor and weapons "more solid" by increasing hardness without respect to brittleness, or sealing a door by drastically increasing its inertial mass. A Chemical energy manipulator could reduce or negate the need for certain catalysts à la Eschew Materials, or change the rates of natural reactions to, say, decay an enemy's equipment.

Ultimately, since all anyone is really messing with is entropy through its various expressions, any mage could indirectly replicate the most obvious effects of any one school using any other school creatively enough; e.g. a solids user can generate electricity with a perpetual motion flywheel by selectively increasing the wheel's gravitational mass on the downstroke. It's just that if a mage has the physics knowledge required to construct that flywheel in the first place, then they already have the physics knowledge required to manipulate Kinetic and Electrical energy directly, unless other restrictions on who can do what are added in, vis à vis Mistborn or A:tLA.

edit: To expand on my previous edit as well, accomplishing something like telepathy or mind control with Information magic should actually be possible, but would first require the caster(s) to use advanced Information magic (itself requiring the kind of theoretical and practical knowledge we don't currently have in the real world) to bootstrap their ability to use Information magic, either by directly enhancing their own brain's (or possibly mind's) ability to process data, or networking the same with those of trusted colleagues.

The costs and consequences of such an undertaking are left as an excercise for the reader, though again, many of them have been previously established on this sub.

edit2: Not sure how/if Political or Economy level effects could be acheived under this system. Maybe with a large enough group, but they would all have to have the same true knowledge base to work with, at which point they may well be capable of achieving their goals within that system through mundane means /anyway/...
