I've done a number of computer science magic systems that do logical divisions. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/1ziaoz/a_crud_magic_system/][This one]] might be of the most interest to you, in part because it wouldn't be terribly hard to adapt that to something more scientific like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction#Four_basic_types][chemical reactions]].

I think my favorite splits might be within physics, looking at various SI units and thinking of each of them as being at the core of a kind of magic. The SI divisions are all very logical, and a magic system that has "liters" at its core is going to be much different than one which has "grams".
