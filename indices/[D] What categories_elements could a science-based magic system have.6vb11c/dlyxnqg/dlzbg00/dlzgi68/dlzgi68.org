I was doing a weird fantasy thing with it where all the wizards are explicitly programmers except in the sense that they're using their minds instead of a computer or IDE. The protagonist, James Elsethen, was a guy who had defected from the wizard collective, with a hallucinatory sidekick who spent most of the time insulting him. The antagonist was a wizard who hunts wizards, whose mind was swiss cheese from too many queries. It got away from me though, I think because I liked the protag chapters to be in first person and everything else in third person, and the viewpoint shifts got a little off-putting.

Another one of those projects that I put too much time into without thinking it through.
