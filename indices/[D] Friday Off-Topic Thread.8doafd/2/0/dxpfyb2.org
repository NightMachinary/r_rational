Seconded. It's like if Adult Swim made a cartoon about the Foundation. I find the jokes hit or miss, the characters aren't very rational or complex, and the premise necessitates taking some liberties with the source material. However, the simple animation is expertly directed to convey the spooky yet clinical atmosphere the story needs, the plot gives just enough emotional weight to the characters to keep me invested, and the references spotlight some lesser-known SCPs instead of grabbing the low-hanging fruit.
