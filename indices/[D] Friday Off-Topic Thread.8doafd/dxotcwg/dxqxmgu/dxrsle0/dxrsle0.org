  no longer the hammy megalomaniacal villains like Cold Shoulder or Tough Egg, instead creatures with long knives and names that could only be said with a gurgle.

  A James-Bond-type goes around killing people, but every time he kills someone, we get a chapter-long sympathetic biography of their life leading up to their death. (Maybe use footnotes, so the whole long action sequence is a single chapter, and the rest of the chapters are humanizing stories about the dead?)
