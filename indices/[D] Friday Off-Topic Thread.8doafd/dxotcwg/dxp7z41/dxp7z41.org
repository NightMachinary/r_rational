Intelligent life has slowly spread throughout the cosmos, and everything discovered in the vastness of space has been as physics predicted. FTL, FAI, and all other hard problems were solved ages ago, and their successors live in an age of peace and expansion.

Generation ships have arrived at a new, uncharted galaxy. Again, everything was as distant observations and prediction engines expected.

Settlers have engaged in terraforming the frontier systems. Subtle problems plague the early settlers. Terraforming schedules keep going off track. Early dyson spheres suffer from unforeseen delays, because of misalignments and miscalculations.

Eventually, scientists narrow down the cause of the mysterious incidents. The gravitational constant isn't - local anomalies are slightly altering the constant, and more improbably, entropy seems to decrease at these instants. The epicenter of the effect is eventually tracked to a specific system, one with eight planets and indigenous life, some of whom seem capable of manipulating these constants at a whim.
