Maybe I'll write it someday, I'll have to think about it. I'm currently busy with exams and plan to start a pokemon mystery dungeon quest thread once I finish , so dunno if I'll have time .

I thought of making something like this as a videogame maybe( whith voxel mini planets that have blocks that generate artificial gravity , and spaceships that are basically the same thing but move ) its on my long list of project ideas .
