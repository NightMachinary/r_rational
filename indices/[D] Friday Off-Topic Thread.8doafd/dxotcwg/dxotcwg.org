If you're anything like me, the most fun part of writing a story is coming up with a really cool premise (a "plot bunny", in fanfiction.net parlance.) Of course, the vast majority of plot bunnies never see the light of day because, for whatever reason, writing a story featuring them would be unfeasible (have other projects) or undesirable (don't want to commit the time). So let's host a mini-competition!

In reply to this post, write the hook, intro, or prologue to a story, minimum 10 words long, soft-maximum 300 words long (longer if you want, but not too much longer.) The winner is the person who has the most people begging them to continue.

If you want to include multiple entries, go for it! I'll include an example reply.
