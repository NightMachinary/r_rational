I really, really like this one. Of course the world of the dead needs to be fleshed out a lot, but the strong limits on interaction allow us to be very creative with ways of trade and force projection.

The dead have three things to offer / kinds of force to project: Information, reward and punishment, Schelling points. The latter means: The dead king communicating via Ouija board might end up having more legitimacy than a living heir.

The living also have three main kinds of forces to project: dead people just caring about the living world, Schelling points, and education / propaganda (the living solely determine the long-term demographics of the dead world). Schelling points, in the sense of e.g. living Queen Victoria being the legitimate ruler of the dead British empire, even for people who died before her time.

Obvious political plot option: Living queen Victoria begins a grand propaganda / social engineering project to ensure her eternal rule. Or, maybe the current British empire begins a grand endeavor to ensure that the living head of state shall rule both worlds; containing two prongs, projecting power into the current world of the dead, and educating the public to not accept a dead ruler even in the afterlife.

Anything I missed? I mean, there is obvious potential for long-range communication by bouncing via a ghost / Ouija board. I'd like to see this closed as a loop-hole; maybe the dead world has a related geography, and the communication is only possible when you are in corresponding locations. This still allows interesting plots about this, like passing a message through a blockade by transferring it through the other world, but disallows instant intercontinental communication.
