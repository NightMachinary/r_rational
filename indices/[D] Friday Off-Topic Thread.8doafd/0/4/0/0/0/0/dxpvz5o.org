Ah...I didn't realize you were asking what you would see. I hadn't put much thought into the reactions of future-you on realizing that their powers don't work anymore, but it's a natural consequence of the ability, so I'd have to say yes. You'd see yourself acting how you'd act if your powers suddenly vanished (or realize that you're not 'real').
