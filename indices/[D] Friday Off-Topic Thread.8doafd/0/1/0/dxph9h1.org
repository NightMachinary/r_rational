I haven't seen any original fiction following the idea of a sci-fi tech level civilization of any size encountering a planet of wizards, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was some around.

There's quite a few fanfics that cover the idea, mixing Harry Potter or MLP or Dresdenverse with The Culture, Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, or some other 'verse.
