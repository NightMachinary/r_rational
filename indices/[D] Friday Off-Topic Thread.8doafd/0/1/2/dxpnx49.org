Sidenote this:

  everything discovered in the vastness of space has been as physics predicted.

and this:

are not compatible. FTL may be possible, but not with normal physics. You could maybe try to get around that by including negative mass, but if so you will have much larger problems like time travel and wormholes also being possible.
