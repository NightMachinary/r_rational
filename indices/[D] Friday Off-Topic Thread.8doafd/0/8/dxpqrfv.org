Since the beginning magic has existed in this earth . Magic brought here living beings from other alternate earths ,and it slowly began to adapt to then . Mana particles formed a symbiotic relationship whith life . Soon all life was producing mana. At some point some humans were also brought to the planet . They also adapted to use magic . Civilization rised on earth.

This is the year 3568 since the arrival of humans to the world , the magical sciences have advanced and the different magical planes have been discovered. The aether is one of the only habitable ones ,. It consists of a series of mini planetoids whith artificial gravity of different shapes and materials , occupying a space of the size of the solar system .

Every time a spell is cast its effects are replicated in the aether( even all the ones that were cast by plants and animals during billions of years ) , so it's full of copies of summons , magic materials , light spells , fireballs etc.

Thousands of people departed towards the aether in spaceships powered by the mana output small ecosystems , in search for freedom , success and a new place to live .

Basically magitech space one piece .
