This one's an idea for a Death Note fanfic I never wrote more than one chapter for.

Death Note: And you, too, shall lose the light

The tiniest random changes can snowball in the most unpredictable ways. During the story of Death Note we know, something went slightly amiss - during Higuchi's pursuit, the panicked businessman steered the wheel too fast and carelessly once. His car crashed and burned; the Death Note he was carrying, as well as his own knowledge of it, were lost forever. As a result, Light never went back to being Kira and kept living happily with Misa, with Rem looking upon her from the Shinigami realm, L's investigation came to an halt, and the other Death Note was forgotten, buried in the woods in a place that no one remembered. Until, completely by accident, it was found, by a murderer who was burying the corpse of a victim. Driven by a sharp intellect and utter spite for the human race, he becomes a new Kira for L and Light to catch together. This time it's not just about the lives of a few criminals - the future of humanity itself is at stake.
