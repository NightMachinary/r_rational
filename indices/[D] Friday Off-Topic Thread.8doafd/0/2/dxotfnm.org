  The nuclear launch codes are secured behind six factor authentication, a lead lined, buckminsterfullerene reinforced briefcase, and armed secret service agents.

  I knew, because I had just stolen them.

  Not that it really mattered; nukes were just mythical anyways.

  I should probably step back a bit.

  When two or more people decide on something, that's called an agreement. When an agreement has an enforcement mechanism, that's called a contract.

  Everyone has a contract with reality. We act as if we're real, and in return we can't tell that we're not. If we renege, we die. If reality reneges... well, suffice to say, there's a reason I'm stealing the nuclear football.
