I just wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8dp3tp/if_band_names_were_literal_who_would_you_want_to/dxpdgio/?context=1][this]] in response to the "If band names were literal, who would you want to see live the most?" AskReddit question and the answer "Godsmack"- although that may be slightly too long.

For a shorter answer:

I awoke to the sight of three billion faces. I screamed, and at least two billion of the people screamed back. "What the hell is going on?" I asked, and each of the people answered in a different way, mostly in languages I didn't understand. Somehow, I realized, I could perceive each person perfectly, contemplate their response and consider a reaction, as though they were each the only person I perceived- and yet, there were billions. Not only that, but I could speak to each person individually; utter billions of different sentences simultaneously. The feeling was profoundly strange, and as I considered it, I began to feel the first hints of the mental power that might come from distributing my thoughts across that vast multiplicity.

It soon occurred to me that some of those I was perceiving had grasped what was occurring more quickly than I had. "This is a dream," they'd said. And so began my first night inhabiting the dreams of all of humanity.
