  An eccentric jounin takes two students. Little do the genin know that the jounin is an expert in genjutsu and poisons who intends to make them fall in love with each other in order to improve their teamwork. (Gekkou Hayate and Uzuki Yuugao composed one of her previous teams, but Hayate's sickness unfortunately tore them apart.)
