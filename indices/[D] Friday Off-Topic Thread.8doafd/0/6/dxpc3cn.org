#+begin_quote
  Katara desperately flings a shield of water to block Azula's lightning bolt from hitting Aang, and gets zapped. Aang uses the Avatar State to massacre the Dai Li and severely injure Azula and Zuko. Afterward, amnesiac as always, he doesn't know whether or not he's the one who killed Katara; Iroh says he wasn't. A grief-stricken Sokka demands to be dropped off with Hakoda's band of raiders (along with Katara's corpse), while Aang continues his adventures with only Toph (who trusts both Aang and Iroh more than Sokka can bring himself to), Appa, and Momo.

Naruto: A Ninja's Mind Is Her Castle

#+begin_quote
  Kurenai introduces the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] "mindscape" technique ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][known among civilians as the "memory palace" or "method of loci"]]) to Team 8. Under its influence, Hinata develops a split personality: timid as always inside the Hyuuga compound, but courageous outside it, where she can lock away her painful memories.

Naruto: Mind-Body Merge

#+begin_quote
  After Naruto's disastrous first year of Academy, Inoichi, perplexed and disgusted by Hiruzen's refusal to train the Kyuubi Jinchuuriki, and with the support of all the Ino-Shika-Chou bigwigs (and possibly of the Hyuuga as well), takes a year to teach to Ino a forbidden technique (developed by Yamanaka researchers during the Second Shinobi World War, but never actually revealed on the battlefield, lest Konoha and the Yamanaka become international pariahs) that (unlike Mind-Body /Switch/) allows the /permanent/ controlling of two bodies and minds by a single soul, without deleterious side effects (except the loss of the chakra regeneration associated with the target's soul). (The second soul is painlessly evicted. Because the second /mind/ is retained, the target's memories are not lost.) He instructs her to use it on Naruto, so that Konoha doesn't have to choose between having a half-trained idiot as its sole Jinchuuriki (in comparison to Iwa's and Kumo's /two fully-trained jinchuuriki each/) and overthrowing its Hokage without having any good replacement ready.

Harry Potter: Soul-Bond Subversion

#+begin_quote
  Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry desperately pours his magic into her, and gains control of her mind and body. Dumbledore informs him that this is the original bond of love that was perverted millennia ago by dark wizards into the "Horcrux", but essentially is the reverse of that evil: If /either/ body or mind dies, the soul is sent onward. This phenomenon is rare but not unknown, so the Weasleys will understand and accept what has happened.

Naruto: Married to the Village

#+begin_quote
  An eccentric jounin takes two students. Little do the genin know that the jounin is an expert in genjutsu and poisons who intends to make them fall in love with each other in order to improve their teamwork. (Gekkou Hayate and Uzuki Yuugao composed one of her previous teams, but Hayate's sickness unfortunately tore them apart.)

Naruto: Grand Tour

#+begin_quote
  After becoming a missing-nin, rather than hiding out in underground laboratories, Orochimaru roams the Elemental Countries to trade techniques with isolated ninja clans, just as Sakura and Hinata do in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/19][Chapter 19 of /Time Braid/]].
