I think it's a problem that Eliezer choose the example he did... If his goal was to persuade people's intuition to except utilitarianism, he did the opposite. If his goal was to demonstrate a practical example of shut-up and multiple, the numbers involved are so absurd as to make it impractical (even if a Friendly AI uploaded everyone and turned the whole universe into a computer, it probably wouldn't be able to do a whole person per molecule, and then number of people to exist won't reach the number he choose), thus he did the opposite. Literally the only purpose that example serves it to make laymen associate rationality with being willing to torture somebody and to make rationalists feel smug for choosing a counter-intuitive answer.
