The problem with the dust speck thought experiment is that it's impossible for humans to really grasp =3^^^3= of anything. Even if it was only =10^82= dust specks (about the number of atoms in the universe) that's still far greater than we can picture.

So of course it will seem like it isn't worth it. That's by design. Replace "dust specks" with "amputation of the left arm" and =3^^^3= with "Every human on Earth," and see how your intuitions decide then.
