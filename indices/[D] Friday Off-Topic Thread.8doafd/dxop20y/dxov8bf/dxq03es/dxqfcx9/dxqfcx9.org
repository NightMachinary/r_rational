The absurd number used to try to illustrate this point undermines this point. By using a number that requires [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/152641/knuths-up-arrow-notation-is-there-practical-use-for-the-numbers-involved][Knuth's up-arrow notation]] to illustrate his point, Eliezer choose a number bigger than the number of molecules in the observable universe, bigger than the number of planck volumes in the observable universe. If the Friendly AI uploads everyone and converts everything to computing substrate and then converts the whole universe into to computing substrate, the number of people to exist will stay not reach the number he wants us to consider in his example. He talks about shut-up and multiple, and then chooses a number to break our multiplication.

If his goal was to persuade people's intuition to except utilitarianism, he did the opposite. If his goal was to demonstrate a practical example of shut-up and multiple, the numbers involved are so absurd as to make it impractical, thus he did the opposite. Literally the only purpose that example serves it to make laymen associate rationality with being willing to torture somebody and to make rationalists feel smug for choosing a counter-intuitive answer.
