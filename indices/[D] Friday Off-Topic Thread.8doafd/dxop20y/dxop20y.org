I'd heard the term shut up and multiply before but I'd never read the LessWrong post that (presumably) inspired use of the word. Read it this week [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks][here]] and wanted this subs collective thoughts and opinions on the conclusion it draws.

Personally, I feel that the conclusion it draws is incorrect. I believe in the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few, of course, but something as negligible as dust specks to so many people doesn't seem worth a person's life being filled with agony. Now, I'm aware that, by that logic, people should be doing a lot more to help the less fortunate by sacrificing the money they'd otherwise spend on leisure activities or luxury items and I can't say I wholeheartedly disagree with that either; I'm selfish enough that I certainly won't be driving myself into poverty to donate to different charities but, from an overarching decision making standpoint such as the one detailed in the post, I feel that's a fine attitude to have (though there are certainly limits that most likely no one will agree on)
