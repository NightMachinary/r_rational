Once again, Scott Alexander [[http://archive.is/VnjsR][has been caught red-handed]] in editing and +deleting+ "temporarily hiding" articles without notice.

  [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7gvjhx/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dqm6o6j/][What (if any) opinions do you have on the changing of names upon marriage?[...] I'm inclined to think that [refraining from changing either name] is the best option, since changing one's name incurs a risk of mistakes (e. g., on credit reports) and makes filling out forms a hassle ("Have you ever worked under a name different from your current name? If so, list all other names."). I was quite surprised when, some months ago, I saw that the wife of Prophet Yudkowsky (pbuh) had assumed his last name.]]

(I omit from this screenshot the two entertainers to whom I subscribe on Patreon ([[https://www.youtube.com/user/FilthyRobotChannel/playlists][FilthyRobot]] and [[http://portsherry.com/][Port Sherry]]) because I remain [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/80dn8l/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/duuypqp/][/extremely/ lukewarm]] on whether I should retain them.)

[[http://mcmansionhell.com/][McMansion Hell]] is a fun website. I first learned of its existence last year, when I read [[https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?company=mcmansion+hell][a series of news articles]] that discussed how its author had received spurious legal threats from [[https://www.zillow.com/corp/About.htm][Zillow]] (a "real estate and rental marketplace" website from which the author took many of the photographs to which she added humorous captions); however, I didn't at that time bother to investigate it. More recently, I was reminded of its existence by [[http://archive.is/c4rfQ][this /pol/ thread]], in which various people posted some of the site's hilarious captions, which spurred me to actually visit the site.

Unfortunately, it seems that [[https://voat.co][Voat]] is going through some difficulties (though it's still somewhat accessible [[https://preview.voat.co][here]]). I glance at it only rarely (except when I want to use its "Preview comment" function, which is useful in writing such posts as these since its Markdown is almost the same as Reddit's), but a lack of alternatives always is bad.
