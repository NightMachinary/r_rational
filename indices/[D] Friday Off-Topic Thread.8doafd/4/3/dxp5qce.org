  opinion on changing name upon marriage - Hyphenation: - - One spouse's name goes first for both participants - - What about the next generation?
#+end_quote

This is pretty much [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs#Marriage][what's done in Hispanophone countries.]]. Everyone has two surnames, and people's surnames don't change upon marriage.

About the next generation, most people do it as follows: the first surname of the child comes from their father and the second one from their mother, effectively passing surnames down the male line. However, couples may choose to give the surnames to their children in any order.
