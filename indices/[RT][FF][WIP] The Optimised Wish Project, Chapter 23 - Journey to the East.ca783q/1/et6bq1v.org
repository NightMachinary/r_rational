This one took me a while because next chapter was pretty long (and as usual, I want to finish at least one more chapter before posting the previous one). I'm really trying to think carefully about what comes next because the story is getting intricate and it's not easy to keep track of everything, do the proper amount of foreshadowing, and keep it all together while still having a semblance of thematic consistency. Writing this story really has made me come to grips with how hard that can be!

As an aside, today I've also put up a lesser story, a Harry Potter one-shot that's all but rational, as it's mostly just near-crackfic levels of fun nonsense, but if you're interested in reading it, here it is:
