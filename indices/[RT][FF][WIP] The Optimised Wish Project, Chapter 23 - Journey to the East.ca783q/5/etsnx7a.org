Beautiful chapter.

I remember thinking how should a more numbers focused dbz videogame be, and realising that big beam blasts would have it hard to be worth the charge time, vulnerability and lack of redirectioning. I'm glad to see it is acnowledge here, but I still don't see how you will justify beam struggles besides showing off. Maybe if you stun your oppoment for a second you can actually hit, but I don't see how anybody with super sonic speed, after seen their enemy begin to charge, wouldn't rush to give a kick in the head
