Well, I wasn't thinking specifically about a /Dragon Ball/ RPG. I just meant I'd have liked another RPG that fleshed out that sort of mechanic more. I know there are some RPG-card game hybrids ("Slay the Spire" has been on my wishlist for a while now) but I don't know of any that do something similar to what I described above.

(and if we're talking RPG-ish games using card mechanics... I loved the card-based dungeons of Hand of Fate)
