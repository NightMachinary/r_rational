Well, beam attacks are mass destruction weapons, so they have their own usefulness as a deterrent. That too is part of Gohan's idea here. If behind you is a city that you need to protect, you /have/ to take it head on. If we get to DBZ levels of power and behind you is your planet... you get the notion.

Other than that, yes, huge beam attacks seem pretty useless. But you know, we have small arms and we have artillery and we have ICBMs, and all have their uses. The problem in DBZ is that a lot of the time they're using ICBMs in what amounts to one-on-one pistol duels.

Though there's also another thing to note, which is that the normal human is very squishy - we can deal inordinate amounts of damage with weapons, and take almost none. By comparison superpowered Saiyans and the like can take /a lot/ more punishment, and regenerators like Cell and Majin Boo are even crazier, so obviously one needs to work WMDs into regular combat to even have a chance to kill them. In some cases in DBZ this tends to be acknowledged too - Vegeta's Final Flash only hits Cell because he provoked him into taking it head on, and of two beam clashes between Cell and Gohan, both are basically based on the premise that Cell's kamehameha would destroy the Earth if not stopped. We can also concede a bit more license in the speed these motions are portrayed - for example Goku's genkidama against Majin Boo might as well be so massive and so fast that he simply does not have the time to dodge it, though the scene looks pretty slow for the sake of our own inferior human eyes.

About numbers-focused DBZ games... have you ever played the old SNES "Legend of the Super Saiyan" game? It's an incredibly obscure RPG with a strange but fun card-based combat system and abysmal graphics, but the most enjoyable thing about it is how character stats are replaced by power levels that follow closely the way they work in the anime. In other words, they rise /exponentially/ with level, and with a big enough gap between two fighters, one is literally unable to harm the other entirely. It's one game where grinding rewards you ridiculously. It ends with the Namek saga, and while you can get Goku to go SSJ (by doing the obvious thing: have Krillin in your party, and let him die), you don't need to. A couple more levels and even little Gohan can kick Final Form Frieza's butt to hell and back (oh, also, the game includes a zenkai mechanic too, which raises your Saiyans' level if they heal back from 1 HP, so even more brokenness XD).
