Speaking of, Grandpa Gohan implied he didn't meet any saiyans in Heaven. The most obvious non-earth candidates, Tarble and Broly, are still alive, but are people like Gine and Yamoshi ([[https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Yamoshi]]) not in heaven or did he just miss them?

Also, I liked the JttW reference with monkeys hatching from stone eggs.
