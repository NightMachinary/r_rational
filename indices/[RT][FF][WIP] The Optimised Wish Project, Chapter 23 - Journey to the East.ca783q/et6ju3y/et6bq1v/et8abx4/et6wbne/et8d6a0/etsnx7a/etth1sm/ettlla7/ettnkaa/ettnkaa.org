Ah, the card system is a bit annoying because it relies on Japanese numerals up to 7, so you need to know those... but basically, the way I remember it is like this:

- the upper left corner Dragon Ball represents the offence. It's 1 to 7 dots (so that's easy...), plus Z which is basically a critical hit. The higher the offence, the higher the boost given to your attack.
- the lower right corner Dragon Ball is the defence. This one is in Japanese numerals. Some of the easiest kanji to remember, but still... /very/ easy up to 3 (as they're basically one, two, or three horizontal strokes), then they get a bit more confusing. Same as above, high defence = you take less damage.
- the figure in the centre represents the kind of attack. I never figured these much out except that if the square is blue instead of yellow, that's an energy attack.

All the stats apply as boosts to your character's base stats, so basically if you have a very strong character already and give them a Z attack card they'll obliterate almost anyone but the bosses, if you have a weak one then not even a Z defence may save them from being one-shotted. Ideally you want to save up those sweet, sweet blue background + Z attack cards as finishers to use in combination with your strongest characters, because those do /a lot/ of damage. The strategy is all in managing how and when you use those cards, balancing the need to attack and that to defend. It's a fun, if unusual, system, which IMHO well manages the randomness inherent in an RPG fighting system, as instead of being /entirely/ up to the RNG part of it is delegated to the cards and you can manage those, for example saving up your crits for when you need them.
