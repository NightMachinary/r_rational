Fun chapter all around. I think Goku still significantly undervalues beam attacks, but it makes sense because he hasn't discovered their niche yet, not really. It's kind of fun to see him spit in the face of conventional DB wisdom of “weak burst blasts have never accomplished anything / has that ever worked.” I liked how Goku has taken on the habit of metaphor correction; it can be done poorly, but I do like it a lot when done well.

Also, note: do you prefer reveiws here or on FanFiction.Net? I used to do it there regularly but I've been switching to here, not sure if you care since it's not a big deal to do one or the other on my end.
