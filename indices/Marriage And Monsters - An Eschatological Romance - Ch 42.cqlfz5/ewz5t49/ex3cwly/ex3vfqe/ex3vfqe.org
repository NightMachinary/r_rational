On the one hand, the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][unthinkable bomb]] is basically designed specifically to take out something like the Concept.

​

On the other hand, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3125][SCP-3125]]is explicitly stated to be a sort of conceptual prionic infection, capable of subsuming other ideas into itself, and is much, much more dangerous than the Concept (for example, 3125 instantly kills and takes over almost anyone who even knows about it, can create other SCPs, and can't be cured by memory removal). If 3125 subsumes the Concept, then you've gone from being fucked, to being super, extra fucked.

​

On the third hand, it would be interesting to see the fallout from SCP-3125 and the Concept duking it out in idea space, or however a fight between them would work.
