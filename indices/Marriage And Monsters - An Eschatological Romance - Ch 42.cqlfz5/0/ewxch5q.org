SIEGE OF HOGWARTS

VOLDEMORT THRESHOLD CROSSED

GET HYPE

Okay I /love/ that Hogwarts is where the climactic siege against the Concept will occur. Magic has so many interesting avenues of offense and defense-- Sean had a brilliant thought with his sensory modification, but of course Mad-Eye can just false memory charm you to stick the image directly into your head.

Dumbledore was able to ward against the meme because Hogwarts is impregnable by longstanding narrative convention. But the Concept is evolving at the speed of thought here because it's all but melded with magic.

Pensieves are a smart solution, scaling it up is gonna be tough. I enjoy the challenge set out here (for Sean, Haley, and FormerlySarsaparilla) and look forward to seeing this ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny.

Also SEAN AND HALEY ARE BACK TOGETHER

I still love the Concept a lot. It's got Mad-Eye, Merlin and Holmes, and I can't wait to see how those three navigate this siege.
