I'm looking forward to the perhaps never gonna happen sequel as I really enjoyed the prime intellect story and universe in general.

MoPI is not everyone's cup of tea largely due to the sexually and violently graphic first chapter (which I personally didn't mind), but this short story doesn't require knowledge of the universe and has no graphic content at all.

Upgrade isn't my favourite localroger piece by any means but it's hard to top a lot of the stuff he's written (Passages in the Void is my personal favourite). The "reveal" about the alien culture at the end is something I've seen before, [[#s][in]], so I didn't feel it had payoff like maybe it "should" have, and I thought the story was interesting enough without having to have a payoff. Then again I like silly meandering stories with no real plot (/The Time Machine/ typifies this IMO, wanders around, doesn't get into major conflict, just observes a bunch of stuff and then travels 40 million years into the future just for the heck of it).

It does remind me how much I love post-singularity sci-fi, does anyone have any recommendations? I never got into the Culture series as much as I wanted to, started both Consider Phlebas and Player of Games but never got gripped...
