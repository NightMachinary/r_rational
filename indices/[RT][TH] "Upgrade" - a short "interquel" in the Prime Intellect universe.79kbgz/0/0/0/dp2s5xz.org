Glasshouse and Accelerando, as a transition between here and there are both well worth reading.

As far as Banks I think OP started with quite possibly the two worst novels to try and get "gripped" with the culture series. Personally, as someone's who's handle and flair are culture allusions, I'd recommend, Excession and Surface Detail, even if both abuse the Godzilla threshold on the morality front with their respective [[/s][spoiler Excession]] and [[/s][spoiler surface detail]].

Edit: addition Mater is also worth reading if only as an example of the prime directive subverted i.e. [[/s][spoiler Matter]]
