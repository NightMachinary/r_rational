Obviously the second image is supposed to be Marco, but the hunched over body language immediately made me think Garrett.

Apologies if this is answered in the story and I forgot, but can I assume that the characters in the images are younger as a consequence of the timeline being different than canon? Or am I misremembering the age of the earliest Animorphs cover models?
