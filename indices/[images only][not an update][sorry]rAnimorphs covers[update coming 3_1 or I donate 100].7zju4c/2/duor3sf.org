It's funny, I recently realized that making these kinds of pledges (I will have finished X by next week/month or else) was making me /less/ productive, and made me miss more deadlines on average.

For now I'm just trying to do the most I can day by day, and avoid deadlines whenever possible (which is why I've stopped posting updates on my game project, even though I'm still making progress). I don't know at all if the same would apply to you or if you have a different mindset, but... I mean, if you feel like your life is going Game-of-Thrones bad, maybe you should just try to let go a little?

I say that as the guy who really want the next Animorphs update as soon as possible.
