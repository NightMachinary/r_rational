You could build yourself a prosthetic hand, so you can detach your fingers, attach them to the prosthetic, attach it to your arm, and now have your fingers in an unusual arrangement. Like spacing them out for piano or typing, I guess.

You could attach a bunch of fingers to each other tip-to-base^{*} to have a really long wiggly finger. This would be useful for when you drop something behind the couch and whatnot.

You might be able to do something to help with search and rescue efforts in collapsed buildings, dropping a finger on a string down a crack and reporting if you feel anything fleshy.

If you're willing to permanently lose a hand, you could lend some fingers to NASA for a Mars mission. Fingers are a lot more sensitive than instruments; you can report details about rock and soil texture that can be used to infer geological things. You might even be able to eventually get them back if it's a sample return mission, though you also risk losing them for nothing if the launch goes poorly. You'd want to keep the fingers in a heated compartment in the rover so they're not too cold to feel things, but otherwise it doesn't add any real life support challenges, since they're getting oxygenated blood from your body.

On that note, since the remote fingers have to still be getting blood from your body to function properly, I guess there's a tiny portal in there? You could hook your hand up to a siphon that withdraws blood just before the finger and inserts it on the way back, inject whatever in the blood's place, and bleed it back out of a cut on the finger. So you can remotely deliver tiny amounts of liquid very far distances. This sounds incredibly horrifying and uncomfortable, I'd recommend not mentioning this capability to anyone.

^{*} If the power doesn't allow this, I'm imagining a padded finger tube that you tie tight with string.
