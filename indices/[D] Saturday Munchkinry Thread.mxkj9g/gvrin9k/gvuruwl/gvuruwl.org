You can leave a finger in a hospital, where they can monitor your vitals remotely and inject drugs if needed.

You could use it for communication with things radio waves can't reach, like deep underground or to nuclear submarines.

A low thrust space probe could use your finger as an infinite source of reaction mass and a much lower power and more resilient communications. Maybe even FTL.

You could use it to cheat at various situations where communication is not allowed, such as school exams or trivia TV shows, even if they have faraday's cages, monitoring, etc.

You could attach a strong to it and use it to trigger traps, even if you don't have access to technology.

You could attract a SO with an extremely specific fetish.

Someone who has the finger can detect if you're being tortured, and inject painkillers or something extremely lethal.

If you hook it up to an IV with sugar and nutrients, an maybe even some form of oxygenation, you could require significantly less life support than someone else.

You could use it to trigger a bomb, in a way that's immune to most ways of preventing that.
