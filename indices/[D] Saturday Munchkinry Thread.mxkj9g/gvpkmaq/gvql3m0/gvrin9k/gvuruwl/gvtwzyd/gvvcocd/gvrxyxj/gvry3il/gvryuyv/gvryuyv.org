Oh. That is much weaker than I thought. And probably completely replicable with modern technology.

I guess we have to look at uses in extreme circumstances then. You could detach some fingers and put them on a spacecraft while you remain on Earth. Then you eat food on Earth and use the calories to exercise your detached space fingers, generating a very tiny amount of extra energy for the spacecraft?

But a solar panel would be easier so never mind.

Maybe a medieval era life sensor? Give a detached finger to a trusted ally before heading into danger. Periodically move the detached finger while you are alive. If the finger stops moving, that means you are dead. So you can set up various dead man switches.
