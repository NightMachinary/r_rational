Putting aside the prize money from proving supernatural powers, this power is basically limited telekinesis. Unfortunately, fingers cannot go through walls, nor are they particularly strong or durable. You probably couldn't do something like float around 10 guns each carried by one finger to shoot an enemy from all directions. Nor can you use your detached fingers for exploration, lest they get destroyed by unknown factors. Who knows when a bird will see your worm-like detached finger and decide to eat it?

Which leaves things like button pressing. You can press buttons that are far away. But this is not particularly advantageous since the buttons could always have been installed closer to you, or voice activated, or any number of other electronic/engineering workarounds.

Off the top of my head, the best use for this power is becoming a master pianist. Pianists typically have big hands, because this allows them to simultaneously press piano keys that are entire octaves apart using one hand. But that is their limit, no one has hands large enough to press keys that are on opposite ends of the piano.

You have no such limitation. Your 10 fingers are detachable and can be sent to any piano key you want. You can give live piano performances with musical chords that are literally unplayable by any other pianist. So these performances would be completely unique, and thus very valuable.
