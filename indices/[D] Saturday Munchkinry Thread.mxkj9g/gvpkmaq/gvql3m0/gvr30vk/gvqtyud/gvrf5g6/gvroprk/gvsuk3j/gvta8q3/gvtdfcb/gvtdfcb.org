Well, I don't agree with what the OP said. A copy is a copy, and the copies start diverging almost instantly as their experiences differ.

Also, I don't understand how you're going to make a copy of someone 10 LY away if you didn't have one to start with.

Again, if you're breaking the current laws of physics, you'd better have a good explanation for your new physics.
