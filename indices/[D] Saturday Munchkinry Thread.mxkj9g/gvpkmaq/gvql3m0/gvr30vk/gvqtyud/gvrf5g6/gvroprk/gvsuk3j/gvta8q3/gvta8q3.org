Except this copy has the same memories as the original because it /is/ the original. OP already specified that dead people can be revived with all their memories with copies even if the copy was made before they died. So if a person is on Tau Ceti and we make a copy now, we'll get the past ten years of news without waiting ten years for radio waves.
