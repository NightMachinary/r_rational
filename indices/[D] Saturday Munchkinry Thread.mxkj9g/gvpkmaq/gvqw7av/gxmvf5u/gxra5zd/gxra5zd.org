Those are two really big topics, and the best parts are the ones that'd be missed by a shorter explanation. But basically, hypercomputation means that for any possible question, if you can find out if an answer satisfies some criteria (including you checking it manually and going "yea this seems right") or not you can magically create that answer does so instantly at no cost. Probability manipulation means you can magically alter the outcome of any random event forcing it to be whatever you want as long as you can see if they really turned out that way or not, including ones much further in the past than any form of time travel allows you to interact with and other absolute bullshit sequence and assumption breaking things like that.
