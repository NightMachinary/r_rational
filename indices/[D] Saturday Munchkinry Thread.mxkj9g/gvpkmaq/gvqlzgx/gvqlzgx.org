Three seconds is easily enough to create paradoxical conditions if the time travel mechanism is not a friendly one.

This might be a case where the only winning move is not to play.

But taking the question as intended and assuming it's quicksave/reset style time travel, you could do all sorts of physics experiments. Settle some arguments about odd variants of hidden variable entanglement, or play at being Maxwell's demon and reverse a tiny bit of entropy just out of spite.
