I saw a post on askreddit the other day asking what people would do with the ability to go back in time by three seconds. The time travel couldn't be stacked so you can only use it every three seconds.

Besides the obvious of winning Randi's million dollar prize I thought maybe you could use it for HFT by partnering with a hedge fund though idk if that is long enough to get confirmation of your trades.

What else could 3 second time travel be used for?
