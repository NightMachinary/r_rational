Good idea about gambling, blackjack would be another game you could manipulate with 3 seconds.

You mentioned combat and the element of surprise. It might help dodge bullets or something like that.

Another combat application would be for a sniper who gets to take as many shots as they want without losing the element of surprise. That would make them a scary assassin though then they would still have to escape.
