There might be forms of poker it'd be useful for, or some kinds of slot machines, but that's pretty much the HFT idea watered down (arbitrage.)

It'd be good for physical exercise and combat, obviously. While it's not a good idea to seek out trouble, it'd help with preparing for and dealing with it. 3 seconds is enough time to avoid a lot of injuries and nullifies three seconds of the element of surprise.

Any experiment that can be performed in three seconds can be undone. Silly contrived example: There's a priceless Faberge egg but you need to know what's inside it. Smash the egg, then rewind as soon as you see what's in there. Or, if you only have /one/ lump of unobtainium, and each of the five experiments you want to do requires a lump, you could perform the experiment over and over, resetting to preserve the material each time (as long as you can do it in under 3 seconds.)

It could be useful for social engineering/cold reading; you'd still get to use the old cold reading tricks to get people to tell you stuff, but you could erase their memory of telling you that stuff. Strong psychic act.

3 seconds is an interesting choice, because even 60 seconds is obviously ludicrously OP, but 3 seconds is short enough that one might barely get one's bearings in that time. (Still ludicrously OP, but requiring of more forethought to get there.)
