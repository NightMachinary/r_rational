Probe for hacking vulnerabilities with no one the wiser. In particular, I imagine your power grabs some cryptographic schemes by the assumptions.

Spend a lot of money on a "one-time" voucher for 3 seconds of as much cloud compute as money can buy; effectively double the global amount of cloud compute for perhaps 8 hours a day, only usable for computations which have on average very few bits of output, such as brute-force searches, such as bitcoin mining.

If you go public with your power: Livestream an LED that says whether the current timeline is virtual. Let people pay you a lot of real-timeline money to have the right to /once/ send back a message for whatever use they can come up with. (Their name is included in the message for purposes of length pricing. Still, they can send back N extra bits by doing their experiment 2^{N} times and sending back the info on a particular run; this is a feature.)
