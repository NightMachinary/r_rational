It'd also work well in a fight or boxing/MMA since you can undo any punch that you miss with the knowledge of how they're going to try and dodge it to ensure it either hits or puts them in a position where they can't dodge the next one or turn it into a feint and any enemy blow that lands and know exactly where it hit you and when so you can dodge it next time.
