  I don't understand what it means to share a consciousness then.

I don't either.

It is not trivial, /today/, to copy a consciousness. In the future, with an AGI that runs on conventional hardware, or a biological mind that has been copied at the molecular level (advanced molecular nanotechnology), a mind-state can be copied.

And I would expect that exposed to the same stimulus, the original and the copy will react similarly... depending on how exact the copy was, and on how exact the stimulus was. We run continuous integration tests on programs with that sort of intent.

But when you expose a program to substantively different inputs, you expect substantively different outputs.

Likewise, the original mind looking at the trees in the park will have different thoughts than a copy of that mind looking at the rings of a gas giant 42 Draconis b light years from home.

The speed of light is still the speed of light. If anyone is proposing something that breaks the laws of physics...

And that Roko's basilisk crap doesn't carry any more weight with me than maltreating any other sophont. Torturing people is /bad/ in general.
