OK, I now am more closely reading the OP, and have been coming at this from the wrong angle.

I've previously read arguments about sufficiently detailed mind copies, from the rationality crowd as well as the SF crowd (like Charlie's Accelerando).

There are various philosophical implications around exact copies of minds, and those discussions didn't involve FTL communication. Stuff like Boltzmann Brains.

As OP /is/ implying FTL comm, what I've said previously is invalid.
