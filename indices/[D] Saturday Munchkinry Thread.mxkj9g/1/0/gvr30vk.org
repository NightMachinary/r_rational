Uh. So you mean that if someone has a sufficiently accurate and detailed understanding of your mind, they could create an instance of it and use it as a literal voodoo doll?

Then they can do all kinds of things to your simulated mind to control your real mind. World domination becomes actually possible, since a tyrant could forcefully make simulated copies of everyone's minds, and put them in a simulation that forces their real minds to obey.

On the other hand, how would one create a sufficiently accurate and detailed instance of a real person's mind anyway? We don't have any kind of brain scanning technology that can do anything like that. So this would probably just be used for simulated (not actually intelligent) AI minds.

This could be incredibly useful for phones. Create a simple AI that simply learns and regurgitates info when asked, duplicate it countless times and put one on every phone, and now you have a true wireless connection between all phones that can never be jammed and doesn't need any signal whatsoever.

Private phone calls become possible just by having some simple security measures on the AI's regurgitation. Accessing a wiki is easy by having more copies of the AI sit in servers somewhere and crawl through wikis. Giving the AI access to your phone's location could make search and rescue a breeze, as long as you don't lose your phone. The applications are boundless!
