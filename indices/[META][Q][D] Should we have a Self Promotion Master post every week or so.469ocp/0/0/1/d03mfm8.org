Reddit as a whole is a content aggregator, and I wouldn't be surprised if the really big subreddits are mostly about linking to things you've found. That being said, I don't really care about or use Reddit other than in the small communities I hang out in.

Here's what I care about: finding rational and rationalist fiction to read and enjoy. I don't care who the person posting the link is. I don't care whether or not it's "self-promotion" either. If alexanderwhales or eaglejarl post links to their stuff as it comes out, this makes me really happy! I want to read things.

If we put into place rules that make it harder to do what we want to do, and follow them because they are rules, the tail is wagging the dog. Rules exist in service of our needs and wants. They are our tools, not our chains.

So, feel free to post links to your stuff. If you find yourself getting downvotes a lot, then maybe rethink it, but those downvotes won't be because of self-promotion, they'll be based on the content. That's how I vote, at least.
