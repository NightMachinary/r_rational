Posting original content has never been frowned upon, the only thing that reddit (the company) dislikes is when people use reddit as nothing but a platform for self-promotion. There's a rule of thumb for this in the reddiquette:

#+begin_quote
  Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror --- you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.
#+end_quote

Reddit (the userbase) doesn't tend to have as much of a problem with that, unless it rises to the level of spam, and the 9:1 rule is generally considered to be a pretty terrible one.

As far as this subreddit goes, I'd actively encourage people to just link their stuff as a new post. If it does poorly, take that long look in the mirror.
