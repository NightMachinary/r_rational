I find the votes on my stuff a little odd, it seems like most of my updates have been in around the 10s-15s range... but some times it's just 'not a good day' or maybe the crowd is different or possibly I presented the update in the wrong light?

But with posts ranging from the first post here about my comic to the last one some times people just vote it down with no comment. It's a bit less then helpful because also sometimes they just vote it up with no comment too. It feels very arbitrary and makes it hard to gauge which factors are 'good' or 'bad'.
