PAO can only affect nonmagical inanimate objects of up to 100 cubic feet per level - or one creature. By eaglejarl's reading of the rules, this is a limit on the size of the object's original form, not what it turns into.

And PAO is temporary, too. It is permanent if the transformation is relatively simple (there's a definition of this in the SRD), and apparently casting it twice makes it permanent (temporarily polymorph A into B, then permanently polymorph B into B). But again, this only works if B is small enough to be a target of PAO.
