[time dilation]

I am treating the area inside the event horizon as also having infinite time dilation. From the outside universe reference frame, Neklos is stuck inside a Temporal Stasis (except not magical). From his own perspective he was only in there for one round -- 6 seconds. When the black hole finished evaporating the time dilation fell apart and he returned to find a universe where all the protons had decayed into nothing.

  Where is this room, anyhow? Not on the Material Plane, I hope.

Nope. Extradimensional space (aka demiplane) that Afi had created.
