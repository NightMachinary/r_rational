What's the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation][gravitational time dilation]] factor?

Let's assume he sat around inside the black hole for a few minutes (from his perspective). Let's assume he was around ten meters away. We know that it's ten billion solar masses.

The equation I found on the internet breaks down inside of the Swartzchild radius (i.e. the event horizon). The logic is that if you measure the amount of time it appears to take for somebody to fall into a black hole, it take an infinite amount of time, because the photons heading in your direction are going slower and slower as they get closer to the black hole.

I wonder if any of Death's followers tried to teleport into the room to save him. Where is this room, anyhow? Not on the Material Plane, I hope.
