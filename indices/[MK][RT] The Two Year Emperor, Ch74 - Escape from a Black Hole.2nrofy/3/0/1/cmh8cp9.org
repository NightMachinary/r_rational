As time approaches infinity, the probability that somebody will have discovered a way to (possibly accidentally) destroy the Prime Material plane approaches 1.

The method that pops into mind requires a couple epic levels, but I recall finding a way to throw the Elemental Plane of Earth, and a Hulking Hurler does 1d6 damage per 200 pounds of thrown object, so that'd probably do it.
