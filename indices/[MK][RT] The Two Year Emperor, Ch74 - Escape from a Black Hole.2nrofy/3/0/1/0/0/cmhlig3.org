Well, that's impressive.

I was specifically thinking about laws of physics as buggy as D&D, with sentient beings around to fiddle with them, though. I suppose I should say "the chances the universe ends up in a state that nobody can do anything about (for instance, because the universe is empty) approaches 1."

Though with the quantum tunneling there's always a chance it'll revert to some other state, so I guess it doesn't actually approach 1.
