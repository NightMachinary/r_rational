I don't think we can answer that with presently known physics. Any case where the Schwarzschild radius expands faster than the speed of light - where particles can go from "outside a black hole" to "should already be inside a black hole" instantaneously at least doesn't conform to normal behavior around a black hole, so I'm not sure if simultaneity is well-defined in this case, rather than producing the answer "Neklos is in the infinitely far future".

Because of that, I'm also unsure how much subjective time passes for Neklos before the decay of the black hole, if it ever would: normally, objects never seem to pass the horizon from the outside, so the black hole decays before they appear to fall in, and since everyone has to agree on observations, the black hole decays before you fall in, but with Neklos he just discontinuously ends up inside a black hole.
