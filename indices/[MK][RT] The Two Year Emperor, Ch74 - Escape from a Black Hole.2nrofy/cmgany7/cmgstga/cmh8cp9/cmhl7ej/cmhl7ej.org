Not necessarily. Lets take an 'event' to mean the evolution of one state of the universe to another state by way of the laws of physics.

The number of possible states of an infinite universe is at most countably infinite. This is because space is discrete, any finite region of space can only have a finite number of states, and any sum of discrete items is at most countable.

Also, it is possible (albeit /incredibly unlikely/) for the entire universe to spontaneously tunnel into another state.

Thus, the number of possible events in the universe can be viewed as the number of functions mapping one element of {N} to another element of {N}. This is an uncountable set, and so the number of possible events in the universe is also uncountable.

This means that even given an infinite amount of time, you cannot say that any arbitrary event will occur with probability approaching 1, or else EVERY event would have to occur with probability 1, and there simply just isn't enough time for that to happen.

Edit: Unless you assume a universe with finite volume. Then there are only a finite number of states, and then /every possible event/ would occur /infinitely many/ times. That's just weird to think about.
