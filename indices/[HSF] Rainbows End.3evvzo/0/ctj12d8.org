If you haven't read it already, here's Vinge's [[https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html][The Coming Technological Singularity]] (notable partly because it was written in 1993, and partly because it's the wellspring of a lot of talk about the Singularity).

And yes, this is (probably) my favorite book. There are imperfect characters who get a little less imperfect as they go, fumbling their way forward in uncertain times like most of us do. I personally like that, but could understand if it weren't in [[/r/rational]]'s set. It's got some stellar near-future worldbuilding.
