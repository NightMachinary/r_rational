The way the protagonist starts out being a deliberate asshole, and eventually realizes that that's not working for him any more... and probably wasn't working as well as he thought before he got sick... is pretty core to the story. He's not /supposed/ to be a likeable character, he's supposed to have the potential for becoming one.
