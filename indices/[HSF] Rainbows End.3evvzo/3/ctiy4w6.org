Your description of the setting reminds me of the Oubliette in Hannu Rajaniemi's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quantum_Thief][The Quantum Thief]]. People could move around in public as visible-but-indiscernible hazy people-clouds, or reveal themselves to only friends/family/etc, however they wanted to customize it.
