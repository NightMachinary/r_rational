The whole thing started when...I believe it was [[/u/TimeWinders]]...asked if there was any rational horror out there. After some discussion I ran a Kickstarter and wrote [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00V52XRIE?ie=UTF8&redirectFromSS=1&pc_redir=T1&noEncodingTag=1&fp=1][Baby Blues]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00V4ZIEMQ?ie=UTF8&redirectFromSS=1&pc_redir=T1&noEncodingTag=1&fp=1][Pay Attention]]. (Those are links to Amazon eBooks.)

Pay Attention is the story of a group of rationalist friends who do a seance as a lark proposed by a woo-woo friend, and the fallout thereof. Baby Blues is the story of someone escaping from Rikers Island prison and fleeing pursuit. Both are rational horror.

As an aside, I think that Baby Blues is the best thing I ever wrote. Certainly it's the one I'm most proud of. It was also the easiest -- it poured itself into the computer with almost no effort and required little editing. It seems to have been effective too -- I've had multiple people email me to say "oh my god, I just finished Baby Blues, and it was horrifying!" Fortunately they all went on to say they liked it or I would have misunderstood. :>

Actually, I say BB was "little effort" but that only refers to the writing. I did a crazy amount of research that included heat maps of police crime statistics, tide charts, maps of the currents in the East River, sunrise/sunset tables, and Google street view to locate real-world elements I needed for the story. Every place that's mentioned is a real place, except for one.
