I already have a beta reader for /Shadows of the Limelight/ but I'm working on some shorter pieces that I might eventually like some feedback on before trying for wider distribution. These would be mostly fantasy, and not full-tilt rational; one "weird west" detective story, one fantasy-kitchen-sink mini adventure story. Or maybe some other things.
