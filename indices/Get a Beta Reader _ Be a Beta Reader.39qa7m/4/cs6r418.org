I'm looking for a beta reader for a serialized original webfiction that I'm starting up called "Horismos".

Drawing a fair bit of influence from Sam Hughes (Fine Structure, Ra) (maybe too much), it's fairly hard science fiction with a rational bent.

Probably going to be slow with the writing, though.

No aliens.
