I'm getting ready to restart writing "S.I.", the first part of which is at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit]] , and I can still use all the beta-ing I can get. In case you haven't caught previous posts on it, it's RST, HSF, attempted-MK, and TH: A cryonicist wakes up after the Singularity, gets stuffed into a new body, and tries to deal.

(Before I start writing new story, one of my preliminary tasks is, in fact, going to be catching up on on the betas' comments and suggestions that have built up while I was not up to writing.)
