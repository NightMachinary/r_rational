Consider that chakra makes ninja super-humanly strong, fast, and physically durable. Chakra do that sort of enhancement for the mind and mental state as well.

And look what canon Naruto's got: an abundance of over-the-top optimism /and/ chakra. Sort of fits, right? Might not make someone sane, but it could make them stable when any normal person would be a complete psychotic mess. Even if your Naruto wasn't taught in the academy how to properly use yin chakra and meditation to keep himself sane, it could be a natural side-effect of his situation.

Might also go a long way to rationally explaining why ninja don't just PTSD out almost immediately, even when they're /not/ genius 12-year-old murderbots with the fate of the village in their hands. Would also be a good explanation for veteran ninja with absurdly exaggerated personality traits, a side-effect of directed yin/yang chakra imbalances that supported their mental states over their long careers as professional spies, assassins, combat engineers, and forward scouts.

So Kakashi meditating on his dead friends at the memorial stone isn't a sign of weakness or sloth, but is perhaps a Hokage-ordered method to keep a severely traumatized, top village asset from suiciding or going on a rampage.
