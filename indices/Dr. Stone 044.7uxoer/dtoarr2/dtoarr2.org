It honestly doesn't look like the author has any intention of explaining how 6 people managed to start a village that kept existing for thousands of years....that's really annoying. Even just one or two panels showing that other people who were unpetrified joined the village later would have been sufficient.

also that bit about senku and his dad not being biologically related is BS; there was no mention of that whatsoever in the flashback ad they look similar, as other users have pointed out. They only put that in there so fans could ship Senku/Ruri or Senku/Kohaku together without incest accusations. Really disappointing..
