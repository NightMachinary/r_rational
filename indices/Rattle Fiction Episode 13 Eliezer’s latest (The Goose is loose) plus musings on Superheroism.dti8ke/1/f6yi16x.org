The main way superheroes “cause” their own rogues' gallery is through the shift in expectations known as the Overton Window.

- Once you believe a man can fly, you start looking for his physics exploits. That's Lex Luthor.
- Once you know the sheer power of will, you wonder about the power of fear. That's Sinestro.
- Once you see a masked man flaunting the law and being hailed as “your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,” you want to find out what he's hiding behind that mask. That's J. Jonah Jameson.
- Once you see your stupid strongman brother hailed as a god and hero of men, you want that adoration for your own clever self. That's Loki.
