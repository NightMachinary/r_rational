When I saw the part of the title of this post where it says "the Goose is Loose" I was hoping Eliezer's latest fanfiction would be some rational retelling of the Goose Game.

I'm imagining something like a group of noble villagers teaming up to try to take down the goose, which of course is some kind of cosmic Lovecraftian entity.

Actually can someone write this.
