I'm going to assume that you don't read With This Ring? It's very long, I know, but quite on point.

Proactive measures featured in the story include:

- Contacting the less extreme/crazy villains and pointing them in useful directions. Eg arranging for Captain Cold to submit his work on thermodynamics and get a doctorate. Bonus points for using cold guns to reglaciate the poles and share the environmental prize with him.

- Unlocking the mundane utility of super tech. Electricity generation from a cosmic rod. Mass transit via Dolmen Gates. Recruiting Greek gods to help produce a perfectly conductive metal.

- Getting big business interested in magic. In the DC universe, at least, it has massive utility but it's hardly used, just a few amateurs.
