How does everyone deal with the massive amount of commends on Reddit threads (especially the repetitious "jet fuel can't melt steel" or thread-derailing silly ones)?

I really love the discussion on most threads but I find myself having to really wade through many of them to find quality discussion about the topic at hand; obviously the ideal solution is to unsubscribe from the default subreddits, but it's often hard to find good alternatives (for example, I've tried a few and haven't been able to locate an active community for world news, etc.).

For example, one of the solutions I'm considering at the moment, is trying to find a filter program like [[http://www.unspoiler.tv/][Unspoiler]] except for Reddit.

Edit: Hmm, or I've heard people mention using RES to tag people, I suppose it might be worthwhile to tag posters of good discussion, if that makes them more visible? Or tag jokers to hide their posts?
