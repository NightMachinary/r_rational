Most people lurk. This sub has ~3,500 subscribers. As of 8/31/15, 1,756 people have ever commented (though note that "people currently subscribed" does not fully contain the set of "people who have ever commented"). Of people who have commented, 1,283 have ten comments or less. This is not unusual on the internet; it's known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)][the 1% rule]].

As to why that's the case ... it's something that I think about a lot. Some of it probably comes down to personality. There are certain people that just naturally post a lot, because they like being part of the conversation rather than listening to the conversation. But I think there's probably something more as well. I don't know. I've been trying to work towards a grand unified theory of internet participation but there are too many variables and there's not enough real data to look at.
