Let's talk about lurking a little bit.

I read this subreddit more than I read any other, and yet I think I've posted maybe five comments in here. Ever. This is the first subreddit I open when I get home and start casually browsing on my desktop, yet I just don't interact with the community.

Reading this thread made me start wondering why that is. I thought on it a bit, and I realized my knee-jerk emotion was intimidation. I recognize the silliness of that, and that I'm likely falling prey to the Dunning-Krueger effect, but I'm just posting this to wonder out loud if anyone else feels the same way, or acts the same way for different reasons?
