To be honest, I've only subscribed to it for a little while, so I haven't purchased anything based on it /yet/ - but I already own [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/33fray/40_year_old_tupperwear_cups_still_kickin_theres_a/][these glasses]] (plus a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1e74eh/bifl_request_minimal_reliable_and_reasonably/c9xfajq][wristwatch]], some thermoses, and cast-iron cookware that may similarly last absurd amounts of time), I miss the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/2keulc/corelle_kitchenware_i_grew_up_with_these/][dishes]] that went away during one family move, my artist brother owns at least one of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/319zc1/a_very_bifl_knife_35_years_to_the_day_separates/][these knives]], and I plan on skimming the subreddit for suggestions when I have to buy a new pair of hiking boots or a daypack in the near future.
