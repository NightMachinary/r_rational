[[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]] is your friend. It includes filteReddit which allows you to filter posts based on keyword, domain, subreddit, etc. It includes User Tagger to let you tag users, or ignore them completely. It also includes a ton of other enhancements.

Subreddit discovery is a bit trickier; it really depends on what you want to talk about. Sometimes there just isn't a place for discussion outside the defaults, either because the alternative is too small to have much conversation, or because too few people care for there to be an alternative.
