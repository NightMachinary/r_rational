So, 767 all told. This comes out a bit over budget, but going lower than this would leave us with a dual-core CPU which would not be able to handle streaming, I'm fairly certain. Going over the choices quickly:

CPU: X4 860K is a cheap quad-core CPU. AMD is more efficient at this price range, despite slightly lower single-thread performance. The cheapest intel CPU with 4 cores is the i5 4160 at $181, so we make do with AMD.

Motherboard: Gigabyte motherboard is cheap and has the slots we need.

Memory: 8 is what we need. 2x4gb is cheaper than 1x8gb and has slightly better performance at the cost of making an upgrade to 16gb (2x8) slightly more expensive.

Storage: Seagate Barracuda is inexpensive and fast at 7200 RPM. It's no SSD but it gets the job done.

MSI GTX 750 TI has the best price performance in our range. It's more power efficient and cooler than the AMD offerings, and MSI makes good products.

NZXT Case is cheap and although it is low-featured and a bit cramped to work in, the price is right.

Corsair CX 430W meets our power needs and is efficient.

Windows 7 can be upgraded for free to Windows 10. I am not familiar with buying used keys and have never done it. If savings can be made, they will be made here.

These Acers are the cheapest, best 1080p monitors on the market for $100 each. You'll be hard-pressed to do better.

Logitech K120 is a great keyboard that gets the job done with no frills.

Gigabit GM-M6800 is a wired mouse with good tracking and it's cheap.

This computer will meet your needs, though you could knock off about 10% of the price by being very clever and shopping around, and waiting for deals [[/r/buildapc][r/buildapc]] and pcpartpicker.com are both good sources to use. This assumes no mail-in rebates and only using Newegg and Amazon.
