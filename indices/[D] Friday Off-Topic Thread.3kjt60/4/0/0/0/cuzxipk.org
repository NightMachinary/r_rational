/Naruto/ is available to watch for free on Hulu ([[http://www.hulu.com/naruto][pre-timeskip]], [[http://www.hulu.com/naruto-shippuden][post-timeskip]]). It's all one series--but, like /Dragon Ball (Z)/, there was a time-skip in the middle, so Part 2 got a separate name for simplicity. Personally, I think nearly all of it's worth watching, except the individual filler episodes and most of the post-timeskip filler arcs. The comedy spin-off anime /Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals/ is also /absolutely hilarious/, and available for free on Hulu [[http://www.hulu.com/naruto-spin-off-rock-lee-and-his-ninja-pals][here]].
