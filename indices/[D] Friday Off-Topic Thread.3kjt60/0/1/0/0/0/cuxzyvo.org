My best theory is that it's almost entirely attributable to a small handful of users who either delete their accounts on a periodic basis, or users who delete their comments after some amount of time has passed. [deleted] also gets a big bump whenever an active user deletes their account; this data is only goes until 8/31/15 and I know that there has been at least one person with hundreds of comments who deleted their account since then.
