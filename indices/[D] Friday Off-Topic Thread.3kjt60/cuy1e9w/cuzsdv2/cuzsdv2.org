I don't have any guides or links, but I'm comfortable putting myself into the likely-Dunning-Krueger-effected category of Intermediate:

I don't remember most logic gate functions off the top of my head, and I can't look at file headers and tell you which magic numbers correlate to which file type, but I can administrate the shit out of a Debian server, know most networking off the top of my head and also built computers too, which is the relevant bit of information here.

I work like 90 hours a week, but PM me any questions you have or link me to a question thread you have and I'll be more than willing to help you out :)
