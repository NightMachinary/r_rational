I used to build PCs for pay. Generally speaking, building a PC lets you use higher quality components that have a lower chance of failure. If you want a desktop and want to spend more than $200 USD, and are willing to invest ~3 hours of research and ~1-2 hours of construction time (imagine making a moderately complex lego construction, but each lego costs $100 so you are very careful) building your own is 100% the way to go.

Here's what I'll need to know to make you a recommendation:

- Budget (and country in which purchases are made)
- Monitor's native resolution, or desired monitor if none owned
- What games to you intend to play? What settings for them?
- What do you intend to use the computer for besides gaming?
- Do you intend to overlock?
- Do you need an operating system?
- Do you need a monitor or any other peripherals as part of your budget?
