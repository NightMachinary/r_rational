I'm not that knowledgeable, but I built my own PC myself, with some help from a friend and [[https://pcpartpicker.com/][this site]] It's really useful because it has a lot of built in features that let you put together a PC build online without knowing all that much. For example, if you select, say, a processor that's incompatible with your motherboard, it will notify you of this. It's still a good idea to double check this sort of thing, but the notifications can really help you do a lot of your primary filtering. It also aggregates products from quite a few popular sites for parts (Newegg, Amazon, etc.) and tracks them. You can even set it so it sends you a notification if a price drops below a threshold you set due to, say, a close out sale, or black friday.

So yea. That site. Is the shit. Once you were done putting it together based on what you wanted, it's really easy to link your build to a friend or helpful redditor. For example, [[http://pcpartpicker.com/user/Kishoto/saved/MMk9TW][here is the PC I built roughly two years ago]]

Feel free to shoot me some basic questions but, as I said, I'm not THAT knowledgeable. I know enough to build one, but I'm not the best by far. I also watched this three part video series( [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPIXAtNGGCw][part 1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls][part 2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxaVBsXEiok][part 3]] ) It's a 2 hour investment, but it's comprehensive as hell, and will definitely help you understand things if you are as clueless as I was when I started

Fun fact, when I finally got all my parts shipped in, and sat down to build, my internet went out, so I was completely unable to reference things mid-build. Took me 4 hours. 30 minutes of that was being convinced I was putting in my processor wrong, because the latch to secure it had to be pressed down SOOO hard, I was scared I was going to crack my motherboard.
