The max score is definitely the most interesting thing there.

I would love to see length of comment against comment score for the max scores (then compare across subreddits).

Why does the max score often disagree, the one on Reddit isn't the same as the one on the spreadsheet. Surprises me how few people are overall negative too.

Is there a way to separate comments into upvoted and downvoted ones? Also if I didn't remove the upvote from my own post my average would be almost double, that's curious.
