Well one developer job I do on three screens. Trust me it's needed. The other one I do is "research" really low bid software prototyping engineering for my school's customer, on my laptop. So I'm probably just waiting to see how the unboxings go when the kickstarter models go out, but I thought it might attract some interest or useful commentary here.\\
I'm cautiously optimistic with the images they have shown of the aluminum model's hinges, but I think the real concern will be how the cabling is routed and or guided with the sliding part, the wiring harness seems to be the most vulnerable faiure point if they are engineering the hinges to allow the screens to be positioned at an angel in two axis. That and it's usually the part that get's skimped on the most to cut costs/ ensure the obsolescence lifecycle imho.
