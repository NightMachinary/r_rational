I've thought down the exact same lines. I don't have anything conclusive other than vague thoughts about community atmosphere and that beyond a doubt the topic (or lack thereof) of the community being big factors, but nothing quantifiable. Figuring out that theory and maximizing towards participation is an itch that's been in the back of my mind for easily a decade now.

I don't know if you have one, but I would like to formally subscribe to your newsletter.
