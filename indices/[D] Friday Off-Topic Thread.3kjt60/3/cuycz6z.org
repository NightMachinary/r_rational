So, for those of us here not following various people on Tumblr, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] has been updating in the last little while. I don't think it's really a good topic for it's own thread - the story is not exactly rationalist fiction at all - but it's very definitely the sort of thing that people reading [[/r/rational]] would probably really really like, and you should check it out if you haven't. Summary: A group of people who knew each other on the internet where they discussed their favourite author's works, gather in person to discuss and attempt an exegesis of his baffling final text, presented in a variety of forms (personal accounts, forum threads, source materials, etc). It's really really good, and is written by nostalgebraist.

I don't know where it's going but it's super interesting, 10/10 story.
