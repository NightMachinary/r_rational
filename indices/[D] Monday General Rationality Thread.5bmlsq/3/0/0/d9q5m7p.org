Happy to have been helpful! Yes, I wouldn't focus on more than 3 habits at a time, with one main and the others as support/slow burner.

One great thing that gives instant happiness is partaking in social activities. Join a gym class or a painting club, doing something together makes you instantly part of a community.

But the first thing for me is the sense of being on a path of long term self improvement.

Also a diet without sugar and few pasta/pizza helps you against brain fog and spikes on your blood level.
