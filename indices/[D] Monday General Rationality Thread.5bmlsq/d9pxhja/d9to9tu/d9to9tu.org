This is the first mention of factions; can you elaborate? I can easily see someone deciding that they'd rather let someone else win than destroy the world. And if there is a faction that means /everyone/ wins, then what's anyone's motivation to oppose them?

How can "Risk" affect the chances of positive/negative outcomes in a game of blackjack? Is there actually a target /range/, instead of a single target?
