I haven't read them but if I'm right in assuming that they're essentially 26 essays, distilling them into videos is going to lead to either (a) a significant loss of content or precision, (b) long, wordy videos unlikely to appeal to the audiences we want to reach, or (c) a very large time investment to achieve the desired accuracy and brevity.

That said, I think it would do wonders for disseminating the ideas into the wider population. A well-made series of videos that avoids coming off as preachy (difficult when covering a topic that can be summed up as "You're thinking like an idiot, here's how not to do that.") would be worth the cost of its creation.
