The Dark Valley of rationality, I think it's called? Where someone knows just enough to better defend their beliefs, but not enough to critically examine them? I had a conversation with a Young Earth Creationist who acknowledged that the reason they reject evolution is that it's antithetical to the Adam and Eve story, which is at the core of the whole original sin concept that makes Jesus's sacrifice make any sense, and since that MUST be true, evolution MUST be false.

They had all the right data and understood the logical consequences of the data, but their priors still made them reject the outcome. So frustrating. It's like watching someone in a maze walk right past the exit because they're afraid of what might be outside.
