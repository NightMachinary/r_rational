I don't think it's hard to convince someone to recognize values dissonance in themselves, institutions, or others that claim to follow a particular belief system. Critical thinking can be easily applied to the practice of an ideology that a person already believes in, since it's just about what they do because of their beliefs. What is hard is to convince someone that their belief system is inherently irrational.

The dominant ideology that's being spread by scientists and social liberals is secular humanism, where you are allowed to believe basically whatever you want so long as you don't do anything obviously stupid or repulsive. Rationality, on the other hand, explicitly promotes atheism because it doesn't distinguish between the physical and metaphysical. That's not going to go over well for a lot of people.
