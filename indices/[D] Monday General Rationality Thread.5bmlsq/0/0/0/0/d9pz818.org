  articles like Outside the Laboratory will repel theists instead of encouraging them to hold more rational beliefs.

I think it's important not to insult people, but I don't think discussions about rationality should hold back the truth, and the truth is that cognitive dissonance from double standards in work/life are a very real psychological phenomenon. It's the kind of thing that actually often prompts people to eventually look into their faith and realize it doesn't match up with their reason.

I'd like to ensure that whatever communication is done reinforces the idea that rationality is a spectrum, and that you're not "barred at the door" if you have religious beliefs. But that isn't the same as denying that all theological beliefs are irrational, and that it's impossible to go all the way to the positive side of the spectrum without reconciling that.
