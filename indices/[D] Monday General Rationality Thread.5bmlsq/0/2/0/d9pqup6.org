I don't think animation would be good. In my experience, the worst way to talk about philosophy is to animate it - it makes things seem kind of unreal. It also puts a hard limit on how long you can make your explanation - the depth of your wallet (or, talent). If we went the minutephysics route instead of the Kurzgesagt route, and went with basic whiteboard drawings, it would be even harder to be taken seriously.

I think the easiest way to do it would be CFAR-style (this topic came up in the thread asking about CFAR effectiveness, IIRC) where we have real locations and real people. The biggest problem with classroom learning, in my opinion, is the fact that it's hard to relate to real world concepts. When people are going into a video series naturally skeptical, that's the kind of image we want to put out. (think Veritasium)

So, when discussing [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/][Hindsight Devalues Science]] you might go to a WWII memorial or museum to make the point clearer.
