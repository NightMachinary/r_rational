That sounds amazing, because people are far more likely to watch a video you link them than read an article.

Plus people could stumble upon it on youtube, getting the information out to lots of people, who would otherwise never have encountered it.

Hell, if you put good animation in the videos, maybe it would even become quite popular outside the crowd the sequences is currently read by.
