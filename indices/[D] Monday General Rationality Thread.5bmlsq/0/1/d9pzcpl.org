It might be best to, as a community, approach existing Youtube channels that are good at this sort of thing and see if they'd be interested in doing an episode here and there. One by CGP Grey, one by Veritasium, one by Smarter Every Day, one by Kurzgesagt, etc. If some crowdfunding is needed to sponsor an episode, that might be doable too.

It might sacrifice uniformity in narration and art style, but it would also increase the awareness of the series, and it would be more likely to be taken up as projects by those youtubers, since it wouldn't completely derail them from doing their own work for months and months.
