  This is the first mention of factions; can you elaborate? I can easily see someone deciding that they'd rather let someone else win than destroy the world. And if there is a faction that means everyone wins, then what's anyone's motivation to oppose them?

This is something I'm still working on, in terms of good incentives for some people to work together without having outright alliances set in stone.

  How can "Risk" affect the chances of positive/negative outcomes in a game of blackjack? Is there actually a target range, instead of a single target?
#+end_quote

The more Risk you have, the higher your chance will be of "busting" by going over the target, while the more Risk reduction cards you have, the better your odds of controlling whether it hits the target or goes below.

As an example, lets say the risk starts at 0%. You have to draw at least three cards from your "deck" of components, and each of the core pieces bring it up by 20%. So you want to have at least 60% of risk management in your deck to try and bring it back down to 0%, and that's only if you're super lucky in draws after the initial 3 and flip 3 more over.

I'm also still trying to work out how to best have that balance out: it's a work in progress, and any suggestions are welcome :)
