I've been doing some thinking recently and I've come to the fairly terrifying conclusion that I don't know how to estimate what a government's utility looks like. What does a government's ultimate goal look like? Is this even a meaningful question, or do I have to think about it in terms of the actual people involved? Is there a certain level at which it's possible to disentangle the individual officeholder's goals from the organization's, like we can for corporations? Halp
