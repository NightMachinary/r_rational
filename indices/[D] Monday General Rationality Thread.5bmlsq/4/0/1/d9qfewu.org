Like Salivanth said, it can often be boiled down to "make money." As an even more specific criterion, my go to is: "to get people/other corporations to opt into whatever thing they produce." Or even simpler, to survive in the market they exist in. Often, that translates to making money. While laws and shareholders' wants sort of constrain a corporation's actual goals, I've found that "maximizing profits at almost any cost" works well as a first-order heuristic.
