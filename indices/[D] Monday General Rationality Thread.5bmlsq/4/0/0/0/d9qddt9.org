A corporation can have a stated goal, and this can sometimes be to make money, but that's not really a given, especially for corporations which are privately owned. And having a stated goal doesn't /at all/ mean that a corporation is working toward that goal, since the corporation is made up of a bunch of laws and a bunch of stakeholders, the former which work against the goal and the latter which have goals different from the nominal goals of the organization.

Edit: That is to say, if you model corporations as having their stated goals, their actions will tend to make very little sense to you.
