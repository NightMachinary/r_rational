I think the government's utility is supposed to be the sum (or average) of the utilities of all of its citizens. A group of people with no government would form a government in order to protect their mutual interests and create laws that break up inefficient games like tragedy of the commons and force the higher outcomes.

Now in practice you might nuance this with things like boundaries that restrict its size and type of activities it is and is not allowed to do in order to achieve these goals to prevent weird paper-clipping behaviors and also to prevent corruption, and maybe you would add some smaller weight to the utility functions of non-citizen humans. But if you were to make a government with an actual utility function, the main function ought to look like a citizen utility maximizer with some smaller side terms.

In practice I think it's actually just some average of the politicians' utility functions. Each politician acts in their own best interests, and the citizens' utility functions are only bootstrapped into that by the desire to get reelected (and possibly some altruism on the part of some politicians).
