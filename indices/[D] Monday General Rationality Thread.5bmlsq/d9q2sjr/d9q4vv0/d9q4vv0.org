I see three of them:

- learning to draw
- learning a new language
- cleaning up your space

Though getting that many habits on at the same time would probably be overwhelming. The most bangs for my bucks for me has been physical exercise, meditation, a new language, and cleaning up.

edit: forgot sleep, [[/u/munchkiner]] reminded me of it below. Sleep goes first (for me).
