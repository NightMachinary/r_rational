I am experimenting new techniques/tools/resources on myself, and I reached a good point to share the results with you. Probably you already know it all, but think about this as a way to start giving back to this awesome community.

*Token Pomodoro*

Everyone probably knows the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gp4/the_power_of_pomodoros/][Pomodoro technique]]. Personally I'm using the [[http://toggl.com][toggl]] Chrome extension. It's mainly used by professionals for tracking time, but you can set it for pomodoro. I have set it so when the 25 minutes are passed it just shpows a popup without sound and continues tracking the time, so I have little distraction if I'm in the zone. Just racing against the time can be a huge motivator, but I am working on an upgraded version.

Shortly if you plan multiple pomodoros during the day you can use physical tokens to track your progress. So for example yesterday I wanted to study german, and set 8 slot as a goal. Every time I completed a pomodoro I put on the table a new coin (I was lucky to have 9 of the same kind), until I finished the fifth and put them on a column with a golden one on top. Gotta hit those reward centers whenever you can! And apropos:

*Gratification*

It's much, much better to reward your brain toward a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/cu2/the_power_of_reinforcement/][positive habit]] than a negative one. If you want to eat less junk food, it's more efficient to focus on learning to cook healthy recipes and establish an "incompatible behavior". So instead of fighting procrastination I have every day a few things I would like to do to push my long term goals, as learning a language or doing exercise. Also is nice to have some "unproductive" activities, like watching a series, ready when you need to relax, instead of just mindlessy browsing.

Remember to congratulate yourself everytime you finish an activity, even if you fall shorter than your initial plans. Guiltiness is your [[http://mindingourway.com/guilt/][enemy]]. Yesterday I ended doing 5 slots instead of the planned 8, but it's much better than the usual 0, ans I felt really good. Of course then you need to analyze what happened to do better next time. Just don't plan thinking to be a machine.

*Fitness*

I'm at level zero for physical ability. I even considered grumpily that working out was a waste of time in the past, compared to intellectual trials. Simply wrong. Just moving give you a great productivity and confidence boost, and is a great opportunity for socializing. I'm now doing the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine][bodyfitness routine]], that's a great start with a readyprogression on the exercises if they gets too easy. You can follow the videos and do probably everything at home. In my experience just starting is much better than waiting until you find the perfect program. I like so much the sense of improvement that I find myself searching a spot to do pushups at work or practicing handstand when at home. Also I have a park near home full of bars and rings, so I discovered the happyness of going there during a sunny day, feeling like a ninja doing training, and meeting other great people exercising there.

I'm also trying to mantaining a [[http://placeofpersistence.com/30-30-squat-challenge-by-ido-portal/][squatting position]], but haven't results to share yet, if not that you feel good after.

*Typing*

#+begin_quote
  Why do many who type for hours a day remain two-finger typists, without bothering with a typing tutor program?^{[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/2p5/humans_are_not_automatically_strategic/][source]]}
#+end_quote

It's a shame form me, but I can't yet touch typing. I started in august [[https://www.typing.com][this program]] until half the intermediate program and then pretty much forgot about it. Since this weekend I'm forcing myself to 10-finger typing (also while writing this, so appreciate the effort!) to get to a decent speed.

*Social skills*

Everyone goes around the world with a continuos mental dialogue about his problems. If you forget for a moment about yours and ask someone about his life, and listen sincerely, you can skip all the boring small talk and get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People][close]] pretty fast.

*Sleep*

Sleep is important. Charging the phone away from my bed have the double benefit that I don't spend hours reading past a sane hour, and when the alarm rings I have to get up from bed.

Also reduce at minimum the lights, even removing simple leds. Try to have complete darkness and throw open the windows as soon as you get up. /Ganbatte!/

*Final words*

I'm not used to writing so much, even less in English. Do you like this format? Think it could be useful? More time I spend here more I feel an itch for writing, and a blog could be a possibility, but still pretty feeble.

Feedbacks (also on the writing) are really appreciated. See you on the [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][Discord server]]!
