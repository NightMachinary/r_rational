Regarding your first sentence, fair enough. I don't really know much about the goals of corporations.

Regarding the rest of the post, while it's definitely true, that's also the more solvable part of OP's problem. If you know what the corporation's goal is, you can examine how the different goals of the individuals making up the corporation (get promoted, don't get fired, don't work too hard, whatever you like) affect the goals of the organisation itself. Hence why he said it was possible to disentangle the individual's goals from the organisation's when studying corporations.

With a government, however, you can't do that at all unless you know what the end goal of the government is supposed to be. That seems to be OP's problem. You can't say "The goal is X, but Y seems to happen because of what individuals want, and that ends up not leading towards X" when you don't know what X is yet.
