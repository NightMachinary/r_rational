I'm on board with this idea, but I think that some editing may be in order for at least some articles to make them more appealing to a wider audience. I didn't care for Yudkowsky's promotion of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, particularly his insistence that it wasn't just his opinion. I'm also one of the people who sided with Robin Hanson in their debate about AI, so EY came across as heavy handed about that too.

What is guaranteed to be controversial, however, will be Yudkowsky's comments on religion as a concept. If we want more people to learn rationality, we probably shouldn't say that true rationalists are all atheists. We should still promote secular humanism, but articles like Outside the Laboratory will repel theists instead of encouraging them to hold more rational beliefs. EY is very smart, but his self righteousness will rub some people the wrong way.
