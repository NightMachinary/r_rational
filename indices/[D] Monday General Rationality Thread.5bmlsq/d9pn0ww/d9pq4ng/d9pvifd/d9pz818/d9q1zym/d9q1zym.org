I agree. The point of half the Sequences was that holding theological beliefs is irrational - and that you can apply this to most of the spectrum of non-evidence based beliefs. It's not wrong to say /all/ organized religion as people practice it is irrational. You can change those beliefs to something more rational, but at that point it stops being religion. Then again, it's really just an argument over definition, and we know how those go.
