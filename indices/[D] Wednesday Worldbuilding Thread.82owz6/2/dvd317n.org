For a while, I've had an idea in my head of a civilization suddenly granted scientific and technological knowledge far beyond their current level of development, basically the Primitive Technology channel on a planetary scale. My initial conception was that of a textbook sent back in time as part of a stable time loop, but it could also be from an outside source.

Say that a planet has a sacred text, that was mysteriously discovered soon after they'd developed a robust enough writing system. The book contains things like diagrammed instructions on metallurgy, basic and advanced chemistry and physics, et cetera, and basically walks them through how to become a powerful civilization without all the clumsy false starts inherent in the scientific method.

How much more quickly could such a civilization develop, if the primary bottleneck were infrastructure and not discovering the core principles and how to apply them? A caveman clearly isn't going to build a nuke in his cave, but if he knew /how/ to build one, how many years of building things to help build stronger things, to in turn build even stronger things, would the tribe need before they're colonizing space?
