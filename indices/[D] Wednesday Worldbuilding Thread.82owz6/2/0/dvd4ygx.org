It's partly a matter of infrastructure, and partly a matter of training. If you've ever followed a very clear and precise set of instructions and bungled it because you didn't have any idea what you were actually doing ... yeah, that kind of thing would be a problem, no matter how idiot-proof the text was. You'd still need divisions of labor and specializations.

Honestly, the biggest hurdle is probably food for a very long time. How many people can a single farmer feed? In medieval times, the answer was "three or four", but the number gets lower and lower as you backward in time, in part because of technology, but also, in part, because of the limited diversity of crops and inefficiency of said crops in delivering calories. The staple crops as they now exist are the products of millennia of selective breeding, which our hypothetical tribe wouldn't have, regardless of what the book said on the matter, not without a lot of time and effort spent growing crops and selectively breeding them. Same goes for domesticating animals.

And the other big bottleneck, which is only partially infrastructure, is the matter of urban concentrations and the logistics and politics of getting food and materials to them. But I'm not sure how much that's within the scope of the book -- people know how to do all this stuff, but they don't necessarily have a reason to, not if the primary beneficiary is going to be the king who's taxing everyone to within an inch of their lives.

(My rough guess, depending on what crops, animals, and materials are available, is that it would be doable in a few hundred years, less if there was absolute dedication to the task, more if there were development traps or other unforeseen consequences. Overtaxation by a tyrant king who has the means to prevent anyone from advancing (though they have the knowledge) and the incentive to do so is one example, but another, less grim one is that effective contraception is developed which limits the size of a society and thus, the resource chains that it can support).
