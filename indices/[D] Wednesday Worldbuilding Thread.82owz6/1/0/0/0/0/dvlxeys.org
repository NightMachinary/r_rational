I feel kind of torn about it.

On the one hand, I do prefer to tear out all the troublesome elements that I'm not really interested in exploring in a world; it would feel weird to have an incidental genocide going on in the background of a romance if it's not touched on or explained very much, or in any way central to the plot. In that way a lot of things get shuffled to the side, or justified in some way as not being a problem in /this/ world.

But on the other hand, it can feel like white-washing history, in a "wasn't medieval England great?" kind of way. It's not even just about /history/, it's about /people/ and how they relate to one another, which forms the basis of the sexual and racial inequality that's so incredibly prevalent through the course of human history. I'm of the opinion that human history happened the way it did for reasons, and those reasons are half down to stupid brain biology, and half down to structural forces at work. Ignoring those or justifying them away seems ... wrong, somehow, like it's shying away from what it means to be human, because it feels better to do that. (I still do it, because it's not always a bear that I want to wrestle with, but I do sometimes think that I'm short-changing some particular element of how worlds actually work.)

All that said, /this/ particular project is meant to be /about/ the entrenched systems and structural forces, and in part is about how a movement can fail by addressing the wrong things, or how people miss the forest for the trees when crusading, and shying away from issues of gender inequality in a society that revolves around a male-coded and male-advantaged activity like armed combat feels doubly wrong. (Which is not to say that I think it's going to be a novel that's about gender equality, just one that takes place in a society which thinks it's equal but is manifestly not to anyone paying attention, in a way that hopefully reinforces the more direct themes of rich/poor and how power structures perpetuate themselves.)
