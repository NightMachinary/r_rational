It's something that's been true for all of recorded history. Also, while dreaming life is considered better than waking life, it has the flaw that nothing exists that the dreamer didn't chose to create. It's only in the waking world that one can learn new things, actually interact with other people, and deal with the unknown.

You can do anything you want in the dream, but the dream is limited by what you already know, if that makes sense?
