It's not that people are stimulating the real world in their dreams, but rather that they are only aware of what's needed to create the experience. For example, let's say you are going swimming. The dream will stimulate the sensation of cool water splashing on you, the fluid dynamics of the water (or just what our intuitions expect), and the taste of the water.

Understand the dream doesn't follow reality; only our intuitions/desires. For instance, if people think water is compressible then water will compress in the dream when in reality water is actually [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hammer][imcompressible]].
