I would say that the dreams are limited by brain power, but not as much as you would think. In a dream, things only last as long as needed. So if you are exploring a cave, then the cave system would only last until the dreamer has passed through it. Once the dreamer has cleared a room without the intention to go back, then it would dissolve away. Basically yes you are limited by brain power, but the brain is pretty efficient and good at giving a convincing illusion of limitless space and unexplored realms in your dreams.
