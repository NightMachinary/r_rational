I think you'd get at least a subset of people who treated the waking world as the worse of the two, and who treated their mundane waking life as being, essentially, a distraction, or a necessity that had to be endured. In bad times, this subset would likely be a majority. For those people, drugs that induced sleep would be common, and they would only put the minimum amount of effort into the waking world, enough to let them get from dream to dream.

As a reaction to that, you would have stories, social norms, etc. that frame the dreams as /bad/, or as seductive tools of demons, or as places where you need to not indulge yourself. Because of sociocultural survival of the fittest, I'd expect cultures with a strong "anti-dream" mentality to be the dominant ones; they're the ones that are getting things done in the real world, building up forces, feeding the masses, engaging in education, etc. This might be different if it wasn't from the start of human history, because in the modern era it's possible to get work done while in your hypelucid dreams, but for most of human history, that wasn't the case. The things that needed to be done needed to be done /while awake/, because they were almost all manual labor of one kind or another.

Once people can do productive things with their dreams, i.e. intellectual labor, I think you would see a focus on memorization and visualization, and something like "dream accountability", where you have to report the results of your dream-work to someone. This is a social tool that helps with competition between societies; those where labor takes place an extra eight hours a day would be vastly more productive than in those where it doesn't. I'm not sure exactly what that would look like -- dream confessions to a superior? A measuring of output with standards that can only be reached by working in your dreams? I'm also not sure what the limits of work would be, with training, and how best to capitalize on what's possible within those limits.

I would think a lot of art and culture would be "dream fodder", that is, designed such that you can adapt it into your lucid dreams, rather than being a proper story in its own right, or in /addition/ to being a story in its own right. I'd think that you would get media that were essentially worldbuilding documents, supplying all the instructions necessary for a unique and interesting time in your dreams.
