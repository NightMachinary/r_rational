Well given that humans enjoy fresh experiences, and you can only dream what you know, every second of people's waking existences could be dedicated to increasing world-wide exposure to new ideas. After being educated, humans could be divided into jobs such as information gatherers, information categorizers, and of course information distributors. Life would become the densest possible flood of maximum marginal surprise. Algorithms could be devised to tailor people's information diets to whatever would have the best chance of exposing people to something they couldn't think up on their own. Pharmaceutical companies would compete to create drugs that would artificially elongate sleep cycles. Work would become increasingly important as the only source of social interaction that would have a chance at competing against the wonders of sleep, since families and friends couldn't match the fantasy and work would at least provide people with resources to support their sleeping selves. Slowly, as automation took over, more and more people would retreat into eternal dream chambers to experience the high forever - perhaps being woken up every week for a few hours of dream-enhancing knowledge boosts.
