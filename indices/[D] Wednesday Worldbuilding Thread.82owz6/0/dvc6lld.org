Random idea: There is a world where people are exactly the same as to us in every way except for how they dream. In their dreams, they are perfectly lucid with incredible powers of visualization and focus. They can dream about worlds and situations however they like as god-like tyrants, adventurers exploring marvels of nature, scenes with the perfect woman/man, and more. With the best possible dreams and the waking world being the same as ours, how would their society develop?
