What I mean is, I am not convinced people are capable of simulating any universe with much more vividness than dreams in our world in real time. That is, assuming the experiences in the dream feel real and hold up to scrutiny while entirely under a human's control with no lag or time constraint (unless I am misinterpreting things), I don't think that brainpower is a constraint on the dreams.
