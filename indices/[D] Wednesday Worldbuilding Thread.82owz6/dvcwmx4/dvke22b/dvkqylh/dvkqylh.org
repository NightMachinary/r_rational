I'm not sure that I have the gender politics of the setting fully worked out yet.

/Currently/, I have it at about an 80/20 gender split in favor of boys. Equal rights at this point in the society basically means "women can participate on equal footing in contests and in institutions which inherently favor men". In the case of trial-by-combat, the average woman has a disadvantage against the average man, mostly because of issues of height, reach, and muscle mass, not to mention the issue of pregnancy. Entrance of girls into the battle school is, to some extent, a political move on a few levels, none of which are all that great for the girls, or in the sense of /actual/ equality:

- Girls are there more to build political alliances than to learn how to fight
- Girls are there more to find or advertise for a marriage than to learn how to fight
- Girls are there because even with the characteristically large families, some of the families have only girls, or only one boy, necessitating one of them to pick up the slack as far as trial-by-combat goes
- Girls enter into battle school if they're toward the end of a few bell curves (the best of the best)

That being the case, I'd think that a lot of girls would take a year at battle school and then wash out, simply because it's not expected that they stay in, and because their interests can be served with only a single year there. I kind of like this from a setting perspective, since it underlines a lot of the themes and issues that I want underlined, namely the power of entrenched institutions and customs to perpetuate a system that only the people in power are really happy with (and maybe not even then).

But on the other hand, there's the question of "if this is what the boys are doing, what are the girls doing?" If they /don't/ go to battle school, as a general rule, where do they go to get hammered into the society-shape they're expected to be in? Having children aside, and the running of a household being something that's largely taken care of by the people you hire, what role do women play? Which I've got a few ideas for, but am still trying to hammer out, since there's both division of labor and practical arrangements to work out (architecture, engineering, arts, science, medicine, management, planning, religion, etc.) and burdens to be placed.
