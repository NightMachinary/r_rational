Exactly what I came to say: I keep forgetting to catch up on Subnormality, then do a binge that reminds me all over again how shamefully obscure it is. It's hard to get people into comics that are so imposingly large, but as far as webcomics go, it's up there with the best of the best, even if it's not a "funny" one like xkcd or smbc, or even Dresden Codak.
