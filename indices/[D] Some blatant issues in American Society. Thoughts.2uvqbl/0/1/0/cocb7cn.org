  66% of Sweden is in one Church.[1]

This is so, but the OP was referring to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch][*these*]], using 'Church' in the "a building used for public Christian worship" sense rather than the "a particular Christian organization, typically one with its own clergy, buildings, and distinctive doctrines" sense.

The OP wasn't referring to just the excessive /religiosity/ of Americans, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch#Criticism]["the application of corporate business models"]] to religion.

This would be a valid counterpoint to the OP if he had said this:

#+begin_quote
  If America is the only member to do it differently, it might bear further examination.
#+end_quote

Rather than this:

#+begin_quote
  If *more than two thirds* do it in a certain way, and America does it differently, and particularly if America is the only member to do it differently, it might bear further examination.
