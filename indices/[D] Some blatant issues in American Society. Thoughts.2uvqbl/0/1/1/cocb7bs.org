Uh... Swede here. Yeah, 66% of us are technically members of the "Church of Sweden", but most of us have no religious beliefs, and a very small fraction of those members ever go to church except for weddings, funerals and graduation ceremonies. Until the year 2000 you were born into the church as long as your parents were members and didn't object, but religion is not exactly a hot button issue here. It's similar to the Church of England.

We certainly don't have anything like Mega Churches. We have other problems, like accepting immigrants and then leaving them unemployed in our suburbs in great concentrations where there isn't much opportunity for them to integrate into society, but Mega Churches most certainly isn't one.
