  For examples, look at how other members of the G20 or G30 do it. If more than two thirds do it in a certain way, and America does it differently, and particularly if America is the only member to do it differently, it might bear further examination.

Unfortunately for USAians, there are a surprising amount of issues handled one way, or somewhere on one spectrum of ways, by most G20 countries, and an entirely different way in the United States for the sole reason that America refuses to ever enact /anything/ by a clean move from one state to another, instead preferring to force itself to occupy every single possible intermediate state along the way.

Which also means that where a "hole" or other discontinuity in the topological state-space of policies occurs, America /never/ manages to make the jump /at all/.

You know, like parliamentary democracy, or public funding for elections, or regulatory bodies that /actually do something/.
