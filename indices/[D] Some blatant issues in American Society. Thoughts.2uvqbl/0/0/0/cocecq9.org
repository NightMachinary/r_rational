Yeah, but the United States is a collection of states with their own independent constitutions and governments. The founding document deliberately makes it hard for federal changes to happen, and the whole thing is sort of held together with bits of wire so that it will actually work.

In my opinion, the United States of America is more analogous to the European Union than it is to any one other country. People keep referencing America as this monolithic thing, but it was never built to behave like a country in its own right. Giant swaths of federal policy are held together with the interstate commerce clause and some court decisions. And this is probably never going to change, because of Constitutional fetishism.
