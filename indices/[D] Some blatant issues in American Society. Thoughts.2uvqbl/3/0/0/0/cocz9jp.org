  Maybe we are the least worst option,

No. Sorry, but no. That would imply that neither Germany, Australia, Canada nor any similarly rich-but-not-American country is the least-worst option. I'd have to run a bunch of numbers to nominate a specific candidate, but for a simple heuristic, who's got the lowest infant mortality rates, the highest scientific literacy, and the longest expected lifespans? It isn't the USA!
