Speaking about western democracy in general.

And even then it may just be that we have had the longest time to get rich, off the backs of colonial subjugation. The rest of the world is catching up pretty fast. Will be interesting to see what form of social structure can overtake the legitimately amazing gains in health, wealth and security we have achieved.

On that note, even taking USA as the worst of the best on many measures, it is still orders of magnitude better than the best of the best a few generation earlier.

I think "best achieved to date" is fair, but golly there is a way to go.
