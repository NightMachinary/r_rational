Sexism, racism, classism all heavily institutionalized. Nationalism/patriotism held as a virtue and taught to children. Regulatory capture. Poverty traps. Widespread harm inflicted on non human life for no good reason other than inertia. Environmental pillaging. The exportation of suffering to fuel growth. The apathy to horrendous but solvable ills in the world, like famine and preventable disease. The deification of gut thinking and the sneering dismissal of careful deliberative thought.

The fact that /every fucking thing/ in our society is a competition, when most social games can be set up to be positive sum. The fact we even see competition as an inherent good, rather than a social tool like any other.

Maybe we are the least worst option, but it staggers me that [[/u/eaturbrainz]] was downvoted in this sub for that comment.
