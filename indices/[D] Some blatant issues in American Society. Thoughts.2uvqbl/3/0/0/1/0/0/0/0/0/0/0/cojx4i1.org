Oh. That isn't how the word is used.

Institutional means "practice of the institution".

For example when we call increasing rates of death in hospital that can't be explained by a single person an "institutional failing". It was never written by hospital management that more people should die.

edit: just remembered you didn't want to debate definitions. That is fine, just the way you were using it sounds dismissive, which is important in this context.
