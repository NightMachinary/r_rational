True. But exclusive in what way? It makes sense for them to be difficult, intellectually. Based on what universities want, you want the smartest people around. But the high price can be more than daunting for a lot of people. Also, not helping the problem, is the non-standardization of high schools. Billy Joe from Middle Montana High School, from a class of 14, can't compete with Joe Vandervilt from the high end magnet school that costs $10,000 a year. If given the same opportunity, school wise, it's quite possible for Billy Joe to have more raw talent than Vandervilt. But you'd never know.
