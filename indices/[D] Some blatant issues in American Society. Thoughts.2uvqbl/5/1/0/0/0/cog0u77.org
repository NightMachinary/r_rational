That's the thing, where i come from at least there are colleges which are cheap and extremely hard, yet they are not -nearly- as good in getting you into a high paying job... so the exclusivity must have "value" for the employers by itself. I find that to be irrational, but a lot of human behaviors are irrational..

Also it is still possible that one of the reasons that expensive and prestigious places are so well linked into high paying job is the connections you make during your time there, specifically your links to high socioeconomically positioned people. Snd said people will usually prefer to go to more expensive places just to differentiate themselves from "low class" people...
