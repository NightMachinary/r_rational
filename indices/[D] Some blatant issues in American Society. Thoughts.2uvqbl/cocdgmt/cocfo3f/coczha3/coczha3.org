All the things [[/u/rumblestiltsken]] said. But wait, there's more! The United States makes an ideological fetish of a bloody-minded refusal to solve problems in any way /except/ hill-climbing via small steps from the status quo. It is, in effect, a nation of people who don't believe in evolution, and yet refuse to use anything smarter than blind evolution to optimize their own society.

Then let's add:

- Configuring the economy to maximize rents and financial pseudo-profits rather than industrial and informational productivity.
- The competition fetish has given America a /death and suffering/ fetish. To wit, you are talking about a nation which, when given the option to house the homeless cheaply or jail them expensively, often chooses the latter. Ditto ditto on many cases of the sick lacking health insurance), and /triple ditto/ on the War on Drugs versus legalization (or /at least/ a repeal of mandatory sentencing laws and partial decriminalization, leaving it to the good judgement of /trained professional judges/ how to deal with offenders). I repeat, much of the country sincerely believes the cheap and efficient way of keeping order is /just too damned altruistic/.
- Basic science on ecological issues is treated as tribal and political. COME ON, PEOPLE! GAME CALLED ON ACCOUNT OF EXTINCTION RISK!
- The perverse act of trying to educate more and more scientists and engineers and then /leaving free productivity on the table/ by refusing to actually /employ/ them at any reasonable rate. America brain-drains the rest of the world to fuel its research laboratories, and then tosses out the large supermajority of those trained researchers once /actually proven themselves competent/ by getting their PhDs.
- Treating double-digit percentages of the population as /discarded stock/ by keeping them in both urban and rural ghettos, neither training nor educating them nor making them productive in /any way at all/, but still paying large sums of money to beat them up for feeling bad about it.

These are just the ones that come to mind for me. I think points (2) and (3) are /actually/ the strong ones, really.

My overall complaint is: America really seems to think it has no problems that need solving, nor glories that beckon, larger than bickering over whether Teslas or Hummers are nicer. As a matter of fact, there are both important problems to tackle around the world /and/ awesome glories to be reached, and running an entire society as a single overgrown status contest /instead of handling all those problems and glories/ is just a little too "pre-evolved" for me.

Simple thought experiment, right out of the LW imagination: imagine Fnargl has some goal he wants accomplished, on the scale of a new Manhattan Project. How does he do it? Well, why do we keep /deliberately choosing/ to run our society more stupidly and /even less humanely/ than Fnargl would?
