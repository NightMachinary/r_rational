For your first point: do you allow a child to choose it's own bed time? Or how many sweets it should have?

I more-or-less agree with the rest. The problem with having group power though is what happens when the leaders disagree - either no action is taken, or actions are not all pulling in the same direction. See the problems caused by whole countries swinging from 'left' to 'right' every electoral term.

By the way I don't think what I'm (halfheartedly) proposing is necessarily plausible, I just think it has some benefits.
