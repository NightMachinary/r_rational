  For your first point: do you allow a child to choose it's own bed time? Or how many sweets it should have?
#+end_quote

There really ought to be some point at which you /do/. Otherwise, the child only ever learns about bed-time or limited quantities of sweets as Parental Commands, rather than as necessary ways of heading off such undesirable consequences as falling asleep at mid-day or getting sick to one's stomach (or getting obese, but unfortunately modern parenting seems to accomplish /nothing/ to stop that).
