I guess the best way to draw the lines for national security is to make the assumption that a dedicated and funded group would seek to use any piece of information that is released in a harmful manner, then try to figure out how much damage they could do with knowing the budget/development plans/etc for any given proposal. You'd have quite a bit of the process of making new laws regarding people interacting with each other getting through (so abortion, discrimination laws, stem cell research, gun control, stuff like that), but I doubt discussions of public roads/buildings, or planning for events would be allowed through, just on the basis of how much damage a few people with wildly different utility functions can do.

I've always wondered why elections weren't handled by an independent governmental division. Something with no allegiance to the party system whatsoever. Allow all the private funding you want, but the funding goes towards a specific election in a specific riding/district/whatever, not to a specific candidate. So if you wanted to support Governor X or Congressman Y, you would donate to their specific election fund, which is used to pay for the ads of both (or all, if you live in a multi-party system) parties. That way, you get private funding (though admittedly probably far less so, since you couldn't outright buy politicians, but on the plus side, /you can't outright buy politicians/) and can still have a much more balanced coverage of the issues, which would mean the candidates would have to win on the strength of their policies or their personalities, not their ad campaign. The third party agency would make the ads, book the ad time, and generally run the campaigns for both/all parties, and any other interference /coughcoughadsbySuperPACscoughcough/ would be illegal. One of the major issues I can see with this method would be the introduction of new parties, though this presents less of an issue in the States.
