Yeah, these are problems you would need to work out. I think if people got used to being able to look up politicians going to the bathroom they would lose interest fairly quickly, so we'd be rid of that problem. Similarly with national security things it probably wouldn't be easy to work out where the lines should be drawn. I suspect it would have come down to a binding national vote. I obviously don't have finished proposals, I just think these would be good directions to go in.

For public financing, the way I usually hear it you would only finance people and parties based on their results in the previous election, while leaving it legal to fund parties that do not have any power (Although you'd stop them from keeping money gained before one election to use in future elections). I have no idea what to do about Primaries, since that's not something we do in Sweden.
