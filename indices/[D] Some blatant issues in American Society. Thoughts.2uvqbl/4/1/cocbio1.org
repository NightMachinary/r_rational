I don't think moving away from democracy is the way to go, but certainly things could be done much better. I think democracy would work much better if, for one thing, we forced all full time politicians to wear cameras that recorded what they do all day. They'd be allowed to turn them off to go to the toilet or if for some reason there was a genuine national security reason, etc, and the lines would have to be argued about, but just killing privacy for politicians I think would go a long way towards making it easier for people to see who they are. It would also require a pretty transparent bureaucracy, obviously.

Other measures could include forbidding legislators and regulators from working /for/ the companies they have worked /with/, as well as having publicly financed elections and a complete ban on receiving political donations once you qualify for such support.
