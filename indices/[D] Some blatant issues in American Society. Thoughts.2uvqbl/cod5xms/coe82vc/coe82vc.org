Agreed, universities, at least initially, were definitely more about learning. But the way society is currently leaning, it's much easier to get a good paying job when you have some sort of degree(s).

There are many jobs that won't even consider you unless you have, at minimum, a bachelor's. And most of the highest paying, standardized jobs (not counting professions such as celebrities and certain CEO's) in the country involve having some sort of degree. College, initially, was indeed set up to promote higher learning, and there's still a lot of that going on, don't get me wrong. But it's also the best way to succeed, on average, in our current society.

EDIT: The issue here is that the job sectors of our society have shifted, ensuring that getting a high paying job is difficult to impossible without a degree. It's not necessarily the college's fault, but it IS how things are currently set up. And due to the ever increasing automation of unskilled labor, it's unlikely that creating well paying jobs for the average Joe isn't looking good. Hence my desire for the school system to shift, allowing for a greater number of people to go to decent schools without breaking the bank, or sinking themselves into debt.
