  And some people may say "Oh, go to a community college, they're cheap!" but then you have to look at how much worse off you are in competing for jobs, depending on where you graduate from.

Aren't universities\colleges supposed to teach as opposed to provide better jobs? I mean sure that is a good added benefit you get as a result of getting a degree, but i got the impression that was never supposed to be the main benefit. Because if you assume that a job is the priority i think the curriculum should probably be changed anyway.
