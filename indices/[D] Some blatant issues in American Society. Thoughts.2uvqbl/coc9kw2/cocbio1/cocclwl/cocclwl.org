The trouble with "cameras that could be turned off to go to the toilet" is that then whenever politicians want to do smoke-filled-room type things, they will hold those meetings in bathrooms.

The trouble with "for a genuine national security reason" is that if you allow anyone with any stake in the issue to classify what "national security" is, the scope of "national security" will be steadily expanded to ensure their job security. Furthermore, the act of obtaining a national security clearance (to be able to be a person who can judge what is a national secret) is itself a process that creates stakeholders: the people who can decide what the classification level is for information themselves have clearances and are in well-paying national security jobs. Which puts us right back at the beginning.

Publicly financed elections are a good idea, I think, on the average - the main trouble is that then you have a sensitivity/specificity problem on the lower side. Yes, the main Democratic and Republican parties (this post was labeled for American issues, so I'll keep assuming American perspective) will field candidates who are shoo-ins for getting money, but what about third parties? How do you set the third party bar low enough to be responsive to new upswellings of public sentiment, while high enough to not give money to frivolous campaigns?

I'm not disagreeing with the general direction of your suggestions, but there's a decent amount of exploitability here that needs to be grappled with - or at least acknowledged - before I'm willing to declare them the best of all ideas.
