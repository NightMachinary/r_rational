An interesting observation! Of course, a benevolent dictatorship has nothing on a benevolent democracy (or similar) where everybody can agree on the bestest, most benevolentiest leaders to run the country by general agreement and the system is innately resistant to usurpation (due to it's aforementioned "benevolence" attribute). But let's not abandon our inferior non-benevolent democracy just yet! We've still got to examine the very best and most effective of governments: The benevolent anarchy! This is where everything just works out because everyone is already benevolent and government is unneeded in any form. The most effective solution to your government woes.
