Parents can be benevolent and are consider dictators for a good part of their child's life, but that doesn't mean they always know what is best for their children.

So I think it would be better to have a benevolent, mentally flexible dictator who has both the resources, time and cause to always strive towards making a best choice.

Ideally it would be a group of dictator/best buddies. People who can make decisions but have enough persons around them, with whom they share trust, ideals and power.
