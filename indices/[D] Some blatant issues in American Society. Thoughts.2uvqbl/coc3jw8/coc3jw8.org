For examples, look at how other members of the G20 or G30 do it. If more than two thirds do it in a certain way, and America does it differently, and particularly if America is the /only/ member to do it differently, it might bear further examination.

For example, the concept that health insurance and employers should ever be allowed to have anything to do with each other, instead of being kept as far away from each other as possible.

Or the concept of having prices in stores which are not what you pay at the register, because that would generally be considered fraud.

Or the use of imperial measurements.

Or medical treatment not being free to all, thus meaning that the citizenry don't need to actually worry about it constantly.

Or 'news' channels which are effectively pure lies and propaganda being (a) allowed to exist in the first place, and (b) being allowed to call themselves 'news'.

Or megachurches.

Or the lack of a national education curriculum.

Or the blithe acceptance of the existence of American military bases in other countries, without corresponding foreign military bases on American soil. Is there any argument whatsoever which could justify this other than "America is #1 and the best and you have to do what we say or we bomb you"?
