"Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia. The reason our current system isn't a utopia is that it wasn't designed by humans." -[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]]

so pick a specific issue.

healthcare? easy. it's expensive because it's not regulated- hospitals can charge whatever they like, which results in huge price-gouging. a procedure that costs an arm and a leg (pun intended) in one hospital can be relatively inexpensive in another hospital just down the street. regulate the system to decrease costs, and people wouldn't /need/ insurance to afford healthcare.

education? even easier. teacher's unions enforce tenure after only one year in good standing. this increases costs while decreasing effectiveness- the exact opposite of what we want. eliminate teacher's unions and tenure in elementary through high schools. this will also allow us to have better control to implement further corrections.

the problem is, these solutions assumes a ruling authority with god-like power to change things unquestioned. this is not true.
