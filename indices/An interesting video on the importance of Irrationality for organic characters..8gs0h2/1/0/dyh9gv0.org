I think it's more than just an argument for realism in fiction. One of the points here appears to be that people don't make good decisions when facing unfamiliar situations they are not prepared to handle.

Most choices people make are based on heuristics rather than decision theory. For important decisions people will take their time and figure out the best thing to do; something like buying a home. And when rushed... decisions tend to get pretty bad. If you've ever been on the receiving end of a hard-sell you'll know how effective a timer can be.

From a rationalist point of view, you really can't expect a person going into these unfamiliar and stressful situations to make good choices. If they do anyways, like sometimes happens in rationalish fiction, the character begins to look rather unbelievable and suspension of disbelief is shattered. And if these sorts of scenarios aren't showing up, then the character probably isn't being pushed far enough and they end up being too powerful for the story (or maybe the antagonist is underpowered relative to the hero).
