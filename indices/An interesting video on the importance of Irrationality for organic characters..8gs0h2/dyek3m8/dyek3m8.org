This seems like apologetics to me. It's an attempt at generalized deconstruction of why stories in film operate the way they do rather than actual advice on how to produce quality stories.

It's the tired old "realism" argument, where something is supposed to be satisfying because it's accurate rather than because it's interesting or revealing or drives the story forward. Sure, in retrospect there can be some justification and even emotional resonance in such moments. This analysis of Green Room is just such an example.

At the same time, I prefer to watch capable people triumph over other capable people because their knowledge and experience allow them to succeed. Good luck one achieves by being informed and prepared is a lot more satisfying than good luck one achieves by accident.

Cathartic sympathy inspired by the suffering of the hapless is effective, but their success through rash action or luck isn't something I can realistically hope for in my own life. It's bad behavior that should be (and usually is) punished by the grim crushing weight of reality.
