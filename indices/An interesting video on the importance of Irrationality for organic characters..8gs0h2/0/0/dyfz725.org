This right here is good.

I read a lot of rat fic that fails to remember these things and rat fic fans judges things a bit overly harshly.

But I also read a lot of fiction where people bemoan how a character acts like a robot who is more or less behaving like I have in comparable situations.

So as often comes to be, human beings are a lot more diverse then readers will imagine.
