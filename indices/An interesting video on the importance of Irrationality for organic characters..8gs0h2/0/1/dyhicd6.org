  Don't get me wrong- most movies are dumb. Characters there make stupid decisions for no other reason than to drive the plot.

Exactly. That's really the issue that "rational" fic IMHO deals with, not stupidity in general but /plot induced/ stupidity, the so called "Idiot Ball". In the end, rational fic, especially fanfiction, is a form of satire. Its purpose is to highlight how much plot induced stupidity drives certain stories by showing what would happen without it. Yes, you can end up with the exact opposite - as you said, realistic or not, battles of masterminds are /fun/. But that's not the core of it, the core is showing how much potential can lie for example in a given world building that isn't explored because the author didn't bother. A character being stupid or irrational is one thing, a character being /conveniently and selectively/ stupid or irrational quite another. Sometimes in fact you ought to do the opposite - have your character act irrationally even when a bit of rationality would make the story simpler because that's just what /they/ would do.
