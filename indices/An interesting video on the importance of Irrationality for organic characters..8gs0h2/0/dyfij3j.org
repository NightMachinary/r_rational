I enjoy the idea that's presented, and think that the criticism on it is a bit too harsh.

For one, author didn't praise every movie that has 'irrational' characters in it. Not every movie uses irrationality well, as shown by Prometheus. A scientist shouldn't touch the space cobra, that's dumb. He's a trained, rational person who faces a possibly hostile, alien fauna.

But when a bunch of scared, free-spirited teenagers are confronted with a mortal danger, they behave like monkeys with guns? Okay, that's believable. Oh, and the pseudo-soldiers are scared of people who behave so recklessly? Yep, those are people alright.\\
It wasn't even an improbable victory- only /two/ of those kids survived.

Don't get me wrong- most movies are dumb. Characters there make stupid decisions for no other reason than to drive the plot.\\
But on the other end of the spectrum, we have rational chess-masters, making perfectly correct decision in blink of an eye, having elaborate monologues in middle of the action. That can be entertaining, but it's very far from human.

It doesn't even require a person to make dumbass decisions to be "organic".\\
Let me just write a few hypothetical movie scenarios:

- A poor guy is running through the woods, escaping a bloodthirsty monster. You see a cabin in the distance, but know that a road is not that far away.\\
  Let's assume that after a long discussion we'd all come to a conclusion- run to the road, cabin is a death trap.\\
  What did the tired, scared, wounded, dirty and overall exhausted man do? He chooses the cabin, cause it's "safety", even if for a moment. For all we know, the man forgot about the road in his extremely limited state of mind.

- A middle aged woman wakes is abruptly woken up, her loved ones chained in front of her. Her choice? She has two buttons, killing either of her children. The clever viewers we are, we'll notice that she doesn't /have to/ press /any/ of the buttons. In fact, the cruel villain would gloat about this very fact, as she mourns the child she needlessly killed.\\
  Shock, fear, worry, facing a new and bizzare situation. Lots of information to take in. And unlike us, reclining in our chairs, sipping a hot beverage of choice, she's not in such an open state of mind. Rules lawyering is not the first choice when someone puts a deadly ultimatum in front of you, first thing in the morning.

Okay, so those were /dumb/, but /believable/ decisions. Certainly not smart enough for you, rational readers, starved for intelligent heroes.\\
So how about a decision that's 'locally optimal'? It makes sense when you made it, and maybe it even worked, but regretted it soon after.

- Horrid alien creatures appeared on a farmer's neighborhood. He's taken by surprise, as they enter his house. Quickly identifying their /unique/ senses (let's say focusing on electromagnetic), he whips up a number of clever distractions, and ultimately outmaneuvers them by locking them in his basement! All well and good, but his dog was sleeping there, since his doghouse got wrecked the day before...\\
  A successful mission, except simple forgetfulness took it's price.

- A boy is locked in a barn with a crazed murderer! The door is locked and the key is nowhere to be found! Desperate, our hero brings his car and /barrels/ through the door! With some difficulty, boy gets rescued, and the duo drives away. Car was ravaged, but is still functional. As it turns out, the key was in our hero's jacket. It was a /looong day/.\\
  "Where did I leave my keys?" is a lot more stressful question when lives are on stake. In this case, the search was discontinued in favor of a faster, if a bit reckless, solution.

What I want to say is- characters can make their own decisions that are flawed, but meaningful to the plot all the same.\\
We don't really need geniuses. Even an idiot would do, if he used his brain in the first place.
