If your only example of what portrays a "realistic teenager talking" is the featuring of some specific "teenspeak" vocabulary, I'm afraid that doesn't explain much of what the problem you're talking about is.

I don't know... The "alleged" you put in there makes me understand that the problem is not so much that teenspeak is being used but that it's badly done... which, if it's the only problem, goes back at the origin of your reaction and implies that the organic writing isn't the problem at all.
