The video made a good point about believable mistakes at the beginning. Other than that, I'm not sure it has much value. The examples don't really seem very compelling beyond their novelty. This is especially true of his description of the green room, where the leader of a hate group is said to behave rationally.

Of course, this might be a bias on my part, since I don't consider the idea of a hate group member behaving intelligently to be very likely. Further, in my experience, people in hate groups tend to be dumb and emotional. (I live in bumblefuck nowhere U.S. so I've met plenty of racists.)
