Oh, on that note, I did want to apologize too for any part I had in fomenting the aggression and panic that happened as a result of the update. Though I was threadbanned before it dropped, and I was legitimately upset, it was not my intention to upset anyone. I'd intended to put this inthread once my ban was either rescinded or expired, but faflec's relayed comment warranted my own.
