I hope that they decide to lift the ban and let you back in; you're an active player with good ideas and nigh-always positive contributions to the community. That said, I wouldn't get your hopes up. The violations of rules 3 and 4 are arguable, but your post was almost a literal cut-n-paste from the "don't do this" list under rule 2.
