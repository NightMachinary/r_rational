Sorry if it wasn't clear, but it was meant as a little joke at how I have to keep checking for any new non-canon chapters whenever there's an update and how it was exaggerated today with 4 new omakes for me to read. It's such a minor issue that nothing needs to be done.

I wasn't actually aware of the ex-canon chapter Velorien wrote when I made my post, so I wasn't referencing it at the time of my post.

Carry on being such a wonderful writer!
