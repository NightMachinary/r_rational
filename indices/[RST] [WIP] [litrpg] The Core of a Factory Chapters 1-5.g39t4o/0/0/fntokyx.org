Very interesting story!

Recently been binging on Last Angel, so it's rather nice having an intelligent AI protagonist that isn't hell-bent on murdering a bunch of (deserving) people, but instead just a newly sapient being trying to figure out what to do with itself after everything it has ever known is long since gone.

My main complaint is that while telling us the size of the hangar, you switch from *meters* to *feet*. Switching between two different measurement systems can be confusing and doesn't make sense from the point of view of the AI. If anything, it would be rather specific about using a precise measuring system, as it's very /purpose/ is to create things that are precisely sized and shaped.
