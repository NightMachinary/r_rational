Yes! Definitely a trope I am deconstructing.

  My main complaint is that while telling us the size of the hangar, you switch from meters to feet.

Ooooff I actually caught that in my review-reading this morning. Total slip of the finger. Both were meant to be in meters (an issue of living in country that uses feet all the time, even if I am thinking in metric I still accidentally say inches instead of centimeters and feet instead meters; I am considering writing a linting script to prevent me from doing that again (and other common mistakes I have caught myself making)). I had been hoping I would be able to correct it before anyone noticed...

Thanks for catching it though! (I am glad someone was willing to call me on it) The entire universe is meant to be metric (let alone the AI as you pointed out would be consistent). Not planning to have any other measurement systems unless they are a joke and have funnier than that names.
