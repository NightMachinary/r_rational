There's been a number of SF novels and short stories where this kind of things happen, chemically, geometrically, and so on. Rudy Rucker visits this in a number of his works starting with /White Light/, and then in /The Indian Rope trick Explained/ he describes something like this from the point of view of someone outside the experience.
