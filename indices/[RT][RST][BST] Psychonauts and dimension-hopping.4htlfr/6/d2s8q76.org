Well, from a rational perspective, I'd ask if the effect can be recreated without a human in the loop. You never /ever/ test a potential new drug on humans before you know exactly what to expect from it. Try it on cultured cells, animal models, etc. See what happens when rats get an overdose, so you have a ballpark idea of how much is safe to use on people.

And then, if there really is no effective way to access this alternate world without a human mind in the loop, at least stuff them in an MRI machine first so you can get some objective data as well as subjective experiences.

If people on this drug can communicate with each other in the shared psychospace, regardless of their positions in the real world, that's like having a radio in your head. Very useful for sending messages that can't be blocked by Faraday cages. If indeed they aren't blocked by Faraday cages...

From a sci-fi perspective, it's a pretty good premise for a short story / thought experiment. How do babies turn a stream of experiences into a coherent narrative? How do we learn to move around, to recognise people, and how do we persuade ourselves that the outside world is /real/? Through what process do pictures on the screen of the Cartesian Theatre become powerful beliefs that shape your identity - beliefs that you'd be willing to die for? What things that we accept as universal could just as easily vary from place to place? And what's the difference between a parallel universe and an Inception-style shared dream?
