In the hypothetical experiment, that's pretty much what my first hypothesis would be - the brain as a general purpose shit-figuring-out device, which will adapt around making sense of whatever regularities it finds in its experience of the world.

But I could also imagine it turning out to be optimised to some degree for the world as it actually is... tangentially reminded of a conversation I had a little while ago about how our circulation assumes the assistance of gravity, and doesn't have good mechanisms to force blood out of our head because we have no history of spending lots of time upside down.

As for Psychonauts... it's an old favourite so I would derive great fan-joy if someone wrote a decent piece of fiction in that world, but I'm not sure exactly what approach a Rational treatment would want to take.

There's some scope for munchkinry with the psychic powers you get in-game, but the plot of the game already has the protagonist as the nearest thing to a rational person in a slightly insane world.
