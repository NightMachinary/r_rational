I think the amount of things that are "hard wired" are fewer than most people realize. Gravity, causality, object persistence, and so on appear to me as a parent to have been wholly strange to a newborn infant because I observed him learning these concepts over time. Cognitive feats like recognizing vertical lines in the visual field are also learned, as demonstrated by an experience using cats.

What is "hard-wired" is the potential to learn from experience and to create abstractions. If a weird alternate reality does not lend itself to abstraction for some reason (perhaps it's purely noise, but of a kind that due to Lovecraftian whimsy simply cannot be characterized in any way), then I think a baby would be unable to function... but then again, so would an adult.

Of course, there are other aspects of "hard-wiring" - some brain structures lend themselves to facial recognition, vocalization, and so on, which means that human babies are simply very good at acquiring those skills. I think if we put a baby in a hyperdimensional simulator, it could learn to operate in space like a true native, but like a mentally handicapped native (i.e. slow to learn).

I've never played Psychonauts but I did wonder if anybody would associate my post with the game. Would Rational Psychonauts be interesting?
