Reminds me of a long-held curiosity (of the sort that could never be ethically tested) about how an infant brain would develop if you put them in a simulated environment with wildly different physics than the norm - just how much of the standard set of assumptions is "hard wired" and how much is learned by experience?

Given a VR feed with 4 spatial dimensions, or a hyperbolic space, or noticeable relativistic effects, is the brain plastic enough to learn how to operate in that space like a true native?

Also, separately, I felt a twinge of disappointment that this wasn't about an idea for Rational [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonauts][Psychonauts]]
