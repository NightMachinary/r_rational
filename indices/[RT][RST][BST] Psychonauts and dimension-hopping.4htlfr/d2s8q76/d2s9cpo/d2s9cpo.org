  Well, from a rational perspective, I'd ask if the effect can be recreated without a human in the loop.

To answer that question, I'd first have to decide on what the operant mechanism /is/ and a bit about how it works. I'm partial to the idea that whatever biochemical process that accounts for the experience of consciousness is somehow /tuned/ to an analogous process in the alternate universe. That way, the mind is swapped out to the other universe while keeping the physical brain here. It also opens up the ability to /tune/ other processes, such as a simple oxidation reaction or a computer program.

  You never ever test a potential new drug on humans before you know exactly what to expect from it.

To construct a better story with characters that readers would have an easier time to relate to, I think the psychonauts should be acting outside of a dedicated research facility. Otherwise, when the anomaly is discovered, the story would get bogged down in practical and organizational issues like ethics boards and so on. The idea of a basement lab or a garage experiment opening up new possibilities for a group of geeks is much more appealing. Amateur scientists would be torn between publishing early (which risks losing ownership of or even access to this amazing new thing, or just being called crackpots and being shut down if the materials or equipment are illegal) and continuing to work privately to learn more about what it actually is before breaking the story (risking being scooped, psychological specters like addiction or obsession, etc.).

The discovery should be serendipitous, I think, to be at all believable. It's so far out of what current scientific understanding permits, that any research in this direction would be carried out only by crackpots (or secret government labs). I'd rather not have to write characters who are actually crackpots!

  From a sci-fi perspective, it's a pretty good premise for a short story / thought experiment.

Potentially, there are a lot of really interesting ideas to explore here, I feel. I almost posted it to [[/r/scificoncepts]], but decided [[/r/rational]] would be a better fit because it's the rational and rationalist treatment of the subject that's novel and interesting. There are tons of stories, books, films, and tv shows that explore "sliding" between parallel dimensions or whatever, and none of them treat it seriously (just as a plot device). I want to explore what it would /actually/ be like, because that exploration leads to a whole nest of fascinating questions like the ones you posed.
