The game Psychonauts is of the "Kid saves the world for no reason and adults are incompetent for no reason" formula. Making the adults competent/rational and still having kids with no experience have a reason to be centerpieces of the plot is ... difficult. HPMOR took similarly problematic source material and worked with it, but still - a lot of the Psychonauts plot makes very little sense. Admittedly, most of the people involved had very obvious psychological problems...

I really liked the game's aesthetics, it's general ideas, and it's setting. However, the actual implementation stunk - the platforming was sort of garbage, collecting a billion collectables was made extremely unfun, and the actual plot was sort of cliche and also silly. Also, Psychonauts isn't the sort of thing that necessarily calls out for fanfiction - the actual plot was resolved fairly well and the game felt pretty satisfactory, and there is less of a feeling of potential greatness missed that seems to motivate so much fanfiction.

If I was making some sort of Psychonauts fanfic, a good start might be to make Raz, the kid who just came to camp this day with no real experience and who in canon solves all problems and fixes everything by himself... less of a mary sue, and involve more of the other characters as active agents. There's a huge cast of colorful characters in psychonauts, and almost none of them really do anything important in the plot.
