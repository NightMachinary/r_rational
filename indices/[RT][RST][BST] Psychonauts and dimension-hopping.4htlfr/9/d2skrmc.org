Even if this occurs to animals, I don't see how you would figure that out - it's not as if they can report their experiences in sufficient detail.

The big issue with a story like this would be the alternate-universe rules; most of the munchkinning comes from there, but presumably they'd be frightfully complicated, the natives would have an enormous head-start, and they'd be difficult to convey.

If this works by "connecting" or "swapping" you with something from another world, then it wold make a lot of sense for every journey to let Something Else into ours.
