I like the character idea and the CV but I don't like the character. The tone of the character feels pretty silly for a god-like person, and I get that it's supposed to be lighthearted, but it just comes off as goofy.

The asides are excessive and make it harder to read by repeatedly breaking the flow. Maybe it'd be fine if they were actual footnotes.
