I've been a Star Wars fanfic search lately and it got me thinking about the dark side of magic systems: when the magic or force or whatever you call it has aspects that are powerful but innately evil or biased towards evil and are corruptive in some way. By dark side I mean in general stuff like Gold Magic in Worth the Candle, or breaking the laws of magic in the Dresden Files, or Diabolism in Pact, or the magic in Warhammer Fantasy.

How potent does a “Dark Side” need to be to get run away feedback loops? I.e. you can't even intentionally use it safely once because it has the potential to be so useful/addictive/corrupting/seductive.

Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?

Any unusual takes on the Dark Side?
