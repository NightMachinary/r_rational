  How potent does a “Dark Side” need to be to get run away feedback loops? I.e. you can't even intentionally use it safely once because it has the potential to be so useful/addictive/corrupting/seductive.

Pretty boring answer, but, if using the dark side raises the chances someone will use it again in the future, there's a feedback loop. If the first time guarantees near-certainty, then everyone who uses it is damned.

One kind of interesting way you could do it would be, say, the Dark Side is extremely useful and the first two times you use it is free, and everyone knows it always makes you its puppet the third time. I think people would still routinely go for the third time, as two successes make them feel safe, despite the overwhelming evidence.

  Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?

It's sufficient if instances of it going wrong come to mind more easily than instances of it going right. Which could just be one or two highly visible disasters, and a subtle or boring success case. Nuclear power, for example.

Coupling this with subtle magic is actually a pretty unique flavor, I don't think I've seen that done. You usually see extreme subtle magic on a good-aligned mentor figure who's some sort of champion of the natural order. You could have a magic based on gaining subtle benefits by helping balance the forces of nature, which is completely safe except for those couple of times someone messed it up catastrophically and opened a portal to the realm of the Fey, inviting the Wild Hunt. Or necromancy consists of resolving the business of the restless dead in exchange for Death fudging the scales in favor of your safety, except for a couple notable times someone became a lich.
