  Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?

One angle that sort of makes sense for the Star Wars dark side is that force use simply reinforces the states of mind that are required to use it. So using powers that draw on anger (which is honestly like nearly all the dark side powers) will make you a more and more angry person until you go evil.\\
This would also imply that using the dark side could just as easily "corrupt" you in ways that look radically different. It's just that we never see anyone corrupted into being super compassionate, happy or whatnot because there aren't any widespread force powers that draw on those emotions.
