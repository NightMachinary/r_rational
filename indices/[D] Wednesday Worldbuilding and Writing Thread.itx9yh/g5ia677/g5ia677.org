Years ago, EY posted /[[http://web.archive.org/web/20140406122655/http://lesswrong.com/lw/jzr/my_april_fools_day_confession/][My April Fools' Day Confession]]/ where he talks about an alternate Earth-like rational civilization called dath ilan. One part that particularly struck me was regarding the education system:

#+begin_quote
  You've probably guessed that dath ilan did not have universities with sit-down classes where a professor lectured for three months. We took education seriously in dath ilan, which in our world meant using professional specialization and economies of scale and large prizes and fast iteration. One hour of instruction on a widely-used subject got the same kind of attention in dath ilan that an hour of prime-time TV gets on Earth. By which I mean that there would be centralized development of movies you watched on your own, and the training-games you played in what I won't insult by calling it a school, and experiments to find out which variations worked. Tell a real educator about how Earth classes are taught in three-month-sized units, and they would've sputtered and asked how you can iterate fast enough to learn how to teach that. Tell them that the same universities that taught were also responsible for certifying that teaching had occurred successfully - that the performance of education, and the verification and certification of education, were carried out by the same financial entity - and they would have just turned and walked away. Tell them that students paid up front whether the university succeeded or failed at training them, and they'd turn around and start yelling about dishonorable fraud. /Everyone/ understood that much economics where I come from.

Assume you have been elected as the director of an education system with a 12-year training program and about 100,000 students of varying ages following a linear distribution ranging from 4 to 16 years-old. You are graded on the performance of your school system, with 60% of your grade based on your students' test scores, 20% of your grade based on early graduation rates, and 20% based on student satisfaction. Your annual pay will be equal to your score squared times a million dollars, so 100% gets you a million dollars, while 70% gets you about $490K.

An outside agency will design, administer, and grade the tests instead of your teachers. The tests will be administered at fixed intervals based upon the students' ages and are designed to test for competency in subjects up to four years ahead of the planned curriculum. Grading is done on a numeric scale reflecting effective grade level, so +0 represents an average student who can correctly answer 90% of questions for their grade, while +1 represents an incredibly talented student who can correctly answer 90% of the questions for students one year ahead. You will get a full score if your students average at +1, and 0% score if your students average at +0.

For early graduation rate, you will receive the full score if your students graduate at least a year early on average, and 0% if the average graduation time is no earlier than expected. This may seem redundant with the above, but serves as a disincentive for holding onto precocious students for as long as possible.

For student satisfaction, the students will rate their happiness with the school and their classes, and your score here is based on their reported average happiness.

Each year, if your students are graduating early, the expected graduation date will be pushed back by 10% of the difference. So, if your students graduate a year early on average, next year you'll be expected to get them to graduate 36.5 days earlier to still get the full bonus.

If/when these reductions bring the expected program completion time to 11 years or less, a curriculum revision board will be arranged, consisting of 100 local volunteers - 20 college professors, 20 teachers from your program, 20 students, 20 parents, and 20 employers. This board will vote on new subjects to be added to the curriculum and on the details of what should be included and tested.

Your educational system is funded with $1.5 billion annually. As the director, you have fairly broad discretion over how to allocate that funding for construction projects, teachers' salaries, teaching materials, school buses, support staff, etc., though you are audited for fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure against direct personal gain. If anyone has proof that you've entered into a fraudulent or abusive arrangement with them (or anyone else), they are entitled to 150% of whatever the gain would have been, provided you are convicted. If convicted, you will be assessed a fine equal to 200% of that payout, and may have assets seized to cover the cost. If that fails to cover the fine, you may be indefinitely kept on probation while your wages are garnished until it is paid off.

To have been elected as the director, you must have at least one child in this school system. You have minimum standards to uphold in regards to cleanliness, fire safety, nurse availability, transportation of poor students, etc. and may be fined or even fired if audits find your schools aren't up to the standards, so use common sense. Aside from that, you have a term of four years before you need to worry about re-election.

Given this, how do you maximize your income?
