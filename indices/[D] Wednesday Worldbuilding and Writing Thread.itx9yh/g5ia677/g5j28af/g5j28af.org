Fuck, I'm on mobile and lost like a half hour long response because i accidentally lost the page. I'm just going to tldr my lost answer.

They'll likely be some way to deal with problematic students, or students with health issues that require them to stop, or dead students, that give a way of removing them from being measured. Abuse this. Students witha poor/negligent/abusive upbringing are more likely to run afoul of rules you impose ("don't share food in case of allergies" while some students don't get enough to eat at home and need help) and students with mental health issues or poor impulse control will end up breaking rules too (don't verbally harrass others/start fights/get caught self-harming). Be as strict as possible on repeat offenses (3 strikes system), be eager to get rid of students who need additional medical/psychological help ("we just dont have the resources to give them the care they need/deserve"). "Culling" the students least likely to succeed, even if for reasons they can't control, will improve your results at the end of the day.

You can also get some private investigators to pick at any weak links in the testing and oversights parts of the system you interact with. Understanding the way the people who will be making the tests think would give you some insight into how you'll need to prepare students, and you could even go further into blackmail or copying the tests before they are finished and applied to students. I don't know if your own private spending would be investigated as part of the oversight (and even then there are ways of being discreet), its just a matter of weighing if the path is worth it or not from the perspective of long-term financial gain.

This isn't the spirit you likely intended when asking the question, but these are issues nonetheless.
