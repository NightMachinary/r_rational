This is actually a large part of what I was looking for! Culling of under-performing students with excessively strict (and possibly selectively-enforced) policies is certainly a potential problem. It's also a tricky topic from a policy perspective, because there are certainly going to be cases where it is appropriate and necessary to expel a student, so the rules surrounding expulsion need to be carefully balanced.

Similarly, picking apart the test design could be a thorny problem. I've seen that in some courses already, where a significant chunk of the class is spent on teaching students how to take the test rather than learning the material. True/false and multiple choice tests seem to be the most susceptible to this, while fill-in-the-blank, short-essay, and show-your-work test formats seem least susceptible.

Blackmail or copying the tests is a possibility, but it's also very risky. There's little you'd be able to do with that on your own, so you'd have to be involving lots of other people, creating significant risk that someone will reveal the scheme. Your personal finances would be getting audited, so this wouldn't be easy to pull off, either, especially not without breaking additional laws in the process.
