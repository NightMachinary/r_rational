I mean I would certainly do a lot more reading on the subject than I know now and a lot more thinking than on a reddit post, but I would imagine a decent chunk (especially at the beginning) would go towards research about what is the best way people learn. I know if kids think they're comparitively smart, they become smarter, and I know that people learn better when they enjoy it or are excited about it, but I would probably have a few board members (or teachers, or someone that knows about the topic and is generally intelligent) get together and brainstorm challenges and strengths that a good plan would address and take advantage of, and then try to implement an actual plan after we've brainstormed about how we should brainstorm first.
