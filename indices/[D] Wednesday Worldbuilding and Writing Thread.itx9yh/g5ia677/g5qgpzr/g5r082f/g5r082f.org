  ...you are audited for fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure against direct personal gain. If anyone has proof that you've entered into a fraudulent or abusive arrangement with them (or anyone else), they are entitled to 150% of whatever the gain would have been, provided you are convicted. If convicted, you will be assessed a fine equal to 200% of that payout, and may have assets seized to cover the cost.
