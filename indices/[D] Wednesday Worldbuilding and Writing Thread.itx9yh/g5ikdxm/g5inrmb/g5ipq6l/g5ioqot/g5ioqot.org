A bit difficult to figure out, I think, if we don't have some other constraints set up first, but let's see what the extremes would look like:

#+begin_quote
  How potent does a “Dark Side” need to be to get run away feedback loops? I.e. you can't even intentionally use it safely once because it has the potential to be so useful/addictive/corrupting/seductive.
#+end_quote

Obviously, a "Dark Side" that immediately completely rewrites your values would be a non-starter in most cases. People would only rarely use the Dark Side in this case: if they were idiots, if their values or meta-values were close enough to the Dark Side's anyway, or if they thought that the actions of their "Dark Self" could be constrained in the right way by outside forces.

Any of these criteria may not apply to a given Dark Side, depending on the nature of its corruption and the degree of its power. For example, if the Dark Side's corruption is an inversion of your current values, no matter what they may be (i.e. "Dark Hitler" would be a pretty nice guy), then nobody would accept Dark Side corruption on the basis that their values are already close enough to the Dark Side's. Or, if the Dark Side were so powerful that no possible outside force could impose a constraint on your actions, you obviously wouldn't accept Dark Side corruption on the basis that your Dark Self could somehow be forced to act in accordance with your present self's will.

  Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?
#+end_quote

The Dark Side doesn't have to be inherently corrupting at all, just /easier/, in order to be warned against. For example, if "killing people with the Force" is "of the Dark Side," as some portrayals of Star Wars have it, then it might not be literally supernaturally corrupting so much as corrupting in the vein of "first you're throwing lightning at people, then you're choking them, then you're realizing you can just pinch their carotid artery, and somewhere along the line you start killing people who don't have to be killed, because 'kill them with the Force' is just so much easier than anything else that it's really, really easy to justify killing them."
