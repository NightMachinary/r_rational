  You usually see extreme subtle magic on a good-aligned mentor figure who's some sort of champion of the natural order.

I mean for all the utility of throwing around objects, the real value in the Force seems to be precognition and guidance to the right place at the right time. The fanon that makes the most sense out of the prequel has Palpatine actively sabotaging the Jedi's connection to the will of the Force and precognition after they had grown over reliant on it.

I like your examples. I could see the "Dark Side" being a natural emergent outcome of exploiting or bending the rules in a way that creates a feedback loop. Like with the necromancy examples... if you could use Death's favor to bend the rules to temporarily count yourself as dead and then both create and resolve your own restlessness in a cycle that spirals out of control.
