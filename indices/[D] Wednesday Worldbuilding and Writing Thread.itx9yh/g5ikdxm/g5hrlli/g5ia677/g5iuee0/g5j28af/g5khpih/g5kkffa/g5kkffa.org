Yeah blackmail and such approaches probably has too much risk attached to it to be worthwhile, only reasonable tactic in that whole vein of things would be asking a few less scrupulous folks "hey can you befriend(/seduce) someone from this list of employees at this testing agency, and I'll pay you a flat amount plus extra for any relevant info." Idk how refined laws are on social engineering strategies, but probably significantly less than the laws on blackmail. Problem with this strategy is knowing people in the first place who are willing to do such things, but still being an "upstanding" enough citizen to end up director of an education system. Like I used to be about two steps removed from folks who could sell me drugs on the lower end of dangerous right after the end of high school, but didn't bother with maintaining those connections since that's not my scene in general, even if there have been times those connections would've come in handy since. If I'd been a more extroverted individual or didn't have those long-term health issues that cropped up I'd have made the effort, you never know what you might need, but that's not how things panned out.

I'd strongly recommend into looking into Finland's education system. I don't remember as much about its design as I used to, but in broad strokes its based around engagement with learning on terms that benefit the student, rather than learning to get the best answers on a test. Being among the global elite in test results* is just a side-effect of the approach. There's a lot of cultural weight and history behind that approach though that you can't just throw $1.5 billion at to replicate.

​

Eschewing testing as a metric for deciding effectiveness of the education reform, perhaps going for things like student and teacher satisfaction, student self-confidence, engagement in regards to attendance (and associated rate of student absence/tardiness/dropouts), engagement in regards to subjects taken (once electives become a choice), engagement through general self-reported metrics like time spent reading and studying subject content, all these could all be used just off the top of my head. You could also do follow up studies/surveys afterwards, comparing student satisfaction and self-confidence, how capable they feel in general, and the perceptions of employers (or university personal who deal with the students? idk at what point this 12-year education system starts measurement if it begins part-way through typical primary education for the purposes of reforming tertiary education too). That said, going back to the culture point, taking a radical approach like this would cause friction between students of the education-reform system and people who'd had significantly different educational experiences. Like, you can't answer questions about academic results in a job interview if your education system tried to avoid such flawed methods of assessment to focus on the less tangible benefits to the process of learning as a whole.

(Tangent I'm not going to expand on because this response is taking long to write, but the more reform you try to do the more pushback there is in the wider population due to cultural mismatch. Aside from time lost to having to explain new concepts of education to teachers and stuff from whole shitshow, you'd have to deal with parents pulling the "back in my day..." and "kids these days are soft and want participation trophies for everything" asshole lines, with parents sabotaging their own kids opinions and education based on their own beliefs like how antivax and super conservative parents harm their own children. So tl:dr; the best education reform isn't the one that is likely to have the best students in a vacuum, it's the one that can do as much as it can while also accounting for idiots)

​

(Crack suggestion, but $1.5 billion per annum could probably be enough to begin the process of investment in Finland for the basis of setting up a large scale international boarding schools, assuming the deal was structured as partly paying for setup/construction/organisation/training costs and taking a cut of the profits the institutions would generate while most went to the government. It'd still be large-scale heavily funded education "reform," but the very significant delay on getting everything up and running probably wasn't exactly what you were looking for given the whole "elected as..." bit kinda implies a current event you're expected to deal with quickly (or at least prepare plans to implement). Also the government would certainly be worried about making such a large commitment so as to provide education facilities to increase its student population by 100,000 (~8% increase over current 1.3 million students) that are exclusively international, bringing with it the clash of cultures and languages (and also disease, because current events))

*The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ran by the OECD is what I'm looking at for stats. The Wikipedia page for PISA has a brief ranking of the test results in 3 year intervals, more complex data is on the official website.
