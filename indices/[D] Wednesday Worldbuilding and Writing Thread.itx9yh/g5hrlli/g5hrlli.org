I've been working on this fictional [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing][alternate timeline Venezuela]] for a while as an exploration of the sorts of novel institutional designs in the rationalist sphere. If you see anything that's not explained in the doc or links, or notice some problems please let me know.

I'm fairly proud of the unique urban planning and would like to make some sort of mock up to show off what it looks like (city skylines isn't remotely adequate). However I'm rather lacking in any artistic skills and I don't know what the best program to use for something like this would be (especially given all the vegetation), so I would appreciate any information about that.

One question pertinent to my setting which I'd like some predictions on are what the cultural impact of a country so absurdly progressive for its time would be on the rest of the world. I'd also like predictions about what kind of resistance there would be to this rapid cultural shift, since I'm already expecting some domestic terrorism.
