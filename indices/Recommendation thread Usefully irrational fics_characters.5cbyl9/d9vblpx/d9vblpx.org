So much literary fiction covers exactly this that it almost seems like more of a challenge to think of exceptions, so instead some genre examples:

/Sandman/ (Wahhh, I can't put my life back together, wahhh), /Ender's Shadow/ (Must be Spock must be Spock OH GOD POKE NO WHY must be Spock) /HPMOR/ (Quirrell is so cool, he's totes my bro OH HEY WATCHA DOIN WITH THAT UNICORN), /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ (I must avenge my HONOR!).

All do a good job of getting you in the head of and sympathizing with someone making terrible life choices.
