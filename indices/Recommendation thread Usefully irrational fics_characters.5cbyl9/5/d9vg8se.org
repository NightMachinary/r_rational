Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is... not rational in a lot of ways. But it's hard to get more fun than that show.

Stuff happens for the rule of cool, implausible is the rule rather than the exception, and they win through force of will rather than with their intelligence. Half of the characters are completely flat, but the main characters have surprising depth.
