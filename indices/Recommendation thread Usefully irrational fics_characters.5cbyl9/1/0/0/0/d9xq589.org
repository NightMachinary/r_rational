Aside from Sazed, who treated theology as an academic subject, religion didn't seem to play a significant role in the story so I'm curious how Sanderson's faith could've bothered you. No other character had motivations related to religion, and when actual gods started playing a role in the story they were treated as lovecraftian monsters manipulating humans.

I REALLY liked Sazed's character arc because I've had similar, if far less dramatic, crises of faith in my past and it seemed like a natural progression for him to end up where he did. I didn't notice any misrepresentation of religious skepticism or an unfair defense of theism as anything other than what it is.

One of the main tenants of The Path, which Sazed founded, was that worshiping God was a waste of time and people should focus more on studying philosophy, introspection, and fulfilling their moral values. As a spiritualist, this naturally appealed to me but I fail to see any reason why it would turn atheists off.
