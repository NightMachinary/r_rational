It's hard to explain this without digging out my copy of the book and quoting exact phrases, because I read it years ago, but I'll try from memory.

Overall, there's a certain flavor of skepticism that distinguishes it as "rational skepticism" rather than "token skepticism."

Sazed's was the latter. He kept coming up with good arguments for bad reasons, so that when the circumstances changed, his arguments fell apart. His motivations were emotional, not logical, which is fine as a starting point, but never evolved past it. Which means the author can lead him toward a moment of "enlightenment" that made all the previous arguments immaterial.

I liked The Path just fine. It was a great spiritual philosophy to have.

But when you start there, and then shift to a "Hey, god actually exists and influences the world," it makes the whole thing ring hollow. It didn't help that when the godlike powers showed up, they completely undercut the impact of what happened, and now we know that there's a heaven and all the good people who died are happily living in eternal bliss and don't worry, nothing bad is going to happen now because an omniscient and benevolent and all powerful entity exists.

It's basically the kind of story someone who DOES believe in God and theistic values would write, and while it's admirable to try and include other philosophies in it, they end up not really working when one's personal beliefs end up being the true ones.

Orson Scott Card's early books did a fantastic job of avoiding this. He had religious believers, and he had atheists, and he had characters whose religious beliefs just never came up and none of their beliefs ever really mattered or came out as correct or incorrect.
