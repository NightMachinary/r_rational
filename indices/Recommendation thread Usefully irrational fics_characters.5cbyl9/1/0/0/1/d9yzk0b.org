Um, it you don't mind, could you expand a bit on Sazed's characterisation? Can you remember what felt out of place and what did not? I've finished main Mistborn books just recently and to me (a lifelong atheist) it seemed... strange. But I had the curse of knowledge about Sanderson (he is a redditor btw), so I'd appreciate your perspective.
