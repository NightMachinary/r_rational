Interesting, thanks for sharing.

To me that part was actually one of the least jarring. They all start in the world where faith is not required and not practiced. The existence of the Lord Ruler just could not be disputed, he was a real figure and the only superstition they encounter, fear of the mists, is disproved right away, since criminals have to go out at night.

Sazed is a scholar that has been given a weird mission to preserve faith through preserving knowledge. Well of course he fails, of course he has no clue what he is doing. They are kind of like people that had to eat bland food all their lives and then Sazed reads them records of how spices taste and asks whether they like those spices or not. Not the best analogy but I felt like that, sort of Mary the super-scientist dilemma, but in regards to faith.

But what happened in the 3rd part was so... weird, especially that reviewing of recorded religions. The amount of purely epistemological faults was so overwhelming! Especially since it was a purely intellectual endeavor. I could understand if he latched onto some worldview that made him feel good, but he /clearly/ rules out that bias and at the same time commits fallacy after fallacy after fallacy. I wonder how close is that to what actually happens in Sanderson's mind.

Related to "popular media is not atheistic" bias, have you read "His Dark Materials"?
