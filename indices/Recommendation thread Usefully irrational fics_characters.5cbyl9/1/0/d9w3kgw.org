I'm not really a fan of these books, the pacing is just too slow for me even if there are bunch of great scenes, but the scene where Jasnah explains her reasons for believing what she does is fantastic. It's especially remarkable considering that Sanderson is a practicing Mormon.

This isn't even the first time he talked about religion in his books while preaching against his own faith. Mistborn has a fantastic character arc for the theological scholar Sazed having a crisis of faith, and The Path in the Alloy of Law is essentially Buddhism.
