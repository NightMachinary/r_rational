  I'm curious if you read the epilogue I wrote and published a few months after the main story. I ask because I wound up going for a martyr-fantasy bittersweet ending instead of the simpler wish fulfillment happy ending you seem to expect; it's still very much transparent author appeal wish fulfillment, but of a distinctly different type than you're implying.

I didn't even know it existed! I'll have to go back and read it soon, will let you know what I think when I get the chance.

  I do hope people read GWSI both to take what's good from it and to appreciate its many flaws (as I think you're suggesting).

Definitely! As I said, it was very enjoyable, had a very unique feeling of creeping horror from the unreliability of the narration/memory charms, and contained a lot of cleverness :)

  I hope to begin self-publishing better fiction, not written on such a tight deadline, sometime in Q1 2017.

Neat! What's it going to be about?
