Well, first off, it's definitely not rational fiction (neither written primarily with the rationalist community in mind nor written to minimize the number of cognitive mistakes characters make), though I've taken the lessons of rational fiction as general writing lessons.

But to actually try to pitch the series I'm writing, it was inspired by the early 2000s fundamentalist moral panic over Harry Potter. I always thought it was ridiculous, both because the actual existence of Satanic magic is at best highly dubious and because Harry Potter is just one entry in the well-established literary tradition of fantasy magic that has generally been uncontroversial. But eventually I got to thinking "huh, what would a YA contemporary fantasy series where magic is inherently evil actually look like", and decided it had a lot of potential. Faustian bargains baked into the magic system, necessarily underpowered protagonists and necessarily overpowered antagonists, a deliberately black-and-white main conflict of which all subconflicts necessarily are grayer by various degrees.

To put it in Imp-from-Worm terms: so there's this Earth with no real parahumans, but two warring Simurghs, one named Fucko McSkullface and one named Bored Mike. Fucko gives people temporary access to powers if they do her favors (which are usually bullshit and evil), and the results pretty much always suck for humanity. No one's really sure if Bored Mike exists because he doesn't do supernatural shit very often, but he does exist and spends all his time tweaking shit behind the scenes to make Fucko's job harder (instead of, you know, *fucking killing her*).
