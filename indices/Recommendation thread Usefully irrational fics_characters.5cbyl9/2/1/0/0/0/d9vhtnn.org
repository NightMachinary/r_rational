Ha, that sounds pretty awesome. I've been writing a bit of my own "dark YA fantasy" on the side, though I'm still not quite sure where it'll end up going. I'm looking forward to yours!

  But to actually try to pitch the series I'm writing, it was inspired by the early 2000s fundamentalist moral panic over Harry Potter. I always thought it was ridiculous, both because the actual existence of Satanic magic is at best highly dubious and because Harry Potter is just one entry in the well-established literary tradition of fantasy magic that has generally been uncontroversial.

Tell me about it. I had a client once whose mother refused to let him read Harry Potter books because she didn't want any of that "ungodly stuff" to "corrupt him."

This was a mom that, in the same session, admitted to taking said 9 year old client to see the latest Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, and laughed over him crying from nightmares afterward, asking why he was scared since "none of it was real."

Yeah. That one took a lot of willpower not to lose my professional calm :P
