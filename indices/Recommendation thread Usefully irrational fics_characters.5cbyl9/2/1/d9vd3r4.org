I kept coming back to this thread hoping to find a recommendation/takedown of GWSI, and I've got to say, finding a /ten-paragraph/ recommendation/takedown of GWSI was beyond my wildest hopes.

I'm curious if you read the epilogue I wrote and published a few months after the main story. I ask because I wound up going for a martyr-fantasy bittersweet ending instead of the simpler wish fulfillment happy ending you seem to expect; it's still very much transparent author appeal wish fulfillment, but of a distinctly different type than you're implying.

In general I'd say your criticisms stand, though, and I accept them as lessons to learn from in the future. I do hope people read GWSI both to take what's good from it and to appreciate its many flaws (as I think you're suggesting). I hope to begin self-publishing better fiction, not written on such a tight deadline, sometime in Q1 2017. :)
