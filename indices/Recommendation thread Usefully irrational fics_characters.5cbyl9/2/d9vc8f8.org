If I understand the question right, I'd say Ginny in /Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence/ is a great example of this.

I very much enjoyed the story for the most part, and think it did a lot of unique and interesting things with the source material. But Ginny herself was a heavily flawed rationalist for a number of reasons.

At risk of beating a dead horse (an obvious horse?) it was her religious beliefs that posed the biggest problem. Despite never getting any actual evidence for her beliefs, Ginny continues to defend them against shoddily constructed arguments by the other characters, and her responses are similarly full of holes. She learns just enough rationality to entrench herself deeper in her beliefs, as described in [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/][How Biases Can Hurt People.]]

Of course it all turns out well for her because this particular character flaw was the result of an author tract, which is unfortunate, but it's important to remember that a rational character is only as "genuine" as the arguments around them. It's very easy to make someone seem smart when you surround them with strawmen.

Ginny also starts the story with many flaws and shortcomings that made her an interesting foil to the now-somewhat-traditional Rationalist Protagonist. She had some questionable morals. She's obsessive about her idols. She has all the pride of a "deep thinker" without any of the discipline.

Then, slowly but surely, she simply got better and better at everything. Not through actual, learnable skills or wisdom, which would be alright, but simply by narrative fiat. There was information being communicated, but not knowledge of what distinguishes rational epistemology from irrational epistemology.

Which was confusing, because it also seemed like the story itself was written to point out the flaws of stories with author tracts, specifically to counter the author tract of HPMOR. This is supported a bit by the scene where Harry starts to subvert the cult stereotype and parody the LessWrong community, but as the story went on and it just kept running with it, it seemed more and more like the writer had trouble distinguishing what actually made the author tract problematic, and simply disliked the flavor, substituting it with their own.

On top of all that, all the accusations of Harry being a Mary Sue in HPMOR (which I disagree with) apply much more to Ginny in GWSI. By the end of the story, she's leagues ahead of Harry: not just the chosen one, ordained by prophecy to become the savior of the One True Religion, and by extension, all of humanity, but also able to utterly defeat him and deliver a This is Why You Suck browbeating.

Contrast that to Harry at the end of HPMOR: he's "chosen" by prophecy to destroy the universe as we know it, and if he's not super careful and super cautious and as rational as possible, he might just kill everyone. There's no similar Sword of Damocles hanging over Ginny's head by the end of GWSI: I have no reason to expect her to do anything other than becomes the new messiah to Wizardkind, and perhaps even all of humanity, with the lost magics she now has access to.

There was, however, an obvious mitigating factor for the story, that is also important to learn from: the author was on a deadline, and thus churned out chapters as fast as they could. The rate of the writing was, in all honesty, very impressive. The problem is that it seems, in this area, quality was very much sacrificed for quantity.

I'm not a perfect writer, and I know my readers are frustrated by how slow my chapters come out. Hell, I am too, and if I had a bit more free time and a bit more work ethic, I could probably publish faster than once a month. But a lot of that month is spent researching, poking holes in my ideas, taking the opposing view, and so on. If a writer skips all that and just goes for the low hanging fruit, they're going to have a hard time reconciling how rational they think their characters are versus how rational they actually come off to others.
