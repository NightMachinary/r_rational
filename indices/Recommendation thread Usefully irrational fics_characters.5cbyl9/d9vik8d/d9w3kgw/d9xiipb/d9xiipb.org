  It's especially remarkable considering that Sanderson is a practicing Mormon.

Wait, what? Really?

This... explains so much about what I disliked about the Mistborn trilogy. Huh.

  This isn't even the first time he talked about religion in his books while preaching against his own faith. Mistborn has a fantastic character arc for the theological scholar Sazed having a crisis of faith, and The Path in the Alloy of Law is essentially Buddhism.

Ehh. As someone who went through my own crisis of faith and went from theist to deist to agnostic to atheist over the space of about 10 years, Sazed's character was at times fantastically done, and at other times a walking caricature of Skepticism. I saw his flip back to religious belief coming miles away.
