I can try.

So to start with, I came in with a bias. Not the atheist bias, but the "popular media is not atheistic" bias. So my default expectation of anyone who comes off as a skeptic or agnostic is that they're going to either have a change of heart, be proven wrong, or generally just not affect any meaningful change in that sphere.

So at worst my expectation of skepticism in popular fiction is that it's an excuse to soapbox about the wrongness of skepticism, and at best it's just a characterization.

Sazed, then, triggered a number of warning bells early on. First, he seemed to love religions to an unrealistic degree for someone who claimed not to believe in any of them. This is explained somewhat by his setting, of course: if you're a historian in a world where religions have all been wiped out and oppressed by the autocratic ruler, then sure, I can see an anthropologist being fascinated by religion. And I don't mean to imply that you can't find an atheist in our world who enjoys learning about religions. Obviously many do.

But to me a realistic character within those parameters is much less uniformly positive about religions, especially when describing them to other skeptics and atheists. "I have a religion for you" or "What religion do you have for me?" is one of the things that he said or was asked often, if I recall correctly, and that notion, that people benefit from superstitious beliefs about the universe, is one that rubbed me the wrong way coming from someone who claimed to be a skeptic.

Again, maybe it's explainable by his context. But that's part of why he didn't strike me as a "true skeptic," because skeptics in our world have experienced the negatives of religious belief first hand, and are much less optimistic and rosy about the notion of adopting religious beliefs or perspectives without actually believing in them.

But it's been a few years so maybe my memory isn't doing the character justice. But that's at least one thing that I can recall rubbing me the wrong way.
