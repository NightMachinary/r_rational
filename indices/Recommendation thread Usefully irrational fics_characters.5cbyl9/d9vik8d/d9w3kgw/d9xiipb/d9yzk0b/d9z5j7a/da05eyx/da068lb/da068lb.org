  The amount of purely epistemological faults was so overwhelming! Especially since it was a purely intellectual endeavor. I could understand if he latched onto some worldview that made him feel good, but he clearly rules out that bias and at the same time commits fallacy after fallacy after fallacy. I wonder how close is that to what actually happens in Sanderson's mind.

Yeah, this is what I meant by "He kept coming up with good arguments for bad reasons, so that when the circumstances changed, his arguments fell apart. His motivations were emotional, not logical, which is fine as a starting point, but never evolved past it." in my response to [[/u/trekie140]]. That third book was just full of frustration for me on a number of levels, and this clumsy heel-face-turn was one of them.

  Related to "popular media is not atheistic" bias, have you read "His Dark Materials"?

I have! One of my favorite trilogies, though it wasn't atheistic so much as anti-theistic :) I was going to recommend it at the end of our Multiverse podcast episode, but went with the Dark Tower instead. I'll probably talk about HDM at some point soon.
