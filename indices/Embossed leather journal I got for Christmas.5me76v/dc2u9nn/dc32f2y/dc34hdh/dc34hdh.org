thanks! I actually don't have a good picture yet. The tattoo artist actually forgot the final line down the center. it's only visible at the top of the triangle so it's easy to miss, and I didn't notice till I got home. Hoping to get that finished off. Overall I'm pretty happy with it though, the overall design really speaks to me, it's the only tattoo I've ever gotten.
