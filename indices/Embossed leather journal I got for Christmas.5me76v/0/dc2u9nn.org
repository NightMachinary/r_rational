Explanation:

I'm a big HPMOR fan, and had a strong connection to the metaphors around the deathly hallows and using rationality to defeat death.

My friend got me a custom embossed leather journal with a symbol I designed and actually got a tattoo of: the Vitruvian Man combined with the symbol for the Deathly Hallows.

For me, this symbol represents the fusion of Humanism, science and rationality, with the hope for a fantastical future made possible by technology.

The gift was really thoughtful, and I thought of a few of you might appreciate the symbolism!
