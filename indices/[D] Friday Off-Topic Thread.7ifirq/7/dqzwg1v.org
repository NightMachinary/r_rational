Pictures of my boat. One of these days I am going to write down what progress I've made. I've pretty much finished the power system, and need to install it in the hull. I've got a lot of the freshwater system ready. I've got a good system for keeping water from getting in between hull layers. Hopefully I'll document things a bit better in the future.

It's still needs a good thorough scrub.

Also, hopefully google will start associating that site with my name any time now...
