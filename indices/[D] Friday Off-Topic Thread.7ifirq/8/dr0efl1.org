Any My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Fans here?

Any Worm fans here?

I ask because I have a persistent plot bunny that I'm thinking of utilizing for a story; most likely a one-two shot as opposed to a full length story.

All Might is transported to the Wormverse and is brought back to peak condition by Panacea. He tries to become the Symbol of Peace in a superhero world that's definitely not as simplistic as his own, and he does his best to come to terms with the Grey on Grey setting as much as possible.

Tbh, the above would just be flavouring because I then plan to have him fight an Endbringer. /And win./

Wouldn't necessarily be a rational story but could be some fun.

P.S Based on the feats we've seen in both Worm and My Hero Academia, I'm fairly certain he doesn't have the capacity to beat an Endbringer. But I would write him to be that way, for the sake of being able to conceptualize All Might using Detroit Smash on a fucking kaiju!
