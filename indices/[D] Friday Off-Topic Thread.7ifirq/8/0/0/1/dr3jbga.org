  I don't know MHA but Saitama is a parody.

Well, yeah. Saitama's whole power concept is basically 'I have enough force / ability to defy physics to win, under any circumstances'. If you take that as his power definition then...yeah, Saitama wins. And I'm fine with that.

All Might's power set is basically that he's, in the MHA universe, fantastically strong and fast. But we're not talking 'shatter dimensions/levels of physical reality through punching' levels of strength here, which is what canonically would be required to actually damage an endbringer core.
