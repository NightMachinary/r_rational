I love the image of everyone in my building being replaced with weasels, and you're kind of on the money but not.

I got appointed as a Junior Weasel and they do the work of an Ordinary Weasel. So I've been doing Ordinary Weasel job for the past 3 years but I'm still technically a Junior Weasel. Another OW is leaving so I'm going to apply for the OW job.

Like you're saying, there's a chance that some External Weasel will come from outside the organisation / elsewhere within the organisation and take the OW job "out from under me" and I'll keep being a Junior Weasel until another OW leaves or gets promoted to Better Weasel or a Better Weasel gets promoted to Boss Weasel and then an Ordinary Weasel becomes a Better Weasel leaving an Ordinary Weasel job open for me to apply for all over again.

(The External Weasel risk is especially salient because we have a lot of unemployed engineers who might be wanting a secure government job)
