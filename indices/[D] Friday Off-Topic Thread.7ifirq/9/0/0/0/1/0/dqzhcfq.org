We're getting an Especially Junior Weasel in January so it'll be fun to have Intern Weasel and EJW both!

Got the intern partly becuase i spat the dummy about how horrible the opportunities for advancement were in the area - I was promised Ordinary Weasel job would be advertised in June and then through some HORRIFICALLY UNLIKELY LOOPHOLE some other guy got the Ordinary Weasel job and I was like "HOW DO I KNOW THE NEXT ORDINARY WEASEL JOB YOU ARE PROMISING IS NOT GOING TO BE LOOPHOLED AWAY??"

It wasn't and now I get to apply for it, so yay.
