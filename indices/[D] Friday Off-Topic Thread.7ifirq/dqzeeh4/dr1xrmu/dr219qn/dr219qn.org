It's about Joffrey being caught in a groundhog style timeloop.

If you don't know the source, Joffey is a spoiled sociopathic child tyrant in the original and all around horrible.

It's not really rational since it's more about dealing with past demons and Joffreys growth as a person.

But it's still a really great Fic. It makes me feel sad whenever I read something with the source Joffrey in it.
