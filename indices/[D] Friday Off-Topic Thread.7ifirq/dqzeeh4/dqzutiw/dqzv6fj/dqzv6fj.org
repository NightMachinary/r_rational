I personally think that the story was always more about Joffrey and the person he becomes and less about Westeros. So I had less of a problem with Yi Ti. Though it did drag a bit, the last two chapters in the arc were brilliant and for the latest four in the story he is back in Westeros again. So i would say it recovered.
