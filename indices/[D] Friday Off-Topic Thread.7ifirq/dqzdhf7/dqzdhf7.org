[[http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/putin-pawns-and-propaganda-garry-kasparov/][This interview with Garry Kasparov (the greatest chess player alive today) about Russian politics and foreign policy]] may be the most important interview I've listened to all year. This is a man who can make sense of the crisis facing the world, if not necessarily how to solve it. In surprisingly few words, he surmises how civil society is being poisoned by propaganda that promotes authoritarianism and nihilism while demeaning morality and objective truth. This is how the sanity waterline is falling.
