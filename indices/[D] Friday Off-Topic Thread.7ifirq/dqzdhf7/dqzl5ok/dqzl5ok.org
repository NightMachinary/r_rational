Interesting. Kasparov says, "We are at war," as well as commentary to the effect of "the free world is giving away technology to its enemies." It may be the case that restriction of information is the way forward. I hope not though. The Internet is a valuable thing, and I really hope lack of net neutrality doesn't catch on. I hope that, as Kasparov also says, the problem can be solved by political will and perhaps compromise. Unfortunately, what we actually have is Donald Trump. It's enough to make a person depressed.

If you want to skip the intro (which is irrelevant and boring IMO) then the actual interview starts at 13:30.

I watched a video that's relevant to this discussion as well: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs][CGP Grey's Rules for Rulers]]. It shows how despotic leaders are beholden to their support base and are inherently unstable; the incentives for them are to do nearly anything to hold onto their power because if they don't, they get killed or imprisoned by the next regime. It's a tough situation to resolve, especially since Russia is a fairly powerful country and its actions have consequences for the entire world.

Kasparov seems to have good, realistic advice about how to deal with the situation, from a Russian's perspective who sees the world from both the Russian and external points of view. Highly recommended listening. Thank you for posting.
