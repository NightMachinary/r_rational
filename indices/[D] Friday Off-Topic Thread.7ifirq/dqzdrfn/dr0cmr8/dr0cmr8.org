In Austria we have the Workers Chamber, which is an union everyone joins as long as they work and aren't independent. (for the independents there is the Economy Chamber) Participation is mandatory and they give you Legal Advice and Attorneys for free(like [[/r/legaladvice][r/legaladvice]] with actual power behind them) when you have problem with your boss. I know many people they have helped.

So i think it could help, but implementation with the american culture would have to be different.
