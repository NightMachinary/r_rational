Does anyone have any opinions on [[https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-student-assistants-covered-nlra-0][Graduate Student Unionization]]?

The graduate students at my university are starting to the process, working on collecting cards in order to get to a vote. Talking with my parents (they are both Republicans and thus automatically against Unions), there arguments against seem to be that we should be grateful for getting a scholarship and that we aren't owed anything more? And that participating in the unionizing could potentially endanger my own scholarship (I am pretty sure that would be retaliation and be very clearly illegal if the university actually did retaliate in anyway like that), or at the very least distract me from my own work (possible, but if anything I would just ignore the process and put in the bare minimum effort of voting). They are also ideologically opposed to the fact that if the graduate students worked with the United Auto Workers (UAW) for resources/support some portion of our dues would go to support them. In terms of pros... for me personally, I am happy with my advisor, my advisor is committed to making sure my work helps me complete a thesis in a timely manner, I work very flexible hours, so those aren't a big issue for me... occasionally I hear of other graduate students who have issues along those lines which I imagine might benefit from the collective bargaining of a union.

Anyway, thoughts?
