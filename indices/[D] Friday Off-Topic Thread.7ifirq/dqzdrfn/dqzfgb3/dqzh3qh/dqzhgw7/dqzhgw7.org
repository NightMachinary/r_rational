[[/twistare-r][]] ...alright. So, having a more complete description of the situation has had two effects.

First of all, I feel more than just a little silly. I /really/ should have been able to figure this out (especially since it's not just /student/ but /graduate/ student).

Second of all, I can now certainly see the benefit of graduate student unions. Mind you, specific /implementations/ of graduate student unions can cause problems of various sorts - from your original post, I have reason to believe that your parents will tell you all about such potential issues at great length.

[[/twibeam][]] But a /properly run/ union, whose principal figures are /sensible/ and /sane/, could be a great boon to students in such a situation as you have described, yes. In much the same way as any union can benefit it members.
