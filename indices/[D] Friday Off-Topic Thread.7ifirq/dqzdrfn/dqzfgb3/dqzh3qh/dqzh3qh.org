  What am I missing here?

I think you are unaware of the basic setup that most PhD programs have...

  The students are paying to attend the university, not vice versa

It is the opposite for graduate students. Graduate Students work as Research Assistants and Teaching Assistants are given a tuition waver/scholarship as well a stipend. In my PhD program, we typically only take classes in our first 2-3 years (while working 10-20 hours a week for our professor our first year when we take the most classes, 20-40 hours once we've gotten through the first year), and the remaining 2-3 years are entirely devoted to finishing our thesis and working as an RA or TA (work on our thesis and work as an RA tend to blend together somewhat, a 40 hour work week at minimum is typical).

  it's a way for a large group of employees to put pressure on an employer who's being troublesome by being able to call for a strike.

The arrangement I described can create [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive][perverse incentives]] in some cases. The professor that we work for as an RA, that is providing funding, is almost always also our thesis advisor/mentor. So letting the thesis drag out nets the Professor a RA for a much longer period of time, which only effectively costs the stipend cost, which is cheaper than hiring a Post-Doc/Assistant Professor/Technician. In some labs there is a lot of highly skilled work to be done. The student has no recourse, they are entirely dependent on that professor in order to complete their research and graduate. For me personally, this is not an issue, and I think in my entire program I've only heard of one or two professors where things even started to approach this worst case, but still, there are few protections for student in the the times where it does come up.

In terms of stipend... it tends to be pretty small, especially if you consider the opportunity cost the graduate student takes by entering a PhD program instead of going into a Master program and then getting a well paid job. In so much as a PhD student is worth a someone with a Master's degree, not counting the value of the tuition waver and mentorship from a professor, we are getting vastly underpaid. Of course the education is valuable and the mentorship is priceless, but those aren't things we can live off of... (see the complaints about the GOP tax plan on scholarships for another case where this has come up)
