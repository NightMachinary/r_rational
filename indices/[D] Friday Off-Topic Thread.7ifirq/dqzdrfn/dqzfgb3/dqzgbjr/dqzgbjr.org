You're missing the fact that many graduate students are actually working for the university. They are often teaching assistants or research assistants, or even course instructors. They literally get a paycheck from the university for providing their services in research and teaching, and often have actual employee IDs. So in many cases, graduate students are actually university employees, many believe they should be allowed to form unions just like employees of other companies.
