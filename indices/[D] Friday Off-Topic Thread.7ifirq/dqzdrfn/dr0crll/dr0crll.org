  Does anyone have any opinions on Graduate Student Unionization?

It's a Very Good Thing.

  And that participating in the unionizing could potentially endanger my own scholarship (I am pretty sure that would be retaliation and be very clearly illegal if the university actually did retaliate in anyway like that), or at the very least distract me from my own work (possible, but if anything I would just ignore the process and put in the bare minimum effort of voting).

You should unionize. You're a worker, and you deserve protections as such.
