It actually sounds pretty stupid.

+Graduate students are meant to be slave labor. Take that away, and what's the purpose?+

Unlike actual professions, there is a high level of turnover among graduate students. Who would actually run the union? If you can't find any students with the time and experience to run the union, would you be happy contracting an outside firm to do it for you? Knowing that they'll get part of your (already low) pay?
