Seconding @Perspeculative's post.

I know that I will go through "stupid" phases during the day, depending on what I eat (mostly, kind of protein - sometimes red meat puts me to sleep; and carbs/no carbs, and VERY MUCH sugar/no sugar). So, play around with both what you're eating, and /when/ (ex: intermittent fasting).

What I can't tell is how much this was also going in college, or as I get older and my body responds different, different stuff happens.

Also, do you feel like you're going a million miles an hour, but things aren't sticking? Like you can think super fast, but aren't forming strong memories?
