To me this points to other problems in your life or health. Are you highly stressed? Do you have (even slight) depression? You may just not be someone who learns effectively visually/auditorially; given that there are people who simply don't have a visual imagination (something so foreign to me that I can't imagine how they can function) there is probably some weirdness to your specific experience that we can pin down.

I've often felt incredibly stupid as well, in the sense of making a ton of mistakes even at a seemingly easy job. In my case the cause was that I just wasn't invested or concentrating on (and didn't even have the ability to concentrate on) what I was doing. This was because I apparently had a mental illness, and whether that was the cause or the lack of concentration was a side-effect of medication is a question I just don't know the answer to. But I can understand how you feel.

Do you know about memorisation techniques and how to "study" in such a way as you actually retain the information? There's actual research done on this; I haven't read it but a book to try might be [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick][Make It Stick]].

Otherwise, we probably need more information about other things that might be causing this lack of retention/memory in order to help more.
