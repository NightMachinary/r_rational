  And I want to comment on these threads and go, "it gets better guys", but then I remember I'm a straight woman who is in the nerd/rationalist/etc sphere, so I'm in a pretty good position, supply and demand wise

Damn straight.

  but then I'm like, are there dozens of people like him who never had someone like me find them on OKCupid?

Yup. Makes for [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/327849.html][pretty ugly dynamics]] too.

Honestly, I don't really see what you're describing. Like, I appreciate what you're doing, and I do realize I don't need to be limited to the rationalist community (I mean, I'm French, so that'd be a pretty bad strategy)... but this is a definite problem that I have, and I think you're aware the solutions that applied to you won't apply to me.

I'm not going to solve this merely by meeting people, being kind, and looking less hard for romance. None of the girls I've dated felt like people I would grow to love if I spent enough time with them. I don't know what I'm going to do about this... but eh, I'm awesome. I'll figure something out.
