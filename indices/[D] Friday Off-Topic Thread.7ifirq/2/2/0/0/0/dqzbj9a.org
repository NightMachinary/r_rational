I don't know. I see the other side - I know people IRL who are in the general rationalist sphere and are just... not appealing partners. And I don't mean /for me/, I mean /in general/. And it's not because of anything intrinsic to rationalism; it's because of the stupid stereotypes about autistic neckbeards are based on /something/.

Some of it is stuff that is "entry level" - poor personal hygiene, lack of life skills (i.e. cooking / cleaning / small talk) - and a lot of that I'd imagine the average guy already knows and does. But at the same time I'd imagine that many people think they're OK but they're really not.

I keep on going back to this one guy I know - and he's the archetypical neckbeard stereotype and turned up to like 12. I tried to give him help with his OKCupid profile ("can it be shorter than 10,000 words and not list every mental illness you are diagnosed with?" - "but any woman who loves me needs to love ME for ME!"), grooming ("I just will let my hair and beard grow out then shave them when they're too long. Rinse and repeat once a year. It's EASY")... And none of that would be a problem if he wasn't like "I want nothing more than to be loved but no women want me they're all shallow" and I'm like ARGH you won't do BASIC ENTRY LEVEL stuff to make yourself more appealing to potential partners, what do you expect???

And yeah, that probably colours the way I interpret a lot of other people in the "I want dates but can't get them" lens. I also wonder how much people do the actual pursuing, etc.

Another thing I wonder is whether people are going for people "in their league" - while personality gets you a lot of places, if you're a 2 you're vanishingly unlikely to get with a 9. I once dated a guy who was a 3 and he had always been crushing on 8s or 9s with no success. He has now been living with a fellow 3 for the past 5 years and they have a beautiful cat together. And I wonder if my neckbeard friend, who is a 1, is going after 5s? He had a girlfriend for a while and she was a 2 and that seemed to go well.

Knew another perennially single guy who was depressed about it. I have ended that friendship because of his attitude towards women that came to a head when he got a girlfriend for ~1 month. Just didn't seem to care about her as a person, only interested in whether he could have sex with her. This was a guy I considered my best friend for some 5 years. In retrospect he had a lot of problems - like, he'd groped me once or twice and I really should have just ended the friendship there because that's a much bigger deal. But so we women are socialised.... Ugh.

I'm sure none of this helps at all. But hey, it's how I see the "nerd dating society" in my little millieu.

(And I'm not exactly in the bay area FWIW - I'm in a small city in Australia with no formal rationalist community)
