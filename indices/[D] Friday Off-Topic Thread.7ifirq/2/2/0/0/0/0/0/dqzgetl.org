  Made me wonder for a long time how shallow I am. Still wish I had given her a chance.

We are all shallow people if it helps. But it's a good bias to be aware of when it can impact you and try and not let it get you too much. I was really hesitant about dating my partner because I was 24 and he was 34 and I was really freaked out by the age gap but we hit it off immediately and 5 years later it's a good relationship.

  I always end up going for problem girls. Girls who have problems with their family, or who are lonely, or who had a bad past relationship
#+end_quote

Honestly? That's.... pretty much everyone in the universe. I mean there's degrees of these things and "problems with family" can be "my dad is kind of distant" or "it was so bad I was emancipated at age 11", but you are probably going to end up dating people who are broken in some way... and you are no doubt broken in your own way too.

I can see why you might feel that but that's not my experience, maybe it's just some generalised misanthropy but I am always finding myself getting more and more understanding of people who are different and whatnot.

What really helps me is remembering that everyone is an expert on something.

Kind of an example: one of my favourite conversation techniques when I'm at a party is when someone tells me what their job is and my first thought is "wow, a scent-tester at a perfume factory? that job sounds really easy", I go against that instinct and go "wow! That sounds like it must be really hard." - and people always love talking about how hard their job is and you get to hear about how the perfume scent-tester doesn't just smell things all day but she has to categorise them on 17 different axes and test them against exemplar scents and you get a whole new appreciation for that person and that role in society.

Another example: back in the day when I was a young engineer I was supervising bridge maintenance. Seeing the tradies operate heavy equipment or even just a chainsaw with practised skill and finesse was awe-inspiring to watch. I remember having the same feeling when I was watching someone shape pretzels on an assembly line. I think everyone has something they're good at and practised at?? I don't know.

Anyway that's all come across really touchy-feely kumbayah hasn't it?

Again not sure if any of this helps but I think we're stream of consciousing at each other today so...

I just realised you didn't actually ask me for a critique but I wrote one anyway..... Sorry if it was not wanted, but it's below if it is:

First thing that jumps out at me: you say you speak some English. I would never message someone who didn't speak English fluently unless I shared or wanted to learn their main language (et je parle le français assez bien et je veux l'améliorer, donc pour moi, c'est pas un vrai problème: mais pour les autres filles qui ne parlent pas le français....). So put English as one of your main languages, especially because your profile is /in/ English (depending on the number of French people living where you are I'd probably put a sentence in French in each section, but if there are vanishingly few I probably wouldn't bother).

In general your profile doesn't seem... interesting? Like, if I went on a date with you, I don't know what we'd do. The standard geek standby of playing board games doesn't even come to mind as you don't list favourites. That said, I've not been actively dating for the past 5 years or so, but your profile makes you seem bland when from reading your comments on here you're exactly the sort of person I'd be interested in going on a first date with.

And this sentence confuses me: "I'm really interested in perspectives from people who identify as neuroatypical." - I'm not in that demo so maybe I'm missing some important context, but you don't really specify what sort of perspectives you want (like, I'm getting the feeling that you... want to date neuroatypical peopple? You want to interview them as part of a research project? you want to.... tell them that identifying as neuroatypical is stupid and they are dumb??? any of those). It's just.... weird and not in a good way.

You definitely need much better photos, (how to say this without coming across as a creepy old lady?) - I can tell from looking at the photos that you would probably be my type, looks-wise, but your photos don't make you look appealing? Apparently photos are the most important thing in a profile (sad but true) so that's something you should really focus on improving. OKCupid has a bunch of articles on what works well in profile pics that you might want to check out.
