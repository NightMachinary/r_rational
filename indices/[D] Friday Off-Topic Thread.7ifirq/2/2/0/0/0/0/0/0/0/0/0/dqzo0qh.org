It's hard to see yourself from an "outside perspective"; that's why soliciting feedback is useful.

I hope your situation improves. FWIW in general I think the level 1 advice is good, for level 2 advice you'll need to ask IRL friends who would be able to say "no, actually, you small kind of bad" or "hey I know this great singles bar" or "when yo u talk about X it comes across as Y" or whatever.
