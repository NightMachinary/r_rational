  We are all shallow people if it helps.

  What really helps me is remembering that everyone is an expert on something.

  Honestly? That's.... pretty much everyone in the universe.

Don't take this the wrong way, but you're kind of giving me level 1 advice where I feel like I have level 2 problems :p

And... no, there's definitely a pattern here that I'm not imagining. Almost every single girl I've been with had some variation of "I'm too shy to date" or "I had a bad experience and now I don't want to date anymore".

    "disgusting normal humans"

Let me be clear, that was, like, /at least/ 95% a joke. I'm not misanthropic. I don't have, like, a deep-seated scorn for non-rationalist people or anything. (unless I'm in a really bad mood, but I'm gonna guess that's normal). I realize in retrospect that there are people on that thread who'd say things like that with a perfectly straight face, so, um, my bad for miscommunicating.

  I just realized you didn't actually ask me for a critique but I wrote one anyway...
#+end_quote

Eh, I posted a link, so I was implicitly kind of passive-aggressively asking for one.

Thanks for the feedback :) It does feel pretty spot-on. I'm currently in Korea, so I probably won't touch that profile for a while. Mind if I PM you for advice when I get back to France?

  (et je parle le français assez bien et je veux l'améliorer, donc pour moi, c'est pas un vrai problème: mais pour les autres filles qui ne parlent pas le français....)
#+end_quote

Smooth.

  I'm getting the feeling that you... want to date neuroatypical peopple?
#+end_quote

Yeah. I added that line after I talked with a neuroatypical friend, and I realized that a lot of the qualities I was looking for (a sense of respect for other's boundaries, an understanding of the typical-mind fallacy, basically everything Scott talks about in "Which developmental milestones are you missing?") were either correlated with or easier to see in neuroatypical people. Didn't really think about how it came across.

  That said, I've not been actively dating for the past 5 years or so, but your profile makes you seem bland when from reading your comments on here you're exactly the sort of person I'd be interested in going on a first date with.

  You definitely need much better photos, (how to say this without coming across as a creepy old lady?) - I can tell from looking at the photos that you would probably be my type, looks-wise, but your photos don't make you look appealing?

I'm going to go with vaguely flattered :)
