Man, reading all this stuff depresses me / makes me feel guilty in a really hard to describe manner...

Like, when I was 15-17, I remember /all I wanted in the world/ was a boyfriend. I was bitter that other people had boyfriends and I didn't. I would get mad at people kissing in the street because they were rubbing it in my face. Etc.

Then when I was 18 I went to university, met people, dated a guy there for a year, was single for 8 months, then met my now-husband at the ripe old age of 19. We were the first in our friend group to get married. And we're also poly so as well as my husband I have a boyfriend who I have been with 5 years now.

And I /want/ to comment on these threads and go, "it gets better guys", but then I remember I'm a straight woman who is in the nerd/rationalist/etc sphere, so I'm in a pretty good position, supply and demand wise (and 15 year old me comforted herself with promises that at university she'd be popular and have tons of opportunities for boys).

Then I start thinking of the systemic problems in society, in the rationalist community, etc and the reasons why there aren't more women here.

Anyway - I don't know what I want to say, or why I'm writing this comment. I /want/ to say "I felt that way too but it worked out for me", I also /want/ to say that my boyfriend was 34 years old and never been on a date, been kissed, etc when I met him and he was also in the early stages of recovering from really debilitating OCD, and now he's got me and aren't I wonderful - but then I'm like, are there dozens of people like him who never had someone like me find them on OKCupid?

But if people had told me that when I was 15, young-me would have cried out that that's all well and good but I'm a teenage girl and I want a boyfriend so I feel loved and wanted and /who cares if it will get better i am lonely now/??

So, I guess, at anyone in this thread who is reading this: you are right to be sad and wish you had love and affection. Try and find things that make you happy or fulfilled in general, without a focus on romance. Meet people. Be kind. Treat women with respect, not as an adversary. Accept that culture treats men and women differently, and just because women haven't drunk from the cup at the altar of Yudkowsky that they aren't intelligent rational people who can't some day be just as keen on signing up for cryonics as you are.

I guess that's kind of something to consider - me and my husband have grown up so much together, and changed a lot in that time, but maybe a lot of that was because of how young we were when we met.

(Oh, and when I met my husband, I was like "oh, he's an interesting guy and he lives a five minute drive away. Exams have just finished and we're having our long summer break.I don't think it'll be a long term thing but it'll be fun to have a summer romance" - so you know...).
