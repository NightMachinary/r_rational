I don't know, exactly. I'm kind of operating on the assumption of "I'll know it when I see it".

But basically... I want to be with a girl who tries to get things right? Like, I want someone who doesn't make the same mistakes twice, sees patterns, anticipates problems, knows her limits, takes responsibility for stuff, connects "I should have done X" with "I'll do X next time", etc.
