Dude. Been there. /I am talking directly from this experience/. I have been where you are /so many times/. I know that what I need is a relationship (and, now that I'm dating someone, and can /feel/ the effect that's having, it's just really confirming it). These things are related in that self-care makes you more attractive and they are unrelated in that self-care is required to maintain a successful relationship.

Think over the people you've met that you've wanted to be with. Do you think they're taking care of themselves? Do they seem like they genuinely like and value being the person that they are?

Have you maybe noticed that most of those people are /already in loving relationships/?
