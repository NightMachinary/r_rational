Ah. No, I don't think you signaled "tried the obvious", but you did signal "going for venting" and I just didn't pick up on it.

But I'm the other half of the equation, and it's pretty frequent that I go "do the thing" and people are resistant and then I get them to do the thing and then they're really happy that they did the thing. Your situation fits this pattern.
