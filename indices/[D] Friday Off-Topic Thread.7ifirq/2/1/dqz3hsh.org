Yes.

Here're things that I'd do:

- Do an activity that involves human contact (formal dance, contact improv, acro yoga)
- Become emotionally intimate with friends
- Fall in love with myself
- Remember that unfulfilled needs feel bottomless, but they really aren't.

So, #1 and #2 help deal with #4. Sometimes what you're feeling is that lack of deep human contact, and all you really need is that.

And then #3 is really the important one.

An important thing to realize is that there is no closer or longer relationship than the one you have with yourself. There's a lot of ways this looks, but a good perspective is the meditative one: there's you, there's the you guiding that you, etc. Another perspective is: if "treat yo self, don't cheat yo self", who's doing the treating? So, treat yourself well. (And notice what only makes you feel doing, vs what feels good having done.)

A method that is working for me is that, having gotten some kind of fit / in shape, and having learned how to take better care of my hair (and otherwise paying more attention to grooming), I can just stare at myself in the mirror thinking "Damn, but I look good.".

As for emotional techniques... I mean, you'll hear a bunch, but meditate. Not the "clear your mind", etc etc, but the "take dedicated time to check in with your insides". If your computer is acting off, you'll check it's vitals, right? What excess programs are running that don't need to be? Is the temperature good on all the different chips? Is the hard drive well organized or fragmented? That kind of thing.

This practice also works - and you won't expect it to, and it'll start off sucking - when you're feeling things, sit with and dive into those feelings - [and for me] then start saying stuff. I had an event a month ago where I kept breaking down into short lived sobs, and then all of a sudden I said a thing and I realized that /that/ was I was upset about. Having named and realized it, I immediately started feeling better. Like River Tam, it's not the contents of the secret, but that you don't know what you know that drives you up the wall.

Finally - Tripper 101: If you don't like what's happening, start changing things. Then remember Rationality 101: Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change. In other words, pick things to change and start changing them; you do not have to and will not get anything right "the first time". Can you re-arrange where you live to be nicer to you? Can you change your activities to better match what leaves you feeling good / bad? Can you change the people in your life?
