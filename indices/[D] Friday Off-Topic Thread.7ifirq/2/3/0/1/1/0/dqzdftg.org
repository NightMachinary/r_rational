I generally expect people to mouseover (or long-press on) links before following them, rather than clicking (or tapping) with wild abandon into the great unknown.

  "Worthy" has the wrong connotations here.

"Worthy (in the opinion of a typical person)", then.

  And for having been there when you were doing the conversation sheet thing, I wouldn't qualify it as either materialistic or sociopathic (but definitely misguided).

  Giving up on being better isn't okay just because you recognize that you're giving up.

Actually, I'm pretty sure it is. There's definitely a consensus that /r9k/ (not self-aware) is worse than [[/r/mgtow][r/mgtow]] (self-aware). I distinctly remember seeing (in [[/r/all][r/all]]) a post on [[/r/justneckbeardthings][r/justneckbeardthings]] in which people were applauding the subject of the screenshot for acknowledging how pathetic he was.

In any event, there's no point in being "better" if your /own/ happiness is not increased in the process. An endless treadmill of farming money, accolades, or smiles to attract people from whom you'll get next to nothing of value to you does /not/ automatically increase your happiness. (t. Howard Roark)

In the jargon of this subreddit's denizens (I think): Expected utility is outweighed by expected effort.
