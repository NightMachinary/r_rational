  Accept that your desires will remain unfulfilled, and it's your fault (1 point)
#+end_quote

I accept that many of my desires remain unfulfilled, but I don't see why I should blame myself. Or others for failing to meet my expectations. Not when the one at fault is clearly the world itself!

The laws of biology. The laws of physics. The laws of natural selection! All heinous villains, thwarting my every desire.

I desire to soar through the skies, but the laws of physics drags me down with gravity!

I desire to be healthy without exercise or eating healthy foods, but the laws of biology are trying to kill me!

I desire to be desired by potential mates despite my unattractiveness, but the law of natural selection means that any creatures attracted to beings like me have long since died out!
