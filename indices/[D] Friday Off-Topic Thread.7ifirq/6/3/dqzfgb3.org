I'm not entirely sure what the point of university students unionising is. I mean, I get the point of /unions/ in general - it's a way for a large group of employees to put pressure on an employer who's being troublesome by being able to call for a strike.

But - perhaps I'm just being dense here - I don't quite see the point of university students going on strike. The students are paying to attend the university, not vice versa - and if a student really wants to object to a university being completely beyond the pale, he need merely withdraw from his classes to deny the university his money.

What am I missing here?
