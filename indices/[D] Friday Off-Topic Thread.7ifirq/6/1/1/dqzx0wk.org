Keep in mind that for PhD programs, the programs tend not to be very big... my program, which is very well funded and thus fairly big, takes in around 7-10 new students per year, while another program, peripherally associated with mine only takes in one to two new students per year. For the most part, my program director is already on our side, so to speak, so there is no need to influence her as a program. Organizing at the level of program is simply too small for the overall university administration to have to care, and it is the administration we would need to affect to change some of the larger overall policies.

  Why should the Biology students take action when the Physics students have a dispute?

  so there's no fear of replacement workers coming in.

I think there is actually just enough overlap to make it relevant in the case of TAs. A math student and a physics student might be able to effectively TA in the place of each other for many undergraduate level courses, for instance. A psychology student and a neuroscience student might both be able to TA for a cognitive psychology class. You are right that the issues that affect sufficiently disparate programs might be pretty different... a literature RA and a biology RA might have totally different types of work and working conditions/issues. However the overall idea, as with all unions, is to make a collective bargaining units, so for instance the Biology students know they have enough solidarity that administration can't just decide to punish them by cutting all of their TA position and replacing them with a mix of TAs from related programs.

In the case of RAs, the idea of striking in the first place is almost absurd... their work to graduate and get published often heavily if not completely overlaps with their work as an RA. So striking delays their own publications and graduation. In the event their professor has mismanaged their work heavily, it is possible that their may be some disconnect between their thesis work and their work as an RA, but this is an unusual case in my experience.
