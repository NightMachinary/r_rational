I've been meaning to recommend this book for a while, but never got around to writing the post. The book is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control][Version Control by Dexter Palmer]].

It's, hands down, one of the best books I've ever read. It's a sci-fi magical realism deconstruction/"parody/pastiche". I don't think it quite qualifies as "rational" since it has an element of "magical realism," and I'm not even sure that it's /internally/ consistent. But it definitely /deconstructs/ the genre of magical realism by giving it a sci-fi veneer. Part of the great thing about the sci-fi part is that except for the causality violation device, all the technology is a reasonable extrapolation of what's available today. It's a future that, barring the "time-travel," could really happen. It's a vision of multiple dystopias within one book, and a look at how our choices change depending on the circumstances. I really cannot even put down succinctly in words how good the book is, it's one of those works that, like impressionist art, must be experienced first-hand.

It can be a heavy read. It is, IMO, "Literature" although I haven't read much to compare. But there's just /so much/ you can get out of the book that I'm amazed the author fit it all into one novel. And that is definitely something I look for in a book: that it is well-structured and well-written. Both are the case here.

I've seen on here someone mentioned what they call "perfect" works; this is as close to that as I've ever seen. (Although how I would describe it is it's at a "local optimum": there can be "better" works in an absolute sense, but for what it is, it is incredibly good.)

Highly recommend you read it if it sounds at all appealing. It's probably particularly relevant if you're part of the 20-35 age group.
