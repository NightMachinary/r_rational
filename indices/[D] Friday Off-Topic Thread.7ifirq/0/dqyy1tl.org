What do you guys think about [[https://blog.patreon.com/updating-patreons-fee-structure/][Patreon's recent change in fee sturcture]]?

I think it's a very shitty thing they did. They had a good system of batching pledges to reduce the impact of fees, now they decided to de-aggregate them, screwing over small pledges (each $1 pledge now costs the patron $1.38, almost 40% fee) seemingly to cater to creators who are interested not in small voluntary subscriptions for otherwise free content, but in gating content behind pay walls of more substantial pledges, basically operation a more traditional pay2play business. And they try to present it as concern for creators. I mean, technically, yes, it is concern for creators, but it appears to be only for a specific subset of creators with a specific business model.

UPD: Also an [[https://brianbalfour.com/essays/patreon-onboarding-growth][interesting article]] was unearthed during the shitstorm shining light on Patreon's priorities. How do you like this language for example:

  But at Patreon, a big drop-off could actually mean something good is happening -- unqualified leads are getting weeded out.
