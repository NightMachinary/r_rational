I think it's terrible - about a third of my patrons give $1 and another third $2; I'm in that "saying thanks for free content" category you mentioned. /If/ pledge behaviour isn't changed by this stupid fee structure, I'll get more money, but (a) I think that's missing the point as I don't want to trick anyone, and (b) of course it will ouch people to freer larger pledges.

So I'm going to look for an alternative platform - there's nothing to stop me using two, after all.
