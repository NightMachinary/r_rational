[[https://d.rip/][Kickstarter's Drip]] which is supposed to launch soon looked promising, but it looks like they want to charge each pledge individually too, so it would be the same rip off on small pledges, only passed onto creators, not patrons. We'll see what they actually do, maybe they'll implement some mitigating features, like an internall wallet you can fill periodically in large batches and pay out of that without/with smaller fees. UPD: It seems for small pledges Kikcstarter offers a much better fee of 5% + $.05, so even without any additional measures it should be an improvement over Patreon's new exorbitance.
