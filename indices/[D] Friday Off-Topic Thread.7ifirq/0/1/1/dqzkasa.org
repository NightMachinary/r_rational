  It seems like a solution to too high transaction fees is to reduce the number of transactions. It also (mostly) solves the patron's issues with being double-charged as far as I can tell.

Exactly, instead they increase the number of transactions to make it "like any other subscription service". The batching of charges to reduce fees was one of the reasons to use Patreon. Right now as they want it there's no reason not to just pay your voluntary subscriptions through PayPal directly (it seems PayPal fees will be smaller than Patreon's new ones for all charges less than $14.3). Other than the fact that Patreon is also a DRM system for perks, so if you want your perks, you better pay through Patreon.
