That graph is sketchy. They're drawing "2.9% + $0.35" as smaller than 5%, despite the usual low amounts being pledged.

EDIT: they also switched the color scheme and labeling order, and distorted the lengths. The amounts they're showing are 80% take-home + 15% Transaction Fees + 5% Patreon Fees (vs. labels of "85-93%", "2-10%", and "5%") for the first graph, which is flat-out wrong. The second graph is 95%(91.7) take-home + 5%(4.8) Patreon fees + 3.6%(3.4) Transaction fees. Normalized percentages to add to 100 are in brackets. These lengths /are/ correct, but only for single payments of exactly $50.00. Any less, and the $0.35 becomes more significant and the portion paid in fees becomes greater.

Why not just prorate the monthly subscriptions when you sign up in the middle? For example, if you want to pledge $10/month starting on the 20th, you pay $10 immediately, then $10 * 10/31 = $3.23 on the 1st, then $10 on the first every other month. If you then sign up with a second person, you pay $X whenever, then then pay then pay $10 + $X * Y/30 on the 1st of the next month, and $10 + X each month after that.

It seems like a solution to too high transaction fees is to reduce the number of transactions. It also (mostly) solves the patron's issues with being double-charged as far as I can tell.

Thinking more about it, this seems to go against one core part of Patreon's purpose. (I haven't used Patreon, so please correct me if I'm wrong.) Before I could support 10 creators and only pay one processing fee: now I can't. Before, I could create content for an audience of 20 people and pay only one processing fee: now I can't. I'm not seeing the advantages compared to directly paying creators and cutting out the middleman.
