Ah, you beat me to posting this. This is going to cause me to drop all my small pledges. I use Patreon because it is easy and I'd rather give small consistent support then throw a one off lump sum. Now I am considering cutting out the middle man and take the time to donate the next 6 or so months directly to everyone I'm dropping while this whole thing settles.
