I honestly think I might literally be in Hell, like I already died and I've been doomed to live this shitty life over and over again.

Was walking outside to smoke, heard water, investigated. Pipe connected to the water tank had a leak, woke mom up out of a dead sleep because I thought for some reason that she would be able to help me with the situation, but because her brain was still 90% asleep she didn't just hold the pipe in place she wiggled it violently back and forth and that disconnected the corroded screw from the tank and the entire pipe was no lnonger connected to the tank and I had to have my brother hold the pipe and force it downwards to stymie the water while I begged Google for an answer and STILL just GALLONS of water ended up on the floor and every towel in the house is ruined, I couldn't find the shutoff valve outside and ended up literally calling 911 because the chaos made it impossible to think and the operator told me to just shut off the power to the water pump at the breaker box instead of trying to find the water shut off valve...

I don't expect anyone to see this or respond to it, I just needed to type it to expel it from my brain so I can move on. I wanna scream, I guess this'll have to suffice.
