I don't know if things are different where you are, but I do know that if something like this were to happen to me, then once I'd dealt with the immediate aftermath (i.e. turned off the water and gone around towelling up the worst of it) I'd have to then get hold of my home insurance provider to ask about getting a replacement done.

...I certainly hope your home in insured, because this sounds like /exactly/ the sort of thing one needs home insurance for.
