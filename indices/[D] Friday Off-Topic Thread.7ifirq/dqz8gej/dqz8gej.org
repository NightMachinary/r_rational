Didn't get an interview for the job I was hoping to get an interview for (gave myself 50% chance of interview) :(

Got an interview for the job I'm currently doing though :) it's Wednesday. Fingers crossed I get the job. If I fuck up the interview I won't get the job even though I've been doing it for ~3 years. Also means that I'll have to work alongside whoever /did/ get the job which is going to be kind of humiliating.

Regardless of whether I get my job or not I'm going to be looking elsewhere around the organisation for something else. Fortunately my job's a lot better than it was even a month ago (... I have an intern to supervise which is great experience).
