Not to keep. It's complicated because I work for the government.

Basically I have job A, which pays $X per week. I'm actually doing job B which pays $X+$15 per week. There's an opening in job B, but because of the rules about hiring people, they can't just offer me job B; I have to apply for it, which means that dozens of people probably wrote resumes and three page essays on how good they are at traffic engineering (yes, really, that was part of the application) for a job that is /basically/ going to go to me unless I really fuck up the interview (and it does happen).

I need job B because job A will pay $X forever, but next year in job B I'll go from earning $X+$15 to $X+$100 per week, and the year after that another $100pw, for a few more years. And job B is a more prestigious job on paper so it will help me apply for job C down the road...

If I fail the application I keep doing job A, someone else is brought on to do job B, and I have to hope another job B opens up (there's a limited number of job B's: this job B is open because a colleague is leaving).

So worst case scenario my life stays as it is now.
