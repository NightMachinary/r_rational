I've seen similar situations happen before. Based on such situations, I'm going to guess that MagicWeasel's boss weasel retired or left the company, and MagicWeasel thus became Acting Boss Weasel as a 'temporary measure' (i.e. taking on boss weasel's work along with her own, with or without a bump in salary). Now, about three years later, WeaselCorp is actually getting around to officially hiring a replacement Boss Weasel, and MagicWeasel has applied for the job. Both she and the interviewers are perfectly aware that she's been doing the job for the past few years, and therefore she is capable, which gives her a distinct interviewing advantage, but there are reasons why she might still fail the interview (such as a New Weasel applying for the job who has a massive long list of relevant degrees and experience and/or an Uncle Weasel in Top Management). Nonetheless, fair employment laws prevent anyone from being appointed on a permanent basis without going through an interview, so therefore MagicWeasel must be interviewed.

All subject to correction from the Weasel herself, of course, but that's what I'd expect to be the case.
