Oh come on, that's caricaturing me and you know it.

But otherwise, Neurodiversity is a thing. My point is, you don't need to be "sane" by society's standards, or to follow arbitrary rules like "You have to be depressed all the time and think about the heat death of the universe", you just need to have a brain that works. In that framework, mental illness is only stuff that impacts your life negatively, whether it's hallucinations or paranoia or whatever.

Otherwise, there are no rules, you just find what kind of person you want to be and how to be that person. Hence, "mental health is whatever you need it to be".
