  An important thing to realize is that there is no closer or longer relationship than the one you have with yourself. There's a lot of ways this looks, but a good perspective is the meditative one: there's you, there's the you guiding that you, etc. Another perspective is: if "treat yo self, don't cheat yo self", who's doing the treating? So, treat yourself well. (And notice what only makes you feel doing, vs what feels good having done.)

I realize that you may have a different perspective than I have, and that taking care of yourself is important and healthy.

But /*fuck that noise*/. My problem isn't that I don't understand myself, my problem is that I'm lacking a soulmate. I'm gonna keep looking for one, and I'm going to keep feeling a crushing emptiness in my heart until then. The day I start ignoring / rationalizing that pain away is the day I lower my standards, and the day I lower my standards is the day I die.
