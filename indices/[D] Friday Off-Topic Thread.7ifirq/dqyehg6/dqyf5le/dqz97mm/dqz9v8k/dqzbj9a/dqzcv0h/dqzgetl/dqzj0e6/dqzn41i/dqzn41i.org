  Don't take this the wrong way, but you're kind of giving me level 1 advice where I feel like I have level 2 problems :p

Oh come on I'm somehow managing to look like I'm coming onto you in the process :/

I feel like people who need level 1 advice don't take it (c.f. my friend who won't shave regularly or at least invest in a beard trimmer). So they keep hearing it and keep not taking it and nobody wins I guess.

Like, "how do I get a girlfriend?" - "work on yourself to be desireable then do activities where you might meet someone who will find you desireable" - "yeah I already know that where's your level 2 advice" - "oh okay here's my ONE WEIRD TRICK for getting a girlfriend"... Like sometimes it really is that simple, you know? Or just about putting more time in/waiting? I don't know, that probably sounds like more stupid level 1 advice so....

  I realized that a lot of the qualities I was looking for (a sense of respect for other's boundaries, an understanding of the typical-mind fallacy, basically everything Scott talks about in "Which developmental milestones are you missing?") were either correlated with or easier to see in neuroatypical people. Didn't really think about how it came across.

Yeah, writing (basically) "I want to date mentally ill people" does not come across that way at all. I'd honestly replace the part about neuroatypical people with the bracketed explanation why as then it dosn't make you look like some weird predator who is preying on vulnerable people (at worst) and instead just someone who is the way you are.
