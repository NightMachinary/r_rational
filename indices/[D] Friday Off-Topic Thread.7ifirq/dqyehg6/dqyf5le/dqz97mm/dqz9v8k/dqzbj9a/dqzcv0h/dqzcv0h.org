  And none of that would be a problem if he wasn't like "I want nothing more than to be loved but no women want me they're all shallow" and I'm like ARGH you won't do BASIC ENTRY LEVEL stuff to make yourself more appealing to potential partners, what do you expect???

Eh, [[https://www.okcupid.com/profile/NarrateurDuChaos][my profile]] is "nerdy but hygienic". The worst part is a bunch of Star Wars references, and a photo where I'm scowling at the camera. (... wow, why did I think this was a good idea again?)

  Another thing I wonder is whether people are going for people "in their league" - while personality gets you a lot of places, if you're a 2 you're vanishingly unlikely to get with a 9.

Yeah. I do remember one summer camp, where I kept going after a 7 colleague, and ignoring a 1 colleague that went after me. I mean, I don't think we'd have connected that well emotionally... but I'd have connected even less with the girl I was going for. It was also kind of cruel of me.

Made me wonder for a long time how shallow I am. Still wish I had given her a chance.

But anyway. I don't know how appealing I am personality-wise. But in recent years, I've started to get dates.

And I'm starting to realize I always end up going for problem girls. Girls who have problems with their family, or who are lonely, or who had a bad past relationship... and I don't know if I keep going for them because I'm more appealing to them, or I (sub)consciously think "I have a comparative advantage here!" or because they're easier to get and I'm not attractive to anyone else, or I'm just attracted by a project. (well, obviously it's all 4, but I'm wondering which is most important)

So... I dunno. I can, with a lot of effort and people-wrangling, get a date, and maaaaybe sometimes get some sex (without going into details, not very frequent), but that's not something I want long term. I read a post a few days ago by a girl on [[/r/relationship][r/relationship]] who complained about how her boyfriend was unreasonable and asked how she could better communicate with him. I asked for an example conversation, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gt9jf/i_need_tips_on_how_to_communicate_better/dqlnx2u/][she copy-pasted one]], and... the thing is, in that conversation she did everything mostly right. The guy was just unreasonable; she could have handled him better, but it would always have been a chore.

So I feel like my situation is a bit like that girl's (but less extreme). I can find girls, and get an emotional connection with them, but it's kind of fake and it only lasts as long as I pour effort into it.

And that aside... I've met people with the rationalist spark. I didn't know they even existed before I read HP:MoR, but now I've met them, both online and IRL. I know they exist, I know how to recognize them, and I know there's a world of difference between them and... these... disgusting normal humans. Like, seriously, once you have seen the difference between someone with the spark and someone without it, you just can't be satisfied with someone who doesn't have it. It just jumps in your face.
