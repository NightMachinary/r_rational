  I feel like people who need level 1 advice don't take it

Okay, yes, that makes sense. It's a trust thing, I guess: either the person who receives the advice has to trust the other that the obvious advice they're giving does apply despite how obvious it is, or the person who gives the advice has to trust that the other is already aware of the entry-level stuff and it won't help.

And, I kind of think I'm in the second category? Like, I think I'm basically pareto optimal on a certain level: I can get more skilled, I can get better at presenting myself (obviously), and there are social dynamics I'm trying to figure out; but, as far as the basic "shave yourself", "realize that everyone's a little shallow", "remember that people are flawed but have hidden depth" things go... I think I'm doing okay, or even better than average?

I mean, it's not about giving advice that's new or original; advice doesn't get stale, it's just... I feel like I'm doing as well as I'm ever going to (or close) in most obvious categories. I'm not saying you shouldn't give that advice on general principles, mind you, I appreciate it, and the okcupid stuff /is/ helpful.

I realize that I may have come across like I'm desperate for some magic solution, but I'm not. At worst, I'm bitter that the situation I'm in sucks, but I do intend to solve it through non-insane self-improvement.

  then it dosn't make you look like some weird predator who is preying on vulnerable people (at worst) and instead just someone who is the way you are.

But but but what if deep down I'm just some weird predator who is preying on vulnerable people and I want vulnerable people to know I appreciate them? /jk

Yeah, looking back, it does make me sound a little like a devotee. Food for thoughts.
