Yeah, I'm going through one of those weeks.

The thing is, my standards are pretty specific, so I do expect finding a long-term romantic partner to be ridiculously hard. Like, of all the people I've met (in person), the number of guys I felt an emotional / intellectual kinship with can be counted on two hands at most. The number of girls is... basically zero, that I remember.

Some days I feel like I empathize a lot with HPMoR's Quirrel.
