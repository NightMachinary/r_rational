  - Am I worthy of affection? No: Assessments of me have ranged from "too materialistic" to "sociopath".
#+end_quote

"Worthy" has the wrong connotations here. And for having been there when you were doing the conversation sheet thing, I wouldn't qualify it as either materialistic or sociopathic (but definitely misguided).

  - Am I worthy of admiration? No: My programming endeavors are quite meager (whatever some CK2 modders may say), and nothing else that I do is even worth mentioning.

  - Am I willing to work toward becoming admirable? No: I have little incentive to write a giant overhaul mod for CK2, become licensed as a professional engineer, or learn Lojban.
#+end_quote

Oh come on. Everyone's programming endeavors are meager for a while. I'm in the 4th year of a coding bootcamp / engineer school, and "made a few mods in a game, has sound reasoning and a good work ethic" is already somewhat above average.

I could say stuff like, you're the master of your own world, you're can improve as long as you try, but I don't think that's your problem.

  - Am I willing to work toward seeming nice? No: I lack the creativity and the patience for full-time, long-term lying.
#+end_quote

/That's/ your problem. Fuck that. I know I was ranting about lowering your standards five minutes ago, but working on yourself isn't the same thing as long-term lying.

You have this idea that your laziness, your social ineptitude are part of who you are, and if you want to be true to yourself you have to accept these things. Fuck that. You can do better, learn social rules, do sport, study harder and still be yourself. Giving up on being better isn't okay just because you recognize that you're giving up.
