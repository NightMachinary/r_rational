  If you want it in technical terms: it's an implicit contract to be nice and supportive with each other. The point of it is that you get people who you can reasonably expect to be nice and supportive with you.

Yay! Two people pretend to care about each other's lives!! How enchanting, dattebayo!!! (Insert the most skeptical ISHYGDDT reaction image in your maymay folder here.)

  Random person, speaking: I feel so bad, ToaKraka! I got a bad performance review at my job, because I kept accidentally using the wrong date format. What if they fire me? How will I be able to afford that Magic tournament that's coming up?

  ToaKraka, thinking: I don't care about Magic. I don't care about your job. I don't care about /you/. Why am I listening to this drivel when I could be converting /GURPS Space/ to HTML?

  ToaKraka, speaking: Well, I'm sure it can't be too hard to use a consistent date format. Just copy whatever they give you. And, you know, the Magic scene is getting worse and worse. It might be better to investigate /GURPS/...

I'm not interested in a "fake it till you make it" scheme.
