  I generally expect people to mouseover (or long-press on) links before following them, rather than clicking (or tapping) with wild abandon into the great unknown.

Okay fine. But it doesn't matter what you expect, because people who read this subreddit don't know what you expect, they know the accepted social rule that NSFW links are marked as such, precisely so they don't need to worry about that. Please mark your link.

  Yeah, sure, whatever.

I'm not sure what's your point here. There are other advantages/perks/reasons for being friends other than being able to ask each other trivia questions or knowing that they won't use the singular they.

If you want it in technical terms: it's an implicit contract to be nice and supportive with each other. The point of it is that you get people who you can reasonably expect to be nice and supportive with you.
