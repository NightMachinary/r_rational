Anyone else ever kinda sat there and just stewed in the midst of what may be a slight breakdown over the complete lack of romantic affection in their lives? Like of course, statistically speaking, finding a romantic partner if your standards aren't very deviant (sexual or otherwise) shouldn't be /that/ difficult.

But that's certainly the case sometimes. Sigh.

Ah well.
