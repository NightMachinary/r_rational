It's fine. I read something about cycling the HVAC between cooling (because the air conditioner pulls moisture out of the air) and heating (because the newly warm air will pull moisture out of the environment to resaturate itself with water). Wasn't comfortable cycling between 65 and 80 degrees, but it seems to have worked. We also stuck a fan in there and pointed it at the floor for like half a week.
