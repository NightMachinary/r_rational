And what if we have literally zero monies left to invest in this particular problem? We just went to Lowes and spent fifty bucks we didn't really have on replacement parts and tools (luckily the screw only /looks/ like it's built into the tank so we don't have to spend $300 on a new tank, we bought a pipe wrench so I'll be able to pull out the screw and replace it (also, apparently it's not a screw, it's called a heat trap nipple)).

The tank is located in a small room, like 5x7 feet, and it gets pretty warm in there if you close the door. Could we get away with cranking the thermostat up a few degrees?
