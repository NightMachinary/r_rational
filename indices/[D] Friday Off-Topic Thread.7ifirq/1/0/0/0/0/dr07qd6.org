That makes a lot more sense than what I thought you were saying, but to be fair, the situation had my brain burnt out.

Thankfully, the water pump got shut off before we got to the state of "flooded." We piled every towel in the house around the base of the tank and wrapped towels around the pipe-to-tank connection that was no longer connected, so those absorbed a lot of the water and acted as a funnel so instead of going literally everywhere we were able to control the flow and direct it at a couple of large buckets, which ended up collecting about a gallon each. There was probably only about 5 gallons of water on the floor when we started piling towels around the base and they managed to absorb most of it, and after I removed my mother from the situation and replaced her with my brother, the water flow decreased dramatically. We've also got a concrete slab foundation and no carpeting. I think we're getting away with zero water damage, and only have to worry about the water tank itself. The screw that the pipe connects to is built into the tank, and said screw is extremely corroded. If we can't fix that connection, we're gonna have to replace the entire tank, and I've just woken up so I haven't started looking up what to do about it yet, haven't even eaten yet.
