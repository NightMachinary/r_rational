Hm. Alright, I think I can figure out something like that. I know it's doable since it's a variation on word sequence-to-sequence (particularly languages like Ruby).

AFAIK, the goal of the architecture would be to allow layers to figure out the possible symbols, just like the CV nets figure out features/edges/etc. But, I'm also talking about of ignorance.
