Nah, NN all the way. This is part of a multi-stage plan; this part is about figuring out how to make unsupervised, exploratory systems.

What does it take to make something that, when given a black box, can explore the possible input/outputs of that black box?

Given that I'm still new to NN, but from what I know, reinforcement learning does not require training sets, but something akin to the fitness function of a genetic algo. Perhaps even exactly the same thing.
