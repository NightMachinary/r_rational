Sort of! I think any error will be 0, any success will be 1, at least to start. (where success is "did make sound").

Subsequent modifications I've got in my mind are scoring based on symbol count, GAN against existing music, etc. If anyone knows good ways to auto-detect certain music metrics, that'd be great!
