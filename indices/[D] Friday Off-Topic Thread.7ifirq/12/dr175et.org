*Looking for particular story*

I'm looking for a story I read that was featured on this sub reddit, but I can't recall the name, only the content of one of the narrative threads up to a point. I hope you can help me ferret out the story. So here goes nothing:

Teenagers are living in a rotating habitat, which is relatively aged already, and discover an kind of well or bunker that leads into the underground (towards the outer shell of the habitat). At the end of the bunker, behind a thick sheet of cracked glass of some sort, they find an unused docking bay that's worked into the outer shell of the habitat. They make the control room for this bay their hangout, and one of them starts the work to get the bay running again. At some point some of them dangle out of the bay just for fun, at least at first.
