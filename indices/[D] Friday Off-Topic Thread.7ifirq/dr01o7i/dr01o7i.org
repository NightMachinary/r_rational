I recently backed the [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneshotpodcast/a-woman-with-hollow-eyes/rewards][Kickstarter for the RPG Actual Play campaign A Woman With Hollow Eyes]] and there's still 3 days for you to as well. It's been fully funded, stars professional improvisers from the One Shot and Campaign podcasts, and features a new RPG called Invisible Sun that combines the best parts of Welcome to Night Vale and The Matrix.

I was super hesitant about this because I knew so little about the project and game system going in, and was convinced such an idea was way too good to be true and would end up just being weird and pretentious, but then I listened to [[https://youtu.be/II8MpLIEh20][their world/character building session]] and [[https://overcast.fm/+BIYnVjCrU][the character vignettes from their first roleplaying session]] and was blown away.

This is the greatest piece of emergent storytelling I've ever seen. The atmosphere is fantastic, the characters feel all too human, the world is surprisingly rational despise the surrealism, and the fact that it's *all improvised* is an astonishing achievement. This is something more people should know about both for its uniqueness and excellence. There are scripted audio dramas I've loved that weren't as good as this.

All the play sessions will be streamed on Twitch, where they will allow viewers to interact with the game, and then released to everyone through One Shot's podcast feed and YouTube channel. Backing the Kickstarter just gives them more money for the production and gives you the opportunity to participate in the project. If you have even a vague interest in anything I've said, this is worth checking out.
