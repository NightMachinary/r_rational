That sounds like a really rough situation. I'm not an expert on these things. However, if you have easy and relatively affordable access to healthcare professionals (via insurance or if you are in a country with socialized medicine) I think that a doctor would be able to help you a lot. I've heard that symptoms like these can be related to nutritional issues, sleep issues, various diseases, or ADD, all of which can be treated worked around better once you know what they are.

One of my friends who had similar symptoms went to a doctor and found out he had a sleep disorder where he would wake up several times during the night without realizing it, causing him to always be fatigued and therefore not on his mental A-game. After he got treatment (which turned out to mostly involve changing his sleeping conditions) things changed a lot for him.

Not sure how much of this will apply to you, but sometimes a doctor can be a hue help for this.
