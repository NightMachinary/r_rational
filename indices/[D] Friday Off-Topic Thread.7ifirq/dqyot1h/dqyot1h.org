I've recently gotten my first “job” as an unpaid bank intern.

And while even doing that much did wonders in regards to solving some of the problems I've been fruitlessly struggling with for years, there's still that one thing that I just don't see any ways of overcoming, dealing with.

My comprehension skills suck, I think. Looking back now, I had this problem standing on my way as far back as during my later school years. I have trouble with understanding and digesting new information, with converting it into knowledge that would be available to me on my “fast-thinking” lane. When I have to understand and learn new information, either the progress is happening way too slowly (for instance nowadays it can be as bad as barely managing to go through just several pages of material per day), or my mind just blanks out when I'm trying to read the text (for instance, sometimes I can't even force myself to comprehend what's being said in relatively simpler paragraphs, and this state of stupidly staring at the page in front of me can last for several hours straight).

And now I have to yet again face the same damn thing that has been poisoning my life experience during both my school and university years. I just don't see how I'll be able to learn all the laws and internal protocols that are expected for the employees to learn with a ”handicap” like this.

Maybe my brain (or me myself) is just being lazy, maybe I'm doing something wrong (with food, with my daily routine, etc), I don't know. I just want to be able to absorb the damn infodumps the way other people are seemingly able to do /while/ they're also managing to maintain at least some kind of a private life and not go to sleep at 21:00-22:00 to keep being functional the next day.

I've tried using the pomodoro technique, but because of the slow progress speeds mentioned earlier one interval can only manage to cover several paragraphs, making me lose the train of thought. And the constant inability to understand what's laid down in front of me and the constant feeling of being stupid are making me almost physically sick of reading educational materials altogether, to the point that I can barely force myself to get back to reading them the next time.

What can I do to improve my situation? At least problems like having poor social skills, etc are of such a nature that you can at least grasp in what ways they can possibly be solved.

With this, I'm just out of ideas. I just feel stupid and like if I'll not be able to find at least /some/ kind of a solution to this, this will be blocking my perspectives for the remainder of my life.

Any advice?
