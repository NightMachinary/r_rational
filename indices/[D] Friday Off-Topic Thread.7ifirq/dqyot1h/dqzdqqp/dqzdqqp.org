Have you tried to ask to get someone to assist you full-time until you're up-to-date on the rules (whether an employee or another intern)? It might help with your concentration problems if you can say "I'm drawing a blank here, can you explain with different words?"

Your boss may or may not agree to dedicate one guy only to help you, but there's no harm in asking. In general, managers are aware that getting a new employee up to date in a company is both harder and more important than it looks, so there's good odds they'll send at least some help your way if you're struggling.
