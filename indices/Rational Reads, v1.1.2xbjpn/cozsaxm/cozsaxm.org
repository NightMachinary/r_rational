One thing I'm noticing as I browse around -- some of the entries already have "lit-up" stars as though I've rated them, but I haven't. One example would be [[http://rationalreads.com/#/works/71][Chanson De Geste]] which claims that I've rated it five stars, when in fact I've never even heard of it.
