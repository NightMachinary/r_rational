I found it, but I didn't notice it at first. It might be more noticeable if you put the filter directly under "All Works" or change the color or font size or something. A suggestion: when you change filter categories, the list doesn't go back to the first page as you would expect it to. If you were on the second page of the old filter categories then when you change the categories you end up on the second page of the new categories.
