One thing I would like is to see an Amazon-style breakdown of the ratings. (5-star x4, 3 star x5, 1 star x1, etc)

Something else: profiles of the users so that we can see what works they have rated and what ratings they gave them. This would function like a reputation / matching system, where you could identify people who had tastes similar to your own and follow them.
