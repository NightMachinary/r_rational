About that when I was on my "adding rationalish fiction" binge I skimmed the list for the works which met my criteria and added them to the site. The only ones I didn't add were a music song about the elimination of smallpox and a confusing one about Twitter posts.

If someone wants to add RationalReads to the Rational Fiction page, then it'll have to be someone other than me because I'm not a Troper.
