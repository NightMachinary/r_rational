I highly recommend the manga, the artstyle is insanely good, and the artist (Murata) is insanely talented and hardworking.

Here's a link to the chapter that takes place right after the first season of the anime, if you don't want to read the same stuff as in the anime. [[http://ww3.readopm.com/chapter/one-punch-man-chapter-038/][Here]]

While most manga/anime have boring bonus/filler episodes/chapters, one punch man has very interesting chapters that are disconnected from the main story, like a spin off. You can read them in any order side they're disconnected.
