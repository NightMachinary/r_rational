Yeah, I've actually already read metropolitan man, I really liked the part where lex calculated the average amount of lead in the ground to determine how far superman can see into the earth. Even if the ending was a little depressing and somewhat anticlimactic, I did like it.

I think superman probably could survived just by slowing down his perception of time and pushing down the wall (so that he would be cut up by little pieces of kryptonite)/breaking it with the table (same reason) instead of blasting through it though. The fact that he could blast through the wall shows that he wasn't that weakened yet.

I also really enjoyed mob psycho 100, I find mob to be a really relatable and interesting character, he's definitely more interesting than Saitama so far, though it's unfair to compare the two given that mob psycho 100 is actually complete. I love how powerful mob is and how he really just wants simple things: to be liked by others, to have friends, to understand others etc, and how these insane powers don't help him a single bit. In comparison to charisma, psychic powers may seem far superior, but Reigen (the embodiment of charisma itself) shows that he succeeds and deals with problems far more effectively than mob ever could.
