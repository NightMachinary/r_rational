The closest thing I've read about this was in the Alvin Maker books, an old Orson Scott Card series that never got finished. It's not explicitly psychic powers, but he can basically alter matter at will, and uses it in some clever ways. Another is in the Eragon series, where the protagonist eventually starts using telekinetic magic to just snap people's necks. Can't really think of more complex interactions than that, but I'm hoping to explore something similar myself in Pokemon :)
