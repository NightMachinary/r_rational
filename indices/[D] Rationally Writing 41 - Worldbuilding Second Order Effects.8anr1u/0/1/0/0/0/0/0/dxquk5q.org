My interpretation of that was that he blasted through the wall faster than the effects could weaken him, but it resulted in pieces of kryptonite embedding into his body, which rendered him unconscious.

I didn't mean to compare the protagonists directly, was just saying that I really enjoyed the way Mob's struggle was portrayed, as you said, to demonstrate how little his powers actually helped him with what he really wanted in life, and how he was willing to work for that stuff instead of feeling entitled to it. I'm sure OPM will continue to develop too: I've only seen the first season, haven't read any manga yet.
