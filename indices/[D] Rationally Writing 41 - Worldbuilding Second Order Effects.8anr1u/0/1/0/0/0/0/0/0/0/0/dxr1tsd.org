Oh, on the subject of physic power, have you heard of any stories where a weak but rational (or at least rather intelligent) esper finds clever ways to apply his powers instead of brute force like others would? For example just by breaking the chemical bonds in an object in a 2 dimensional manner would allow them to cleanly cut through even an extremely durable material, or knocking people out by squeezing a major artery shut.

Maybe they'll trick people like Harry does in HPMOR, for example say espers (in this world) can't heat things up or cool things down, and the protag could create a vacuum (or least an area of low pressure) to boil water and trick others into believing he somehow can use pyrokinesis when it's just "plain" psychic power.

I read worm for a while, but it was really long and got a little tedious for me, I recall there being some kind of mechanic the author introduced that explains why someone who can make portals or protective shields can't just form a portal/shield in another person to instantly bisect/kill them, which I found pretty interesting.

I was just wondering if there was any such story that you know of.
