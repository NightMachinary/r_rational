Cool! In eragon they can't really use acute application of power easily though, since basically any major threat would have defenses against it.

I remember eragon was taught the words of death or something, I remember them being very energy efficient ways of killing entire armies by blocking arteries and whatnot. Though I don't think it was ever actually used...
