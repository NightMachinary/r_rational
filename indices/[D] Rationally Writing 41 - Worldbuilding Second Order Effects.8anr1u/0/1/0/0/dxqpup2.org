So I've listened to podcasts 0-10 so far (minus the magic system ones), and I'm want to ask you some questions:

1. Do you think it's safe to say that most good villans believe that they are doing good?

2. Have you watched one punch man? I know it seems very shallow and dumb at first, but it gets really interesting regarding human character (especially the manga as the story is much more progressed). It's not a "rational" style story either, but it is a really good one imo.

I recall the other guy saying he likes how superman is really "human" in a sense, and it kinda reminded me of Saitama, the protagonist of one punch-man. He's got overwhelming power, but because of it he's constantly bored and depressed, he's more worried about which day is garbage collection day, or whether today is that massive bargain sale day, rather than if, say there's a meteor about to fall on the city, or a monster it's about to kill a child, since these are (to him) trivial problems to solve. He's also poor, so he's got to worry about paying rent.

For example here's a nice analysis on the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePunchMan/comments/6lqmys/opm_is_a_commentary_on_depression_and_saitamas/][protagonist]]
