Book recommendation by [[/u/alexanderwales]]:

My recommendation for this week is The Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson, starting with "[[https://amzn.to/2H4cwfE][The Way of Kings]]." Sanderson is a rather prolific author, and this is his epic fantasy series, with thick, doorstopper books, dozens of viewpoint characters, and a larger scale than he's worked on before.

I feel like worldbuilding, and specifically, second-order worldbuilding, has always been one of Sanderson's strong points. The world of Roshar is dominated by immense, rock-hurling storms that move from east to west, which has all sorts of interesting first order effects, like the best places to build cities being in the lee of a mountain or cliff, and architecture being suited specifically to defend against heavy winds from one side. The second order effects are in trade, travel, the organization of civilizations, and the prominence of cities. Because the highstorms grow weaker as they move across Roshar, the vegetation and plantlife is affected, and the civilizations that live within them are adapted to different conditions.
