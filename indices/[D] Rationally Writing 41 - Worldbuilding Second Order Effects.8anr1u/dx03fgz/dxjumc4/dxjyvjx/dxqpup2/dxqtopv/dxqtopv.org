1) I think it's very hard to make /interesting/ villains who do not believe they're doing good, but that "believe they're doing good" is not on its own enough. It's the principle, but not the execution: I think the villain needs to also actually come across as /sympathetic/ in some way that the reader can relate to or understand.

Which means that they can't just say "I want to blow the world up because that's best for everyone because it's so shitty," or "I need to subjugate this race because they're evil and so I'm making the world a better place." The writer has to actually go through the hard work of making the villain's perspective sympathetic, and the more heinous the villain's plans, the harder that is, which is why most writer's barely bother.

There are some niche roles for villains that can be great that don't rely on this, by the way. Most edge toward "force of nature" type villains, or are engaging in other ways like having unique personalities or just plain being fun to observe in their element. Others make good villains because they're uniquely terrifying, regardless of what they believe. But villains whose actions seem justified are usually among the most memorable, and often end up more popular than the heroes in the stories they're in, because they brought something new to the audience's experience whereas the heroes are usually more uniform.

2) I have watched OPM, and enjoyed it a lot :) I also really liked Mob Psycho 100 by the same creator: I actually enjoyed it even more. The protagonist of that one is also very unique for the "insanely powerful young man" archetype. That post was great though, thanks for sharing it!

The other guy on the podcast is Alexander Wales, btw, and if you haven't read anything by him, you should really check his stuff out! Speaking of Superman, his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]] is a great exploration of the character.
