The information Ana received was that Malia is Thamiel's daughter and that Mark's opal amulet bears her blood. We don't have a reason to think that Sohu knows Malia's true parentage, and Sohu didn't arrive at the dress rehearsal until after Dylan revealed that he intended to give everyone amulets bearing Malia's blood.

However, we saw Erica learn both of those critical pieces of information. It's also implied that Ana would be crying if she had time for it, which suggests that she's feeling a personal loss, not Sohu's loss by proxy.

Given all of this, I think it makes the most sense to conclude that Ana got the information from Erica and that Erica is, in fact, dead. This is consistent with Erica stabbing Malia "as the flames closed in around them." Her victory was framed as a self-sacrificial one.
