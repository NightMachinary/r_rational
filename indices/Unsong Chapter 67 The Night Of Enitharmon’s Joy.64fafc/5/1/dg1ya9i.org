  “No buts. If you can fathom the mind of the Comet King, you can talk to him as an equal. Until then...”

  “Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a fishhook?” asked Ana, that night at the dinner table. “Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put a hook into his nose? Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?”

  “What I think my esteemed cousin meant,” Ana had said, “is that God argues here that we're too weak and ignorant to be worthy to know these things. But then the question becomes -- exactly how smart do we have to be to deserve an answer? Now that we can, as Bill puts it, send lightning through the sky, now that we can capture whales and make them do tricks for us, does that mean we have a right to ask God for an explanation? Discuss!”
