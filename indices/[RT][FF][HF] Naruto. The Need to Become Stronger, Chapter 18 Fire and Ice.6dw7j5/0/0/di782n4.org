I'm glad it's appreciated! You wouldn't believe how much effort it took to plan all of this in advance, with the foreshadowing of Naruto and Sakura's research and establishing Naruto's seal use and the parallel of Naruto offering to carry Tazuna in the first chapter of the arc and so on. I'll be honest, if I had to do it all again I'm not sure I wouldn't just write one chapter at a time and make it up as I go along :P
