I liked this chapter quite a bit. You seem really good at writing your fight scenes like puzzles; we had all the info we needed to figure out how Naruto could go about beating Haku, and that makes the fact that Naruto solved this particular puzzle whilst in a combat situation particularily impressive.

Naruto and Sakura, in this chapter, looks smart. And I love reading about smart characters.

Keep up the good work!
