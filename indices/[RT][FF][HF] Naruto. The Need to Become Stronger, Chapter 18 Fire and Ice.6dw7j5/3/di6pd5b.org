I've read this story until about chapter 6, and I hate to ask it like this, but does it get better later on?

So far, I hadn't really read anything that really made it seem like rationalist fiction, but more like a regular naruto fanfic (albeit a /little/ less dumb Naruto version so far, not even smart), with Sakura being a more rational character, but I have a pretty (irrational) hatred for her character, just cannot stand her. :v
