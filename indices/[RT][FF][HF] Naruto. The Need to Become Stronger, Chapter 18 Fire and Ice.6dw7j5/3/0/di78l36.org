Erp. I would be more comfortable answering with a "yes" if you had only read until chapter 4 or something. I do think it gets better with each chapter (the first few are definitely my least favourite, personally) but if you didn't like chapter 5 at all for example then I cannot guarantee you'll like the rest.

You're not the first to remark that this Naruto doesn't seem that rational, but I do think that's not entirely fair. This Naruto is definitely very smart if you just look at what he /does/ instead of how he acts, but because everybody else sees him as bit of a bumbling idiot it doesn't really come across that way. I think I tried to be a little too clever here, by intentionally subverting the tropes that the critics of HPMOR hated so much, where the protagonist lectures his superiors constantly and everybody else just rolls with it and accepts he's just that awesome. So I went in the opposite direction and wrote a protagonist who is objectively very smart, but who is very flawed and who just cannot get any recognition for his cleverness.

The mistake I made, I think, is forgetting that the whole reason people read rationalist fiction is because they /want/ to see an awesome main character break the story by doing incredible things. If I were to do it all over again I would definitely start with Naruto clearly displaying his intelligence in a way that's obvious to the audience, though not necessarily to his peers.

Also, even with the failings of the main characters, the rest of the story I think still counts as rationalist, going purely by the definition on the sidebar. The underlying rules and mechanics are explored, the main character slowly becomes stronger through his efforts to munchkin them, the agents all have their own clear goals and motivations, and the final plot is of course a puzzle which can be solved by the reader much like a murder mystery novel.
