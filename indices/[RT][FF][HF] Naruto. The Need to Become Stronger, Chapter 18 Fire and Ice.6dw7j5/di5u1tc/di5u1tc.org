Hey guys. It turns out my grandmother doesn't have a tumor after all, but only a bloodclot in the brain from which she's mostly recovered. I guess sometimes things do turn out randomly positive, after all. It's a huge relief, either way.

I'll post my beta-reader's feedback here, same as before (also in the hopes that it will spur more conversation):

  Solid ending and good cliffhanger. I'll admit, I didn't see it coming. Naruto was being so clever that I really did think he'd pull it off. I suppose I did see it coming in one way: Sasuke hasn't come to help him yet, so Naruto couldn't just have won alone. That would've made the earlier bit pointless. Tazuna is dead meat, though.

  Anyway, it's another strong chapter. I have to admit that I am starting to get some amount of fight-fatigue, but I expect your target audience has a much more developed capacity for such than I do. Also, it was mostly an issue earlier in the fight. When the basement scene started, I became much more engaged and I really like the way the fight played out at the end.

  On a slightly more worrying level, I'm not entirely sure the connection between Naruto and Haku is strong enough to give this scene that much of an emotional load. They had one scene together, in which they got along quite well despite half of them acting under false pretences. It's believable they'd rather not kill one another, but it's not that big of a deal. As for the readers: we have a bit more insight into Haku than N does, and are more likely to like him to some extent, but I can't say I actually care for him that much. He mostly comes across as someone who could be a decent enough person if the Zabby Ninja weren't around, but he's not actually done anything in particular to make him rise above that.

  This isn't fatal to the scene: “would rather not kill eachother” works well enough at this early point in the story.

  In other news, I liked Sakura's and Sasuke's scene. It moved the plot along and had some neat lines, especially by Sasuke. (When he finally opened his mouth, that is)
