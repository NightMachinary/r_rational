Noah Smith talks about [[http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/situationalism-in-economic-policymaking.html][situationalism and models]] in economic theory and policy. Put simply, given multiple competing models of how the world works, which one if any is right? If, as some suggest, we pick different models in different situations, how do we know which one is the right one for this situation?

  Here was an interesting paragraph from a recent Simon Wren-Lewis post:

    The big models/schools of thought are not right or wrong, they are just more or less applicable to different situations. You need New Keynesian models in recessions, but Real Business Cycle models may describe some inflation free booms. You need Minsky in a financial crisis, and in order to prevent the next one. As Dani Rodrik says, there are many models, and the key questions are about their applicability.

  Rodrik pushes this idea in his book Economics Rules, which I am about to start reading. But he's far from the first to advocate the idea of using different models for different situations. Let's call this "situationalism".
