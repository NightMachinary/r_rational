What determines pitchability of an idea?

I've been looking at [[/r/WritingPrompts/top]]. There are a lot of cool ideas that don't naturally make for good stories; that subreddit tends to upvote those, because people get pleasure from the /pitch/ rather than the /execution/.

At the other end are works which are difficult to pitch but are nonetheless very good. I think you hear this expressed most often as, "I'm not sure that I can describe this in a way that would make you want to read it."

Now, obviously some of this comes down to the skill of the person writing the work and the skill of the person giving the pitch; poor execution can ruin /any/ idea, while a poor pitch can make /any/ work look bad. But with that said, I think the concept of "pitchability" is a meaningful one, and I'm curious about what's at the core of it, if it has a core.

(This is one of those places where it feels like information theory should be able to help, but probably can't.)
