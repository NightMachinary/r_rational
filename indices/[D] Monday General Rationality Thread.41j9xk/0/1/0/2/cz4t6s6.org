I've only seen better than the technique [[/u/Luminnaran][u/Luminnaran]] proposes on jacket insides and first page teasers. An example of a teaser follows, after which I've transcribed character pitches from a back cover. Both are from Daniel Abraham's /The Dragon's Path/.

- *Marcus rubbed his chin with a callused palm.*

  "Yardem?"

  "Sir?" rumbled the Tralgu looming at his side.

  "The day you throw me in a ditch and take command of the company?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "It wouldn't be today, would it?"

  The Tralgu crossed his thick arms and flicked a jingling ear.

  "No, sir," he said at last. "Not today."

  "Pity."

  *MARCUS*'s hero days are behind him. He knows too well that even the smallest war still earns somebody's death. When his men are impressed into a doomed army, staying out of a battle he wants no part of requires some unorthodox steps.

  *CITHRIN* is an orphan, ward of a banking house. Her job is to smuggle a nation's wealth across a war zone, hiding the gold from both sides. She knows the secret life of commerce like a second language, but the strategies of trade will not defend her from swords.

  *GEDER*, sole scion of a noble house, has more interest in philosophy than in swordplay. A poor excuse for a soldier, he is a pawn in these games. No one can predict what he will become.

  Falling pebbles can start a landslide. A spat between the Free Cities and the Severed Throne is spiraling out of control. A new player rises from the depths of history, fanning the flames that will sweep the entire region onto The Dragon's Path -- the path to war.
