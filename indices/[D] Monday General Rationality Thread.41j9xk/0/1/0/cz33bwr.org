Characterization is one of those really difficult things to pitch, because it tends to come off sounding cliched and flat. What can you really say about a person in a single sentence, or even a pair of sentences, that will get people interested?

I'm in the process of developing a new web serial and trying to go character-first, but even though I've got lots of description written for them (their personality, worldview, emotions, connections, etc.) I don't know that I could pitch them properly in a way that would make people care.
