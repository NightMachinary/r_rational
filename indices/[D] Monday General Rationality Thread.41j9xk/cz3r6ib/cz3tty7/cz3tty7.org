Models may not be right but they can be more correct. For example, the meta-model consisting of all the different models and how to chose which one will be more correct than any one of the sub-models. It may be more likely/plausible if the extra correctness outweighs the added complexity.

But yes, the idea that models have realms of applicablity is important. We don't try to calculate the lift on an aircraft wing with quantum mechanics or even by tracking individual air molecules but by treating air as an infinitely divisible fluid. While QM is probably closer to reality, it's just not practical.
