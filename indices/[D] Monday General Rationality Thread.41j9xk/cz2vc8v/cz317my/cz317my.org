I feel that pitchability as your describing it has a lot to do with how interesting the world the author is creating is. Even if you can't explain your character and their motivations very well most people will agree that Frodo would be badass with a lightsaber. Therefore I think something with a high pitchability but hard to make a complex story of have the authors describe interesting worlds but with subpar characters. Often I find when reading(or writing) a BST the general world is described far more than the characters which can leave you wanting to see this world but when you do actually see it you dislike it because of the boring characters in the world.
