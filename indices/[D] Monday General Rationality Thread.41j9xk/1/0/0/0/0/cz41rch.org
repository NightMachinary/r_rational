Excuse me, could I get some soup with my fly?

Your reply is something perfectly valid, with bad words tacked on. In my anecdotal experience of arguing with anonymous strangers, the way "Don't tone police me" is used /most of the time/, is by someone who is called out for making a special pleading or simply asserting facts, while being very rude to those who disagree.

I agree entirely that attacking only grammar or spelling is bad. Attacking use of slang words (politely), while more of a gray area, is bad if the argument is still understandable by the vast majority of people. Same with needlessly complicated/obscure words, which are just slang for academics.

But. I more often see "don't tone police me" as a cheap attempt to score points without addressing the arguments of the other side than I see any variant of tone policing used for the same. Although I guess I don't count "You need to calm down if you want to be taken seriously, but here is why you are wrong" as tone policing, because the person then goes on to answer the substance of the policed person's arguments.

And in real life, demanding to be taken seriously when you are rude or hysterical is a bit like demanding that someone evaluates the quality of the soup you made without complaining about the fly they saw you put in it.
