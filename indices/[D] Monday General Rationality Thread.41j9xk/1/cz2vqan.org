We have names for logical fallacies and these names are very helpful; they allow us to say something like "That argument is an ad hominem" without having to explain what an ad hominem is and why it isn't a good thing.

I think there should be a name for the following rhetorical move.

Persons A & B are arguing about something, either in real life or online. At some point, person A makes some kind of error in language use. If it is an argument online, it may be a misspelling, or its vs it's, or something else; if it is an argument in person, it may be a mispronounced word or maybe something said in the wrong tense, etc etc.

Rather than ignore it and proceed with the argument, person B launches into a long lecture about the mistake, usually discussing not only why person A was wrong but also multitude of related technical issues (e.g., how to pronounce words coming from Latin, technical details of tenses in the English language).

I've seen this sort of thing happen many times, not just on reddit but throughout the internet. It seems like a common enough way to derail a conversation that it deserves a name.
