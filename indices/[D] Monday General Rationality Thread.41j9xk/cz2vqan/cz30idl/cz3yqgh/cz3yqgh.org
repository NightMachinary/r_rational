I strongly dislike the article you linked.

Attacking the language is a very poor way of arguing, and I understand that 'the tone argument' is a term that makes sense, but just like the article makes clear, usually when I've seen someone accuse others of tone policing in the wild, really what they mean is that person B wants them to calm down and present a rational argument. Which they think is unfair as it polices their tone and ignores their strong emotions on the subject. The article also says that tone policing is something people with more privilege use to silence people with less privilege.

The tone argument definition used by rationalwiki is bad. It tells readers that if they are not a white male and a white male is asking them to calm down and back up their position, the white male is trying to silence them with his sinister tricks. There is a brief paragraph at the bottom where it says it is /hypothetically/ possible to use a tone argument honestly, but then it also suggests that if the language discussion is not mutually consented to, it's ok to 'light the flamethrowers'.
