Allow me to illustrate why I think you're wrong (don't take my insults seriously, I'm sure you're an okay person):

You cunt, did you ever fucking think that you could ask for clarification without the self-righteous tone policing? The point the article is trying to make, and that you missed like the little shit that you are, is that my evidence doesn't care about my motherfucking emotional state. My points stand regardless of what language I decide to use, and asking me to change my tone is a way of evading my valid points in favor of telling me to shut the fuck up and speak so that I don't hurt your precious little feelings.
