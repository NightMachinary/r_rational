Not sure if it's considered "hard" fantasy but /Name of the Wind/ (Patrick Rothfuss) comes to mind - there are several distinct systems of magic varying from "obeys conservation of energy" to "poorly understood even in-universe", and the main character is narrating his life story so you get the inside view on his thoughts.

Also the writing is just excellent. I would recommend it on the strength of that alone.
