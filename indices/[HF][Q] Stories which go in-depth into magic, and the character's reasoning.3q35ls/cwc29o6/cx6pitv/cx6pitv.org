If [[/u/devDorito]] were posting in [[/r/books]] or somewhere I'd keep my mouth shut because these books are so popular, but this is [[/r/rational]], so let me just say, if you are looking for a story where the main character is actually intelligent (in that he makes smart decisions in a show-don't-tell way), this story will probably disappoint you. Mother of Learning is amazing, and the protagonist is very smart and effective. In NotW, there is a lot of wish-fulfillment type stuff that is annoying, where he is the very best at everything, and a lot of the plot seems contrived. For example, he is supposed to be the best musician ever but he somehow is constantly poor, and he's supposed to be super smart, but he falls for the most obvious trick where someone tells him to take a candle into the rare book section of the library, resulting in a ban (so the resulting conflict feels very contrived). He's telling the story about himself so you could say he's exaggerating, but that doesn't fix the fact that it makes the story worse.

On the other hand, the magic system is fantastic and well thought out. It might be worth reading for that alone if you can get past the cringe, but
