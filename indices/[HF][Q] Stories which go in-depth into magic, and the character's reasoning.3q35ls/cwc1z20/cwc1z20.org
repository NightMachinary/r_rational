Have you read any of Brandon Sanderson's stuff? He's pretty much the king of hard fantasy.

If you don't mind self-promotion, I also write novels in this style. My first novel, [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]], is already out. The sequel is on its way.

I go into a /ton/ of detail about magic theory - to the extent that many readers think it's overkill. That sounds like something you might enjoy, though.

Two of my perspective characters are pretty solidly rational (Jonan and Lydia), although they're still flawed and have holes in their reasoning. My third character, Taelien, is tactical and knows how to optimize his abilities, but he has more of a traditional shonen hero style of approaching his problems - mostly because he hasn't run into many things that he can't brute force his way through (yet).

Here's a quick blurb for my own novel if you're interested: /Some say that in the city of Orlyn, godhood is on sale to the highest bidder. Thousands flock to the city each year, hoping for a chance at immortality./

/Lydia Hastings is a knowledge sorcerer, capable of extracting information from anything she touches. When she travels to Orlyn to validate the claims of the local faith, she discovers a conspiracy that could lead to a war between the world's three greatest powers. At the focal point is a prisoner who bears a striking resemblance to the long-missing leader of the pantheon she worships./

/Rescuing the prisoner would require risking her carefully cultivated cover - but his execution could mean the end of everything Lydia holds dear./
