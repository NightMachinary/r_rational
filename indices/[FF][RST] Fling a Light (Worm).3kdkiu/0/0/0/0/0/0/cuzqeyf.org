It's kinda funny. If we accept the most popular theory, it would suggest that every single action orchestrated by the Simurgh was with the eventual goal of stopping Scion. But by that logic, Wildbow's allowed to have the Simurgh literally do ANYTHING and it can fall under such a powerful ability. It's a fairly decent schrodinger's cat of a handwave.

EDIT: Another way of looking at it is that the entities don't seem like they'd be fans of the world being advanced in good ways, as that would reduce the net conflict generated by parahumans. Significantly so, if things like Accord's plan to fix literally the entire world goes through.
