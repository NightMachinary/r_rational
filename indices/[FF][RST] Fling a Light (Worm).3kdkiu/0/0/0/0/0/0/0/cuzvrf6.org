That was my reading. I mean, if you take the whole outside-time thing seriously, then Simurgh inevitably achieved her goals in the end. At least we can say that protecting Scion was not one of them.

Using this nigh-omnipotent agent to justify the contrivances of the setting would be ok if one could actually see some kind of overarching goal it pursues in its actions. Otherwise it turns into: 'Why is your universe stuck in this unnatural state? Simurghdidit!' You can't really assign goals to Simurgh even in hindsight because its actions are not consistent. It simply does whatever is required by the plot. Utterly unsatisfying. Combined with the shard mind-control this takes any useful world-shaping agency from the characters in the story. Everyone is limited to choosing ways to beat each other up and that's it.
