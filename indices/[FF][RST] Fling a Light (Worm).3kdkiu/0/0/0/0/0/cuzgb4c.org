I never could figure out what the end-game was there. Simurgh supposedly has an 'outside-of-time' view, which amounts to an even more overpowered version of path-to-victory. I can't figure out what the heck it was after based on the actions though.

Mostly, I think it was just poorly thought out hand-wave on Wlidbow's part.
