Agreed.

I've always felt like leveraging superpowers on a massive scale is something interesting to explore and this fic seems to be going in that direction. People with abilities of Coil, Tattletale, Dinah and Accord really should be engaging in world optimisation instead of petty squabbling over a shithole of a city.
