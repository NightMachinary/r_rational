It's never too early to take over the world! Seriously though, specialisation exists for a reason. Suppose several people decide to be efficient by leveraging the synergy of their abilities (like they appear to have done in this fic). Perhaps Dinah is too young for the minutiae of world optimisation to interest her, she could still make a huge contribution by simply giving Coil her phone number and precommiting to answering his questions. She would not even need to actually do anything, since all the questioning would be simulated by Coil's shard. Even without Coil, answering a couple of questions is a no-braner cost/benifit-wise.

Tt could just be hired to help, would not even need much incentive.

As for why Taylor does not put more portals up, I'd guess it's a combination of upkeep bottleneck and her not being altruistic enough to devote her whole life solely to the job.
