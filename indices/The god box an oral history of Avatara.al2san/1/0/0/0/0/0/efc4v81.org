I read it on mobile so the pull quotes were awful.

Even if they were more to the side I believe there are far too many, magazines I can think of have 1 pull quote per column per page at most. So maybe a few hundred words per pull quote, while this story seems under a hundred for each.

Good story idea, poor style and execution in my opinion.
