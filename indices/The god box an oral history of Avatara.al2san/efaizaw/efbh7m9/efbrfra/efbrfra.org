You're not missing anything. It's a sad, wistful end. They created something that could have been beautiful, and let their own greed destroy it--except that it went out on its own terms, and none of them know what those terms were.

My theory is that Jen and Avatara are out there quietly orchestrating things behind the scenes. Very cool story, though I don't think the author quite knows how quote inserts work.
