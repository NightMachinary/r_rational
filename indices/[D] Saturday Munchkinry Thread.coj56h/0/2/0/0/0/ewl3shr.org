20kJ is enough to, for example, accelerate a two-ton car from rest to jogging speed/just over 3 m/s. Or enough to slowly lift a 50 kg human (or shoes that contain one, such as yourself) up by 40 meters. You could increase the air pressure of a 320 sq. ft room by a quarter of a percent or so. You could bring two gallons of water to boil from room temperature.

At one joule per second of replenishment, you could do one of these every six hours or so. Or less feats more often. For example, a 150 ml cup of tea every seven minutes or so.

This is to say nothing of the implications that come with presumably violating Newton's third law. All sorts of our thoughts about inertia would go straight out the window.
