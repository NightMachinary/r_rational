Yeah, I was looking at the flight idea more and the physics gets a bit wonky when you start trying to define telekinesis in terms of energy rather than forces.

For example, holding an object stationary should not consume /any/ energy since energy can only be defined by a force acting over a distance. Therefore, it should be possible to make floating cities by stilling their foundations since without it being able to move (within your frame of reference) there can be no energy acting upon it.

If you avoid that by specifying that an object has to /move/ by your orders, then you still run into trouble with horizontal movement. Say you want to use your power to move a 1kg weight horizontally 1m (say by using "contact" on an object that far away), using all of your energy (i.e. making it move as fast as possible). since everything's 1, it's evident you exert a 20,000N force on the weight, accelerating it at 20,000m/s. From rest, finding the final velocity becomes as simple as =v_f=sqrt(2*a*d) =sqrt(2*20000*1) =200m/s=

And since the distance travelled is arbitrary, if you want it to contact something 1cm away, the force exerted becomes 2,000,000N, and final velocity becomes =v_f=sqrt(2*a*d) =sqrt(2*2000000*1) =2000m/s=and of course things get even faster at shorter distances.

In short, using units of power to define telekinesis makes some weird problems unless you include things like a cap on how much force you can exert with your telekinesis as well or you want railguns to be an intended use of the power.
