Before I munchkin, I want to point out that a one word limit is more arbitrary than logical. If the autonomy of the infused object has limited processing power, that should still allow it to follow multiple word commands. There are plenty of one word commands that are more complex conceptually than entire sentences. "Kill Bob by strangling him" has a smaller conceptual space than "Think."

Since corpses are objects, I could bring people back to life with the command "resurrect". (I assume that the infusion doesn't work on living things, since that's a little too overpowered)

Second, I could probably infuse my clothes to "Fly" or "Hover". If I couldn't control that, than it would at least be useful in certain scenarios.
