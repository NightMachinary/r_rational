You would have a much safer way to work with highly dangerous chemicals like various fluorine compounds. Just command their containers to "Resist" or "Repel" (there's probably a better word) so they don't react with the chemicals.

Could you take out a small piece of graphite from a pencil and command it to "Compress" or "Pressurize" or "Squeeze" to turn it into diamond?
