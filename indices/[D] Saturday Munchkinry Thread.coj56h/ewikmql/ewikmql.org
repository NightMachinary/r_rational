You have become a werewolf. Every full moon, you transform into a wolf that is your own weight (mass is conserved) at the instant of syzygy (when the sun, earth, and moon are in a straight line). You can maintain the werewolf form until you fall asleep, when you will transform back. During your transformation, your intelligence is preserved.
