  If you put on a dog collar right before transforming

You don't even need to have good timing, just wear an (appropriately loose) collar about a day before you expect to need it and you'll transform into it! People will think you make weird fashion choices but that's a life I have already resigned myself to.

(True story: I have a very expensive hairdresser who is extremely cool, like, SO cool. I walk in one day and she says "Weasel! I love your outfit today! Colour blocking, huh?" and I nod and go "Yes! Colour blocking is a thing I do as a fashion choice! Thank you for noticing this intentional fashion decision" and later on I googled it and it means wearing clashing colours on purpose, so basically, fashion has finally become accessible to me)
