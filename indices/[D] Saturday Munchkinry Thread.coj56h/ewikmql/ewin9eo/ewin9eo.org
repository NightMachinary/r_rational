If you put on a dog collar right before transforming and then walk around while wagging your tail, you could go almost anywhere. This could have a variety of useful applications.

If you're extremely obese, you will presumably just turn into a large but otherwise healthy wolf. For people who are too fat to walk, this could be a good way to periodically regain some mobility.

You could probably make a decent income by setting up a YouTube channel called "Genius Wolf", and publishing videos of you doing things that appear shockingly intelligent for a canid.
