The thing is, one wolf doing intelligent things isn't going to get people to greatly change animal rights. There's too much cognitive dissonance in our relationship with animals (carnism).

Intelligent people won't do relatively simple things like not eating meat, and we have good evidence that pigs, chickens, cows have real emotional lives and suffer for real. People already care about dogs, and without it being replicated in other dogs/wolves, I can't see one Clever Hans bringing in a new vanguard of animal rights unless it's as a figurehead for a wider campaign, especially since Clever Wolf is only available for appearances 1-3 days a month depending how long you can stay awake for.

(nb: when I talk about people in this post I talk about WEIRD people, I know people eat dogs in Cambodia/China/Korea and probably other parts of the world, and I know it's hard for an Inuit subsistence hunter to go vegetarian)
