What's my goal?

Because thinking of who I am right this moment....... i'd probably do weird sex stuff, play frisbee, go to a dog park, swim, go to the forest and try and track animals, that sort of thing. Purely recreational. Maybe see if I can help with unsolved crimes, but that'd be a bit difficult to do anonymously.

Oh, and put myself forward to win some of those paranormal challenges.

Oh, and if I do that, do hollywood stunt work though I can't imagine that being very lucrative. I'd be a small wolf but I'm guessing it's easier to change perspective than it is to CGI a whole wolf / train a dog.
