I think, if you told an object to explode, it would just explode immediately in your hand. Also, such an explosion would be composed entirely of shrapnel, without a shockwave or a fireball, unless it is an object already designed to explode in some other manner. Still potentially useful, but I think it's important to note.

The amount of energy would be 20 thousand joules maximum, regenerating at 1 joule per second. The standing on a floating plank could work, but I think maintaining a flying fortress for significant periods of time wouldn't be feasible.
