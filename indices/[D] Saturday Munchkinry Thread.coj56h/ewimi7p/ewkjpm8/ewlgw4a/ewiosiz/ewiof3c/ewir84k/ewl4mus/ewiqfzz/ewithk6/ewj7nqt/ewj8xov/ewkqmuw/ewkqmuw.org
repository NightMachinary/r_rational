Compared to normal human metabolic needs, this is a rounding error - assuming you use the power enough to constantly be regenerating, 1J/s turns out to be about 20.6 kcal/day. For comparison, recommended daily intake is on the order of 2000 kcal/day.

TL;DR the amount of energy is so small it is easily covered by eating.
