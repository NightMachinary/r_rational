Can I turn any object into a grenade with this ability? Throw it at an enemy and the moment before it leaves your hand command it to explode.

Also, how much energy do you have? Can you hold up a plank in the air, and command it to "Float" or "Still", and then stand on top of it? Can you create a flying fortress?
