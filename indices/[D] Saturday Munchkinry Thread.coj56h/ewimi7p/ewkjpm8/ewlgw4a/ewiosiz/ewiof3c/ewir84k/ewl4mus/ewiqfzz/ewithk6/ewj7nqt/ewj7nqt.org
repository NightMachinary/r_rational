Hmm, does the regenerated energy appear ex nihilo? Or is it drained directly from your body?

If it is the former, you could make space travel significantly cheaper since you can go aboard space vessels and repeatedly command them to move forward even without fuel. (A one word command would be "Thrust" or "Fire"?) It would be very weak and slow, but the savings will add up, especially considering the tyranny of the rocket equation
