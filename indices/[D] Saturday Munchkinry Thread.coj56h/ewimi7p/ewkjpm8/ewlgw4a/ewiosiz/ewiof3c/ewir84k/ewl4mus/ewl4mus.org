The most obvious exploit is that you never specified that the language spoken. Construct a new language, defining words as you need them by perfectly specifying what you want the object to do at that particular time.

Eg. Forsklanging /verb/ The act of flying over to the house of [power owner]'s boss, flying into [power owner]'s bosses mouth into his brain and then heating up to 100,000 degrees.

Other arbitrarily complex things could also be done fairly easily, as long as you properly create and define the word you want to use.
