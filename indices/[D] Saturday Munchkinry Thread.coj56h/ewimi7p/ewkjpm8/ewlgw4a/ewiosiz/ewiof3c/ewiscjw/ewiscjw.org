You have a point on the one-word limit. Do you have any recommendations for a more logical replacement, or should I remove that limitation entirely.

You are right about it not working on living things. On the subject of resurrection, I'm inclined to say such a command would just make the corpse move and attempt to imitate the infuser's conception of the person whose corpse it is, without permanently resurrecting the corpse or actually bringing back the person who used to control it. Unless there's a way to kickstart life through just moving around the bits inside the body, I think out and out resurrection isn't really a possibility.

I like the idea of making the clothes hover/fly - though it would likely require stronger clothes than normal for them to be able to carry you for long, though I may be wrong about that.
