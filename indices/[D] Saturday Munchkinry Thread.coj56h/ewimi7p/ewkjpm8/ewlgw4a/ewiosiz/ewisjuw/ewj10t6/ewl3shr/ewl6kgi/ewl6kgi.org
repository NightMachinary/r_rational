Oh ok I get it you can do some minor things. I understand now. Can you show me the calculations for the car and two gallons of water to boil from room temp? I tried to work the numbers but for the first one I got K=(1/2)mv^{2=(1/2)(1000} kg)(3 m/s)^{2=45000} J. Could this be solved by the replenish rule you have? If so does it work while the object is under the influence of the command you imparted?
