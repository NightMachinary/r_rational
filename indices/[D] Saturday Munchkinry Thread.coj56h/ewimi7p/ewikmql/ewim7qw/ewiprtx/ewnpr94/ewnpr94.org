If they really know the EXACT distance and direction between them at any time that means it could be used for FTL signaling and sending messages back in time. Moving versus standing still could be used to send messages in binary.

Or if it can't be used to violate causality or you can't distinguish the movements over interstellar distances, then I guess they could use it as a long distance communicator without a phone if one of them was captured just by pacing their cell.
