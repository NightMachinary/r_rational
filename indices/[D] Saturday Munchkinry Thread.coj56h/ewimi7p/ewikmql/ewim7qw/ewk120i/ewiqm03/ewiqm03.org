Once again, we're using [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8rjwz5/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e0te2ui/][a setting]] from a short story I read, with one difference: the instant you're exposed to this location, you can no longer create things in it with excuses. How will you munchkin this, using either the things created by your existing excuses or perhaps getting other people to make excuses that work for you? Note that if you bring anyone else in, they also lose their ability to create through making excuses.
