I don't do anything and wait until the time of 1 hour elapsed. If future me still ends up going on a quest to kill me, I go back in time (somehow) and then tell past me in less than 20 words what's going down.

"I'm you. Two hour you wants to kill you. Attempted nothing is me. Possible fourty-six word limit. You have 1 hour." I then attempt to leave past me my phone to see if it stays or goes with me.

If in the end future me doesn't show up then I've avoided doing the thing that makes me want to kill myself.

If the quest to kill me continues then I'll figure out the following

1. Why do I want to kill myself.

2. How do I time travel.

3. Is it really so bad if future me is willing killing past me.

4. Is future me REALLY me.

5. Is it worth it to kill myself prematurely to get back at future me for trying to end me.

Edit: If I do nothing and die then I guess I'll just die then.
