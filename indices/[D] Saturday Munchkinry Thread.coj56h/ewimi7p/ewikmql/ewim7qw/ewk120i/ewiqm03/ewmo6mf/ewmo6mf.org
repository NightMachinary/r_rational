Out of nowhere, a clone of yourself appears next to you. They are covered in bloodied bandages, and their right arm is a stump above the elbow. They say to you:

"Please, you have to listen, I don't have much time! In 1 hour, your future self from 2 hours in the future is going to jump back in time and try to kill you! You have to be ready for them! Just make sure you don't-"

Then they vanish, with a small /pop/.

What do you do?
