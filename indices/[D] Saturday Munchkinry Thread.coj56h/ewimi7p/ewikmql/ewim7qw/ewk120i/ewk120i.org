You can have any superpower that could generate a maximum economic value of under $500 a week (to be adjusted in the future for inflation.) What do you choose? For the sake of sanity, this economic value doesn't include the value of notoirety: money you could make just be demonstrating the power to a telivision audience doesn't count.

If someone, including yourself, ever proposes or thinks of a way to use your power to make more than $500 dollars, you lose the power.

So for example, the ability to randomly find $500 in lost bills and change per week, but only in scenarious where it was plausible, would qualify.
