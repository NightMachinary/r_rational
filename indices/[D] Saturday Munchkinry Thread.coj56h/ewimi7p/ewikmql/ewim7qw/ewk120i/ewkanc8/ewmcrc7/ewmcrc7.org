Yep, this was roughly my first thought. In general, anything you do that would /affect/ others in any way can be used as a generation of economic value. And if it can't affect others, then most superpowers would be worthless. And with the hard cap of $500 a week, any superpowers with any sort of utility would be identical in impact.

I think the two Munchkins would be either:

Take advantage of the notoriety clause, and choose something that would maximize entertainment with minimal utility. For example, the power to allow people to experience books as VR or illusions that only make entertainment media better/immersive. This would be generating economic value, but the exception clause is super vague.

Maximize self-interest while minimizing its ability to affect others in any way, which would look something like you can freeze time in the "real world" to enter a separate self-generating multi-verse where you are all-powerful, near-omniscient, (can seed creations of universes, can live vicariously through copies/imitations of stories and self-memory manipulation, etc. etc.,) but you cannot bring out anything other than vague memories and exactly $500 dollars. If you want to leave for some reason, haha.
