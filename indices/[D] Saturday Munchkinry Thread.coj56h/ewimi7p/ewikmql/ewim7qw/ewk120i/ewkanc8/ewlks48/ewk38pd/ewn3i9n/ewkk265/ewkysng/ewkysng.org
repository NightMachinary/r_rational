My superpower is that bad eating or poor lifestyle choices do not negatively affect how I look, which is like a moderately fit version of myself. I gain no actual health benefits, and still suffer all risks associated with whatever lifestyle I choose. This power is not illusory and cannot "hide" health problems if they develop.
