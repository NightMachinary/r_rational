I'm actually not sure if there's a point to the time-delay, but just saying "create $500 worth of something" by definition makes sure you never create more than the threshold amount. Though at the same time, that's not really munchkinry-- you're using the power up until its stated limits, but haven't actually found a way to break it. If I were to munchkin it, I would focus on generating both economic and non-economic value, or value that would be priced into the economy as being worthless, but have some greater value. For example, creating life-bearing planets where humans can never reach doesn't create any economic value because there's no way for the economy to interact with that, but it would give me some peace of mind in case of an x-risk.

Actually, I think I just figured out the ideal way to use this power due to your post. Changing the /future/ is pointless because that generates economic value. But I can retroactively change the past as much as I want, because then that economic value will always have been there. I can say:

"my superpower is to automatically, passively, and retroactively make myself an omnipotent being who decided to live as a regular human until an automatic return to omnipotence triggered by gaining any sort of superpower, and then giving myself the chance to choose a superpower to recursively retroactively make themselves an omnipotent being who did the prior stuff so on taking the superpower I revert to my ordinary state as an omnipotent being."

The diction can probably be cleaned up, and have loopholes closed, but at this point I already feel like I'm writing yugioh card text so I'll stop.
