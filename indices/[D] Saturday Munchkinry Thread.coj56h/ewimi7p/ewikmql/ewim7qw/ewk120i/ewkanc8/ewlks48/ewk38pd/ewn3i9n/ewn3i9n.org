How many chains of consequence does this superpower manager look at?

- First-order results from your power (eg conjuring art and selling it for $500)?

- Second-order results (conjuring $500 worth of art materials, selling the art for more than $500)?

- Third-order results (conjuring an art book, teaching yourself art, then getting an art job that makes more than $500/week)?

Because depending on how careful you have to be not to let your power "cause" you to generate over the allowed limit, it severely limits what kind of power you can ever have so as not to let it change your lifestyle.
