If you can include restrictions, drawbacks and weaknesses in the description of the power, you can just have any arbitrary power with the drawback of "but it can't be used to make more than $500/week" stuck on.

So, just picking an absurdly OP power on that basis, I'll go with "the ability to travel between universes, including to fictional universes, and bring goods and people with you, but you're magically prevented from using the power for economic gain".
