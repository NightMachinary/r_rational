I think the entity controlling the object wouldn't be able to figure out the positions of each and every atom that composed the object with it's limited processing power.

However, I'm more favorable to it being able to move things on an atomic level. Off the top of my head, this would let you control the temperature of objects by giving them a command like "heat" or "cool." It would also let you hypothetically change compounds into others, assuming you can find a one word command that could do that. Any other applications you can think of?
