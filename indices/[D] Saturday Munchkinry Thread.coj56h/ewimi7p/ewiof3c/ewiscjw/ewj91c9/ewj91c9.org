  Unless there's a way to kickstart life through just moving around the bits inside the body, I think out and out resurrection isn't really a possibility.

Isn't there? We're all made of atoms, death is what happens when the atoms move out of a structure that allows life. If your ability does not depend on your knowledge of how the atoms should be ordered, and has the precision to move each atom precisely, there's no reason why you couldn't rewind a body's state back to just before it died (assuming you collected all the atoms that have left the body since death, which means that if people want you to resurrect someone they better seal that someone in an airtight body bag until they reach you.)

Similarly, I wonder if you could command arbitrary objects to "Rewind", to make them return to their state in some previous time. You're not actually causing time travel, you're just reversing the movement of the atoms, which doesn't actually take much energy. The only reason we can't do this in real life is because we don't have the ability to grab every atom and put it back in its original position. Your magical ability might get around this issue.
