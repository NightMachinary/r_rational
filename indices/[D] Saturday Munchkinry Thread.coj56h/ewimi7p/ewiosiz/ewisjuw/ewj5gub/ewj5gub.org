Okay, so full regeneration takes about 5 hours. Maximum energy release is comparable to burning half a gram of fat, or using about two AA batteries, or about three times the muzzle energy of an elephant gun. That could be useful for accelerating a few bullets without a gun or propellant using the "fire" command. Could also be useful for jumping up to 25 meters upward by issuing the "up" command to your shoes while jumping.

Edit: Had days instead of hours.
