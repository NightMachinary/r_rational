For the car, I worked backwards and I think I forgot about the 1/2 term. 20kJ/2Mg = 1/2v^{2.} 20 J/kg = v^{2.} v = sqrt(20) m/s. v = ~4.5 m/s. You've slipped a digit in your math; a one-ton car at 3 m/s is 4500 J, not 45 000.

For the water, I searched the amount of energy it takes to heat water by 80 K, and found that it was roughly two fifteenths of 20 kJ. I converted it to gallons because two is a cleaner number than 7.5. I messed this up too, though. I just did the research again after some sleep and found a different answer: you can bring ~60 ml of water to a near-boil. Enough for a tiny spot of tea. 20 kJ = c m dT. 20 kJ = 4.184 J/gK m 80K. 250 J/K = 4.184 J/gK m. m = ~59.8 g = 59.8 ml.

Water is /very/ hard to heat up, and I forgot this. Air is easier: instead of 4 J per gram-Kelvin, it's 0.7. Assume an average room is 28 square meters and 3 meters tall, and the density of air is 1.3 kg/m^{3.} Google calls that reasonable for 20 C near sea level. You can raise that 110 kg of air by dT Kelvin, where 20 kJ = 0.7kJ/kgK 110kg dT. 28.57 kgK = 110 kg dT. dT = ~0.26 degrees Celsius. Maybe it's just impossible to heat things. I guess you could make a blanket nice and warm before going to bed.

In theory it takes no energy to levitate-- just force. If you commanded your shoes to levitate, the only energy expenditure would come from maneuvering, which you can probably do with your arms just pushing off things. That's probably the best use of this power, with all of its entropy-defying implications.
