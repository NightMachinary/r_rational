If the "energy" used doesn't actually scale up with the energy it would take to move the object, then demonstrate your power to a wind turbine manufacturer. Telling a turbine to "rotate" "faster" "faster" "faster"... and so on for 8 hours a day would be incredibly lucrative, especially when A) they redesign a turbine for maximal moment of inertia since you can just arbitrarily make it spin and B) they can plop you in a warehouse literally anywhere generating clean power silently with no footprint. I figure you'll eventually end up as a government or military contractor supplying power to remote areas to power construction equipment and make obscene amounts of money.
