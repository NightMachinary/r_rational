Then it would depend entirely on what the scale is between real-world energy and your energy, and how quickly your energy recharges. Basically for the turbine idea and other free energy schemes, your power just has to be strong enough to make converting it into real-world energy economical. If it's on the low end of the telekinesis scale where lifting something like a car is difficult/impossible, then it's a no go.

If it's too weak for that but strong enough that you can lift, say, a few hundred pounds indefinitely, then you could make decent bank as a tour guide/remote photographer/disaster relief. Use a full-body harness and you've got a poor-man's flight by instructing it by "hover" "forward" "up" and such. Research groups would fight to contract you since it'd let them get samples/surveys of areas that are difficult to explore without disrupting the environment, such as caves, cliffs, reefs, etc.
