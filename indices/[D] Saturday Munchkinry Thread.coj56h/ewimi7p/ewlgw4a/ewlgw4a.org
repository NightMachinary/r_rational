Can I command an object to "serve" or "obey", so it can then take further commands? What happens if I tell a computer to "improve"? Can I tell a lump of uranium ore to "separate" to get bomb-ready material? Can I tell a piece of paper with an unsolved theorem on it to "prove"? Can I tell a piece of paper with an algorithm written for an infinitely fast computer on it to "execute"?
