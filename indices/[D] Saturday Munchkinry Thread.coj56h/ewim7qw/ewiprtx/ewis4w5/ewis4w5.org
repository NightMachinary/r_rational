  I assume that they have the ability to turn the magnetism on and off?

This is correct.

  Another question is whether the force drops off quickly over distance like actual magnetism.

I am not sure about this one. I was thinking have it at maximum draw in a ten acre area and start dropping off after that. The ability should cover a entire battlefield. Although ten acre might be a bit much.

  If the force is strong enough to drag the man's entire body, it's strong enough to push a blade into an enemy.

I had considered this but are you sure it would be ? An unfit human can run at 20 mph I was thinking 30 or 40 would be the fastest he could get dragged without much damage. Please correct me if you think he could move faster.

Wouldn't that just push an opponent who is armored to a similar level as him ? If he is fighting unarmored opponents I agree it would be a good method.
