I have two characters that have an ability resembling magnetism between them. One is a normal human man with the squishness that implies. The other is a woman made of metal. The drag goes both ways it is just hard to notice it hitting her because of how heavy she is.

The force of the magnetism is strong enough to drag the man towards the woman at a fast but survivable (without damage) speed. The two always know the exact distance and direction between them.

I was thinking having the man grab others and use the ability to drag people to her in fights. Do you know any better ways they could Munchkin these abliltys ?
