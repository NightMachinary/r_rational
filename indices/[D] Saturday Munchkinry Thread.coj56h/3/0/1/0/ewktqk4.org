That seems like a problem with the specific wording more than a problem with the approach; I was thinking of some transactions and power uses just arbitrarily being impossible like crossing invisible walls in a videogame, not active destruction of wealth by magical forces.

Although, acknowledging that saying a complex thing magically happens implies an optimisation process means I can hand the wish specification problem over to an aligned superintelligence just by adding an "as it would be interpreted by a superintelligence aligned to my values" clause. In which case, giving it massive latitude with powers is better than any specific mechanism I could come up with.
