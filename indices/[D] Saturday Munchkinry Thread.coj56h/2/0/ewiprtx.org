I assume that they have the ability to turn the magnetism on and off? Otherwise the man would be glued to the woman permanently.

Another question is whether the force drops off quickly over distance like actual magnetism. If so, at what distance is "The force of the magnetism is strong enough to drag the man towards the woman at a fast but survivable (without damage) speed."?

I would have the man armed and armored to attack enemies directly rather than just dragging them to the woman. After all, if the force is strong enough to drag the man's entire body, it's strong enough to push a blade into an enemy. Have the man and woman run around trying to get enemies between them then activate their ability to have the man charge at the enemy with great force and with a blade pointed at them. If swordsmanship is a problem, consider wearing spiked armor.
