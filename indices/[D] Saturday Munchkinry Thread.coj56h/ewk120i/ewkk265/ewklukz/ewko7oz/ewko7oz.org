Just roll those millions in to the long-distance charges, and you're golden!

I originally posted it as a joke, but given that "economic value" is a bit fuzzy I bet a properly worded power - e.g, "I can do whatever I want, and any economic value generated beyond $500 a week is generated as a debt against me" - would let you basically use money as fuel for whatever superpower you want.

Or you could go full Marxist, and say that since the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_necessary_labour_time][socially necessary labor time]] for the use of your superpowers is basically zero (because it takes you very little time and effort to use your powers), so you generate basically zero economic value any time you use it.
