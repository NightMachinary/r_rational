A passive power with universal range that will work after my death. The goal here is a power that benefits everybody equally and I have no control over meaning dispite benefiting from the power I gain no economic advantage from it. Also pick a universal power that will destroy or masively shrink the economy so that it can't be used to make money at all.

There are probably better ones but this is what I just thought up: The power to have every human to form into a soft hive mind where everyone has perfect empathy and the abilty to conceptualize the whole of humanity and how actions affect them. It also gives everyone a bunch of minor superpowers and reverses entropy as well.
