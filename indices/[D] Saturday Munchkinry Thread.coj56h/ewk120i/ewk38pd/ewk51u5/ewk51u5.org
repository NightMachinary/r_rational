  if you use your power to generate $500 in gold, when the value of gold goes up, does your power turn off?
#+end_quote

If your power generates exactly $500 worth of gold, pegged to the situation you find youself in at the time (e.g., it generates more gold if you're somewhere gold is common, but less if you're where gold is rare) then no, you keep your power. If it's just a fixed amount of gold, and that gold is ever worth more than $500, they yes, your power is disabled.

  what if you use your power to make $500 which you then invest, or gamble with, and make more money
#+end_quote

Only the economic value of your power's direct output is considered.

  if people pay to watch you create gold from nothing, isn't that making more than $500?
#+end_quote

The notoirety effect of "having a superpower" isn't considered, although "providing entertainment" is evaluated at market rate. If your power can be used to generate entertainment, that plays into how much its worth.
