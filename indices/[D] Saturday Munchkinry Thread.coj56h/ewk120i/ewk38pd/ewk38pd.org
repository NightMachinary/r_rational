  If someone, including yourself, ever proposes or thinks of a way to use your power to make more than $500 dollars, you lose the power.
#+end_quote

what does this mean

if you use your power to generate $500 in gold, when the value of gold goes up, does your power turn off?

what if you use your power to make $500 which you then invest, or gamble with, and make more money

if people pay to watch you create gold from nothing, isn't that making more than $500?
