Have a SNAKES ARE SENTIENT? moment, because if your intelligence is preserved when you turn into a wolf, who's to say that other animals aren't also sentient?

Granted, it's a bit of a leap of logic, but you are now in a unique position to greatly advance animal rights, albeit through deceptive methods. Just get a cooperator to exhibit wolf-you like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans][Clever Hans]], showing off your human-level intellect in animal form to make the public believe that animals are sentient.
