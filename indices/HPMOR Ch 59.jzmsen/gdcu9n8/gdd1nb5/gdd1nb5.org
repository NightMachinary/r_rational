It does all take place over the course of one year. It's not - as you asked in another comment - because of time travel, but because the characters driving the plot don't need more than a year to have their plans reach their climax. It's not like the story is complete at that point, just the primary narrative thrust introduced /early on/ in the book rather than later, which sets up the world after (hence why there are so many continuation fics, like Significant Digits, which I second another's commenter's recommendation of).

There are definitely some people who don't like it, and some of them for entirely understandable reasons. But the first 10 chapters really aren't representative of the book as a whole. Harry being rather arrogant and blind to his own faults is the major criticism I've seen of the book from people who abandoned it early on, so if that was a reason you gave it up, I recommend you pick it up again, because that was an intentional choice and was imperative to some arcs of character growth. If you /really/ didn't like it, and for other reasons, I don't think you'll enjoy the rest of the book.

Methods of Rationality falls under rationalistic fiction as it does rational fiction, the key difference being the former involves didactic writing. That doesn't overwhelm the book in my opinion, but it's very subjective. It isn't very technical either, mostly just interesting experimental results and partly an 11 year-old trying to show off. Harry does spend much of the time just making sound (and the occasional insane and entirely self-gratifying because blind to his own faults blah blah) decisions.
