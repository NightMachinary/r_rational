It's definitely heavier on the rational/-ist/ part than the rational. And it does have its weaknesses. But it's definitely still a good read IMO.

Also, it isn't some kind of fix-fic where a smarter Harry Potter goes through the stations of canon and does everything "right". The only things that happen quite like canon is Harry getting a wand, Harry meeting Draco, Ron and Hermione pretty much where he first met them last time, Harry being offered multiple houses by the hat, and Neville falling off a broomstick on his first lesson and dropping the Rememberall. Everything else is new.
