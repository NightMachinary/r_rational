Just read it, it's AMAZING and doesn't feel rushed in the slightest. I believe it is around 700k words IIRC, and the entire HP series is only around a million words. So it's basically got books 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 all put together in one year (the word count of all 5 books in 1 year, with a lot of side-adventures). I prefer it over the original work, lol (original Harry Potter) but it's very niche.
