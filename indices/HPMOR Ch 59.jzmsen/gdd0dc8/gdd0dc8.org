I read it as Voldemort being trouble and Harry being far greater trouble, but not for that reason. It's simply that, if it's Harry, that means he thinks he knows better than all of Magical Britain what's best for them and is unwilling to compromise, bow to politics, or consider slower or less revolutionary solutions to things he observes as problems. In essence, it's what Quirrel said at the end of that arc: if Harry does conquer Magical Britain, overturn the aristocracy and democracy to institute a Harryocracy, and begin to optimize the world as he wishes, he will be their Dark Lord whether or not the magic he uses is actually Dark.

Basically, Dumbledore is deeply concerned that it was either Voldemort, or a far smarter, more dangerous, and more self-righteous Grindelwald. The only advantage to the Grindelwald option is that he's just 11 at this point...but how much of an advantage is that when 11 year old Grindelwald has already invented two incredibly powerful magical techniques which should have been impossible, under a year after discovering that magic even exists?
