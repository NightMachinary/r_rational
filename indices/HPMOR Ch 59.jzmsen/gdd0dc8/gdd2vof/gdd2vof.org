I think at the very least, Harry's uncompromising stance is only part of Dumbledore's worries. From Chapter 61:

  "In any case," said the Potions Master. "I looked within Mr. Lestrange to see if he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has heard nothing. But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the person responsible was Harry Potter."

  "I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That is good news."

I think he's more worried about Harry actually being giving in to his Voldemort tendencies and corrupting his motives. Dumbledore would still strongly oppose a plan to break into Azkaban even to save an innocent person, purely on the grounds of maintaining the peace, but the other side of that argument would not alarm him nearly as much as someone who possesses the intellect to defeat Voldemort giving in to the dark side.
