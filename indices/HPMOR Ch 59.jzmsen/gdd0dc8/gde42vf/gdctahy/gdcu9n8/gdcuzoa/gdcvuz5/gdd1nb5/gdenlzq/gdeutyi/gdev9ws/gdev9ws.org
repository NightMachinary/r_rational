It's got a similar thing to /Worm/ where a large amount of the word count is spent on the main character's thought process, but differs in that Harry is eager to explain what he thinks. Thus, the thought process is formatted as an explanatory conversation, rather than an internal monologue.\\
I feel this is more rewarding, but it is somewhat annoying to read, because you have to pay close attention to when characters might be lying. Some people read the book three or four times, because there are so many layers of 'knowing what will be revealed in the future of the book, this dialogue is much more interesting!'
