I haven't read this, well I read the like first 10 chapters or something like 2 years ago. Is it all 11 year old Harry? Basically from what I've seen on this subreddit nobody talks about like, 5th or 6th year Harry. I'm not the biggest fan of fanfics (especially rational fics) that “solve” the story in his first year. Does the story do it well/not at all?

I get that it birthed the genre and all that jazz and I'm gonna get 15 people telling me to just read it but I don't know /: I don't want to not like something everyone is supposed to like. I remember it being a really science-y type of rational. With like theories and shit explained. I've only been reading rational stories where the characters just make sound decisions based on their situation, not where they are a professor.
