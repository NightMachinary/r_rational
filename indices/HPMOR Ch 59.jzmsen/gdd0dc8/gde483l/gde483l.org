  The only advantage to the Grindelwald option is that he's just 11 at this point...but how much of an advantage is that when 11 year old Grindelwald has already invented two incredibly powerful magical techniques which should have been impossible, under a year after discovering that magic even exists?

And the other problem with that is that only being 11 is a temporary condition.
