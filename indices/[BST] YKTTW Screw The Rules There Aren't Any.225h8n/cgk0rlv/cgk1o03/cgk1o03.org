[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/topfanfic.php][Tons of them]]. It's [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/CategoryStories-1-17/Stargate.htm][one of the most popular crosses for Buffy]].

It actually works really well. Things like the Initiative actually make more sense if you assume the NID was smuggling Goa'uld tech to Dr. Walsh, and the whole "Sarcophagi use life energy" thing fits better with the Buffyverse magic system than it ever did with SG1's scifi.

Return to Normal works on a parallel-universes-with-different-laws basis (still an excellent fic, though read the prequel first). Better showcases of the cross are [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-4301/Kei+Trick+Or+Treat.htm][Trick Or Treat]], [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-21613/ShayneT+Potential.htm][Potential]] and [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-7705/DonSample+Are+You+Ready.htm][Are You Ready?]]
