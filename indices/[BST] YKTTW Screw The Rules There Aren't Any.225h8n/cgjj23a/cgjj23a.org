This trope shows up a lot in rational fiction, and is something of a real-world rationality lesson, so I thought I'd try getting it its own trope page. I'm hoping to get more attention and contribution by pointing it out here. If this goes well, I'll do a few more of these.

If you're not a troper normally, please be a good guest in their space. Possibly skim their [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TVTropesCustoms][customs document]] and similar things. Also, please remember that this trope should stand alone as a general fiction trope, apart from rational fiction as such.

If you can find anime/manga or comic book examples, I'd especially appreciate those as they can displace "fan works" from the first medium in alphabetical order. (Sadly, I don't know either well.)
