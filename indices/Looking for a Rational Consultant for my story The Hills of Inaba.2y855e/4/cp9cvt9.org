I'd be more than happy to help you: I actually started reading the fic, and have an intimate knowledge of the source material and a solid understanding of at least the Less Wrong approach to rationality. I think I could be a help, if you're still interested.

I've also had some experience writing rational fiction, though nothing published or completed, so take that as you will.
