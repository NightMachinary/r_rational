Sure, I'd love to give it a try! I'm a big fan of both Persona 4 and rational fiction and have a good eye for smooth plot flow and characterization. I'll go take a look at the story in question now, since I wasn't aware of its existence yet!

Update: I've finished reading the existing chapters and want to confirm my availability as a rational consultant (I have trope knowledge, if it helps!). I found your story quite intriguing and am ready to be as helpful as I can for contributing to realize its potential. I'll leave you a more detailed review on FF.net later on today regardless. Also, yes, this is my first post on reddit ever.
