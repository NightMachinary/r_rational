I'm thinking of rereading the whole arc so I can fully appreciate it without the long wait times. I bet I'll notice a lot more foreshadowing that I didn't pick up the first time. But I did remember enough about [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0963.html][this key page]] to find it again. This is the page that shows us "A. what Durkon observed to give him his new understanding of the vampire's psychology, B. that he deliberately avoided cluing the vampire in to what he'd figured out, and C. that he intended to use this information to his advantage in the future.

The scene where the vampire gives its "you are who you are on your worst day" speech is also pretty important, since it sets up Durkon's rebuttal (which is my favorite part about this page, even though I didn't address it in the OP).

In addition, we've seen at least a couple of times where Durkon attempts--either successfully or not--to selectively show memories that will influence the vampire. For example, he tries to drag out a memory (page 948) to make the vampire hesitate and tip off the OOTS. Later, he volunteers a memory that gives the vampire useful information (page 1088), in order to steer it into doing its evil plans somewhere where it wouldn't have to immediately kill anyone in the process So that set the stage for him to use memories as the vector for his final attack.

In fact, he even leverages that second memory into preparing his attack! When the vampire demands that he explain why he volunteered the information, he agrees to tell it the truth in exchange for showing it another memory (page 1089). That other memory just happened to emphasize the extent of Sigdi's poverty, which drove home the magnitude of her sacrifice and helped ensure the vampire would have the desired emotional reaction when it found out.

Edit: Found another one! Page 983, Durkon, without being asked, shows the vampire a memory whose central point is that Sigdi didn't have the money to fix her arm. I believe that all of the memories about Sigdi's suffering--more to the point, about Durkon witnessing his beloved mother's suffering--were intended to prime the vampire to be baffled and horrified when it found out that she willingly gave up the chance to avoid all of it. "How could you not think about how your selflessness would affect ME?
