Thanks! Your reasons are good, I just wish somebody had implemented a way to do spoiler tags that still work if you click on them.

As for the story, I mostly agree with your analysis though the twist did catch me off guard. Combined with the tpk timing that makes it almost feels like a DeM but maybe it would make more sense on a second reading.

I'm more wondering about the setup going on with Belkar. Either he happened to stab the vampire at the same moment and helped kill it, or Durkon's recovery is about to be very short lived.
