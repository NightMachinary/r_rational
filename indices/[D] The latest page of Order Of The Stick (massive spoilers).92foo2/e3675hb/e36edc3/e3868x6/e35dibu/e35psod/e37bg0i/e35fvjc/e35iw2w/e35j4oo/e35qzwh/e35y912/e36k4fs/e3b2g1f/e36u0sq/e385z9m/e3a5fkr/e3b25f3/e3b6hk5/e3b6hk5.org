Yeah, I think the whole book is non-canon, and mentions it several times. ("You win this time, but I'll be back!" "Actually this version of the strip was canceled years ago, so this is probably your last appearance ever.") Though maybe the framing story for the Stick Tales stories is part of regular canon. Sadly that book isn't available as a PDF so I don't have it handy.

The "Invaders from the Fourth Edition" story does a pretty good job of showing the different focuses of the two systems and their respective pros and cons, while still being an entertaining story (IMHO, of course). I was kinda hoping he'd do something similar for 5e in the new book, but I'm sure not going to complain about a bunch of new canonical stories. üòÅ
