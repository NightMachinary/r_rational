It seems like you have a different vision of the comic than the author does, or I do. I get the impression that you see it as a failed "munchkin fic," whereas I see it as a different kind of story entirely.

When I say munchkin fic, I'm referring to stories where the characters are aware of a set of "game mechanics," and the plot is driven/conflicts are resolved by their exploitation of those mechanics. I've read and enjoyed a few of these stories. Conversely, in OOTS it's more common for conflicts to be resolved (or to arise) through interaction between characters in which they persuade, manipulate, support, or outwit one another (e.g. Belkar snapping Roy out of his funk after Durkon's death; Haley redirecting golem!Crystal to attack Bozzok instead of her, then tricking her into the waste disposal pit; the current page; countless other examples), or through independent epiphanies they have in reaction to their experiences (this happens to V a lot, usually helped along by another character's insights). In addition, the author has outright said that he'll bend or break D&D RAW if it makes for a better story. This doesn't preclude characters acting rationally, it just means they're playing a different game than a player at an actual D&D table might.

Basically, as much as I like munchkin fics, I don't think OOTS is bad or generic because it isn't one. It's likely just not your preferred style of fiction--which is totally fine, I'm not trying to argue that you "should" enjoy it.

(The above doesn't address your criticism about Xykon not showing up for so long, but I think it's less of an issue in an archival reading, which is how the majority of readers will experience the comic in the long run. It seems like forever since he's appeared because we have to wait days, weeks, or months for a new strip, but it hasn't really been that long from the perspective of someone reading straight through.)

ETA: Just recalled a page that I think is a great illustration of what kind of story OOTS is and isn't. [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0618.html][Here]], Bozzok seems to have the advantage because he can attack Haley every round by having a disposable minion flank her, forcing her to kill them to prevent a Sneak Attack while he continues to hit her. Nothing in the rules prevents him from continuing to attack uncontested until he runs out of minions. However, because this is primarily a story about /people/ rather than game mechanics, Bozzok can only pull this off a few times before the remaining minions choose not to "die for his fleeting tactical advantage."
