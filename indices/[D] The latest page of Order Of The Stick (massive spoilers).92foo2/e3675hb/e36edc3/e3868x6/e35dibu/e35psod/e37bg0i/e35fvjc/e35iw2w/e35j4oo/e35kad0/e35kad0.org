I mean the problems with the comic. The nominal big bad (Xyklon) hasn't shown up in more than 200 strips last I checked, and hasn't interacted with the heroes in longer than that. Plot points almost never get resolved by the abilities the characters have -- which is particularly bad because we can know and reason about those abilities since it's based on a published game. When characters /do/ try to use their abilities, their success or failure is dependent on the author's vision for the plot, not the effect of those abilities (which we, again, know). Basically, it's stalled out, and given up the things that made it unique in favor of being a generic fantasy story that is simply less good than other fantasy stories I could read instead.
