Sorry about that. The page is so recent that I wanted to be really careful about spoilers.

SPOILERS BELOW

  The latest page of OOTS made me want to open a discussion here about how that comic handles characters who are both intelligent and good (or "Good").

  I'm always impressed with stories where Good characters win not just because they deserve to or had a last-minute revelation or powerup, but because they planned in advance to arrange a victory with the limited resources available to them. I especially enjoyed this page and the slow build leading up to it because it's a take on the "redeeming the villain" arc that I rarely see. I've seen many redemption arcs where the villain is won over by the kindness of the heroes, the betrayal of the real Big Bad, camaraderie against a common foe, etc.") And those are all fine! But I rarely find one where a Good character /plans out/ a redemption tailored to their opponent. In this case we got to see Durkon observe how the vampire reacted to the memories it accessed, reason that it couldn't grasp the meaning behind emotionally significant memories without the experiences leading up to them, carefully manage his interactions with it to ensure it would be vulnerable to his planned attack, and finally maneuver it into an emotional state where it would consent to the overwhelming flood of memories that overwrote its identity. The thought and preparation that went into the events of this page made them feel truly earned.

  I particularly like how this arc doesn't fall into the "feelings are a pointless distraction from Logic(TM), unworthy of consideration" trope that I often see in portrayals of intelligent characters. Durkon's strategy is successful because he understands how powerfully emotions can affect people and, more to the point, how they've affected /him./ He has the wisdom and introspection to recognize how he felt about Sigdi's sacrifice, model how he /would have/ felt about it without the experiences that had prepared him to manage and contextualize it, and leverage that into a strategic play to overwrite the vampire's utility function with his own. A character who hadn't developed their emotional intelligence the way Durkon has could not have pulled this off.

  I'd like to hear others' thoughts. What did you think of this page? What moments do you remember that set the stage for it? What were some other times in this comic, or in other stories, where a Good character (for any value of Good, though I'm mainly thinking in terms of selflessness/compassion) succeeded at their goal by intelligently applying their knowledge, wisdom, and resources?" What about times when they didn't?
