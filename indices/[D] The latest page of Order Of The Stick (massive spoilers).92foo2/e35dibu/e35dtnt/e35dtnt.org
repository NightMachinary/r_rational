I think the idea is that the amulet causes him pain (because he's Evil), which shocked him awake (while also blocking the Domination as part of its regular effect). I don't think that's a thing in D&D RAW, but we know the author is willing to bend the rules for the sake of story. Once he's up, he seems to activate his barbarian rage, which gives him temp HP.
