Yeah - [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0584.html][good is not dumb]] That was a /really/ fulfilling end to that arc.

Especially considering the vampire's earlier claims that Durkon could never pull anything over on him because the vampire had a higher INT score - the vampire couldn't possibly have expected /this/ because if he'd even known it was an option, it would need to have already worked.
