Oh man, that is /clever!/ It establishes how vampire spirits' personalities work, and how this one's thoughts are related to Durkon's. This sets the stage for the slow build-up, which I didn't really appreciate at the time -- but now, at the end, everything makes perfect sense. (Eeeeee! This is great and I'm envious because nothing I've ever written has come close to this level of foreshadowing.)
