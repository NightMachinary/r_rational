I guess whether it resonates depends on what aspects of OOTS are most important to you. I'm not particularly interested in how closely the story hews to 3E mechanics (and the author has said that he isn't either), and I see the individual character arcs as at least equally important as the main Xykon plotline (in part because I expect each character's growth to be critical to the group's eventual victory). This page is a massive character development payoff for Durkon in addition to being a portrayal of an intelligent Good character, so I'm enthusiastic about it.

I'm not sure what you mean by "The ways in which it is good are not conductive to fixing the problems OotS has," though. Do you mean the comic itself, or the in-universe Order of the Stick? If the latter, I'd counter that it fixes pretty much all of their immediate problems and will help tremendously with the main Xykon problem.
