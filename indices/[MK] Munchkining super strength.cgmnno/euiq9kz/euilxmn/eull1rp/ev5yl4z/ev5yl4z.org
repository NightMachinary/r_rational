You can't actually lift that much weight even with unlimited strength because you'll destroy the ground you are standing on when all of that weight settles on your feet, plus it would be impossible to actually maintain your balance long enough to center it over your head. Same thing for pushing, hitting, throwing heavy things etc. Someone with super strength doesn't really have the mass or surface area to use their strength effectively even with the invulnerability caveat due to the limitations of friction, inertia, the strength of materials, etc. They're essentially limited by physics to only using their strength to a fairly low level. They'd have one hell of a firm handshake though. Honestly I think the artistic take is really the most actual practical use you'd get. I mean, there are certain things they could do well in manufacturing but unless you have an army of them it isn't worth the additional overhead and headaches a couple special cases will cause rather than just doing everything the same way in all of your plants.
