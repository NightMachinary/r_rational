There's a manufacturing angle in there. Robots have to be programmed, which takes time and money. Making just one of something with a robot is ridiculously expensive compared to making the same thing with human limbs and custom fixturing, even if you don't count the cost of the robot.

If an mc can replace a hoist or crane with her bare hands that's a huge advantage and a few of these can have huge impacts on their region's macroeconomics. I'm just not sure it's an interesting enough focus for a story.
