Another avenue for making super strength more interesting for a rational, creative protagonist is making certain that there are multiple forms of super strength with different mechanisms and limitations ala the Parahumans series. Like a forcefield that can take any hit once before breaking and reforming after a momentary delay, or having the ability to massively expand your muscles while regenerating in the process, or having a field of vastly slowed time permeating your entire body that you can somehow move normally within. There are a lot of ways to make strength more interesting.
