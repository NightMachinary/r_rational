  Saving people from being mugged is kind of suboptimal and cute in a naive way..

This is one of those things that gets brought up sometimes in superhero fiction. Like if you can fly and have super-strength, why on earth are you "patrolling" around the city looking to stop muggings?

I can't remember if was /Worm/ or something else, where they said something like, "anywhere that the heroes patrol sees a % reduction in crime over the following two weeks," such that you're doing more net good by NOT looking for fights, and just "patrolling" an area to prevent crime in the first place.
