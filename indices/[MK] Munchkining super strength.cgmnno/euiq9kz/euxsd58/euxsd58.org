It doesn't really matter unless the other guy has some super durability.

In pretty much everything the superman and the pals just knock everyone and their heads don't just explode like they should.

But maybe a guy with super strenght should use a throwing weapon instead? Especially if he does not have super speed to go with it so he can't close the gap? But on the other hand they could just use a gun. The great equalizer.
