  Thing is, fast twitch muscles are also used for punching and kicking. So unless you want your superhero to have normal human punches but be really good at lifting stuff, that excuse doesn't fly.

They wouldn't be normal. It would be like getting hit by an unmovable object. A normal fist is pretty much fast enough to kill a person already. With super strength the fist wouldn't slow down much when hitting something if hitter has a good stance. And important thing with hitting things with your fist is to try hitting through it, not stopping to hit when you touch the target. Then again, if your hand can't handle it, you shouldn't hit that hard anyway.

  max speeds should definitely be higher than peak human.
#+end_quote

Just a bit above peak human is very barely superspeed. Lets remember that peak human speed has been rising all the time. Speed would have to be pretty quick to be considered super, and probably multiple times human to be useful as a main power.

And still a normal body wouldn't be able to handle that stress.

  As for the "It's magic, don't question it" approach
#+end_quote

I never intended to go there. Clearly Superman and Flash has some magic going on. Otherwise Supes would not keep his muscles when he loses his powers if his power came from the muscles. Flash has clearly supernatural speedforce too and is not always very muscular. Other people like Lana Lang has also gotten Superman's strength without gaining any visible muscularity.

I never meant to say not to analyze them, just that it's often clearly magic and not admitting that would probably give a bad analysis.
