Because their strength isn't universally increased; those we consider the "strongest" are typically bodybuilders or others focused on lifting strength. But running is ALSO dependent on muscle strength, just different muscles. There's an element of technique too, of course, but if the maximum force your muscles are capable of outputting is uniformly increased, that should include the muscles used to run, allowing much greater top speeds.

I don't see any sensible interpretation that allows for super strength kicks but does not allow for greater maximum running speed.
