Thing is, super strength often does not actually increase muscle mass in relation to strength. Otherwise supers would be way too buff, instead of just chiseled like superman.

My interpretation is that super strength and speed is basically magic, as in not really related to physics. If it was physics, super speed would be too fast for the body and would need other magics like Flash's speedforce bubble to protect him.

And a magic to increase lifting and punching power doesn't have to have same effects as a magic to increase movespeed.

But as far as I know, people have two types of muscles, fast and slow. And it could be that speed works on fast ones and strength on slow ones, so that could work too. At least on technobabble level.
