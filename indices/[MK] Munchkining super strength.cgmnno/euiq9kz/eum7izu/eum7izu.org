Imagine Superman facing down General Zod so that the human race doesn't become enslaved.

The dramatic music starts playing, the lights dim, Supes and Zod square up and raise their arms. Then they each extend their index finger.

The next scene is entirely in slow-mo, to illustrate their superspeed as they feint, parry, riposte, and try to secure a lethal poke. Eyes are blazing red as they circle around, testing each other's footwork and even taking to the skies as fingers come from all directions.

Finally, a brief moment of distraction has Supes' finger pressed against Zod's throat. A small moment of hesitation, then Superman steels himself, and yells (in superspeed, there's no way he can make the speech in normal time):

  This hand of mine glows with an awesome power!

  Its burning grip tells me to defeat you!

  TAKE THIS!

  MY LOVE, MY ANGER, AND ALL OF MY SORROW!

  SHINING FINGER!

Zod explodes. The end.
