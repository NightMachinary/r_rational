I've always wondered at shonen anime fights where they monologue at each other - given they're clearly capable of perception of ~bullet time level punches/kicks/etc, wouldn't ordinary speech feel glacial in comparison?

Or is it merely translating super-speed chipmunk speech into viewers' speeds lol?
