DBZ's first villain, Raditz, can move faster than light. Over the course of the show we see that he's pathetic compared to the fighters that come next, almost all of whom are much faster and stronger. Yet the protagonists still scream and talk during the battles. Forget chipmunk voice, this means DBZ characters are talking faster than light.
