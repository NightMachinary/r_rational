Depends what the goal is, if it's money and fame, you can just go pro athlete. Funnily enough this would technically be the one of the optimal choices for rational beings that care about reducing the suffering and making the world better.

Just donate the money to worthy causes and use your fame and influence to make people care about big problems they wouldn't otherwise. Saving people from being mugged is kind of suboptimal and cute in a naive way..
