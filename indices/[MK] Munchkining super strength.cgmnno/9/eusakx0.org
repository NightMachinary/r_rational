Super strength is also one of the powers most likely (at least in the stories I've read) to have a quasi-biological explanation, with mechanisms that are relatively easy to see (cue generic scientist character going: 'Incredible! I've never seen anything like it! etc...)

One way to munchkin your power would be to go to school, train up in the medical sciences, and then get to work studying yourself. Figuring out how your super strength works, and how you might use that understanding to give other people super strength, could be a worthy goal for a rational super strong protagonist. Especially in a classic comic book universe where every alien civilisation already seem to have a super power that every member of the species possesses.
