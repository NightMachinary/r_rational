The thing about super strength is that it's a power that machines already have - strong engines and motors can lift and move things even elephants wouldn't be able to. A person with super strength might still have an advantage in applying that strength with precision, though; a human hand is extremely dexterous when compared to a backhoe or a crane. Ironically, one of the best things to do with super strength in the modern world might be to become an artist and work with materials and at scales a normal person couldn't.
