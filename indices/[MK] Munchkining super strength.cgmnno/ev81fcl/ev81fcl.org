With super strength come a lot of versatility, for example:

- By squirting water out if your mouth you have become a water jet cutter

- Your limbs, with enough leverage, become like hydraulic presses

- You can make diamonds by squeezing coal (although might need more power since the temperature isn't there)

- you can swim through earth's crust and conduct research

- Your claps cause sonic booms, which can disorient does without killing them

That's all I can think of right now
