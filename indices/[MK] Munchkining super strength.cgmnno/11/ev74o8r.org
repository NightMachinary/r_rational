A very significant problem with exerting super strength is leverage and inertia. For instance, you're limited in how fast you could run or jump by friction with the ground, and material strength of the surfaces and objects you interact with. In some ways it bears similarities to a normal human in zero G, in that you primarily have your own mass, inertia, and leverage via grip to work with.

For combat don't punch or kick, grapple. Then you can hold on with one hand and kick or punch with another limb, or just use both hands and twist or tear. Additionally, thowing small heavy dense objects like large ball bearings or dense stones may be useful.

For fast movement, dig your fingers into the ground or other surface and throw yourself in the desired direction, or pick up dense heavy objects like stones and throw them in the opposite of your desired vector.

To move heavy or dense things, employ cables, straps, and levers. Think of yourself as a crane or a forklift.
