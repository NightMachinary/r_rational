Is the weakest component of a fighter jet the person? You could use your super strength to do maneuvers at 20 G's.

If you are strong enough to swim through land, that opens some possibilities. You can soften the ground for construction work, dig tunnels for cheap, or try your hand at prospecting.

Maybe become a tour guide at Mount Everest--you can carry folks up on your back, along with an inordinate amount of supplemental oxygen.

Get some engineers to design a human-powered aircraft for you. Your power output should simplify things.

Maybe go the Iron Man route? You could wear extremely heavy armor and become a human tank. There is probably utility in that, assuming you can convince whatever military you want to assist that there is less utility in trying to dissect you.

Cooperating with the scientists and trying to figure out what's going on might actually be your best option. Make it apparent that you want a cut should any useful technology result from your experimentation.
