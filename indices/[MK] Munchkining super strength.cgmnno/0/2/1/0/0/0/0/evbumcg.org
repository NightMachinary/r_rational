Thing is, fast twitch muscles are also used for punching and kicking. So unless you want your superhero to have normal human punches but be really good at lifting stuff, that excuse doesn't fly. The inverse excuse COULD help explain a superhero who's fast (but probably not to speedforce levels) and can hit hard, but can't lift heavy stuff, which works a little better.

I don't see the need to try and figure out a way for super strength to work without implying some degree of super speed. It's not like it makes purely speed focused supers useless; the levels of super speed that super strength implies are far below those of someone like the Flash, and it doesn't necessarily come with the requisite super-reflexes required to make full use of that speed. But if all you need to do is close the distance really quickly or cover a long distance in a relatively straight path, max speeds should definitely be higher than peak human.

As for the "It's magic, don't question it" approach, well, I don't like it. Even when it's literally magic I analyze it and try to find hard rules. It's sanderson's first law of magic; an author's ability to satisfyingly solve a problem with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic. So even if we say that super strength is magic and can in some ways violate the known laws of physics, for this to be able to be used to satisfyingly resolve a plot, it at least must do so in specific and predictable ways, not just do whatever the plot requires with no way of saying it definitely can or cannot do something. Moreover, we're on [[/r/rational]], a community I think is probably much less inclined to accept the "it's just magic, don't question it" explanation than most.
