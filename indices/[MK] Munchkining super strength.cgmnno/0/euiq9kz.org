The funniest thing about super strength to me is that, with invulnerability, you actually shouldn't bother punching things if you want to cause more damage... you should poke them.

If you focus more of the energy of your hit into a much smaller area, like a poke, you would cause far more damage. The reason average people don't do it is because their fingers would break or bend.
