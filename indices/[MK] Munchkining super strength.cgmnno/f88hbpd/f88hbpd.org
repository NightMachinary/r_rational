Tungsten ball bearings in a big mittful with a full-power throw delivered by someone with enhanced strength is probably at least as damaging as a shotgun blast, if not more. In a pinch just stomp the ground and throw small bits of rock. There's a reason bombs are deadly and shrapnel is a lot of it.

If you're fighting a lot of not superhumanly though opponents, this scene from [Citadel] showing a fight between a guy with super strength and a guy who can create fully autonomous clones of himself connected by a Hive mind. It underlines the ridiculous amount of damage you can do with super strength, durable cables with weights on the end, and momentum:

  ... Achala stopped running when he reached the center of the room but he didn't stop moving.

  He gave a little flick of his wrists, then Achala was holding a pair of... jump ropes? The Hectors outside were too far to see in detail and the ones inside had their vision obscured by their gas masks. Each had a small handle with a thin cord attaching it to a weight about the size of a gumball.

  Achala spun them, one in each hand, in circles that never quite intersected but covered all of the area around him. The cords stretched out about fifteen feet. Every Hector within that area died in seconds, cut limb from limb as the cord or the weight passed through their bodies without resistance.

Take something flat and wide, like a shovel or just plank of wood and depending on the strength you have and the size of the tool, you can create walls of wind. With enough strength you could create tornado- and hurricane-force winds.

Similarly, water. With the right size of tool and enough strength, you could generate gigantic waves similar to tidal waves or the ones generated in tropical storms.

Actually, because water doesn't compress very well, I wonder if possibly you can run on water just by taking heavy enough steps with super strength. Someone call a physicist!

Speaking of water, purse your lips super tight and leave the tiniest gap you possibly can, now blow water out of that in a jet and if you're strong enough and durable enough to widthstand it yourself, you'll create a waterjet like they use to cut through multiple-inch-thick pieces of metal.

Never enter a room with hostiles via the door. Go around to an adjacent room and walk/run/bust through the wall to enter from an area they aren't considering. Or the floor, floor's always good. No matter where you come from, works better when there aren't hostages.
