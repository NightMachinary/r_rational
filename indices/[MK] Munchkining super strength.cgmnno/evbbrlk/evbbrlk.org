Hmm... in terms of combat applications, specially made bows and crossbows might be useful. After all, in real life, draw weight is limited by the limits of human strength. Someone with super strength would be able to draw bows and crossbows that a normal person could not. Then again, I have to assume there's a limit to how effective this would be, considering that as far as I can tell you could accomplish the same thing by adding a powerful motor, and as far as I know that's not a widespread weapon. If the issues making its use limited are based on the weight or fuel costs of the motor though, or if the super strength is great enough to exceed what is practical with motors (and there are materials that can support that) then it might still be viable here where no motor is required. But it's also possible that we simply don't have materials with the right properties to make this worth using over firearms. I don't know enough about the topic to say one way or another.

Despite the fact that the weight is less of a concern for you, I think that heavy armor may still be inadvisable even if there are materials strong enough to take your super strength. Throwing around as much force as someone with super strength can is going to generate a lot of heat, and assuming you're not especially resistant to heat, that means cooling needs to be a priority. Depending on the degree of super strength (and degree of resistance to the heat generated by it, as well as the efficiency of the strength itself), this may mean as little as wearing clothes that breathe well, or it may require active cooling solutions to facilitate safe use of greater degrees of strength.
