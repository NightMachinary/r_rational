Hmm. It's weird how Davo and Fanny keep insisting that Nic is hiding of his own free will, after everything they've been through, considering what happened to Simole, and knowing that they know Nic is haunted by a demon. /Too/ weird. Are they trying to get rid of Dizzy, as per Nic's adamant "under no circumstances she is to be involved" order, or is something even more weird going on?

  If nothing else, it had been an excellent lesson in humility. He had entered the dragon's lair as though he was a mighty warrior, worthy of the challenge. But he was a fool. A child.

[[/u/mooderino][u/mooderino]], I think this sentiment has been expressed enough times.

  Even if he'd got here in time, what could he have done? It had been a stupid, childish idea. He didn't have any power, no special abilities, no source of supernatural strength. There were certainly people like that in the world <...>, but he wasn't one. He wasn't special. --- /Chapter 20/

  He was no match. He was a child pitted against adults. <...> Realisation of his own folly and lack of ability took him away from whatever the demon and the Archmage were talking about. It didn't seem very important to him. --- /Chapter 28/

  Nic knew he was embroiled in affairs far beyond his control. His role was only important in as far as his connection to the people who were the true players on the stage. He felt both a fraud and an unworthy participant in such momentous events. --- /Chapter 30/

  He wasn't foolish enough to think the reason he had become the focal point for such strange happenings was due to him. It wasn't he who was special, it was the school itself, he had just been the one to unearth it. --- /Chapter 35/

It's understandable that the plot so far somewhat traumatized Nic and made him feel powerless, but maybe decrease the amount of explicit descriptions of it? At least to me, it creates an impression of "trying too hard", as if Nic/the author is trying to convince himself/the readers that Nic is totally not special, nuh-uh, right before the Grand Reveal that Nic is special and extremely talented. (Which is I'm pretty sure not the intent, but still.)
