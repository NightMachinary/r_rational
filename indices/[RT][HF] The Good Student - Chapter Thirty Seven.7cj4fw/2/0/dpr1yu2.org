This is one of the issues of writing a serial. It's difficult to judge how vague/heavy-handed I'm being other than by going on reader response. If I had the liberty of rewriting and editing, it would read a lot smoother.

But readers are a mixed bag, and I get opposing criticisms and advice all the time. So, if I write a scene where a door is locked, and in the next scene a character walks through the door, some readers will point out the error, not thinking it's intentional.

I can counter this by having the character say, “Wasn't this locked earlier...” but then it's like putting a neon sign over it, Look, important and it annoys readers who got it already.

And there's the third possibility, which is that I genuinely did make a mistake.

Recently I've been getting a lot of people finding Nic to be passive and not worthy of being the MC. Which is okay if they don't like the direction I'm taking, but it's annoying when they don't acknowledge it's a deliberate choice on my part. I tend to underline and put it in bold to make a point, which is probably not the best move, but it's tricky to find the right balance when I'm writing so many different things and also trying to sort out irl stuff.

You're right to point out the redundancy (and I appreciate it) and I will be more wary of doing it again, but it will properly crop up in relation to some other element of the story. What I really need is an assistant to help me keep everything in order. But first, of course, I will be hiring a monkey butler.
