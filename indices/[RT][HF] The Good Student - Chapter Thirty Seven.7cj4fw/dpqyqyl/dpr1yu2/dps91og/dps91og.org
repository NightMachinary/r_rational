Well, I apologize, but I can't help but blame your choice of readership for it. If I understand correctly, gravitytales.com and royalroadl.com are notorious for their wish-fulfilment stories about overpowered MCs, which I imagine are usually also lacking in depth. Your comments about their feedback only confirm it: Nic /explicitly thought/ about his lack of ability and power multiple times, he discussed it with Fanny and Davo, there were jokes about it, his uninterest in studying magic is important to the plot, etc. Your analogue doesn't fit: it's not a small detail akin to a closed door, it's a long-established plot point. If people still complain about it as if it's something new, I think it shows poor reading comprehension, which is a problem with the readers, not a problem with the story.

... Hm, okay, that last sentence was somewhat meaningless. If a story is intended for a certain kind of readers and doesn't work for them, it /is/ a problem with the story. What I meant to say is that perhaps the story you want to tell is not the story meant for the audience you're likely to gather where you're publishing.

Take this subreddit as a counterexample. Nobody here complains about Nic, they only sometimes complain about the seeming lack of plot direction.
