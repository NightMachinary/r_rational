I think it's reasonable character progression. Remember, his various attempts at being proactive ended up, in order, with the person he pursued rejecting him, with his friend physically dead and himself haunted by a demon, with him surrounded by mages ready to kill him, and lately, with him trapped underground waiting to be sacrificed. Even before, a lot of his proactivity was allowed by Simole's presence: if not for her, Prince Leovek et al. would've likely succeed in shutting down his various plots, such as remedial classes or setting up the pace of studying.

Frankly, I think he is being as productive as could be expected, given the circumstances. He leverages his main strength (studying) to learn about demons, and (tries to) use situational advantages (demon in his head) to aid with it. It's a situation that rarely appears in stories, and I'm very interested in where the plot would go with it.
