It's also difficult reading serials. When I read a finished story front to back (or back to front, as the case may be), it's all whole in my mind at once. When I get a chapter each week or so, it becomes difficult to keep track of details. Even larger plot points slip away. The point with the (un)locked door? When reading serially, I /need/ that neon sign. When I'm reading it all at once, it becomes heavy-handed. I don't know the solution to this.

(And when reading serial fanfiction, the problems are compounded even more, because the details get confused with canon and every other fanfic I've ever read. I read one HP fanfic where the writer was determined not to make Rowling's mistake and to make sure Flint graduated, specifically mentioning he wasn't on the quidditch team. And a few chapters later, there he is, team captain.)
