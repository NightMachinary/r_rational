The ending of the nested story reminds me of the poem "Power of Taste" by Zbigniew Herbert:

#+begin_example
  It didn't require great character at all
  our refusal disagreement and resistance
  we had a shred of necessary courage
  but fundamentally it was a matter of taste
                                  Yes taste
  in which there are fibers of soul the cartilage of conscience

  Who knows if we had been better and more attractively tempted
  sent rose-skinned women thin as a wafer
  or fantastic creatures from the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch
  but what kind of hell was there at this time
  a wet pit the murderers' alley the barrack
  called a palace of justice
  a home-brewed Mephisto in a Lenin jacket
  sent Aurora's grandchildren out into the field
  boys with potato faces
  very ugly girls with red hands

  Verily their rhetoric was made of cheap sacking
  (Marcus Tullius kept turning in his grave)
  chains of tautologies a couple of concepts like flails
  the dialectics of slaughterers no distinctions in reasoning
  syntax deprived of beauty of the subjunctive

  So aesthetics can be helpful in life
  one should not neglect the study of beauty

  Before we declare our consent we must carefully examine
  the shape of the architecture the rhythm of the drums and pipes
  official colors the despicable ritual of funerals

            Our eyes and ears refused obedience
            the princes of our senses proudly chose exile

  It did not require great character at all
  we had a shred of necessary courage
  but fundamentally it was a matter of taste
                              Yes taste
  that commands us to get out to make a wry face draw out a sneer
  even if for this the precious capital of the body the head
                                                  must fall

It's about communist regime, but works for other too.
