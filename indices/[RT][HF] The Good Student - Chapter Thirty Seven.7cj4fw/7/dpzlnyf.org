So I love this story. I love this chapter and I (from what I've seen so far) love the characters. It might have even overtaken Worm for me. Which is /insane/ because I fucking love worm.

I know that Nic's 'unimportance' is brought up with enough frequently used that some people might find it annoying, but then, I always sort of figured that /that was the point/. Nobody around Nic can seem to stop reminding him just how incidental he is to the plot and that, despite his best efforts thus far, he hasn't really been able to clear that bar in any way that might give him some sense of self worth. I'm not annoyed at yet another reminder as to how helpless Nic is. I'm annoyed /with Nic/ that the world has chosen to remind him how helpless he is. There's a palpable frustration that builds up every time this happens and I'm desperately looking forward to it's culmination. The "fuck it. I don't care how worthless people think I am. I am /not a bystander/." Or something like that anyway.

Funny thing, the only people to actually consider his agency are those who /know/ him. Davo, Fanny and (to a lesser extent) our odd boy out, are actually sort of terrified of Nic. Hell, when Davo jokes about Nic being able to take a demon, he doesn't actually seem like he was entirely joking. Even Dizzy's looking at him twice and she's literally a teenaged spymaster.

Anyway, I'm done gushing. Looking forward to the next chapter!
