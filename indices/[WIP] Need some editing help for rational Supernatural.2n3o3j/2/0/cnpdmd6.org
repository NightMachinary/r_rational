Honestly I got about 7k words in and realized I needed to rewrite about half of it because everyone who read it was being bored by it. The original couple of episodes are hard to make entertaining in written form. (I was starting from the series' start and then diverging) I got frustrated.

I have an outline of the entire story and background that I think is really good but I am utterly godawful at dialogue. It takes me hours I don't have. For the moment it is stalled unless I can find another fic writer who can do dialogue well to work on it with me. I really should get back to looking for somebody.
