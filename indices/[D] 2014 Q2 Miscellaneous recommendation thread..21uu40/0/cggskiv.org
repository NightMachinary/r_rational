The Magicians by Lev Grossman is the best possible demonstration of some LessWrong posts about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/]['if you demand magic, magic won't help']] and the like. It's got a lot of awfully well written segments to it as well. The protagonist is not ... a good or nice person at many times ... which may dismay some readers, but considering this crowd enjoys e.g. Worm this is likely not to be a dealbreaker. There's a lot of good writing and interesting ideas, but there's also a lot of nihilism.

It's got a good deconstruction of several genres and tropes that might be of interest, especially the Harry Potter Magical School thing, and another that would be spoiling the novel to discuss. A lot of good stuff overall, though. Not really much rationality, but a fair bit of deconstruction and twisting various tropes

In other works, I've been rereading the Hyperion/Endymion books by Dan Simmons (partway into Endymion now). There's little rationality and logic and all that stuff in these, and the portrayal of AI is severely problematic in many respects but Simmons' use of language and cool ideas/concepts more than make up for this. The best book is still Hyperion, but Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion are still pretty good on their own terms. A word of warning - if you try this series and don't really enjoy Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion a lot, you might want to avoid Endymion/Rise of Endymion - there's several plot twists and revelations that are not very well liked by a lot of the fan base. Overall, I recommend the whole thing almost entirely on the basis of the writing quality, which is astoundingly good.

Finally, I've been following [[http://markreads.net/reviews/][Mark Reads the Discworld]] recently. This is a community centered around first-time experiencing old series of books and TV shows, with a major emphasis on spoilers. They are just starting Discworld with The Colour of Magic and plan to progress through the entire thing in publication order, at a rate of 20-30 pages per two workweek days (expected finish - about six years away). If you want to discuss stuff on their threads, remember to ROT-13 cipher any spoilers of stuff they haven't got to yet, and also remember that the community over there has an extremely social-justice-warrior slant. If you're looking to get into the Discworld there's worse ways than accompanying a bunch of other newbies who you can discuss plot twists and speculation without getting spoiled. I myself enjoy seeing newcomers reaction to Pratchett's writing - it brings back a lot of the magic I felt when I first read his stuff.
