I'd like to recommend the entire oeuvre of Neil Stephenson. (I'll probably create a separate thread for Anathem.)

The novels tend to feature smart, competent protagonists who have to overcome complex new problems.

Apart from that, each novel teaches you something new. Snow Crash teaches you about Sumerian society and linguistics, Quicksilver teaches you about the dawn of science and how money became a thing, Anathem teaches you about philosophy of science and the Many World Interpretation.
