And just two hours later, I got a nice surprise in a new update of [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][Saga Of Soul]]. It's a short one, but a promising sign after a relatively long hiatus.

I discovered it when EY plugged it a while back, but it's still up there in the quality of Science meeting magic. I really like how there's a lot of discussion about how the Crazypowerful magic system (Matter generation of both complex and simple structures, portals, and flight, all at the speed of thought) can disrupt a culture's scientific advancement, and also how said scientific knowledge is often the only real edge against similarly equipped enemies.
