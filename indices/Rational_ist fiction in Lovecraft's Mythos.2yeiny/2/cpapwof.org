I'm actually planning out a project (But it will be a few years now before I'm done training up my visual and story telling skills for it) based on the premise of a world of 'pragmatic cosmic horror'.

Which fits rather closely to this idea.

The broad jist is that knowledge/awareness/contemplation on the nature of the universe holds extremely high probability of turning anyone and anything into a horrific monstrosity that generally fits well into any number of horror movie/ghost/monster/ghost tropes.

A very small percentage of those that go through this process survive with something similar to their own goals, perspectives and memories intact.

Civilization pragmatically builds itself around preventing people from ending up becoming these monsters as carefully as possible.
