Disclaimer: I know nothing about Warhammer, and I thought that video was pretty dumb.

I think the space marines from James A. Corey's /Expanse/ series are an example of this done right. Highly-trained soldiers kitted out in extremely powerful armor & guns. That said, the setting is way different, and it is explicitly shown that a few smart & lucky people can take a marine in power armor by using its momentum against it, scrapping low-caliber ammunition and just tossing bulky shit at them, etc.

Expanse is ~hard sci-fi, so totally different setting, but an example of the trope executed well. Also Bobby is a badass mothafucka.
