None of this should be taken to support the idea that anyone in 40k is making a good decision, has ever made a good decision, or is capable of making good decisions. I'm just covering places where some of these decisions could be rational under the right circumstances.

  There are trillions upon trillions of guardsman, but only a million space marines in the entire galaxy. The numbers are so skewed that even if a single marine was literally worth a million guardsman, the guard would still be able to massively out number them. That would be fine if you were getting some kind of unbridgeable jump in quality - but you're really not.
#+end_quote

That presumes the costs are proportional to their numbers. Say a space marine is 100x as effective as a guardsman and costs only 10x as much; then making as many space marines as possible (or useful) makes sense. But if there are throughput limits that say you can only produce 1000 space marines a year no matter how much you spend, the total number of them remains quite low.

You can also support absurd casualty rates in training if the cost of human life is low enough. In this model most of the cost of guardsmen would be their equipment; the person is an afterthought (an economy that is horrible, but not inconceivable). They may also have higher support costs; if we have to ship rations between planets then anything that gives you fewer people starts making a lot more sense.

  why even bother with gene seed at all? Why not just extract top quality brains, stick them in a robot body, and that can be your super soldier?
#+end_quote

Assume that there's a maximum prosthetic replacement rate of X% per year before the body starts rejecting the robot parts. The gene seed increases X.

  Do you know who pilots space marine tanks? Space marines.

Somehow this is funnier to me than all the other ways 40k is irrational.

You could hammer this into something resembling sense if one of the benefits of a space marine is that they eat less than a regular human, and the primary cost of your space military is shipping rations between planets. It still requires that the only way to get the "eats less" benefit is to do the entire space marine process (or doing just this costs as much), which is weird, but 40k does come with a half-justification for nobody ever being able to innovate things like this, so if that's what the technology you have looks like that's what you get.

  super soldiers, trained from birth to be a master of war, employ tactics about as sophisticated as I did when I was six playing forts in the woods

Everything ending up being infantry battles is the fundamental stupidness of 40k. Tyranids engage enemies in hand to hand combat despite having the capability for orbital bombardment and a motivation that doesn't care about structures except in that they might be full of meat. I have no fix for this, which is a problem since justifying infantry battles is the goal.
