One problem I frequently see with fictional uses of infantry is that authors don't seem to understand when/why to use them. The main point of infantry is to exercise restraint, analyze a situation, and use minimal force to achieve your objectives. This is only applicable in a fight where there's something you're trying to protect, like civilians, or infrastructure, or hostages, or people's homes. If none of that matters, then you'll have a much easier time just using artillery, air strikes, carpet bombing, bunker busters, drone strikes, cruise missiles, or even nukes.

So, if you're going to have a space marine to begin with, their role should be to capture enemy equipment or personnel, most likely for reverse-engineering or interrogating people for intel. To achieve that, they should be trying to take the enemy by surprise, before they can destroy their own equipment, activate any kind of self-destruct, and/or commit suicide.

From these three videos, it looks like the marines land on a rebel ship. If you're going to kill everyone but spare the ship, why not just use a neutron bomb? Everyone on board dies of acute radiation sickness, but the ship itself remains intact and salvageable for intel. Alternatively, if you don't need the ship or crew, blow it up with missiles. You should only be sending marines in if you're trying to take prisoners.
