Of course, both of those features - cheap and stealthy - have gone out the window by the time we're talking about anything to do with space. At best, you could maybe achieve 'inconspicuous' and 'unexpected', as infantry could be loaded onto a known civilian ship, registered with fake IDs, and the ship could conceivably carry them to a station where they could launch a surprise attack after docking.

Beyond that, the only thing even remotely resembling cheap or stealthy in space combat would be micro-drones under a centimeter in radius, possibly harboring biological weapons, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo][grey goo]], or being used as tiny high-velocity guided kinetic-kill weapons to knock out satellites and space stations.

But anyway, agreed, space marines are generally a bad idea and poorly implemented. They could maybe have some niche uses in very rare circumstances, but using them as a regular first-line attack is stupid.
