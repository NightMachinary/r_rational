There's a fun fan theory that the reason why there's so much war in Warhammer 40k is because the Orks think there should be so much war. The Ork's psychic field thing may very well be applying to everything and warping the Empire to create inefficient super-soldiers because Orks think inefficient super-soldiers are cool.
