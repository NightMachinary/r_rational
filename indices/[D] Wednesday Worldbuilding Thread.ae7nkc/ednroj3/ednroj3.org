I'm working on a setting where humanity is limited to "hard" science solutions to problems. Despite this, they've colonized large swathes of the solar system and have permanent outposts around every planet, including pluto and other far out keiper objects.

Assuming a large amount of energy to play with (ie fusion, nuclear, and solar), as well as mature technology fo space travel (launch stations, energy lasers, etc.) how long would a journey to a far out keiper object take? Something on the order of 30-40 AU?
