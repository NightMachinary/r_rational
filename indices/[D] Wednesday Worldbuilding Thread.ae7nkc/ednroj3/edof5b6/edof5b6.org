There are a couple of tables, that list a round trip to various locations in the solar system. Pluto is listed, and while not a far out kuiper belt object, illustrates that far out kuiper belt objects are probably gonna need some damn good spacecraft. Launch lasers would help, but still make that painful to slow down unless the kuiper belt object has a system set up as well.
