Yes to both, though cryonics would be more coma than cryonic, and there's less need of that considering they live large portions of their life in vr and VRMMORPGS have perfected asynchronous/lightspeed delay games (things like a realtime strategy/subterfuge based solar system simulation, where your avatar matches your IRL location).

Nuclear fusion energy engines are available.
