Do you have an acceleration limit? Humans shouldn't be exposed to much more than 1G for an extended period of time. If your people are modified, or live as simulations on computer chips, you can raise that. But electronics have a G limit too.

There are several constraints on your answer, but one of them is however fast you can get there by accelerating half way and reverse accelerating the other.
