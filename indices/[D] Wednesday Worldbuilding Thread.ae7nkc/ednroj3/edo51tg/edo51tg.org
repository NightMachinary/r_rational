Trying to work out the math at the moment. About how far in the future is this? Do you have nuclear fusion engines? What about cryonics?

*Edit 1:* You're looking at a ∆v of around 16.4 km/s for the lowest-cost annual launches. That's probably going to be very slow, but I'm still working out exactly how slow.

*Edit 2:* Would at least the low-gear [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#id--Pulse--Inertial_Confinement--Magneto_Inertial_Fusion][magneto intertial fusion]] engine be appropriate for your setting?

*Edit 3:* Food should add about 0.83 kg per person per day, including packaging. [[[https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html][Ref]]]

*Edit 4:* Atomic Rockets suggests that life support (including air and water recycling, food, temperature control, power, etc.) should be about 4,606.2 kg per person, plus 2.303 kg per person per day. It estimates a bit more food than I'd expect, but it's reasonable to have some extra mass allocated there since many of the recycling systems are unlikely to be able to provide 100% yield.

*Edit 5:* Assuming people weigh about 80 kg and their equipment and personal belongings add another 120 kg, then the payload is about 4,800 kg per person plus 2.3 kg per person per day.

*Edit 6:* The previously-mentioned magneto inertial fusion rocket was based around a payload mass of 61 MT, and a ∆v of around 37 km/s. Using the habitat figures above, that would correspond to a ship carrying no more than 12,708 people, with the actual number of passengers going down the longer the trip takes, since we'd have to dedicate more of the payload mass to food storage. It would be 10,816 passengers if the trip takes a year, 9,415 if it takes two years, etc.
