Gotta be honest here, I was expecting a totally different kind of story with that title, and then got totally human characters. Next thing I thought was these were gonna be metaphorical monsters. Hooo boy did you subvert my expectations, and also somehow confirm them? I don't even know what's going on and I love it. Can't wait for thursday!
