Paizo? Please.

Pathfinder was originally written to be reverse-compatible with the D20 3rd Edition. Try penciling in one of *those* Feats or skills and see if it gives you a result. There's so much broken stuff there, especially in the Forgotten Realms books, that you hardly need to invent your own stuff. Or, if you want Dragon stuff, the /Draconomicon/ and /Races of the Dragon/ already have quite a few interesting things in there.

I recommend dropping a single point into /Autohypnosis/ (From the Psionics Handbook) just to test it. Losing 1 of 72 skill points isn't so bad, and if it gives you the ability to memorize things with perfect clarity and recall, it will be more than useful if it works. Maybe later they can try third-party stuff too...
