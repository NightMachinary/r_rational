Hey everyone! I'm super excited to be sharing this with you. Welcome to the beginning of an ongoing serial fic I've been cooking up for a while! I'll be putting out new chapters every Tuesday & Thursday. I've got plenty of backlog to run through and 2 chapters per week seems to be a pretty sustainable pace, so don't worry about running dry any time soon- we're going to be /going/ some places, you and I.

Have fun and thank you so much for reading!
