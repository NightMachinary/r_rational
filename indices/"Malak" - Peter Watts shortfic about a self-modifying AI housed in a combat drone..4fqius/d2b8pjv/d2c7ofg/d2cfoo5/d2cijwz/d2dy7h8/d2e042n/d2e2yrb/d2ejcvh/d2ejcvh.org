No Just No. The only reason that architecture led to a moralish result was because The Author Said So. That quality of programming would not pinpoint that result in real life, and would instead slaughter children on the full moon, so you cannot say that morality was built into the stated architecture or emerged from it. Peter Watts can make it happen in the story; he can't make it a natural or logical consequence.
