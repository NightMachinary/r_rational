I have to ask. Why is it more logical that the ethical architecture results in the slaughter of children on the full moon than the actual end of the story?

Obviously, a lot of the programming is very implicit. Most importantly, one major unanswered question is how exactly the program assigns colors to targets. This seems like a major challenge, and would probably be something that could cause a slaughter of children on a full moon (or any of billions upon billions of unintended consequences) by marking them as reds for some reason. I would say however that the in-story assumption is that that part of the programming has been done. Aside from that, some ethical architecture was 'grudgingly put in'; this is the part that results in the unintended behavior (and has possibly not been tested carefully, since the army probably didn't care about that too much).

[[/s][Spoiler]]

"Children on the full moon" do not violate the above rules; they don't 'attack', 'cause attack' or 'override abort'. Mission control does.

I can definitely see other outcomes than the one in the story, but nothing like the 'children on a full moon' scenario. For example, Azrael could self-destruct, since in principle, Azrael attacked six or more blues. This at least seems to require fewer logical steps than mixing up the three definitions above.

So why the slaughter of children? Do you have some set of ethical rules in mind that would cause the slaughter of children in fewer steps than those outlined in the story?
