It's usually very hard to properly predict how software will function without a lot of testing and debugging, even for very simple tasks. For something like a complex morality function, it's seems very, very unlikely to me that it would work in unexpected ways that happen to line up with the designers desires. In the real world, for every unplanned accident that leads to a surprisingly good result, there are 99 accidents that just lead to failure.

The fact that the creators of a complex function did not rigorously plan for and expect a certain happy outcome is itself evidence that the happy outcome should not be expected.
