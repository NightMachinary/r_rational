I can't tell whether you're trying to defend the story on a literary level or claim that this is the sort of thing that would happen with reasonable probability in real life. On a literary level, Peter Watts did an excellent job of rationalizing something that wouldn't happen. On a real life level, your strength as a rationalist is to be more confused by rationalizations of things that wouldn't happen in real life than things that would, so you need to see past literary devices and say 'but nonetheless, in real life...' as part of that skill.
