My original contention was that, arguably, the drone was carrying out the intention of it's designers - who did not anticipate it's operators crimes.

My second point was that the drone /did not/ spontaneously derive moral principles - they were explicitly built in (cf 'ethical architecture').

Yes, this would be staggeringly unlikely to happen in real life. I'm not claiming otherwise - simply that the events depicted don't involve unintended target selection (merely unanticipated), nor moral behaviour emerging from any source but deliberate input.
