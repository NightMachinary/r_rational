This is only broken in the sense that any literal genie is broken though; it carried out it's task of eliminating people who caused civilian deaths. That's not a bug - just a poorly written specification/optimisation goal. And /very poor judgement/ from those who deployed it...

In short: the program is a tool, not an agent, and it's behaviour is merely unexpected (not unforeseeable or unpreventable). No moral reasoning takes place in the machine. All it does is resolve the conflict between human-supplied 'ethical architecture' and the action of humans.
