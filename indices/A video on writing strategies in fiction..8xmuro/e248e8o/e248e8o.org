LOTS of spoilers, yes.

What goes unsaid here is that audience satisfaction can be amped up when any given suspension of suspense cheat operates like a fair-play whodunit: plenty of clues and foreshadowing so the reader realizes after the fact that they could have seen it all coming. The resolution is just a telegraphed twist.

Also: Stakes (and suspense with them) aren't so much about who wins or who loses, as what those wins and losses /cost/. What are the characters and their factions willing to give up? What are they blinded by? What factors do they over or underestimate?

A plan can be fully described in advance... but with costs that are painfully high. Then, as events advance towards their grim resolution, the reader can still be held in suspense by the characters' reactions to those costs: Will the protagonist really be able to go through with this? Will the antagonist show mercy and yield? Even as everything goes exactly as described, it's riveting to watch the crucible cast these people anew.

That's a rare one, though. Great video.
