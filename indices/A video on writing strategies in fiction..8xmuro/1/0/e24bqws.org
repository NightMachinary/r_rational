Well, can you give me an example for strategy you described? I'm just not seeing any advantage from that particular ploy over the regular deception tricks. Afterall, if we're told in advance what's going to happen, and then everything goes according to what we were told would happen, where is the suspense on not knowing what's going to happen?

If the character A says character B has to die for plan to work, and character B dies and the plan works, isn't it essentially giving spoilers and removing the surprise and suddenness from the death and loss?
