For those who don't want to watch the video, a TL;DW:

1. "I Have A Plan"\\
   a) After words to that effect, cut away. Show the plan in action, then explain it afterwards.\\
   b) Benefits: quick transition to action.\\
   c) Example used: 'Bomb defusal' team exercise in My Hero Academia.

2. "Step-by-Step"\\
   a) Narrate the plan as it unfolds, either in-character or with voiceover.\\
   b) Benefits: Provides opportunities for the 'strategist' to demonstrate ability by explaining how they foresaw each variable beforehand.\\
   c) Example used: Capture of Iserlohn in the remake of Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

3. "Hide the Goal"\\
   a) Explain the elements of the plan but not how it comes together, or what the final goal is.\\
   b) Benefits: Promotes 'shock' value when the twist is revealed - that the character was aiming for something unexpected all along, etc.\\
   c) Example used: Purchasing the Guild Building in Log Horizon. Shown that 'the plan' needs cash and actors, but not how they'll be used until the conclusion

4. "Improvise"\\
   a) Explain the plan and the goal up front. Then something goes wrong, and the strategist scrambles to adapt\\
   b) Benefits: Shows ability of the planner to think on their feet\\
   c) Example used: Final battle of Alderamin On The Sky, where a guerrilla strategy is overturned through a brute force attack
