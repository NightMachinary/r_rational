This entire video kinda skips over how to actually formulate a plan though.

Like 90% of the problem of strategy by fiction writers, is that writers are not genius strategists. Legend of the Galactic Heroes suffers from this, where the "genius" strategists come across as merely competent, surrounded by bumbling idiots.

There's tricks to circumvent this of course, Code Geass first combat scene despite never actually describing the plan in detail, was far more effective as establishing Lelouch as a above average military mind.
