Yeah the scene is actually phenomenally designed. The brutality of the cheese pieces montage just before Ron makes his decision gives us insight into the sacrifice he's making. There's no loss of tension even watching it now so many years on from the menacing turn of the Queen and it approaching him. There's never a moment where we don't know what's coming but we're invested nonetheless. The reality and brutality of his sacrifice only becomes visceral when we see it, words can't compare to actions for humans.

My only disappointment is that they didn't show the board pieces in this scene, I believe it was cut for some reason. It is actually a real chess puzzle. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7RIDfDG8wY]])
