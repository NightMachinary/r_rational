Yeah, I was hoping for some tips on writing it so was a bit disappointed.

Like for writing mysteries, I've heard "take the evidence and scatter it". That's a rather simplistic one, but it's still /something/. Didn't really get any better idea on how to write a plan than "here are 4 common tropes". Everyone already knows the /unspoken plan guarantee/ which covers 2 of these.
