Yep. The only moment where I think it's significant is in the very first chapter, where a couple scenes that would otherwise be very close to canon are summarized stream-of-consciousness rather than played out. Even so, you wouldn't miss a single detail if you came to it fresh; you just might think it's a weird choice of emphasis.
