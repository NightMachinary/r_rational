[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] is a crossover between Sailor Moon and Dungeon Keeper, it's ongoing (with over 800K words already), and I really like it. The premise is that Ami aka Sailor Mercury was tricked into becoming a Dungeon Keeper. Everyone expects Keepers to be Always Chaotic Evil, so now she has to use a combination of Sailor and Keeper powers, muggle tech, quick thinking and general munchkinery to defeat the real Big Bads of this universe while trying to prove that she's not like other Keepers.

Worldbuilding is the best part, and it's many times better than the original nonexistent Dungeon Keeper universe. The author managed to create a believable adventure friendly world where characters are mostly rational and properly paranoid, thanks to Keepers often being very patient and smart manipulative bastards.

Sorry for all the tropes, and yes, there's a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][TvTropes page]].

Edit: I'm really bad at writing and I'm already tired, but there are two more stories I want to recommend. They're less rational, but rational enough to avoid anything resembling an idiot ball, and their worldbuilding is good too.

[[http://forums.erfworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13399][The Last Turn]] is an Erfworld story about a warlord who suddenly becomes the Chief Warlord after spending his whole life reading books. Then he has to exploit the rules to survive against an unbeatable enemy.

[[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][The Wandering Inn]] is a web serial by the same author about an RPG-ish fantasy world where everyone has levels. Random people from our world get stranded there, including the protagonist, who becomes an innkeeper.

(All three works require only superficial knowledge about their worlds. I neither watched Sailor Moon nor played Dungeon Keeper, but I'm sure I didn't miss anything important.)
