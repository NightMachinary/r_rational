  Will I miss out on much/anything if I just stick to Reader Mode?
#+end_quote

You will miss a lot of the audience discussion / reactions, but Reader Mode keeps all the 'threadmarked' posts, so that includes both the story and all the silly little fan-written scenes. I recommend it as the best enjoyment-per-time reading method.

  I've only watched, I think, the first season of Naruto. And that was years ago. Will I be completely confused and lost in this story?
#+end_quote

No, that should give you more than enough of a grounding in the premises. And, as [[/u/BlueSigil][u/BlueSigil]] said, much of the world is different, so not being too invested in canon is actually helpful for grasping the setting.
