Of the ones that /don't/ post updates here, other people have also recommended:

The Gods are Bastards Superpowered / Blades & Barriers

The SP/B&B guy also wrote one called "Corpies", in the same universe, featuring /some/ of the same characters, that's since finished and been replaced by B&B.

"The Last Angel: Ascension" updates, although infrequently, and is the sequel to "The Last Angel" on SpaceBattles.

PS - I just checked for updates to Glimwarden, and there haven't been. Was there a comment by the author at some point?
