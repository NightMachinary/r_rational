Ctrl+F "anim"--no results

/How has no-one said [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/][Animorphs: The Reckoning]] yet? It is so good./

Take one slightly goofy Animorphs canon, replete with silly tropes where aliens invade so incompetently that half a dozen teenagers are able to foil their nefarious schemes (and only really seem to start /trying/ in sync with the protagonists' ascending competence). Then raise the bar for competence and intelligence /significantly/ on all sides, and play it straight from there.

Competent leadership on the part of the aliens makes it feel like every encounter could be a total party wipe. Every success feels hard-fought, and the setbacks are earned through their mistakes (and born of their genuine flaws rather than idiot-ball). Characters have minds and motives and internal lives and all feel very distinct from each other, including aliens feeling /alien/.

Hell, there is explicit reasoning included from a first-person perspective, about the limits of information known on each side and how that affects strategy. There are even more examples I want to give of good explicit reasoning but they would be spoilers.

Definitely, definitely, worth the read.
