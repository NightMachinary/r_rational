I binged through.. a very large amount of WTR, and I had to give up because it just got.. /irritating/ for me to read(and I have an almost pathological need to finish stories I start).

I want to say the character was a Mary Sue, but that's a term that's thrown around so much it's become almost meaningless.

As I remember it, the main character was just the best at EVERYTHING. Every mission was something he himself solved (which usually meant relegating the rest of the ensemble somewhere to the side). He trumped Robin in his specialty, Superboy in his, and so on and so forth. Again and again he was shown to be superior to characters like Batman in various ways, and places where he came off as inferior were few and far between, and stuck next to him doing something awesome.

Every time he interacted with Green Lanterns - who had a practically identical powerset and years or decades more training and experience - the focus was on how good the self-insert was. When he had lessons from them he was teaching them as much as they were teaching them. And what he was teaching wasn't even all that clever (e.g. don't signal your moves if you don't have to) - it was stuff the Green Lanterns should already have known.

There's a lot of that - things being interpreted in whatever way is most favourable to the main character. Things follow comic book logic when comic book logic makes the main character look awesome, and it's laughed at when it makes him look clever. Elements added to Young Justice generally either make the MC look awesome, or give him the opportunity to look awesome. Characters being buffed or nerfed to suit (or not being buffed when everything else was).

To me it felt like WTR had the stereotypical SI problems: the main character was the next best thing to all powerful,and the main character had the same opinions as the author, with the world as written by the author then conforming to those opinions. As a general rule the main character didn't seem to /really/ be challenged ideologically, and it could veer close to being almost .. preachy, if you get what I'm saying. (And the author's subjective views being treated more or less as objective facts is something that probably isn't /hugely/ rational)

/Every/ character we see likes or respects him, and often confides in him above and beyond what they confide in others. The way he actually acts is... weird and quirky to the extreme, let's just say, but he's not treated like an insane person would be treated. Instead the absurdities are just something that makes him more cool and awesome.

Like other SI things, there's a bunch of random moments where the main character will stop and spend a few paragraphs explaining, say, why he hates cereal, which doesn't add anything to the story or deepen the character in any meaningful sense and presumably is only there to make the main character more like the author. Or there's some form of author tract about why the author likes or dislike something, which is then dragged into absurdity (and yet the absurdities never meaningfully inconvenienced the character).

I should say that there were good bits too, don't get me wrong. I suspect that reading hundreds of thousands of words over the course of days made it easy for me to see the flaws, and maybe the sour taste the story left is colouring my recollections, but on the whole it didn't feel like the main character was being /challenged/ in any meaningful, personal sense. Things happened, of course, and there were gigantic stakes going on in the plotlines but... I don't know, the conflict felt /hollow/. At least to me.
