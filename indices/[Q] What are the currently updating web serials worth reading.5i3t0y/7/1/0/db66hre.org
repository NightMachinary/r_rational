It was funny the first couple times, certainly, but that section as a whole started grating. It felt like there were a lot of references in a very short period of time, in a section where the longer they spent in there, the less interested I became.

It's entirely possible that I'm a little sensitive about suspension of disbelief, and usually I enjoy the references. That section in particular though annoyed me.
