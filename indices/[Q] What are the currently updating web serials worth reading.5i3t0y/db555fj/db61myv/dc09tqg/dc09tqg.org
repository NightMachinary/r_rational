I dunno about reasonably. The entire plot of Worm could have been derailed by the white hats being a bit more reasonable or kind. I read a theory on SB that the Simurgh orchestrated Taylor's escalation (downfall/ascension) into ... things, starting immediately after her trigger.

I'm trying not to spoil anything. I really need to look up how to do spoiler tags.
