Out of the ones already suggested, there's a lot I consider good - but I can unreservedly second the recommendation of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother Of Learning]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]. Easily some of the best writing I've read, commercial or not.

Now, one I haven't seen listed in this thread is [[https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com][Zombie Knight]]. It updates daily with snippets.

There's not a lot of specifics I can say without spoiling it. It's basically a superhero story, but it's not really presented in line with the usual superhero cliches.

It has a lot of good action, a bit of political intrigue, a bunch of interesting munchkinry, and some truly heartwarming moments. After reading the entirety of it in one sitting, I was left eagerly wanting more.

It starts out a bit roughly but hits its pace soon - try to give it at least ten chapters if you try it (which might be asking a lot, I know).
