[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a Young Justice SI that has updated every single day since August 14, 2013. At 49 pages of thread posts in the story only thread, currently 1220 total posts.

The SI appears somewhere near the moon with an orange power ring on his finger. He describes himself as a "combination futurist, combatant and explorier" at one point in an attempt to judge his ring's translation capabilities. He seems to mostly be in the business of industrializing super human abilities and tries very hard to convince super villains away from crime, actually succeeding in several cases so far.
