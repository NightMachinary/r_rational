Mildly funny story, it used to be on a different forum, and it hasnt really made it every day (Though that is not the authors fault) The forum it used to be on temp banned the author for something stupid involving the new star wars, causing him to miss a day until he moved to the new forum.

Also for anyone whom wants to read it, I would recommend going here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/]] there is a great epub that makes catching up more enjoyable to me.
