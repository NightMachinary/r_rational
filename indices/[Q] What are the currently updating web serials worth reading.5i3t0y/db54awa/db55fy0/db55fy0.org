I keep thinking /With This Ring/ is kinda low-quality and I should be reading something else. Then I'm bored, I've already read Drowtales and Erfworld's updates and I think "what else could I read" and back I am.

The author is /incredibly/ consistent with his update rate; like wildbow-level consistent, except he posts every day.
