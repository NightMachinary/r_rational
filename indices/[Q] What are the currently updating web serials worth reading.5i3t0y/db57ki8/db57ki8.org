I'll throw my hat in the ring for [[/u/callmebrotherg][u/callmebrotherg]]'s Heroes Save the World (found here: [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com]]).

It's currently the early stages right now, about 27 (fairly short) chapters in, and updating quickly, about 2 chapters a week.

The basic premise of HStW is that across the world 100 children born on the same day gain a superpower, and exploration of the realistic ramifications thereof. It is very much a "people with powers" sort of story than a "superheroes" one. The plausible developments, believable character motivations, use of powers, and competent planning all land it squarely in the "rational" category.

The writing in HStW really blows that of other web serials and fanfictions out of the water. Its prose is utilitarian in the best sense of the word, its dialogue is natural, and its pacing is tight. It also abounds with "competence porn" and clever exploitations of superpowers if you're into that kind of thing.

Because of the short and regular nature of the chapters, it's got an enjoyably "popcorny" feel. A nice treat you don't have to waste an afternoon on.

If I could find one flaw in the story, it's that characters' inner monologues are sometimes written in a way that's cumbersome to the flow of a greater passage.

TL;DR: The only web fiction I'd recommend without reservation.
