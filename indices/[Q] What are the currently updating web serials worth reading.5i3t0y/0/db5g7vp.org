A number have already been mentioned; I especially recommend Mother of Learning, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, Unsong, and A Practical Guide to Evil.

To wit, A Practical Guide to Evil was mentioned but not really expanded upon, so...

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] is set in a fantasy world of Names and follows the story of Catherine Foundling. Names (capital N) are role archetypes that come with divine powers that raise some humans far above the normal rabble and make them the linchpins of a metaphysical conflict between Good and Evil. Raised as a war orphan, Catherine has had to adapt to living life in the occupied country of Callow. The traditionally Good kingdom was taken over almost completely by the neighboring Evil empire of Praes twenty years ago. Early on in the story Catherine encounters one of the leaders of the Praesi Villains, the Black Knight. He makes her an offer: join him as his apprentice, take the Villainous Name of Squire, and use the power and prestige it gives to uplift her country through practicality rather than through what is ordained by the gods.

*Why is it good?* Because the characters are fantastic, the fantasy setting with Names makes things interesting, and the fights (battles, really) are amazing. Catherine's Name gives her powers that normal humans don't have, but she isn't overpowered (especially compared to other Named individuals). Instead she has to claw her way to victory after victory using mostly her wits - and relying on the friendship and loyalty of those she inspires. It also questions what she is willing to sacrifice to save her country... and what "saving" it really means.

There are some really good philosophical conversations about the nature of Good and Evil; and about Names and cultures as well. I was firmly on the side of Evil (well, Catherine's kind of Evil) until a side-story from the Hero's perspective shed some light on the other side. I don't necessarily agree with their somewhat dogmatic views, but they do have a number of valid points that really stuck with me. I highly recommend it!

Another good choice I like, though I don't know if it is entirely rational is [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]]. The setting is a fantasy world facing the end of the Age of Adventurers and the rise of... perhaps it's best to say the Age of Bureaucracy? Set on the frontier of the Tiraan empire stands an odd University on top of a mountain. The Unseen University is run by Arachne Tellwyrn, a legendary elven archmage turned school mistress who has devoted her time and efforts to training the upcoming generation of movers and shakers in the world. The story itself focuses primarily on the newest freshman class, consisting of a dryad, a Drow priestess, two Paladins (the first in 30 years), a pirate princess, an ice-elemental pixie, a half-demon, and a lesbian heir to a car fortune who shares a body with a princess of Hell.

*Why is it good?* The story starts off with common tropes and subverts them (sometimes quickly, sometimes over the course of several volumes). For example, even from the start we know this is a fantasy world with magic and elves and whatnot; but the action scenes are more like a spaghetti western. Adventurers wear leather dusters and have shoot-outs at high noon wielding staffs like six-shooters. And things change from there. We all have mental images of what "Paladin," "dryad," or "pixie" means - but as the characters grow and their histories are explored, we realize that those have very different meanings in the world of TGAB. The secondary cast of characters is, if anything, as fantastic as the primary cast. One of my favorite characters, Bishop Antonio Darling, was originally conceived of as a throw-away character for the first book; but has now become so involved with the plot that I find his interactions even more interesting than those of the original cast.

Two slight words of warning: first, the [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/cast-list/][cast of characters gets BIG]]. Many only make token appearances here and there, but there are really several groups of multiple characters each that vie for attention (including some villains; many of whom you don't ever /like/ but are explained well enough that you /understand/ even if you disagree with them). Second, this is not a grimdark universe. There is a lot of growth, both of the characters and the story, but so far (11 volumes in) it doesn't often involve main characters dying. The characters go through hardships and trials and emotions, but it is very rare that they are tortured or assaulted or killed. It's like... the complete opposite feeling of Worm - you feel like things will work out OK here for your favorite characters, rather than dreading to turn the page and see what the next unfair curveball that will ruin their lives will be. Frankly I don't mind it, but some readers have complained that "nothing permanent happens." That's not entirely accurate, but it has some truth to it.
