I recently read through TGAB and wanted to offer a warning and encouragement. The first 3 books are fairly low quality prose (a lot of repeated phrases, phrases like "just so" and "quite so" are repeated so often I edited them out of my ebook copy). Past that, the writing quality markedly improves, and so does the story. I hope the author goes back and re-edits the earlier books.

A Practical Guide to Evil is also fantastic.
