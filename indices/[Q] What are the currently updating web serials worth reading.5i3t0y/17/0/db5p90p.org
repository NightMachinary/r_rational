I really enjoy SFP. It has an interesting status for me where I find myself disagreeing with many of the author's viewpoints espoused in the comic through the main character but even when I disagree they are presented in such a way that I'm pretty sure I could have a totally reasonable discussion about them with the author (were I ever in a position to do so). Also, I'm really interested in where the overall arc of the plot is going. There are so many cool worldbuilding hints that have been dropped but that don't get addressed very frequently.
