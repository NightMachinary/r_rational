I was so confused when I tried reading this; I didn't really understand what all the discussion about abilities and whatnot meant. I was wondering... where was the actual story??

Then I realized there is a button for "Reader mode" down at the bottom that seems to filter out all the worldbuilding/participation posts and just has the author's story posts. Looks MUCH easier to understand. But before I jump in, two question:

1. Will I miss out on much/anything if I just stick to Reader Mode?

2. I've only watched, I think, the first season of Naruto. And that was years ago. Will I be completely confused and lost in this story?
