It's not strictly a web serial, since it involves a heavy audience participation component, but I and a bunch of other people have hugely enjoyed [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]].

Strictly speaking it's a quest, which means that the thread participants vote on a plan for the main character to (try to) follow. Most participants are from the subreddit, so it's a collection of really smart, creative, and often hysterically funny people.
