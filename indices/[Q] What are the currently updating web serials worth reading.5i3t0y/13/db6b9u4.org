OK, I highly endorse the recommendations for: * Mother of Learning * A Practical Guide to Evil * With This Ring

I agree with the varied comments about Unsong. I do think it's going somewhere but it is a very fragmented story. I am still reading, just.

I also recommend Saruman of the Many Devices. A fairly rational reworking LoTR where Saruman gradually invents gunpowder and more modern weaponry. Great reimagining of the world but VERY slow updates (every three months or so). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1/Saruman-of-many-Devices]]
