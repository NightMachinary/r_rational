Good choice!

For those who are unaware, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper][Dungeon Keeper]] is an old DOS game from the 90s that set the player up as a keeper who has to create and expand a hellish dungeon that slaughter the heroes who attempt to invade and destroy it. A lot of the mechanics of the game are also involved in the story (like slapping imps to motivate them to dig faster).
