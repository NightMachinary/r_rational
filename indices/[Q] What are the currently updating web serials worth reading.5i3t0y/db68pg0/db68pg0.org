Fall of Doc Future is good. First two novels are complete with the third in progress. rational!superheroes starring a female speedster, written by someone who probably frequents [[/r/theydidthemath]], recently dealing with AI and sociopolitical aspects of an AI uplift. Good writing. I'm behind, so I can't say how regular updates are (I prefer to binge).
