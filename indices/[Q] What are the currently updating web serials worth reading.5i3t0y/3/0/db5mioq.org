Ahahaha oh my god, this is great. Thank you. I'm kind of at a loss for words here. I mean...

  The writing in HStW really blows that of other web serials and fanfictions out of the water. [...]

Thank you for your kind words.

  Its prose is utilitarian in the best sense of the word

I'm going to be trying to add more description to the prose because I think that I'm falling short so far as descriptions (especially visual) go. Please let know if this seems to be turning into fluff that detracts from the story, though. I think that I have a lot of room for improvement, but I don't want to accidentally mess up what's already good in my attempt to fix other stuff.

  If I could find one flaw in the story, it's that characters' inner monologues are sometimes written in a way that's cumbersome to the flow of a greater passage.

Would you mind pointing out a couple of concrete examples where this happens? It'll be a lot easier for me to fix if I can see exactly where I'm going wrong.

Thanks again for your feedback.
