Copied from a recommendation sent to a friend:

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is an original web fiction about a wizard in a D&D-esque original world who gets stuck in a time loop, repeating the same month over and over, at about 450K words at the moment, updating every 3 weeks and maintaining pretty consistent high quality. Especially fun parts are that the author is excellent at subtle foreshadowing, they're very good at giving the main character power boosts but in a way that feels earned rather than Mary Sue-ish, and they manage to keep conflicts from getting trivial by being in a time loop while still maintaining a feeling of progress.
