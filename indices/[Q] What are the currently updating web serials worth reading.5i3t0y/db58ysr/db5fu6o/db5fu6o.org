I'd add that this has an amazingly rich world which feels like it's bigger that the story, which makes sense author made the world and then made a story in it. It's truly a great example of proper world building and having a story in a world rather than having the world be changed for the whims of the story without considering how such changes would affect the world at large and make previous conflicts nonsensical (I'm looking at you Harry Potter).

It also has one of the best designed magic system I've seen and has the characters make the best use of it they can rather than having of possible abuses that are never used like in so many others stories for the sake of the narrative. The system was very much done so that there'd be no easy "5 easy steps to godhood" scenarios that anyone could have figured out, whatever power the MC is well deserved and earned through hard work.
