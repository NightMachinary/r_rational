Things I'm currently reading:

Void Domain: [[https://towercurator.wordpress.com]]\\
Fantasy story including demons and magic set in modern-ish times.

Curveball: [[https://www.eviscerati.org/fiction/curveball]]\\
Superhero based story with quite a few characters.

Daybreak: [[https://krytykal.org/daybreak/]]\\
Historical military story with magic, reincarnation part kinda becomes irrelevant to the story.

There's more I'm reading but those are the ones I'd recommend as the rest have been mentioned or are posted on the subreddit, like MoL, Practical guide to Evil and A hero's war.
