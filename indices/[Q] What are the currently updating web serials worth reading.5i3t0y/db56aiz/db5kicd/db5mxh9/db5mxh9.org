  Black Knight, Empress, Captain, Ranger, Scribe, and Assassin make up the six Calamities in service to the Empire.

Warlock would like to have a word with you! ;-)

And technically I think the Calamities were only Black, Captain, Warlock, Ranger, and Assassin. Scribe is always with Black, but isn't actually a Calamity herself; Dread Empress has the Calamities working for her but isn't one herself.

Though Ranger, unless I miss my guess, is no longer a Calamity as she works for Refuge now.
