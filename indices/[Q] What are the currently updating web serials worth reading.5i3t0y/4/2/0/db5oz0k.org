I had the same reaction initially, but a couple weeks ago I picked it up again. The story gets much better after arc 3 or 4, and keeps the very high class until 12-13 - I couldn't put it away. However, for me the second part of arc 14 has been a real slog... [[#s][Heavy Spoiler 13+]]

So if you don't like it by arc 5 I guess do drop it for good, but def. give it another try.
