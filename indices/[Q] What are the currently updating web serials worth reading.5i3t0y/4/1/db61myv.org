Honestly, I never really liked Pact. It started out as a great idea - haunted house, then spirits, pacts, territory and etc.-, but didn't really delve into the complex interpersonal politics that usually make up town-based fiction. I'd been hoping there would be even more great dialogue and introspection than in Worm. Instead, it was just a mindfuck.

Twig so far is wonderful, and basically feels like a darker, 007 version of the Leviathan/Behemoth series, but with even more cultural and bodyhorror aspects. It's definitely the best paced of wildbow's works thus far.

If you haven't read Worm, though, do. It's super long but the character's motives feel genuine, and they act reasonably based on those motives. You will never have a Joker character except for [spoiler].
