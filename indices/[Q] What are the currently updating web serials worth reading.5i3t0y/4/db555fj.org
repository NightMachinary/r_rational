/[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/about/][Twig]]/ is not finished yet, but it's already the greatest work ever wildbow has produced, orders of magnitude above /Worm/ and /Pact/. (well, they're great too, so read them if you haven't)

The setting is a bio-punk world where the British Empire went through a biological Industrial Revolution, turned evil and went off to take over (most of) the world. The main characters are a team of high-grade bio-engineered spies/assassins/saboteurs kids who work for the Academy that created them, and by extension the government. The protagonist in particular was injected with a serum that would probably make a lot more sense to people with a background in neurology; it basically makes him more flexible, and able to rewrite his own mental patterns and decide to be extremely skilled in a few specific domains.

The protagonists are all extremely clever and self-aware, the technology presented makes a lot of sense as something that could have been developed after years of progress in bio-engineering (this has to be the only story to ever have first-law-of-thermodynamics-compliant monsters), the social, cultural and logistical aspects are both well explained and kept in the background where they don't slow the story down.

Also, the latter half of the story features a /lot/ of very well developed secondary characters / innocent bystanders who just appear for a few chapters, say a few lines, and make you feel like they're unique people with their own story, wants and needs. The Fishmonger is my favourite example: he only appears for two or three chapters and in any other story would be a completely generic mob boss, but he's actually a very compelling (if despicable) character with a memorable personality.

Finally, /Twig/ has none of the pacing problems /Worm/ and /Pact/ had. Characters are introduced and removed regularly (instead of all at the beginning like in Worm), the length of each arc is appropriate, the time-skips are well-placed, and the whole story feels like it follows a mostly structured plan, that wildbow has /thought through/.

So if you like anything about wildbow's stories, or about rational fic in general, and haven't read Twig yet, I really recommend it. Like, seriously. It's the best.
