#+begin_quote
  Finally, Twig has none of the pacing problems Worm and Pact had
#+end_quote

I feel like this is very YMMV. The first two or three arcs of Twig is pretty meh, pacing wise; for me there's just not enough context to actually care about any of the action, it feels empty. Worm felt much more straightforward in that regard, probably because superheroes is such a familiar setting. (I never got into Pact at all)

#+begin_quote
  Characters are introduced and removed regularly (instead of all at the beginning like in Worm)
#+end_quote

This is actually something I rather dislike about Twig; it builds you up to care about some characters, and then basically removes them from the story and introduces new ones. I'm slow to grow attached to characters, and the bait and switch is painful.
