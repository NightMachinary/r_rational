I'm really enjoying Savage Divinity. It starts out as a SI in a world the person doesn't know. It starts a little slow but the writing quality greatly increases. It updates pretty regularly and there are 150 chapters out. It's the only other web serial besides MOL that I get excited when a new chapter comes out.
