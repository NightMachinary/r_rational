My overall enjoyment of fiction is heavily influenced by its quality of prose and dialogue, so I probably conflate all of it. Sorry I wasn't clear.

I'll have to go back and reread MoL, I don't remember the dialogue being jarring, except perhaps early on where I assumed it was done on purpose to show you that Zorian is kind of an asshole.
