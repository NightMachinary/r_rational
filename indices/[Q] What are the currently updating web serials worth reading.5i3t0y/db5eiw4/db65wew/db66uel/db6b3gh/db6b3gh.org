Ah, I believe my confusion then is in differing meanings of 'writing'. I was referring more towards prose and dialogue than overall enjoyment.

Mother of Learning for example, as much as I enjoy it and rate it highly, is written at a sentence level rather basically and the dialogue/character interaction can be rather jarring at times - something that I feel can be a mild issue in a lot of rational fics but was refreshingly absent from The Gods Are Bastards.
