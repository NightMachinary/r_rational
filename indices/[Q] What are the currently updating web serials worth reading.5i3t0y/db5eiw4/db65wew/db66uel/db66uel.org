I did admittedly undersell it a little in my first paragraph even if I did call it solid later on. It's good writing, but not particularly extraordinary, especially when compared with the rest of the writing in this thread. I'm devouring Mother of Learning with every new chapter, Twig is always interesting, etc.

It's partially that it has some glaring problems to me, even if I enjoy the majority of it.
