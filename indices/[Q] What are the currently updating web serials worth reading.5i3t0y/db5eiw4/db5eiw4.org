I'm almost surprised no one has mentioned [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com][The Gods Are Bastards]] yet. It's not the best writing in the world, but it's extremely consistent and long. Very long. Like, it took me over a month to catch up long.

Set in the fantasy world of Tiraas, it follows a group of students at the Unseen University. Well, mostly follows them. A bunch of very different viewpoints combined with solid writing gives you a good view of what's going on all over the kingdom.

My main complaint is really with the blatant feminism. I actually agree with most of it, but it occasionally comes across as straw manning. That and the 'cheeky' references to real life things tend to pull me out of the story.
