  [[http://unsongbook.com/]] Weird one. I only mention it as it keeps appearing here. I like it, it feels like douglas adam's writing. the only downside is most of the time it doesnt feel like a coherent story, it is more of snapshots oh a particular world. Regardless of whether or not he is going somewhere with it, it is funny and weird and has puns.

This is more or less why I didn't go for more than a few chapters, as well as required knowledge in Judaism and programming to get stuff, and painful allegories to the open-source movement on a par with the likes of Doctorow. It feels like it relies on "tee-hee I'm so weird!" to get by in place of character development or plot.

And for something positive, I'd add [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] to the list. It's set in a land where the Evil Empire has established itself as a dominant power with Legions of Terror to put down rebellions, following a young villain apprenticed to the Black Knight in the vein of Skitter, as she becomes more and more ruthless in achieving her goals. Heroes and villains have Names, powerful cultural archetypes - Black Knight, Warlock, Captain, Ranger, Scribe, and Assassin make up the six Calamities in service to the Empire. Each have three Roles to call upon - Seek, Struggle, Shadow, for example.
