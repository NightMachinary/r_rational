these are my opinions, blah blah blah...

[[http://unsongbook.com/]] Weird one. I only mention it as it keeps appearing here. I like it, it feels like douglas adam's writing. the only downside is most of the time it doesnt feel like a coherent story, it is more of snapshots oh a particular world. Regardless of whether or not he is going somewhere with it, it is funny and weird and has puns.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species]] Disclaimer, im a huge pokemon fan. Updates once monthly, each update is fairly long. This one is less funny, more serious. It stays on topic very well, is well thought out and is on an interesting subject. The downsides of this one is that it feels like it isnt about the standard pokemon story, and is more focused on deconstructing and analyzing the world. I wouldnt go in expecting a huge adventure and a hero saving the world.

[[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/]] Possibly not super rational. Monsters are real, and you were chosen to be a great monster fighter, so we are taking you to a magical school where you learn to fight them and do magic. Great story. The upsides are that it is engaging, and is much more of a "standard hero story" but routinely and repeatedly tempered by reality. The physics are interesting, and generally the world doesnt have you poking around the edges to see how they work. The conflicts are all believeable, and the motivations feel fairly real. In addition to that, it plays with tropes quite well. they get used, lampshaded, deconstructed, ignored, etc. regularly enough to keep you guessing. My biggest issue, is that every aspect of the story is related to every other aspect, to the point it hurts my suspension.

[[http://www.fictiongrill.com/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis/]] This is closer to a trainwreck than anything else. The main character is an asshole. He is racist, and the race he hates is humans. Just kidding, he hates non humans too. the story is weird, with standard themes and an interesting build up. I cant point to any part of the story I really like, but for some reason I keep on reading it unable to tear my eyes away. updates almost daily (I believe the goal is every work day) and just finished book 5 so it is taking a hiatus. I will be back to reading it, and not knowing exactly what keeps me there.

[[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/spy1/p]] super powereds is the best of this list. It is a super hero world, with its own set of problems. Incredibly rational. Each person has a power that does 1 thing, and one thing only. Dont get me wrong, the speedster also got endurance and such, but except for a very small selection most peoples powers are 1 idea and some small powers designed to make it work. It is based on some people going to school to be heros. If you have read any of what I posted, you owe it to yourself to read this. Great characters, that learn and grow and change. a world that he has spent some great time in building, designing, and questioning. Super powereds is the main series, updates tuesday and thursdays (technically it updates sometime late monday and wednesday for me). we are somewhere around alfway through the fourth and final book. Corpies, the first side book is done and also availible on the same site. Blades and barriors is the second side book it is newer, and updates wednesdays. You can stat corpies after year 2 of the primary book, and blades and barriers after year 3.
