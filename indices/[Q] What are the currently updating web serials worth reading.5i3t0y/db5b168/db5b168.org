The ones already recommended in this thread that I'll second/third:

- [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]
- [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]]
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]

Non rationalist/rational ones I also enjoy:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dresden-files-sg-1-gods-eye.232344/][God's Eye]], Dresden Files/Stargate crossover that does the best job I've seen so far of capturing Jim Butcher's style of "constantly ramping stakes".
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wearing-roberts-crown-asoiaf-si.382035/][Wearing Robert's Crown]] starts out as a standard ASOIAF self-insert fic with the quirk that it's entirely third-person, but changes dramatically part-way through. Updates were reliable until recently, but I think the author's taking a break for the christmas holidays.
- [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]] actually is very rational. It's a fairly low-key superhero setting and the story mostly uses the superheroes as a metaphor for social justice issues and discussion on personal, moral, and ethical aspects of its world, rather than action set-pieces.
