ok so let's set up expectations for next chapter:>!- Violin talks to Baba and they somehow try to bail out of Piccolo inner circle

- Tien and Chiaotzu swear revenge and maybe joins forces with our heroes, it seems like a good start of their redemption arc
- Bulma gets in contact with HQ and gets the bad news
- Yamcha reports back to HQ
- Flute (Blue) is the biggest unknown here, but the only reasonable explanation is that he is following Yamcha now. Or maybe he will try to use his little force on Piccolo and fail miserably
- Goku is getting retrieved and healed
- - And Piccolo will be... Piccolo
