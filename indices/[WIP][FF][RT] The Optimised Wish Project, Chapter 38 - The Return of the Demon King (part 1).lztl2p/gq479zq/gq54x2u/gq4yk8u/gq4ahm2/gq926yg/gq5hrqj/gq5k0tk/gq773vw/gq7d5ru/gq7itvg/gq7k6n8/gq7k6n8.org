Yup. It's kind of silly how Piccolo asks to be returned to his youth, but not for /eternal/ youth, and then immediately destroys the dragon before he can leave. The destruction means the dragon can't be used against him in any way in the future, which makes sense, but now he's stuck with dying in a few hundred years anyway (Namekians seemingly have very long lifespans after all). But yes, that's the gist of it. Also, in canon it's Pilaf and his gang, not people from the Red Ribbon, who bring him back. They basically just found his container by accident and hoped that by sucking up to him they would get a slice of his conquests. It doesn't end well for them either (though it's overall more cartoonish and they get out of it with their own lives - just having been unceremoniously ditched as soon as they stopped being useful).
