No, he did just what he says. It's barely skirting the rules because while the time acceleration /is/ an effect that was set in the past from the future, the inside of the container was effectively isolated from the rest of the world until it's opened, /after/ the wish is expressed. Which means in fact the dragon did not send information from the future to the past, and did not create any real time paradox (besides the information that he himself gathered about the wish having been granted). About the gods' ban on time travel, I'm taking inspiration from the various things said to this effect in Dragon Ball Super's Goku Black/Zamasu arc.
