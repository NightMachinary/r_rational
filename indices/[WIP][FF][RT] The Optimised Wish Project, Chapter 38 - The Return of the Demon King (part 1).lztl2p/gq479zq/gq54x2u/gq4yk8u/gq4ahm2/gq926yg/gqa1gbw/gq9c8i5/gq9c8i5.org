"Dragon, kill Piccolo" wouldn't work. The dragon canonically can't destroy beings more powerful than him - or most Dragon Ball arcs would be tremendously short. And Piccolo IS more powerful in terms of sheer strength - well, besides being technically half of his creator.

EDIT: Sorry, realised you meant Blue/Flute. That could actually have worked, I guess. In canon the dragon has never been used to kill, though. Perhaps an umbrella "no kill wishes" rule would make a bit more sense.
