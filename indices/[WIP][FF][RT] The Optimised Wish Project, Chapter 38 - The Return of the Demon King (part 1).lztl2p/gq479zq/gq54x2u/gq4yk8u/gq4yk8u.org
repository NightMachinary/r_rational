I suspect that Piccolo's unyielding rage is metaphysically significant. After all, Piccolo is the castoff, "evil" parts of Kami. Anger was probably one of the big things Kami got rid off, which would make it very central to Piccolo's behavior and identity. It's entirely possible that he can't ever stop being angry, especially since Kami would have kept the more positive behaviors and emotions.

If this is true, it would imply interesting things about Kami. Namely, that he might be incapable of experiencing anger in the same way that Piccolo might be perpetually angry. On paper this might sound good, but I can't imagine removing such a foundational emotion would be an entirely positive thing. It might be why he's seemingly okay with sitting up in the Lookout and just watching as the Instruments bring Piccolo back.

This is a shit ton of speculation though, so we'll have to see how it holds up as we learn more about Piccolo and Kami (whenever he shows up).
