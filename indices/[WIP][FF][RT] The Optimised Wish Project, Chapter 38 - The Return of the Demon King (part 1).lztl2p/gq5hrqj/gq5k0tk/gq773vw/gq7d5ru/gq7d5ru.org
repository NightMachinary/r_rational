In canon, Piccolo /does/ age inside the container. When he comes out he's as old as Kami. He only becomes young later, by wishing for it to the dragon. I suppose you could consider it a bit of a stretch that Piano already suspected that (in a way you'd think it more natural that the time imprisoned would /not/ count towards aging...), but fundamentally this was necessary to bring back a young Piccolo at the peak of his power. Otherwise, since they used the Dragon Balls, we'd be stuck with old geezer Piccolo.
