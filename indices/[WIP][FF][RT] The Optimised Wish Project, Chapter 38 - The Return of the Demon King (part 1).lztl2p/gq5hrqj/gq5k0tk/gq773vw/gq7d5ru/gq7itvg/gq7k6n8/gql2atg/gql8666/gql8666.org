  If he didn't also wish for Kami to be young again it wouldn't even extend his lifespan at all, would it?

Yeah, I suppose this might be yet another occurrence of "Toriyama just winging it". During the Piccolo arc itself there seems to be no suggestion that anyone - him included - knows about Kami. It only becomes relevant later when his son comes back for revenge.

  Maybe he was planning on recreating the dragon eventually (if he was able to do that without Kami).

Again, hindsight is 20/20, but we're told later in Z that generally Namekians are either magic types (healers and dragon summoners) or warrior types, but never both. You could make a case that these roles were split in Kami and Piccolo. Also, in GT, the black star Dragon Balls were supposedly created by Kami+Piccolo before their split, and they are kinda screw-y since they blow up the planet one year after the wish is made. But then again, it's GT. The less one thinks about it, the more brain cells one retains.
