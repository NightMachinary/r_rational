If he didn't also wish for Kami to be young again it wouldn't even extend his lifespan at all, would it? Maybe he was planning on recreating the dragon eventually (if he was able to do that without Kami).

Not that that makes it make a ton more sense, it would still have been better to simply wish for immortality, but all the wishes in Dragonball are very unoptimized. They should start a project or something to improve on that.
