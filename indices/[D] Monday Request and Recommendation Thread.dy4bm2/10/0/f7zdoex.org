  I would like anti-Nazi stories and/or fanfics. Methods has some of this, as there is within it the obvious allegory in that irrational hatred of the /mudblood/, but it would be nice if there were some rational stories where that theme is made more explicit, and the position of obvious evil deconstructed, for that happens all so rarely.
