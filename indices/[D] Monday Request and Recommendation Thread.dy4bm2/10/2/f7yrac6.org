I have not read it, but [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/][Tank]] is supposed to be a Worm crackfic where Taylor is an insane, slogan-spouting Stalinist with the ability to turn into an army of Soviet-era tanks. This is predictably bad news for the E88. It pokes fun at the wormfic community's tendency to try to tone down or redeem the E88. Instead of talking to the Nazis, she just sprays them with anti-personel rounds.
