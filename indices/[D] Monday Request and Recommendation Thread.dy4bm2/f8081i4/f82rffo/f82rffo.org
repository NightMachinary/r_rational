If you mean alternative history, I enjoyed reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41014989-making-history][Making History]] by Stephen Fry a few years ago. It's based on the "A time traveler tries to kill baby Hitler" trope, except the guy made everything worse because as it turns out getting rid of Hitler doesn't get rid of anti-semitism or do anything to stop the rise of nationalism.
