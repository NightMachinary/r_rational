[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/constellations-worm-okami.31091/reader/][Constellations]] has some absolutely lovely situational humor. Highly recommened.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-au-cogito-ergo-lung-i-think-therefore-i-am-dragon.55832/reader/][Cogito, Ergo Lung]] should also appeal to you.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-to-munchies-worm-au-complete.449493/reader/][Path To Munchies]] might also be close to what you're looking for.

I'm absolutely certain I've read more fics with great humor that left me gasping with laughter but, sadly, they seem to be lost somewhere in the corners of my memory.
