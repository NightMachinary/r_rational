I have discovered that what I really like in good fiction is situational humor. Mostly, I am highly amused by setups which allow characters to say absurd, seemingly nonsensical things entirely seriously. UNSONG and The Erogamer do this incredibly well, and the early chapters of HPMOR did it too. UNSONG in particular was fantastic because of the sheer length and complexity of the setups, and also for "There is a kraken: Everything."

Dumb things said for smart reasons, brick jokes, absurdity taken seriously, I want it all. What other things should I be reading?
