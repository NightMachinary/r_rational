Since you mentioned an anime, I'd suggest Code Geass. The protagonist wrote the rulebook on Magnificent Bastards. Not exactly rational, but there are some schemes and unconventional tactics involved.

Remains the most fun I've had with an anime, together with Gurren Lagann (this one is antirationalist by design, though, due to the main power being based on spunk and guts)
