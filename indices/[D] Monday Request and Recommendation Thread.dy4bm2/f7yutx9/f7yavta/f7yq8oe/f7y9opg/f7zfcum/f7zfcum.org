Are there any good stories where the hero is highly charismatic and confident? Most stories always portray the hero as an underdog or even a wimp (e.g. Boku No Hero's Deku) or an introvert with no friends (e.g. Sherlock). I understand that it's to more easily show growth of the character once he stops being so, but it's usually the villain who is made more interesting, slick and confident. Are there any works you'd recommend that avoid these tropes?
