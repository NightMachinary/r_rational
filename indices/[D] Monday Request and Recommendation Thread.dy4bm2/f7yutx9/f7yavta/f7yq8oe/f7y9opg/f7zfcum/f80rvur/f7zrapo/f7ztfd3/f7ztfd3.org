It's a bit challenging, but you've gotten through Anathem, so...

The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing][Prince of Nothing]] series by R. Scott Bakker is a fantasy series in which a major plot element is a sequestered society of hypertrained monks. It's a pretty fascinating series.

Dune also has some concept crossover here, as in computers and computer science being more or less banned.
