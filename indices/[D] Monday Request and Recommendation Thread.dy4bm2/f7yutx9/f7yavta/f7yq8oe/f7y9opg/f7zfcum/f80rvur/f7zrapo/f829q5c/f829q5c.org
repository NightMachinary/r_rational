[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27746/the-last-time-loop-max-of-the-rebellion][The Last Timeloop]] on Royalroad has a very Mother of Learning vibe to it. It's a fun story and has been enjoyable so far. Not really rational and the energy requirements in the story are a mess and not too well thought out.
