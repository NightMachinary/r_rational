Old captain america?

It's trite enough that I can't even find a tvtropes page for it. Lots of things that play with the idea of Nazis, but very little that's just like nazi-killing revenge fantasy stuff. I'm not sure how much you can actually explore the theme of "Nazis are bad" with out juxtaposing it against some other theme.

What would good "anti-nazi" fiction look like?
