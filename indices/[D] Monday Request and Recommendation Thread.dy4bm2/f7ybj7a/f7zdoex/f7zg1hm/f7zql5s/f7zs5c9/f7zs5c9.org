Context. The account being a throwaway and the question being an obvious response to the previous drama. It was clearly not a question asked for it's own sake, but asked to make some kind of political statement or test or something. Some ulterior motive.

In this case at least the ulterior motive seemed to be pretty innocent, but stirring up controversy was another potential motive. Either way I thought it needed monitoring.
