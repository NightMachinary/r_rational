It has a MoL vibe to it because it's a a 3rd-wave [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult][cargo]]-imitation of MoL's core idea. From Mother of Learning to a Russian pulp fiction writer appropriating the idea, to a royalroad translation of said Russian pulp fiction. MoL was initiated [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bo4myr/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eng4mh6/?context=3][in 10/2011]], while this series was mass-produced at a rate of five volumes in the span of [[https://litnet.com/ru/book/poslednyaya-petlya-b108097][11.12.2018]] -- [[https://litnet.com/ru/book/poslednyaya-petlya-5-nasledie-auri-b169298][19.11.2019]].

CONs:

- simplistic prose
- characters' dialogues, reactions, and decisions don't make sense. For the sake of railroading into the badly designed predetermined plotline, everything else unnaturally warps out of its way to accommodate.

  - often the narrator will acknowledge that the developments in the current scene / plot arc don't make sense, will explain them away with a low-effort perfunctory handwave, and move on as if that was enough to fix the glaring writing problems at hand. One commonly used excuse is to blame the unnatural reactions and developments on "alien psychology", whereas in almost every other aspect these "aliens" behave like regular (badly written) humans in cheap costumes;
  - similar to other badly written stories with amnesiac protagonists, almost all characters behave like walking exposition drops instead of real people.

- prot's pseudo-Machiavellian thought process and reasoning

  - "at least I now knew that he had really seen us, and that he wasn't lying to me for the sake of a goal yet unknown to me" --- he's suddenly displaying an unreasonable degree of suspicion about his former teacher without any justification. Also meets him after his bout of amnesia for the express purpose of getting some information about his missing year, but then badly tries to play guessing / mind games with the man for no reason;
  - "A conversation with such a renowned person could've even been pleasant if it wasn't for my rapidly decreasing energy. But, damn it, this game of sophisticated small talk was starting to fascinate me!" --- things like this were the default inner monologue of the protagonist from another book series by the same author.

- prot making baseless judgements about people he interacts with

  - just because of seeing his boss exhaused after a work day and without his "usual mask", he somehow decides that his boss must be a "decent person";
  - then he comes up with an entire paragraph's worth of opinions and deductions about a female coworker out of nowhere;
  - “For some reason, I was sure that the hologram wouldn't lie.”

- the world is a bad juxtaposition of multiple settings (scifi, urban fantasy, DND, LitRPG, time-loop) with no regard to how much sense the outcome setting makes

  - nonsensical setting elements. Example: workplaces for energy donors look like the target audience's regular cubical workplace, which wouldn't have been an efficient design for the aliens to implement.
  - Arbitrary countdowns for his magical powers. • At one point he gets a bracelet that allows him to start tracking his mana recovery countdown, and the very first measurement shows 59m58s. • "My recovery time was reduced to ten minutes and then it stopped decreasing."

- Hollywood security

  - "I .. opened my browser, and began to .. search [for] information about the central planet of the Velly Empire, the Earth governor, and time travel technology" --- the invaders have all kinds of advanced technology, but for some reason fail to monitor the internet search history of the subjugated species for suspicious activity and highly sensitive keywords;
  - they also fail to monitor the energy levels and rates of development for members of the native population to scan for potential rising threats;
  - later on he also makes an "anonymous" phone call to the authorities from his own phone. That's when he already has reasons to suspect that he's being investigated, and he's already aware that there are other, empire-loyal, loopers inside the timeline.

- unnatural / unjustified decisions and reactions by protagonist

  - deciding to feed a battery without safety limiter after just being forcefully drained by a couple of mana pirates;
  - he happens to visit a military recruitment office and impulsively decides to try enlisting on the spot;
  - deciding to go and have a drink with a member of royalty of the usurping forces who just minutes ago was unfairly dragging his reputation through the mud. Not only that, but the royalty member himself somehow ends up agreeing to spend half a night drinking with a random nobody;
  - "I reached the club in half an hour. I couldn't help myself on my way to there and I had to imitate Dumbledore once, turning off all the lights in one of the streets. .. my wonderful abilities made me feel as if they were provoking me to get into trouble. Fortunately, today, I got away with it."
  - "My gaze slid toward the deserted alley. Damn, every time I went to a similar place, I was abducted by battery hunters. However, lightning couldn't strike in the same place three times. I would run there, check everything, and leave. .. Oh, no! It can't be! .. blocking my way to freedom, stood two familiar guys .. God damn it, not now!" --- ... ;

- unnatural / unjustified decisions and reactions by others:

  - some princess or whatnot of the invading empire:

#+begin_quote
  “It was nice to meet you,” I said. “It'd be nice to meet you in person.”

  “A request for a personal audience with Princess Ammi has been received.” The hologram that was speaking in an ordinary voice earlier now sounded a little mechanical.

  Damn! I was just trying to be polite, why do these aliens take everything too literally?!

  “Each imperial subject can ask to see the princess, but not everyone can figure out how to do this .. I cannot deny the meeting to the one who has guessed to call me, but I can punish if the reason does not meet the requirements.”
#+end_quote

For an empire that spans across multiple solar systems, just statistical chances alone (if nothing else) would make such a rule ridiculously stupid. The dialogue itself also feels really forced.

Anyways, if you know Russian and are trying to decide whether or not to read this story, try /Мир Карика/ instead. It's by the same author, and it does have many problems discussed here (so just drop it if you see you're disliking it), but at least it features more consistent world-building, has some interesting ideas, is less rushed, and has higher average quality.
