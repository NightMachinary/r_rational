[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic/][The Dao of Magic]] is a good series with a lot of deconstruction and munchkinry as the 1000 year old protagonist (originally from earth) is transplanted from a wuxia style cultivation planet to a magic planet with dungeon cores and anime tropes, as the result of a botched ascension. Both worlds are broken/mismanaged in very different ways, which makes for good contrast.

Nitpick/spoiler: At one point, he comes to the conclusion that he needs to put up a Dyson Sphere to contain the qi pollution of the local sun, as otherwise the surrounding universe will be filled with gigantic asteroid golems and such. I thought this was brilliant worldbuilding, however it is followed by what I consider a major oversight in that the MC decides he needs super strong materials similar to Ringworld scrith to accomplish this task. There is no real reason he would need that, because the [[https://www.aleph.se/Nada/dysonFAQ.html][Dyson Sphere]] in this case needs only to be a power collector, not a contiguous structure or habitat-world. It should be possible to achieve his goal by setting up a large enough swarm of orbiting satellites and statites. More exotic shell type designs could probably be achieved too, by qi based (or magnetic) momentum transfers that allow orbiting satellites to act as support rings.
