So last week someone recommended the OPM/Worm crossover I Didnt Make It by Zip Zilch and it was wonderful.

Following along those lines Im looking for more One-Punch Man and or Jojo's stories and crossovers. Doesnt have to be with Worm but I would prefer if the stories have the feelings and themes of OPM or Jojo's.
