For those who didn't see it, the "We Want MoR" podcast just started on the original audiobook feed. Same deal as "We've Got Worm", an experienced reader and a new reader go through the story chapter by chapter and analyze it together.

Typing this made me realize I forgot to make a crosspost here for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/dy2zwp/we_want_mor_chapter_6_discussion_thread][today's episode]], so derp, but I run the discussion threads and it would be great to get more activity there. My comments are stretching into the thousand word territories, as I have sooooo much to say about this story.
