The monasteries arent quite as structured and productive as the ones in Anathem, but I'd recommend checking out "A Canticle for Leibowitz".

It's a slightly older novel about the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust and rebuilding of society. I guess (kind of obvious) warning that it's a bit dark and the style of its prose might not be for everyone.
