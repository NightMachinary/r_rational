I really enjoyed this aspect of Anathem as well! In my mind, the main sequels to Ender's Game, starting with [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7967.Speaker_for_the_Dead?from_search=true&qid=Kf1cQzY0s8&rank=1][Speaker for the Dead]] are very similar in tone and atmosphere. They do not have academic monastic order, or plot similarities, so I'm mentioning them purely based on their feel.
