You are probably going to have to be content with, like, Star Wars stuff and similar?

Like...'the bad guys are an evil empire that wants to exterminate minorities' is super double popular. Lots and lots of YA stories have these kind of deals, and 'they won and now we have to do a rebellion' (wolfenstein style) is also really popular.

But it is very rarely Actual Nazis. You will almost always be dealing with analogs. I don't think this is out of any weird authorial sympathy for 1940's villains, but just because if your setting is space or the past or the future past or an alternate world or whatever, really anything but WW2, it is just less work to put in your own analogs.

Soo...I think you can definitely find stories about rebellions against evil empires, but I think the nazi comparison will always be by analogy, rather than stories about punching Literal Space Hitler.

While I wrote the above I tried to think of a few of our sub's favorite ratfics, and actually we have something of a parsity of rebellion works right now. I think it is because ratfic antags tend to be more, hrrm... all encompassing, yeah? Like, the Nazis are fundamentally an 'in-context' problem. Nazi world looks a lot like ours, with different flags and slightly fewer people. Without going into spoilers a world where the antags from Ward, Practical Guide To Evil or Worth The Candle win are much more transformed.
