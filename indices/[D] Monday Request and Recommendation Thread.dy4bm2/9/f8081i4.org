So, I just saw a comment being deleted for asking this question but hey, I'm legit curious and not trying to stir the pot.

Does anyone have any good anti-nazi fiction? I've been playing my way through Wolfenstein: The New Order and have been absolutely loving it. I think part of it is in most violent video games there's always a part of you going 'this is actually awful, and I would never do this in real life'. In Wolfenstein there's none of that moral greyness.

I'd love to read some fiction along the same lines. Decent grammar is a must, spelling slightly less so. I prefer longer works that I can fully immerse myself in; multi-million word epics are always welcome.
