I'm looking for stories with realistic portrayal of skill acquisition (in contrast to the infamous "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkMontage][training montage]]"). Hopefully, focusing on motivation/[[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Tsuyoku_naritai][determination]] and overcoming setbacks.

The difficulty should lie in the training, and the path towards improvement known. The first part of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] fits perfectly, but then the focus shifts considerably. The best example I've found so far is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go][Hikaru no Go]]. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protector_of_the_Small][Protector of the Small]] is also quite good.

Also tangentially related are stories taking place in a learning environment: the first few books of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter][Harry Potter]], [[http://www.hpmor.com/][HPMOR]] minus the battles, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem][Anathem]] (minus the ending). There was a post asking for academy-centred stories and I've tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17879100-super-powereds?from_search=true&qid=8LNZlfqkqx&rank=1][Super Powereds]] based on a rec there; but it's not quite what I'm looking for.
