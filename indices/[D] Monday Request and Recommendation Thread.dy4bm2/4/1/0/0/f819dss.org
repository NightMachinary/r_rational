It does, I think around arc 5 is when you're introduced to the overaching story. The villains from the earlier arcs sometimes come back later, as well.

The main plot of Twig is always the Lambs growing up, but there /is/ a central conflict, their struggle to become independent from the Academies and the Monarchy, and that only /really/ gets going around arc ten, in the way Worm's central conflict is only revealed somewhere around Arc 12(?).
