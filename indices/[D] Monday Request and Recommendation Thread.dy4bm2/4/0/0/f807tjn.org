Hey, since you mentioned it: I read the first two Locke lamora books recently, and I wanted to ask if I was alone in finding them a bit... formulaic. It's as if every character was following a script and I knew how plot points would end the moment they we're introduced.

Maybe I've been spoiled by highly simulationist works like worth the candle and practical guide to evil, I don't know.
