In Chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  The boat and its cargo with my weight is 150 kg
#+end_quote

I looked it up and Luffy weighs ~65kg, which means the boat, plus the ammo, plus the barrels, plus an anchor, plus food and water (I can't believe he doesn't have this), is at most 85kg.

If the boat is as small as the canon one ([[http://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one_piece/one_piece_2/one_piece_2_2.jpg?v5][picture]]), it's somewhat hard to believe this weighs that little. Even if the anchor weighs 1kg like [[http://newatlas.com/worlds-first-plastic-anchor/14618/][this one]].

Also I don't really see why things that weigh less would revolve faster, or why would the anchor pull the boat out of the whirlpool.

EDIT: the whole boarding of Alvida's ship is also pretty silly. Why would they throw cannonballs at a small dinghy? They will probably fail, and if they hit it, it will sink fast so they won't be able to get any booty. Then Luffy boards, and the crew, who /know each other/, start knocking each other out? Even in the smoke, this is implausible. And finally Alvida asks for a duel, for kicks, instead of forcing Luffy to defuse the bombs. Or accepting the offer, then kicking him out with superior force anyways.
