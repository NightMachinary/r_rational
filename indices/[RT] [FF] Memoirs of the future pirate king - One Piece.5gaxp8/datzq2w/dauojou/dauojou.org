Huh... I was thinking that maybe the density of the anchor would be enough to pull the dinghy away from the center of the vortex, but I guess it's more mass based than density based. Guess I better change on that bit.

And the whole part about opening fire on a dinghy also does seem a little implausible, but I really just rushed through that part, so I never really bothered to check on the consistency of that logic very much.

I always thought that if you destroyed a dinghy, the barrels that are loaded on the boat begins to float. I mean, a wooden dinghy can't really sink unless it becomes REALLY saturated with water, doesn't it? And the barrels, which are made most likely wooden, would also float when suspended in water, right?

I think I need to defend the rationale I had when I wrote the Luffy vs Alvida battle. If Alvida had forced Luffy to defuse the fake bombs, Luffy might have refused to do so, which might have turned out catastrophic for her. Alvida had asked for a duel really just to appeal to Luffy's sense of honor if he had any, which she only really assumed he had because of the way that he had approached her to bargain earlier. Luffy had accepted simply to trick her into a corner (of having him on gunpoint), and as a result, check-mated her. Alvida was already very agitated and was already shown from the canon to be an extremely volatile woman who didn't hesitate to end the life of a crewmember for no good reason. You have to remember that Alvida believed wholly in Luffy's bluffs, which was basically the linchpin in his plan to defeat Alvida.

Luffy boarding the ship was extremely dumb and I'll have to amend that a lot!

All in all, I am really happy with your feedback and I'll make some amendments. Thank you for taking your time to better my writing, sir.
