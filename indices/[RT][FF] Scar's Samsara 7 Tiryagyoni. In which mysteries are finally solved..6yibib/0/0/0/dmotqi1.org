I kind of jumbled the explanation there. Basically I gave you one point for both "Rafiki's power is based on hallucinogens" and "magic is based on enlightenment", as Rafiki uses hallucinogens to grant him enlightenment which grants him his power. You would have gotten more points except that you got the details wrong.

Of course, there will be more revelations about magic later! So if you want to clarify your guesses for next chapter, you can still earn more points :3
