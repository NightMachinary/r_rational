Honestly, I have no knowledge of African shamanism, Rafiki's constant use of it could have other explanations and I don't really see a strong connection between strange herbs/fruit and enlightenment apart from the claims of people on drugs that they have achieved it.

Having searched the story for the word fruit it seems that it's only mentioned in the context of hanging off of Rafiki's staves, there doesn't seem to be a mention of it being the thing he uses.
