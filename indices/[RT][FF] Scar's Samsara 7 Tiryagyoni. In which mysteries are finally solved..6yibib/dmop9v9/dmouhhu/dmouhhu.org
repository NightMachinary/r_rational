I don't really like having multiple action scenes in a row, usually. The story is supposed to gradually build up towards a climax, with each payoff followed by more buildup which is then followed by an even greater payoff. So now we have a "lul before the storm" type scene instead.

Of course, you could also write Worm and follow each climax with an ever bigger climax until you ramp up to infinity. That works too. :p

Regarding the fruit thing: Nobody guessed that! I thought it made a great deal of sense considering that A) It's rooted in African Shamanism, B) Rafiki is constantly shown using it for his visions etc. in the movie and C) it makes narrative sense considering the enlightenment theme, but alas. I guess these things are just much harder to guess when you're in the middle of reading a story than when you're writing it.
