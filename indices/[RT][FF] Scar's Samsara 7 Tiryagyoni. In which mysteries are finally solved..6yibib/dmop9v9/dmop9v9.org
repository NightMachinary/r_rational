Somehow, I was expecting that this chapter would be about Scar explaining himself to the lionesses and that it would culminate in some sort of fight scene. Instead this seems to be a setup for the next one.

Regarding the spirits, we still don't know anything about the afterlife with any real certainty, even though what Scar says/thinks indicate he believes in it. I did not expect that the fruit would be the key to gaining real enlightenment, I just thought it was something Rafiki used to make himself seem more powerful.
