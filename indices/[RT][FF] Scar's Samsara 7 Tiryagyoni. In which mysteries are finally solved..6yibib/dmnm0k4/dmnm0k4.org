This chapter finally resolves some long-running questions, and that can only mean one thing: It's time for the first Rationalist Predictions awards ceremony!

  As soon as I read the end of that chapter, I was immediately struck by the possibility that that's the same stick Scar stole. He had no reason to hold onto it when it wouldn't work for him, and would totally rather just leave it outside wherever Rafiki lived instead of face the awkward conversation. Rafiki just figured it was an extraordinary turn of good luck that he got an identical stick the next day and failed to realise Scar gave it back.

Alas [[/u/Flashbunny]], Scar answers this one with a decisive negative. You'd freely give up a mystical object of arcane power that you found in someone else's hut? What kind of RPG munchkin are you??? I'll give you an honorary mention for realizing that this was an important plot element, however.

  Well, if all else fails, Scar actually does hold more fighting power than the Pride. His massive horde of hyenas more or less guarantees his physical safety (assuming he can reach it), if not a permanent return to power.

Ok, this is not an official prediction, but [[/u/Humerus]] does earn a point for correctly anticipating that they would head for the Hyenas. Unfortunately he immediately loses that point again for assuming that this would guarantee his physical safety, which it clearly did not!

  There's no way this is going to end that easily. There will be blood before the day is done.
#+end_quote

Hmmm... Since it's already evening, shall I count this as meaning “before sunrise”? In that case you could still be correct, [[/u/ArsPoetica]]!

#+begin_quote
  I would have been surprised if he'd shifted instantly from such an emotionally driven, impulsive, counterproductive act to a calculated one like you describe.
#+end_quote

[[/u/CeruleanTresses]] gains one Rationality Point for correctly predicting that Scar would not react rationally to the end of the previous chapter! Woo! Huzah!

  I notice that Simba says he heard Mufasa tell him it was his fault. If Simba is right about this (As in not lying to help Scar or suffering from delusions.), I think we can conclude that this was done entirely via hallucinogens, as this is something I don't think Rafiki would want to show Simba and it certainly isn't something the actual Mufasa would say.

  I'm betting that Rafiki's power is mostly just weird herbalism and hallucinogens. So the afterlife is probably not as described and possibly nonexistent.

  As for Scar's spiritual attunement, I honestly don't have a clue. As an out of there guess, that's probably some sort of actual magic which may or may not run on some sort of emotional enlightenment(which would explain how Scar lost his).

Simba did not literally say that Mufasa said it was his fault - that's just what Simba read into it. Nonetheless, [[/u/Kosijenac]] earns one Rationality Point for correctly inferring that hallucinogens are a major source of Rafiki's power. Nice!

And that's it for the awards ceremony! Kudos to CeruleanTresses and Kosijenac for making correct predictions, and kudos to everyone else who stuck their necks out as well! Don't spend your points all in one go now -- and remember to rationalize responsibly!
