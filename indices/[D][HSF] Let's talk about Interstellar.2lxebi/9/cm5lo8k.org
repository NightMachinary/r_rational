This movie hits a lot of cinematic points, which made it entertaining enough to watch, but they don't flow together well as a story. It's more in the category of entertaining spectacle than what I would consider good fiction.

It tries to use contrast, but it tries so hard that many things don't fit very believably. For example, the Dust Bowl gravitas does not fit with a fun story about space travel, and the superhero like character arc of the main character (the story being always about him doing incredible things every other minute) doesn't fit well with the father/daughter relationship arc.

As a viewer you are set up to expect multiple interesting things -- political conflict over whether to expand civilization versus conserve resources, a ghost mystery versus the scientific method, solving a puzzling environmental catastrophe, and the invention of artificial gravity. Most of these get addressed towards the end, but we don't actually get very interesting stories about them or satisfying payoffs/consequences.

For example, the ending of the story is set in a rotating cylinder, indicating that they still don't have real artificial gravity. (The payoff is just that some of the humans managed to escape the pull of the earth. Kind of cheap given that they already have rockets, eh?) The political debate doesn't even turn into a thing, it's just there to set the tone early in the movie. (So the conflict was super one sided, no need to conserve resources there...)

Despite having all these interesting ideas to follow up on, the writers felt like they needed to shoehorn in some deep philosophizing (which turned out to be kind of woo-ish, i.e. love and gravity are mysterious magic that transcends time and space). This unfortunately needed to be there to preface some even more incredible twists that weren't needed.

When the ghost thing turns out to be the dad time traveling via black hole tessaract, this basically makes me think I am watching something more like A Wrinkle in Time than an interplanetary colonization story. It isn't the kind of story I wanted to see, at any rate. It's supernatural in all but name. The crystal clouds reinforced the idea of it being more fantasy than hard sci-fi (I mean, it's physics, as designed by someone who really doesn't care about physics). But playing fast and loose with physics like that, and dragging in spirit-like dimensional beings, clashes with things like the rotating space ship that tries so hard to project gritty realism for how space travel would work, how hard it is, how the danger must be fought by ingenuity.

Some more specific criticisms (many of them already covered here):

- They can land/launch multiple times on other planets, but need booster rockets to leave Earth.
- There is a plot thread about needing to solve a gravity equation in order to get people off the planet. No talk about better launch technology, despite that being the logical alternative.
- We're told that the blight affects wheat and Okra, but people can only farm corn. What about potatoes, soy, sunflowers, and all that? And why no move to greenhouses?
- The suffocation threat didn't seem plausible. There's a heck of a lot of oxygen in the atmosphere. There would need to be substantial mass of blight to bind it with something within a few decades. And nobody suggests it is anything other than a naturally occurring fungi.
- Nonhuman animals would be dying just as surely as humans. The proposals to save humanity are discussed rather coldly, with no reference to the welfare of other species.
- They evidently have fairly advanced cryonics. But the idea of using it to extend lifespan into the far future, avoid dying of hunger, or make it easier to launch a human into orbit are not thought of.
- We get to see two people face death from old age boldly without thinking to use cryonics or time dilation to wait for a cure. But we also get to hear an anti-deathism poem about raging against death, recited multiple times (from the guy who dies of old age on screen).
- Self preservation gets denigrated as equal to cowardice. Self sacrifice leads to a kind of afterlife (almost literally, he gets to be a ghost).
- Newton's third law is invoked poetically rather than literally in a situation where they could have made it literal.
- There's no real romance arc, just a kind of vacuum where it seems like one should be.

I also agree with those who have criticized plot-induced stupidity, deus ex machina, and so on. These things could perhaps be glossed over gracefully in a good enough story individually. I have nothing against an ending with fifth dimensional time traveling posthumans per se, it just didn't fit well with the context (a story about humans solving their own problems). And the movie does still work in some ways (as entertaining spectacle) because it has good special effects and the ideas are fun to play with. But it is hard not to be a little disappointed after it is all over, that it didn't work a little better.
