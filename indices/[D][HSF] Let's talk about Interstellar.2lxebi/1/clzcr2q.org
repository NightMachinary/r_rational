Good direction, acting and soundtrack.

Stupid physics and stupid people using once more the trope that scientists have yet to grow past the emotional maturity of their high school years.

I enjoyed the movie from a technical standpoint(as in, it hit all the right points and did everything 'theoretically right') but I found it meh in any other aspect.

And I certainly do not see it fitting this subreddit. Using 'sciency' words and terms and even concepts does not make it science if its using them as props and not as tools.
