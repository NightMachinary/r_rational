Well, [[http://ikjyotsinghkohli24.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/on-the-science-of-interstellar/][it wasn't that bad.]] [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/neil-degrasse-tyson-interstellar_n_6133178.html][Even NDT liked it.]] There might be a few inaccuracies, but it's /nothing/ compared to other recent space movies like /Gravity/.

Also, I'm a fan of the movie just because it gave scientists the chance to make Hollywood-budget simulations. Best simulation of a black hole yet, and [[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/][we actually made some new discoveries as a result.]] That's pretty awesome, whether the movie's plot is any good or not.
