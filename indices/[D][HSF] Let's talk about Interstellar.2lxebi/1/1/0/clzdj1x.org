Calculate the gravity gradient associated with a time dilation on the order of 1h:7 years.

That's just the first bit.

The movie might have used a bit of science to illustrate and characterize its story, but lets not pretend that it was in any way physically self-consistent. I understand that for people who only have a passing knowledge of general relativity it might seem like a real step up from the usual portrayal of space, but it really plays with picking and choosing what it wants to use and disregarding the rest. Also hiding from criticisms behind "we don't know those details, so we can assume those kind of random things". Lack of knowledge is not an excuse for goddidit.

In reality spaghettification is a real consequence.
