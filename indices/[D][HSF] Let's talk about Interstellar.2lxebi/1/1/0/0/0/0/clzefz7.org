That's what I was responding to and it seems I linked to the right thing. How was it not relevant to the above? He still didn't like the movie but that's because of the story. And there are other details that are wrong in the movie, but the above bit he argued could happen. It's a nuanced POV.

I'm working with limited time and this is a comment thread, so I decided to link to other people's words. I'm not saying 'believe this because names X and Y believe this'. Just linking to further reading material to extend the discussion's mutual background knowledge. Just searching for arguments that already exist and their structure.

The above time dilation point was the only bit referenced earlier and as you can see, it's not weighty enough to support such a broad generalization as was made originally.

But hey, this movie wasn't across the board encyclopedic either.
