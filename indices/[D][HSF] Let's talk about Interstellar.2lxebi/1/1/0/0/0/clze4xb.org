Do you realize that the post you linked to does not adress the criticism I raised?

You seem to be repeatedly making a lot of appeals to authority while ignoring or even misunderstanding the problems of other viewers.

I mean, I will fully admit that I only studied Special Relativity and have no General Relativity formal study, but I do have friends who've worked with topics such as the stability of AdS spacetime and whom I've bounced those ideas of after the movie so I'm reasonable certain about that point of criticism.
