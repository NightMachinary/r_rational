How was the physics stupid?

Btw did you know Kip Thorne was involved in it from the beginning and was an executive producer? Also, he got 2 original papers out of it too.

Oh plus, read Phil Plait's mea culpa... it's easy to pattern match a movie to 'bad science but technically excellent', but in this case you'd have to go deeper to argue that overall it had bad science.

I agree that it worked really well as a movie, though. But I didn't find it unreasonable either...and I could imagine people acting the way they acted. I mean, even one of the antagonists was not textbook evil; you could see that in their own eyes, they thought they were the hero.
