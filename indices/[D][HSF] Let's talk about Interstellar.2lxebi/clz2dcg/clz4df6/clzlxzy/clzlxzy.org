Yeah, I agree that the drama and plot was all incorporated well, but if we actually start going into the sciences of it, well...

If we don't need to follow casualty, then why do the humans-who-have-ascended-into-all-but-godhood choose the stable time loop which involves way too many risks to be taken (not so stable after all), rather than simply going back to the planet and getting rid of the Blight with their physics-breaking powers? Not only does that seem to have a much lower failure rate, but it seems like it would have happened the /first/ time! (though talking about firsts is worthless when casualty is your plaything)

And there are way too many illogics like that throughout the movie, so I just called it another sci-fi, and treated it like that. And from that standpoint, it was excellent.
