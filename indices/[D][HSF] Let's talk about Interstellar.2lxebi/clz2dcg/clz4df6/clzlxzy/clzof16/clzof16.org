Isn't it sort of implied that stable time loops are part and parcel of a deterministic universe? Yes, future-us are time-hopping beings of magical technology, but the time loop must always have happened regardless. Maybe there's some kind of Time Police in the future meant to keep the Future World from being dramatically changed: that is, they could do things differently but choose not to. Or maybe they're slaves to their own personal timelines, or they're not actually capable of walking around time like Cooper thinks, just capable of manipulating time such that in enables time loops, OR their knowledge of time is so great that the time loop that exists is the best way to go.

They did the right thing and made it vague. When you're dealing with time a lot of plot holes can go out the window. Literally, what happened, happened, and always will have happened.
