(I am cross posting my response from the interstellar subreddit, but I really wrote it for the viewers here.)

After watching the movie last night and reflecting a bit on it... I've come to the following conclusion (and potential spin-off.) *Short version:* "Plan B", the Lazarus Colony, are the helpers who created the tesseract and the wormhole... and "they" live inside the event horizon with Brand, Cooper and TARS.

"They" exist beyond time in precisely the world that is built to support such an environment: the edge of a black hole. Who knows how humans who are born and raised inside a black hole will develop? Why add in the extra element of "at some point in the future, humans will become 5D alien-transhumans" when the statement "when time is no longer a factor, humans will become 5D alien-transhumans" is just as valid?

*Longer recounting of events and supporting evidence:* Cooper and TARS went inside the black hole past the event horizon. TARS was able to explain a lot of what was going on: "Cooper, they are trying to communicate with you and they have built something for you to understand their world." In a self-fulfilling prophecy, Cooper neatly closes any threatening-time-paradoxes by manipulating "past"-events precisely in the manner they ought to be... at which point the tesseract collapses and he is rescued minutes later orbiting Saturn hundreds of years later. After an emotional reunion with his daughter, Cooper goes off to find Brand and her Plan B colony on the final planet, which due to time dilation, has only just been established judging by the simultaneous scenes of Cooper stealing the scram jet and Brand burying her lover and setting up the colony.

*Necessities:* In order for the alien-transhumans to create a stable time-loop that involves Cooper and Murphy, they have to know the story of the the bookcase, the NASA coordinates, the watch, and the gravity-equation.

*Theory A:* (what most movie-watchers suppose) is that humans eventually "evolve" into these super-exciting transhumans at some point in the future. The problem with this is that the transhumans exist outside of time (like the Tramalfadorians of Slaughterhouse Five.) Additionally, Cooper doesn't seem to stick around long enough to really tell everyone his story -- as a matter of fact, I'm struck by everyone's relative disinterest in the Hero who Saved the World. Even though they have a lot of nifty spacecraft, they haven't used it for hundreds of years to support Brand -- WHAT?!? In Brand's timeline, she just landed on an alien plant and is building small tents, while the rest of Humanity hangs out in a giant space station off orbit of Saturn building farm museums for at least 2-3 generations? Forgive me, but the civilians of Cooper-Station seem like the natural complacent products of a "Caretaker" generation.

*Theory B:* (what I'm proposing) is that the Lazarus colony, instead of settling on Brand's planet, actually settles in the black hole. Cooper leaves the Cooper Station with relatively few supplies, just himself and TARS basically and goes off to find Brand. They have a supply of humans ready-to-hatch and Cooper arrives with a new space-craft and more fuel. He tells Brand about the event horizon and the tesseract (and this is where my theory gets really wild) and convinces her to abandon the colony and bring the Lazarus Plan Bs to the black hole and they all jump in this time. TARS has the archived entirety of human civilization (and sarcastic humor AI), Brand is an astrophysicist and Cooper is a cowboy-farmer-space-pilot -- combined, they are the perfect progenitors for a Lazarus colony for 5-dimensional beings.

My theory also explains "a lot of the irrational emotion" in the movie: Brand and Cooper have this bizarre theory that "love can communicate beyond time, beyond the speed of light, etc." Why would "they" create a tesseract that precisely falls in line with this theory? Since Brand and Cooper are the direct progenitors of the Plan B Lazarus race -- they essentially create a religion in which this "love" concept does transcend time and space. They give the Lazarus Plan Bs a two-step mission: 1) create a wormhole to Saturn in the Solar system and 2) create a tesseract-link as a bookcase/shrine in the location of Murphy Cooper's bedroom... thus resolving the remaining threads of potential-time-paradoxes.

Unfortunately, since they all live in a black hole, they have a hard time interacting with regular humans (aside from the massive endeavor of creating a wormhole and manipulating gravity) and they can't ever escape.

*Theory C:* Brand and Cooper establish the colony, perhaps more explorers arrive from our Solar system and an indeterminate period of time in the future, they travel to the wormhole and decide to live there instead. This storyline has less narrative urgency and intrigue, so I like Theory B much better.
