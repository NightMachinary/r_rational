It wasn't rational.

Why did Astronaut #2 wait for 23 years instead of leaving to try and solve the mission alone? Not because it made any sense, but just so Cooper had a place to return to, but still loses 23 years of life, so that there can be drama?

Why go down to planet #1 at all, given that you'll lose years of time? Especially when the sane alternative is shot down with only a few mutterings about a few *months* of travel and resources.

Why spend decades on a fake plan that no-one but you, the astronauts, and one girl really care about? Lie to everyone else about how the project is going and redirect the resources /anywhere else/.

The scene in the beginning, where Cooper hears about how the moon landing was covered up, is done because it is shocking to the audience and helps give sympathy to Cooper when he defends his daughter. (Never mind that they never deal with the fact that Murphy's response to disagreement is violence- Right or wrong, you can't raise a child to hit someone for disagreeing with you)

That scene isn't done because it makes sense- What, they got everyone over 40 besides Cooper and his dad to pretend the space race was faked? Why? Public opinion was already against the space program, they don't need to lie to convince people.

I do actually like Dr. Mann's characterization, though- His slip from sanity makes sense when he's been alone for decades with no hope for rescue.
