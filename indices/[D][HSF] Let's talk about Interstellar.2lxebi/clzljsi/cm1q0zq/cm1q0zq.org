  Never mind that they never deal with the fact that Murphy's response to disagreement is violence- Right or wrong, you can't raise a child to hit someone for disagreeing with you

Actually I didn't necesarily see that as her being the aggressor, more like on of the other kids went all "Grr you stupid. I beat you now." so she defended herself... but since she was defending the 'politically incorrect' point of view, she was blamed.

I doubt they had to put so much work into it. Declassify some secret documents saying it was, get some supposed experts to back it up, the vast majority of people will swallow it.

Especially when most people have more important things to do, like surviving.
