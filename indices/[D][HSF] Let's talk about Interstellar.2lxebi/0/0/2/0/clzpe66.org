If you try to steelman her words, they would come like this:

"Hey, my System 1 screams at me and tells that we really should try Edmonds' planet. I don't know why, but maybe my intuition could be evidence here? Maybe my System 1 acts like this for a reason?"

This thought actually occurred to me while in cinema. I quickly ran through the Kanneman's "expert prediction" checklist and concluded that well, no, there is no possible reason for her System 1 to be correct here: Power of Love doesn't exist, and her intuition couldn't possibly be trained in "black hole astrobiology" or whatever.

And then I turned out to be wrong, and she turned out to be right. Because Mann had faked his data, and this situation is actually about psychology, not astrophysics: the subject where expert predictions are valid. And it's perfectly plausible that intuition of Brand actually had tried to tell her this:

"Hey! I know Mann and he could not be trusted! He is coward at heart! His data is /too perfect/. I know Edmonds, and Edmonds is a good guy who will not lie. Edmonds' data isn't so promising as Mann's but at least I'm sure his data isn't faked. Edmonds' planet is a good choice /because I love him/."

Hooray for intuition. You could call this "power of love", I think: the ability to use the model of your soulmate to your advantage. As, for example, Cooper did: he wouldn't be able to transmit "quantum data" to Murphy were it not for his knowledge of her knowledge of Morse code.
