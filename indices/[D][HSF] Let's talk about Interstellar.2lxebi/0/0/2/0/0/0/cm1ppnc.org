Considering the preceding scene "Oh look, massive 100 meter tall wave of water approaching fast, if it hit's us the mission is over. I'm gonna run out there even though everyone's shouting to get back so we can GTFO and try to pull some water logged computer bits out of the wreckage!"

I'm pretty certain that she simply suffered from a terminal case of teh stupids.

Also, did they forget to put a radar on that ship? Cause a radar should have warned them of oh look massive approaching wave well before they even got out. Maybe before they even landed.
