I do believe trying to interpret a piece of fiction "generously". However, if in a piece of fiction a main character's motivations are guided by mysterious off-screen unmentioned and never revealed intuitions that are guided by mysterious off-screen unmentioned and never revealed knowledge, both of which are counter to her actual words and actions, that's terrible writing in worse ways than just having a stupid character. I also think if love did turn out to be a mysterious 5D force, that's the worst writing of all. Therefore, I think the most generous explanation is that just she's an idiot.

Also, something something "generalizing from fictional evidence". It is an interesting point, and it probably is worth remembering "make sure to check that your 'expert prediction' is actually based on the field you think it is", but I still would not say "Hooray for intuition". If this was a rationalist fic, it probably would have been "Hooray for ignoring your intuition when it doesn't know what it's talking about!"
