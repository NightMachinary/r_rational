Nanotech obeys the laws of physics and chemistry like anything else, you can't just "handwave something up". If it can get through walls how did they manage to keep it off of the space stations before they were launched? How would it actually go about blocking the sun, mechanically speaking, and how would that prevent other forms of energy collection from working (wind, geothermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, tidal, etc.)? Solar power is pretty weak out in the vicinity of Saturn, that space habitat was likely relying on some other power source out there anyway.

This movie was nowhere near "hard science fiction", IMO. A few individual set pieces or visual effects were hard SF (Endurance, the black hole, time dilation), but that can't make the work /as a whole/ into hard SF. They were mixed in with too many flagrant and fundamental violations of physics or plain old logic for that.

And going through the list of bullet points in the sidebar definitions, I can't find a single one of them that this movie satisfies as either rational or rationalist. "Hollywood" is no excuse.
