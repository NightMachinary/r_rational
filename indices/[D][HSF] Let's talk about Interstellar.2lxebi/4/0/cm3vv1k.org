Well it's a hollywood movie, I think it's rather unrealistic to expect no plot holes. I think it's great when you take into account that fact.

The whole water planet thing is a huge plot hole, but it's only a small part. And the habitats not working on the Earth's surface could be explained by the blight being able to get through solid walls. Or the blight covering the sun such that making a self sustaining habitat on Earth would be difficult. I mean it's nanotech, you could always hand wave something up. And I can't really think of a way to get around the SSTO thing if you want the same group of people to visit multiple planets.

I agree the characters weren't rational, and I laughed every time Cooper took the controls from the robot but I think it still counts as hard sci fi. The rules are relatively sane and with the awesome robots, awesome spaceship, and life extension as a matter of fact (at the end) I think it qualifies as a "rational hollywood movie".
