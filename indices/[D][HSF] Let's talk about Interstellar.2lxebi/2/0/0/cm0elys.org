You make a good point about mistakes and people making suboptimal choices. In fact Brand(t?) going for the data on the water planet made sense. We see it all the time where people go above and beyond and get away with it. It was nice that she failed spectacularly and was deeply affected by that. A lot of the character stuff in the movie was done superbly well. Crazy Dr. Mann's actions made sense in a twisted way.

I can see politics getting in the way of dealing with the food crisis. Immediately after an obvious world war a government would want its people to know they are safe and that there is hope for the future. Maybe they couldn't grow enough food in sealed complexes to feed the number of people left so the majority /had/ to grow it in the open.

However I don't think that a group of people who designed the strategy behind the space missions did not see the obvious flaws and how to fix it. Even if they were resource confined there were far better ways of doing the mission. It's not like it was a heat of the moment scenario either, they had decades to plan it.

My real problem with the time loop is that it does not add to the story or characters in any meaningful way. I felt it was included as Shyamalan type twist to make the movie seem smarter than it was. I think the idea of an alien race helping humanity out of the blue and making no other contact was far more interesting. It brings up the question of whether a price is attached. Maybe they accidentally caused the blight during a first contact situation and felt guilty.

If it were just one or two things the movie wanted me to accept as a premise I think I would have been okay. It was the fact that my suspension of disbelief was shattered a short while after they went through the wormhole.

I think the writers came up with a lot of interesting ideas and problems and a fascinating scenario. Instead of asking "How would humanity react to this?" they went with "How dramatic an adventure can we write?". That's what gets me riled up, they didn't think things through well enough.

A few years back my friends and I went to see John Carter of Mars. It wasn't an absolutely awful movie it was just bland. John Carter was clearly fantasy and actually surprised me with its understated sci-fi elements. However one of my friends took personal offence at that movie. For 2 years he lamented the couple of hours that movie cost him. I think Interstellar is my John Carter.
