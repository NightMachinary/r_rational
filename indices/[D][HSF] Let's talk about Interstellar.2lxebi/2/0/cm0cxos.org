It could be a stable time loop in which there's no paradox. Still deterministic.

Maybe the above was more feasible overall. But I can see various suboptimal and not-smart actions being taken, though. People make mistakes and are wrong about things. That's also a part of observed reality. It's not so ridiculous for a movie to show people making mistakes.

I think your strongest point is about sending eggs on every mission and automating their incubation. Idk though, maybe they can't get to term automatically. But still, each of the Lazarus missions could've had them. I guess it's possible that they were resource constrained in some way.

They did send a bunch of probes though, but perhaps they don't have strong enough AI to rely on them? I'd argue it's ok to assume that as a premise.

Interesting points to think about!
