re: the food crisis.

I believe that the blight was a mass extinction event on par with the creation of oxygen in our atmosphere by photosynthesis. We used to have an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, but once the potent, toxic oxidant Oxygen byproduct started polluting our environment, the creatures of Earth suffered a mass extinction event.

The Blight was like a virus or a microorganism that used Nitrogen (the 70% reference that older Brand/Michael Caine references) as an energy source and was polluting the environment. (I cannot recall what was happening to make everyone suffocate, but it was referenced a few times.)

My biggest biological concern with the Blight was that they would bring the Blight accidentally aboard their Space Stations from Earth and they would continue to be unable to grow food (reliant on plants and photosynthesis rather than blight and nitrogen-consumption)
