Where would the blight get the nitrogen from? With oxygen, it was the breakdown of CO2 via plant photosynthesis. There is no equivalent component of the atmosphere for N2. If the N2 were turning into N2O (laughing gas) and therefore depleting the oxygen, it would be more believable. But global warming would probably kill us before suffocation in that case.

The fact that it attacks specific human food sources but leaves corn and inedible natural plants like sagebrush untouched bugged me. It would have been more believable as a genetically engineered bioweapon than as a natural disaster. Also, the lack of concern over the fate of nonhuman species seemed like a major oversight.

The only way this works is if extreme political stupidity or something leads to us producing hardly any crop diversity. No potatoes, hemp, soybeans, etc. are shown as surviving /or/ being lost to the blight.
