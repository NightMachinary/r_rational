Why would existence of advanced bio tech necessarily preclude that sort of food crisis? I can see your point but it's not that weighty. We have advanced enough tech to contain Ebola, but it spread in West Africa nonetheless; maybe there were other hurdles to containing the food crisis. Anyway, I kind of treated it as part of the premise. Not too ridiculous compared to sci fi in general.

And perhaps the machines doing the farming were not fully autonomous enough to finish the process by selling crop in the local markets...you'd perhaps still need an overseer who knows stuff about farming. Or just owners of the machines.

I do agree with the point about there not being advanced optics. They could've spotted trouble or at least better argued why landing was necessary. I thought landing a robot should've been enough...they looked very capable. Perhaps they ran out of money/time to fully build out a piloting system and took a shortcut with a human pilot? But the point about not having the best telemetry...yeah.
