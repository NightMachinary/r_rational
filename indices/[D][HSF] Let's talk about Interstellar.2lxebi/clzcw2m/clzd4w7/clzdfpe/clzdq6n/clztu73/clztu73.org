People starve despite having the means to feed themselves, yes. Wars cause that all the time. But societies at that stage of disintegration don't have a prayer of mounting the kind of space program needed to get an offworld presence going! Space is difficult - if you are having trouble with surviving on earth you are guaranteed to fail at it in space. If you want to construct a crisis forcing an evacuation, it needs to be something which the toolkits needed for said evacuation cannot trivially fix. Like discovering the sun is scheduled to have a very unfortunate encounter with a smallish black hole or something.
