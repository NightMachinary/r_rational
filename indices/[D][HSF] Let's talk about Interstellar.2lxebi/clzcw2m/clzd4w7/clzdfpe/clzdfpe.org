Eh, no, MoreDonuts is right. The worldbuilding does not really hang together - a food crisis and enough grasp of biotech to hope to establish off-world colonies can't co-exist, having a need for lots of farmers.. and fully robotic combines is also incoherent, not giving an exploratory mission the finest optics equipment the NRO can make or dig out of storage is just flat out insane, which means landing on planet one makes no sense whatsoever... and I have some issues with the things done with Anne Hataway's character, and the movie loved Cooper far to much - it's just bad story telling to center everything on one guy to that extent.

It did a few things very right. The scene at the end where Brant was gearing up to start a colony all buy herself? That was /potent/. The movie diluted it by implying Cooper was on his way (See earlier point about everything having to be about Cooper somehow) But it's one hell of an image nonetheless.

Honestly, I think the movie would have just worked a lot better if Cooper had just never left the black hole and they tied up the loose ends without him. He got to say goodbye via the watch. The meeting with his old daughter on the space station is just surplus to requirements.
