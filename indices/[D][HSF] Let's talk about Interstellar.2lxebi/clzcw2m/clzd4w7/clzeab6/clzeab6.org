Here's my extreme reduction of the plot:

#+begin_quote
  Humanity is in danger!

  Guy goes through mysterious wormhole

  Guy falls into mysterious blackhole

  Look there's a mysterious tesseract here, let me us it to send "the data" to my daughter!

  Humanity is saved the end. Also don't worry about the wormhole or the blackhole or the tesseract. They make perfect sense-they were put there by future humans with a love for convoluted plots and indirectness and high probability of failure. Or aliens with a love for convoluted plots and indirectness and high probability of failure. Or they just randomly happened because "anything that can happen will lol".

But regardless of how you try to interpret the plot, what the hell was the point? The drama was dramatic and that's fine and all and that's nice, but there wasn't much to think about after the movie was over.

As for characters being idiots - Cooper wasn't an idiot because he was the tropeful wise-crackin' bad-assin' smarter-than-the-supposedly-"smart"-characters Bruce Willis-esque character, and it was obligatory that everyone was like, "We need to do [ridiculous action] because of [tenuous reason]" and he's like "No, we need to do [obvious thing] because [it's literally the only thing that makes any sense or has any hope of working]." Anne Hathaway's character was horribly unprofessional, wouldn't listen to Cooper's instructions, and for some reason thought that love was a supernatural force, and was willing to stake the future of humanity on that belief. In other words, she was an idiot. Mann... I don't even know what Mann was trying to accomplish, but whatever it was instead he managed to explode despite every telling him "DON'T DO THAT YOU'LL EXPLODE". In other words, he was an idiot. Murph was a "brilliant scientist" yet couldn't forgive her dad for "trying to save humanity" or something, EVEN BEFORE SHE KNEW THAT PLAN B WAS HOAX. And even if Cooper did know and Murph knew he knew, did you have a better idea Murph? Or do you prefer the death of humanity to having your father leave? Murph should have just stayed 10 for the entire movie, it would have matched her actions better. Actually that goes for everyone except Cooper and maybe Michael Caine.
