Here's one thing it did right. It's a definitive fuck you to the deathist point of view. Also, it at least in name underscores the importance of science and discovery. And exploration. I'd say that was the point. To make a sci fi movie that extrapolates from what could happen. Hell, new physics came out if this.

Mann lost his mind. Hathaway was under incredible pressure and besides, cooler heads prevailed and she grudgingly agreed too. Also, there's something to be said about artistic license.

But yeah I agree, some characters make suboptimal decisions (see? No intrinsic character disparagements!). You made a lot of good points. There are all these things that need some suspension of disbelief, but perhaps some that are still problematic after admitting the premise. Oh, it's not rational at all either, I agree with that, it doesn't try to be.
