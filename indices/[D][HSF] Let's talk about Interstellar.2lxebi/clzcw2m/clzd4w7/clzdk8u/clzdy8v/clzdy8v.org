Yeah that was weird coming from her. But maybe she was under incredible emotional pressure? Isn't it possible that there could exist such a person on such a mission (they don't really have the best pickings)? Why would the probability of her being an emotionally balanced person be so high as to override a basic, biological drive?

But I do agree, would've been better to at least see her overcome this or battle this out with herself and reluctantly agree with Cooper at the very least.

I don't buy the flowery love angle either... But I could imagine some people saying that.
