I saw it, and I didn't really like it.

It was very pretty, yes, and there were a lot of individual moments and set-pieces that were way more scientifically accurate than 99% of the science fiction movies out there. Loved the design of Endurance. Loved the visuals of the black hole. The fact that suspended animation and time dilation and realistic travel-time to Saturn were used were great. The AIs were awesome characters, and none of them "turned on humanity" for no reason.

But it was all woven together into a plot which made no sense.

They have the technology to build those awesome spacecraft, human-like artificial intelligences, and yet all they gave the forerunner explorers were simple "yes/no" beacons? They didn't have space probes even as competent as the ones we've got orbiting Mars in real life /right now/. Mountain-sized waves would be obvious from orbit.

For that matter, if a planet is orbiting a black hole close enough to have 1h:7y time dilation, it can already be dismissed as "safe for habitation" right then and there. They should never have bothered.

Or, actually, they could have bothered. Why not send "plan B" artificial-womb colonies to /all 12/ of those planets instead of those useless yes/no explorers. Follow up with plan A colonization if you get the chance.

Apparently, Earth had the resources to build gigantic self-sufficient space habitats down on the planet's surface, they just didn't have the magical gravity drives needed to lift them into space. But why did they /need/ to lift them into space? When Earth's environment degrades to the point where it's uninhabitable, just seal up the habitats and live inside them while they're still down on the ground. They'd be much easier to build if they didn't need to be designed to survive in space and you'd still have access to all of Earth's resources just outside the airlock. You could build a lot more of them and save a lot more people than the tiny fraction of Earth's population that they did with the space habitat in the movie.

Earth has a couple of fully-reusable SSTO shuttlecraft that can come and go at will from a planet with greater than Earth's gravity, survive landing in an ocean and "surfing" a giant wave, and yet NASA's depicted as being a shoestring organization that has to rely on old leftovers from the glory days already in orbit. They could have had those shuttles going up and down routinely on Earth to build better space infrastructure (not sure why they needed a big Saturn V style launch the first time when all the other planets were SSTO).

If you want your second-wave explorers to make an objective decision about which planets to go to, don't include someone among them who was in love with one of your stranded forerunner explorers. At least, not unless she's thoroughly psychologically screened to ensure she won't make decisions based on gut emotions.

"Frozen clouds." Ugh.

Anyway, in addition to just being bad, I don't think this movie fits the definitions of "rational fiction" in the sidebar. Very little problem-solving went on in this movie, the rules of the fictional world were not sane or consistent, and lots of stuff happened because "the plot requires it".
