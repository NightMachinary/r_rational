Well it could be that it takes some time for it to get through walls and they can sterilize a small area at some expense for some time. And the blocking the sun thing would be a sort of constant dust cloud? Sort of the a nuclear winter scenario? It's rather hard to come up with something which makes Earth less habitable than anywhere else and the story kind of requires that (and not saying much about it leaves room for concocting a reasonable explanation).

Anyway wasn't the plan always plan B? There would probably be a lot of stragglers on Earth for a long time more but the idea was to start a proper colony which didn't have to struggle and could rebuild civilization? I understood it as the Saturn station wasn't built for survival, it was built after the blight and stuff was fixed (from the science which Cooper passed them). Which I guess probably isn't the intended script but it makes more sense IMO.
