Movie looked beautiful and I definitely loved certain parts.

However:

- Some sort of food crisis caused by disease spread in dust storm. Grow everything in hermetically sealed buildings. Use algae as a base for most foods. Grow meat in vats.

- Need to find a new planet for colonisation. Aliens help out with wormhole. Fine. Wormhole is in orbit around Saturn. What year is this 2001? Hell I loved that.

- Fate of humanity rests in relocation/colonisation. Infinite resources should have been available to NASA.

- Oh we happened to send 12 people out to get data on these planets. Why? Send a bunch of satellites and probes. In fact there are allusions to artificial wombs so send a bunch of fertile eggs and those super smart robots to care for the children.

- Set up a space station orbiting the Wormhole at both its ends. If radiation based communication fails you can just physically shuttle data back and forth through the Wormhole.

- Launch an intelligent mission from these stations to figure out if any of the planets were viable. No one has to go crazy. No one has to die.

- Let's set aside the fact humanity had the technology to protect themselves from the radiation emitted by the accretion disc. None of the planets near a blackhole are safe.

- Love is a biochemical reaction not magic.

- Guy on mission: "We'll send one of the robots into the blackhole. PAST THE EVERY HORIZON. Maybe we can get data if it transmits it fast enough.

- Guy: Why isn't the data coming through?

- Every physicist ever: it's a blackhole. NOTHING GETS OUT PAST THE EVENT HORIZON. However Michael Cain figured out quantum gravity 40 years ago. Applications for space travel are decades away but we did manage to build a probe that might be able to come back.

- The girl has a mental breakdown and believes her ghost dad is talking to her through the random ticks of a broken watch. No way she came to that conclusion via any train of rational thought. Turns out blight makes you crazy. Even so she is still a brilliant engineer and designs a gravity based engine. Humanity finds cure for blight illness. Craziness is managed.

- I prefer the mysterious 'them' to be aliens as 'them' being future humans would create a time paradox.

- The crew should have been mainly female so they could have repopulated a planet using fertilised the eggs if disaster struck.

Pretty much covers how I would have fixed the major problems. There is room for tonnes of drama in the movie. The slow deterioration of morale as the crew finds each planet in turn not viable would have been great. Coop not being there for his children as they learn of his son's mental illness and his daughter following in her father's engineering footsteps. His daughter also succumbing to the illness even as she works to save humanity and succeeds. Drama of a plan A succeeding but also the multiple plan B's as well. Several world's seeded with human life. What would happen next?
