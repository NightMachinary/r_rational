Eh.. a 26000 lumen LED bulb (Which is basically "Your room is now suitable for growing crops") runs 160 dollars, and assuming you run it 16 hours per day, around 10 dollars of electricity per month. I mean, this might hurt if you are lighting up the entire house like that, but as SAD preventatives goes, not really that bad.
