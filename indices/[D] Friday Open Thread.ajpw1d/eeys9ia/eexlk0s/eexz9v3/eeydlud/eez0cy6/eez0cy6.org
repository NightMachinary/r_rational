The overhead lights in my ceiling fan all burned out most of a year ago so I've gone most of that time with just a not-particularly-bright floor lamp, but maybe like two months ago I was able to get a four-pack of daylight bulbs from Walmart for like 10 bucks. I was surprised by how gosh darned bright they are, and they're exceptionally white to the point of almost looking blue (they're just exposed to the world, no covers/shades/whatever).

After like a week or two I noticed that I was feeling WAY too alert around bedtime and that I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep, and that I was starting to feel somewhat manic during the day. I haven't felt manic in a very long time. I put two and two together and realized it was the light, so I've started shutting off my overhead lights around 6-7pm and that's helped me regulate things.

Something is always better than nothing, right? Mania is the opposite of depression (in terms of one being a surplus of serotonin and the other a deficit) and the cheap bulbs (relatively speaking, compared to other solutions sold explicitly for SAD) from Wally World were capable of inducing an almost hypomanic state, so replacing your bulbs could possibly help alleviate some of your symptoms.

As far as general depression is concerned, I'd definitely recommend lifting weights. If you haven't taken even a single step down the path that begins your fitness journey, start by purposefully walking an additional 15 minutes a day, even if that means pacing back and forth in your living room (that's what I do, but roughly 5 minutes at a time every 90 minutes to 2 hours). After a week or two you can start doing bodyweight squats and pushups every other day (don't expect to do more than 5 pushups, starting with just three sets of 2 reps is enough, and with all exercises try to add just one single additional rep every time you do work out).

I can't be bothered to cite my sources, but whatever. I know I've read studies that claim to show that antidepressants might not work by increasing serotonin levels, because if that's how they worked then you'd expect them to work pretty close to immediately since they raise serotonin levels pretty much immediately. They increase neurogenesis, which most people (in the general population, at least) didn't think was a thing until like 10 years ago. Your brain should constantly be changing and growing new neurons and making new connections/associations. Exercise is good at stimulating neurogenesis. Hell, lots of things are. Varying your daily routine, learning new things, talking to different people and having new and different experiences, all that stuff contributes to neurogenesis.

But life /does/ suck for a great many people, and it can be difficult not to feel like you're just living though the exact same day over and over on repeat. I've been unemployed since like forever. I still live with my mother, which I've started to feel less bad about after having recently read some articles and finding out that 1 out of 3 people aged 18 to 34 still live at home with their parents, a number which hasn't been so high since the late 1930s about 10 years after the Great Depression started, and we coincidentally happen to be about 10 years out from the beginning of the Great Recession, the curves in the graph are pretty similar.

But on top of still living with my mother, we're living at my grandmother's house "between houses" and we were supposed to move to New York like 6 months ago and now it's looking like we'll be lucky to move out of grandma's house before /fall/ and /it hasn't even been spring yet/ and I'm going to have turned 29 /and/ 30 while living here, and I haven't hung out or communicated with any (presumably former) friends in close to 2 years, and I had bright-red bloody diarrhea (10 or more times a day, every day, for 3 straight months) at the end of 2017 /and then again at the end of 2018/, but y'know what, I'm in a good place mentally. I'm playing around with FL Studio again, I'm writing again, I'm reading again, I'm lifting weights again.

I don't know what good any of that information does for you or anyone else, but I've already typed it, so let me try to retrofit a point into there somewhere.

Eh, there's probably one in there somewhere already.

[EDIT: It looks like the "learning and experiencing new things can increase neurogenesis" and the "life is hard for a lot of people and that makes it hard to afford things which might help increase neurogenesis" bits were meant to continue on through to an additional paragraph, the point of which was probably something like /"even though life sucks, if you can force yourself to take/ any /sort of action in spite of the suck, it'll start to feel like it sucks less; I've been in this living situation for almost a year now and have made the excuse not to lift weights because my old bedroom was 20ft by 20ft and my new one is 10ft by 9ft and I have a friggin queen-size mattress in here and a litter box and a cat tree and a cat feeding station and a computer/chair station and I only have a 3-foot-wide by 7-foot-long little square of space at the end of my bed, but once I exorcised whatever demon was living in my intestines for three months, I forced myself to work around the situation; maybe exercising isn't your thing, maybe you need to teach yourself how to play a new game or teach yourself how to cut down a tree or teach yourself how to tile your kitchen floor or how to juggle or how to play an instrument or how to XYZ, the point is that forcing yourself into novel experiences can/ *HELP* /even if it isn't a cure; something is always better than nothing, it doesn't matter if you perfectly clean your room to an immaculate state, thinking that way means you never do it EVER because you can't be arsed to do it 100 percent, at least if you're doing it 80 percent every few days it'll be done more than it would be if you did it 0 percent most of the time and 100 percent only on occasion."/ Or something like that.]

Elevated levels of cortisol might inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Most adult neurogenesis takes place within the hippocampus. Ashwagandha reduces cortisol levels by like 30% after 12 weeks, and that isn't "alternative health" nonsense, you can look up studies yourself.

Cortisol also affects fat storage around the midsection, so there's that too as a bonus (though never expect any pill to magically peel away stomach fat to reveal abs, there's no such thing as "spot reduction," like, you can't work out specific areas of the body to lose fat in those specific areas, your body deposits fat in certain areas in a certain order; the stomach is pretty much the first place where fat is stored (for men anyway, it's a different order of fat storage for men vs women), so it's pretty much the last place where it's lost).
