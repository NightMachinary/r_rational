I've found that ensuring that the first thing I do in the morning (before showering et al, literally within five minutes of the alarm if possible) is /eating something substantial/, has calibrated my brain so that it naturally /wants/ to wake up right when my alarm goes off. (This is, AFAIK, to do with orexin release in the brain being the counter to adenosine release---animals naturally recalibrate to wake up at the time of best historical meal availability.)

Sadly, this means that you can't spend any time cooking in the morning before eating. Depending on your meal preferences, that either translates to preparing breakfast the night before (e.g. non-instant porridge), eating something you don't cook (e.g. granola and yoghurt), or eating an “instant” meal (e.g. a grocery store frozen “breakfast wrap” which you just microwave.) I alternate all three methods. If I crave more complex breakfast meals, I'll prepare those as brunch on weekends, after first having toast or a granola bar (something small that will kickstart your appetite) the moment I get up.

I also, more recently, acquired a light therapy lamp, which I sit in front of while eating said breakfast. This was a good multiplier for the wakefulness-calibrating effect of eating first thing upon waking up, I think, but when I tried it on its own, it didn't help nearly as much as eating first thing on its own (i.e. I quickly went back to feeling unable to get out of bed.)
