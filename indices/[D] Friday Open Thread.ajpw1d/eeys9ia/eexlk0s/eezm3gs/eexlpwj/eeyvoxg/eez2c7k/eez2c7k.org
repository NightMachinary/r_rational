Some books that come to mind:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20553844-how-to-profit-by-one-s-enemies][How to Profit by One's Enemies]] by Plutarch. A very short yet timeless text that is over 2000 years old.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker][The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]] by Robert Caro. A fascinating portrait of power. From the cover: "Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were - even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could not control him - until he finally encountered, in Nelson Rockefeller, the only man whose power (and ruthlessness in wielding it) equalled his own."

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073079-the-cultural-revolution][The Cultural Revolution: A People's History, 1962-1976]] by Frank Dik√∂tter. How Mao used the Cultural Revolution to manoeuvre his opponents into lose-lose positions. This [[https://twitter.com/Scholars_Stage/status/1084237324748185600][twitter thread]] does the book more justice than my description.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook][The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics]] by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith. Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. Everything else is just bread and circuses. I'd describe this book as Freakonomics for politics.

Fiction:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant?ac=1&from_search=true][The Traitor Baru Cormorant]] by Seth Dickinson. A savant accountant takes on an evil empire from the inside.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/589979.Daughter_of_the_Empire][Daughter of the Empire]] by Raymond Feist. An inexperienced heiress of a suddenly ruined aristocratic family must ensure their survival in an empire that loves power games.
