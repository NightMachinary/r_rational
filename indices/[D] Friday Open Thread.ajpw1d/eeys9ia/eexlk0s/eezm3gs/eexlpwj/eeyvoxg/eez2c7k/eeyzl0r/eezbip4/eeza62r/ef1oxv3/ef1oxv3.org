Seconded. Although it's very dark in several places which ruined those parts for me. Definitely not for the squeamish. The philosophical theme is super fascinating and the reason I read it in the first place. Bakker's writing is top notch. One of the very few portrayals of a "dark rationalist" main character, whose quotes keep ringing in my head from the sheer poetry of it.
