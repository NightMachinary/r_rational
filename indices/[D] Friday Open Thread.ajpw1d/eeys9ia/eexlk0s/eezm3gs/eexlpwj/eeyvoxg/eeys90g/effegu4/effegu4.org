Not really sure where else to ask this:

I prefer to read complete stories, but quite liked the first couple acts of Mother of Learning, back when that was all there was. Without giving away spoilers, do we know about how close we are to the end? I've heard that it's definitely near the end game - has the author given any definite mentions to when it'll be complete?
