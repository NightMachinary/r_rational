You can check Wikipedia for a reading list, but yeah.

In the old classics, you have Tintin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, The Smurfs, Blake and Mortimer, Spirou and Fantasio, the Marsupilami, Gaston Lagaffe, and a bunch of others.

For more recent stuff, you have Lanfeust de Troy, Dungeon, Raghnarok, Lou, Seuls, and these are the mainstream ones that I know off the top of my head.
