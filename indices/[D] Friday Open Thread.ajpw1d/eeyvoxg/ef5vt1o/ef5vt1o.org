  preferably one that handles the Guile Hero vs Manipulative Bastard tropes

"Going Postal" by Terry Pratchett neatly fits into this category (on the fictional side).

The hero - well, the /protagonist/ - is Moist von Lipwig, a con man, a trickster, a double-crosser who swindles and cheats and steals his way through life, until he gets caught and Lord Vetinari offers him a choice between more-or-less honest employment (running the Post Office, which hasn't worked properly in decades) or a sharply truncated life. And then takes steps to make /very/ sure that Moist can't get out of the deal.

The /villain/ of the story is someone who starts out having succeeded where Moist failed, having conned, lied and cheated his way into being both rich and respected, secure that his position is nearly entirely untouchable...
