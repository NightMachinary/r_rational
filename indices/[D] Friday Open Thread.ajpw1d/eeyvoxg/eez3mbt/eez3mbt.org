  Maybe their training regimes could be reverse-engineered to reach the same achievements as them if enough effort and resources were invested.

That'd be cute, do you think people are that stupid that in what? Centuries worth of competition they haven't had the idea to emulate the top people in their fields ?

Anyway on your other point, no there are hard limits to how far you can get with just training. Yes you can get very good with training and effort, but the people at the top are all doing it too, the outcome of this is that people with natural advantages are more likely to win and be at the top at competitions. i.e higher long capacity, height in certain sports, arm length, leg length etc.

It's not necessarily PC or how we'd like things to be, but it is how it is. Olympian medalists for instance tend to have a more similar body structure and characteristics to their competitors than to their own siblings and parents, that's how competitive these things are..
