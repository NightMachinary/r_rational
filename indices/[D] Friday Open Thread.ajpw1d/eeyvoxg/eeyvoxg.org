I've been interested in reading both fictional and non-fictional works that make use of Social Combat, preferably one that handles the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero][Guile Hero]] vs [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard][Manipulative Bastard]] tropes. I'm tired of direct battles and magical/sword fights. Are there any good works you can recommend?

I've read that [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] is a good work of fiction with a manipulative heroine, is that true? Does it handle social combat well? Is it really like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series][House of Cards]]) but with vampires?

On non-fiction, I only know the classics such as:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince][The Prince by Machiavelli]]
- How to make friends and influence people by Andrew Carnegie
- 48 Laws of Power by Green. This one has the caveat that it heavily contradicts itself in some parts so I question it's usefulness.

Are there any other good non-fiction social combat books you could recommend?

Also I've been wondering just how far social combat and guile can take you. Implying you're successful in manipulating someone into giving you a high position at work for example, even if you're very charismatic, if you fail in most of your assignments in a row, it will soon catch up with you.

So, I wonder if characters who invest heavily into social skills at the expense of the rest would really be using an optimal strategy.

This week I've been reading the book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7845157-bounce][Bounce]], and really enjoying how it demystifies the concept of natural genius. It explores geniuses such as Mozart, Newton or more contemporary ones like chess grandmasters and the training they have undergone to achieve "genius" status. It's inspiring to think a person could reach such a level provided enough effort and sacrifice was made. Still, I wonder what are the limits of such a "Theory of Effort" and if it applies to outliers such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong][Kim Ung Yong]].

It also makes one question just how much they sacrificed to reach such a level of mastery and if their stories are correct. Maybe their training regimes could be reverse-engineered to reach the same achievements as them if enough effort and resources were invested.

I've been toying with the idea of a Boku No Hero fanfic about a villain that makes use of guile and careful planning to compete with Deku's brute force approach, with the plot twist that his Quirk is super-strength. The idea would be that he had developed his tactical mindset and guile by reverse engineering smart villain's strategies and using rigorous training to imitate their skills without being naturally gifted himself.

Any fans of [[https://mrgone.rocksolidshells.com/nwod.html][World of Darkness? I've found that the character sheets]] are great to depict almost any character. They show each of the attributes and skills that characters can practice in a measurable manner, with the flexibility of adding more traits if you so wish.

I've found them useful to describe a character for a story, simply adding or subtracting attributes and magic systems, along with allowing to more easily keep track of equipment and progression the character makes through the story.

Finally a question to the community. When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

Do you think there's an advantage to one approach over the other?
