So, I didn't get an extension on my temporary role investigating fatal car crashes (boo!) but that means I am moving my trip to Paris forward, like, a full month (yay!).

So, from ~June to ~November, I'm going to be living in Paris - around the 19e, if anyone in the area wants to be my new best friend. I'm working on my visa application this coming week - I've booked in a 6 month course in a language school.

I'm excited! And terrified.

I've got paid leave from work so my "passive" income will be about 1200 euro a month, but the visa should allow me to work an additional 20 hours a week. It looks like a room in an apartment comes to about 600 euro, so I shouldn't starve to death even if i don't manage to find a job (double yay).

Anyone have any recommendations / suggestions / unsolicited advice?
