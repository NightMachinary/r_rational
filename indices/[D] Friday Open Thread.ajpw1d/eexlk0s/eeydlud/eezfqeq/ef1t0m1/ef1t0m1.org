Wow, huge thank you for the reminder that chocolate contains caffeine!

I recently "quit using all caffeine" and haven't seen any improvements in my urge to sleep. Eating dark chocolate as my late night snack is probably a larger part of that now that I'm not drinking 240-300mg of caffeine daily.

The silver lining is that this encourages me to have the chocolate as my first meal of the day!
