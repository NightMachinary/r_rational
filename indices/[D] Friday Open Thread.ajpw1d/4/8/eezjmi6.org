  When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

I sort of build these out in tandem. For my current work-in-progress, I started with a couple of kernels that I built my world around. I came up with an idea for the antagonist, then got stuck for a while trying to make a protagonist or any kind of plot, or even meaningfully tie together the two different seeds that my worldbuilding was founded from. Eventually, after agonizing brainstorming, I got all of that to click into place, a story idea and character I was excited about, and that formed the basis for an outline. Since then, I've had to simultaneously flesh out the world and the characters as necessary, sometimes tweaking background details in the world to allow for the story I really want. Sometimes, though, characters that started as background or plot really ran away from me and took on their own life, which feels magical. (Usually this happens when I actually start writing them on the page, since before that point, it's too easy to think of them as blank faces pinned to a particular plot function without fleshing them out.)
