Twig has plenty of action scenes but there's also a lot of cloak and dagger type stuff. Sy is very much both of those tropes, to the point where he even candidly calls himself a manipulative bastard a few times.

I don't use a full RPG character sheet, but I have a template with sections for different things like primary trait, motivation, gear, etc. Characterization is really hard for me, so having a step-by-step checklist for the soft stuff helps a lot and the other sections just make sure I have a central reference so I don't mess up continuity.

  When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

I started with an interesting idea: what would The Magicians crossed with Ender's Game look like? From there I just kind of kept picking the "inspect" option on each new idea. For example, Battle School had a single objective (kill the buggers). I decided that my Academy's leaders wanted to take over the world, not because evil, but because they didn't want everyone else to ruin it. That in turn begged the question of why they hadn't already, so I chose to have magic be strong, but not so strong that a group of sorcerers could take on an entire army. That led me to having the Academy be secretive and more interested in political manipulation than direct power. And so on. I didn't get down to characters till the end (ish, since it's still being worked on).
