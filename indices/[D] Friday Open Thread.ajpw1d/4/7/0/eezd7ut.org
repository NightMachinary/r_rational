  That'd be cute, do you think people are that stupid that in what? Centuries worth of competition they haven't had the idea to emulate the top people in their fields ?

That's what I wondered. According to the book, most world class athletes, artists and academics spent an average of 5 years practicing 8 hours daily to reach their genius status. That assuming a good amount of resources and focus is spent and methods are given to motivate them to keep going.

According to the book, most young geniuses simply started at a very young age when their brains had the most plasticity and thus on average only started showing their true talent at 5-10 years old.

I bet there's a genetic component too, it would also be interesting to see how it develops across generations.
