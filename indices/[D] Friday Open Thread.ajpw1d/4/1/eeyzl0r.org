  Finally a question to the community. When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

  Do you think there's an advantage to one approach over the other?

If you're into podcasts, we did two episodes on this for Rationally Writing, [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-21/][Top Down Storytelling]] and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-22/][Bottom Up Storytelling]]. But if you don't have an hour and a half to listen to those:

I usually start from the worldbuilding and then move outward from there, finding themes as I go. This tends to make for a much more naturalistic piece, less tightly plotted, but more believable simply because the world doesn't exist to serve the plot. That said, there's something of an iterative process where I move back and forward between approaches, first making the world, seeing what kinds of plots come from that, and then going back to tweak the world if I think there's not enough room for interesting plots, or if there are more interesting quirks that might come from slight rules changes. Because a world has many parts, this can be a long process of going back and forth, seeing the effects of changes, making tweaks, seeing different effects, looking at possible plots, and going through more iteration.

The advantage of the /other/ approach, doing the story concept first, is that your story can have tighter plotting, less extraneous bits, and hit your themes harder.

(I don't think that one is strictly superior to the other, but I will say that it'll be easier to adhere to [[/r/rational]] standards if you're finding the stories in the world, rather than building the world to suit a story, generally speaking.)
