  When you write original stories,

I don't have a lot of experience, but the reason for the number of stories which take place on Earth (as opposed to someone designing a world) became more apparent after I came up with a story and that was what happened. People interact with this world, and it's familiar, so working with that just takes generating a story and characters, as opposed to also coming up with a world. (It can literally spring from looking at something and going "What If...".) If I end up making it into something I probably will make a different world for it - it requires some things to change, so the background (stuff that happens before the story starts, and out of view of the characters) as well as how people operate needs some work. (A different society, or less atomic culture or something might be required for the number of groups to exist to make the story feasible.)

So you can come up with a story by initially thinking about it taking place on Earth, and then if things diverge too much, I think you can flesh a world around it, and rework it. What easiest or best probably depends on you - there's a story about writing that goes like this: An author wrote a book, and wrote all the fun parts first, but then didn't want to write the rest. They looked through what they'd written, cut the boring parts out, and sent it to the publisher.

I would read that.
