I use [[https://www.amazon.com/Verilux-HappyLight-Lucent-Bright-Therapy/dp/B079YBGPM5/ref=zg_bs_13053141_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VZN33WQ547B69BZ8Z5MT][this one]], a Verilux 10,000 lux LED lamp that's set up next to my computer so that I can use it while I'm surfing reddit (or whatever). It's super simple, which helps make it fairly cheap, and I've been using it for the past two years with okay results. It's hard to tell though, because the interventions for SAD are:

- More sleep
- 300 mcg melatonin at night to regulate sleep
- Vitamin D supplements
- Exercise
- Light therapy

So the relative success of light therapy itself is hard to judge. /Personally/, light therapy gives me a touch of nausea until after I've adjusted to it, so I start with 15 minutes and increase whenever the nausea starts to go away. I'm at an hour now, with no nausea, but the nausea comes back if I skip a few days (as happened with Thanksgiving).
