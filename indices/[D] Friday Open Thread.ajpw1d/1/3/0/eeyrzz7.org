I bought a cheap ($10?) wall timer and plugged my bedside lamp into it. The lamp is a cheap Target one with a low-lumen, warm-temperature LED bulb and a cheap shade. Total cost of the entire kit may have been $50, but I was buying retail for the lamp and shade instead of used.

The lamp turns on at 7:30 a.m., more or less, and my mechanical alarm clock goes off at 8, more or less. It's all very analog.
