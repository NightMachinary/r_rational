From my Audible libaray in the 25 or more range.

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell - regency era style novel about magic coming back - with footnotes! Not very rational but excellently written in a period style.

Anathem - very weird story about cloistered communities of scientists (called mathics). Very good. Very weird. Pretty rational.

The Name of the Wind: The Kingkiller Chronicle, Book 1 - overly competent protagonist tells his story of going through life being overly competent. Features a very well realised magical university. Has flaws but very engaging. Also has squeal. Book three has GRRM syndrome.

The Lies of Locke Lamora - the growing up of a thief/confidence trickster in fantasy Venice. Very good. Has two squeals which are good but don't quite have the same magic.
