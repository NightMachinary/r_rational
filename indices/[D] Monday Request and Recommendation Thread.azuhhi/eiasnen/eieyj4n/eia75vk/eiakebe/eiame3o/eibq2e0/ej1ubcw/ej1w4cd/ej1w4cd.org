I think the quality increases with the later books. I actually liked the last book in the original series more /precisely because/ it was such a departure from the original premise(the last book left me gaping, it was crazy). I can see why some people might have problems with it, though. It went from "reverse portal fantasy with grit" to more of a high concept science fiction. The use of real life political figures as antagonists might also trigger some people, but I'm not american so I don't care.
