It's harder to get the proportions right for humans, which is partially why you see so many "funny animal" comics. When something is wrong with a representation of a human, we're hardwired to notice. I wouldn't be particulalry surprised of the author was a furry, given the subject manner, but, as I said, I think any fetishy stuff has a relatively minimal impact on the writing of the webcomic.

Edit: so I was looking at the sidestories, and have to retract my statements. The comic was definitely written with fetishy reasons in mind. (Still good though)
