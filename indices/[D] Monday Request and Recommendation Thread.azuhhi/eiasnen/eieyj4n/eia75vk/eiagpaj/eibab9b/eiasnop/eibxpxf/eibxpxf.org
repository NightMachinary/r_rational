[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21450/the-power-of-formations][The Power of Formations]], was more fun than I anticipated. Magic school, kid from the sticks, computer science references. The writing is a bit juvenile and such, but it was an enjoyable read for me.

Somewhat related in that it involves puzzles and computer science, [[https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/][Untrusted]] was fun to play through. It is a browser based Interactive Fiction game that uses javascript coding for a series of puzzles. If anyone knows of similar coding puzzle type games, I'd be interested.
