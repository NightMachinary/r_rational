Not quite at Val's level, but [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig's]] Sylvester is a devious social manipulator.

Biopunk universe, where Frankenstein's monster wasn't a novel, but an actual scientific creation. The British Crown snatched that up pretty quickly, poured money into bio research, and conquered large parts of the world. Now, in 1920, Sylvester and his fellow young Experiments must find their place in a world of living superweapons, all-powerful nobility, and mad scientists.

Fair warning, it's a Wildbow work, which means it's fairly dark, fairly long, and good enough you won't want to put it down 'till you're done.
