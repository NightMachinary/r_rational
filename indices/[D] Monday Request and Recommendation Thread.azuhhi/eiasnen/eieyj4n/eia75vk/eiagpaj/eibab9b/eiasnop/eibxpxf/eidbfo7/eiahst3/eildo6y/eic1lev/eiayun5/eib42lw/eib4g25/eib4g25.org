Love Anathem & Name of the Wind. Anathem's one of my favorites, I'd definitely give it a rational tag.

I've tried Strange & Norrell a couple of times and have never been able to get very far, though plenty of people whose tastes I trust have recommended it. How do they do footnotes in the audio format?
