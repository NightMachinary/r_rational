Thanks for reminding me of this book, I'll give it a try. I mostly liked her Ancillary series, it had some great ideas but so-so execution. It was a lot of "that's really cool, but why on earth would it work like that?". Verisimilitude way easier in fantasy than in scifi, so maybe that'll be a better niche for her.
