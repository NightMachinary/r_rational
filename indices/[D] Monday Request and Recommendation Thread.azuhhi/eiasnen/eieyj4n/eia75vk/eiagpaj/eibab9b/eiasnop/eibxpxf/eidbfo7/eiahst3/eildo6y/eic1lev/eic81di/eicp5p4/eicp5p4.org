I admit, the plot is pretty "webcomic-y." In my personal opinion, though, the worldbuilding outweighs that, but I can understand why you'd disagree.

Though with how the MC's transformation is handled, I viewed it as less fetishy and more of an examination of body/gender dysmorphia. If he was happy about the transformation or transformed into something cooler then it would clearly be wish fulfilment, but the guy's a waist high rodent now.
