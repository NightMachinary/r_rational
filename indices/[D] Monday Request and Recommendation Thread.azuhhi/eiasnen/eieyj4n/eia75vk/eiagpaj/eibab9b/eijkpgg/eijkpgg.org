Hardcore History is some excellent narrative history. Dan Carlin tells a story excellently and has some great anecdotes. It's not 100% accurate though, he gets some things wrong, and I wouldn't recommend it if you want deeper knowledge about the topics, his audience is layman about history.

Revolutions by Mike Duncan is excellent more academic history. It's drier than Hardcore History, but it's very accurate and goes through a lot of history.

Hello Internet is great, but I can't really explain why. It's two youtubers(CGP Grey and Brady Haran) just talking about random things like flags, elections, and youtube, but it's hilarious and incredibly interesting.
