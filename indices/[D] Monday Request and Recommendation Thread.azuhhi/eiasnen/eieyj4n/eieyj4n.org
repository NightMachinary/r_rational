I recently found [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB7AzTwc6VFZrBsO2ucBMg/videos][Robert Miles' YouTube channel]], and it has been unexpectedly good. It is the best and most accurate casually-accessible introduction into AI risk concerns that I have seen. I first saw him from Computerphile videos (eg. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDqkCxYYDGk][this one on Logical Induction]]).

In particular, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pUA3LsEaw][Why Not Just: Think of AGI Like a Corporation?]] was very well presented. (I'd also like to cc [[/u/Empiricist_or_not]] to substitute part of a response to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9f06u9/slaughterbots_video/e61lh5c/?context=2][an old comment of his]] that I never ended up writing up.)
