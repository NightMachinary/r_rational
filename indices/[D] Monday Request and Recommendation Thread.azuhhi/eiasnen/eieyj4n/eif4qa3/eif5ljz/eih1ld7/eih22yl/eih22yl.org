This distinction is only meant to aid conversation; it isn't pointing at a fundamental distinction in reality. In contrast I don't think ‘super-machine' or ‘hyper-machine' are likely to be all that useful as classifications.

If I were forced, I'd posit that a machine was super-machine relative to another class of machines iff it was better at the task than the best of the latter class, and hyper-machine iff it was so much better that no quantity of the lesser machine provided even modest competition. A GPU might be a supermachine at rasterization relative to CPUs, but it would not be a hypermachine.
