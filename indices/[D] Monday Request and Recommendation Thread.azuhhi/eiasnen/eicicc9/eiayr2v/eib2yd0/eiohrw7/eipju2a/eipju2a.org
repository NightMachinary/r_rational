Sanderson's /Steelheart/ is pretty good. Interesting premise anyway, and the main villain is definitely rational, though it doesn't come into play til the end. It's pretty depressing, but not nearly as bad as Worm

Delphic gets posted here pretty often. I got bored after book 1 but it's well-written and the MC is smart.
