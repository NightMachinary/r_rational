Too popular for me. I prefer the more obscure, little-known stories like Mother of Learning.

Also, did you know that Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality was based on a niche novel series titled "Harry Potter"? It's true! The fanfic caused a dozen or so sales of the book before everyone went back to reading HPMOR. I heard rumors that The Metropolitan Man was also based on something but I don't think anybody knows what it is.
