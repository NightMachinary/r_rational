It is still mostly a character-oriented book. It takes some (again really cool!) ideas, and doesn't really question 'how would this come around', but instead takes it for granted and looks at 'how would this make people behave'.

In this book: gods only speak truth. Not because they are omniscient; instead whatever they say becomes truth (or they die / stop being gods).
