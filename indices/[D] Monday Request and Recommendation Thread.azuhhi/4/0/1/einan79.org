Adding onto this suggestion, I'd recommend CGP Grey's other podcast, [[https://www.relay.fm/cortex][Cortex]], cohosted by Myke Hurley. It's been described by them as a sort of lunchtime discussion about productivity, which I feel is fairly accurate. Both of them talk about various things related to their own careers, in particular how they work and why they make the choices that they do. It's not always /rational/ per se (Grey says repeatedly that he is more productive if a robot in his house is working while he is trying to write, for example), but I still feel that it's the kind of podcast that a lot of people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would appreciate more than Hello internet. Both keep a similar jovial tone, they just bring up different sorts of topics.
