- Sanderson's Stormlight and Mistborn books are generally >25 hrs. Mistborn is probably the most rational fantasy series.

- Bank's Algebraist which has a interesting deep time human similar gas giant species is just under 25 hrs.

- The second 2 books in the Three body problem trilogy (The Dark Forest and Deaths End) are 22 and 29 hours respectively

- The mote in God's eye is classic Niven about evolution and is 20 hrs

Stuff you might like but might not like:

- A lot of Alistair Reynolds is 20+ hrs but they are kinda weak after the transhumanism and posthumans whoo.

- Kim StanleyRobinson's Mars books are all 20+ hours and they are good potential future histories but they can drag on.

- Heinlein's Time enough for love is penultimate capstone and basically has 3 or four novels jammed together with some interesting philosophy, if you already like Heinlein you'll like it if you don't like him you won't.
