There's a fan-made [[http://audioworm.rein-online.org/][audiobook]] for [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], one of this subreddit's favourite webnovels.

I also strongly recommend [[https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/][We've Got Worm]], a podcast where two authors analyze Worm arc by arc. It honestly adds a lot to the experience.
