A hiker has a Tardis look-alike grafted to him, and is kicked off of his native earth. Deciding to become an emperor, he finds an uninhabited earth, buys and frees some slaves, and starts ransacking old battlefields for tech to reproduce. Eventually, he gets into a fight with the Kromagg Empire, from the show Sliders.
