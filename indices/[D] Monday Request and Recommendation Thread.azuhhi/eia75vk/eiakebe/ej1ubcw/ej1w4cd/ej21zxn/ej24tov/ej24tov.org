Yeah, there is a lull in the middle, IIRC. It's been a while since I've read it, but I remember it was a bit of a slog. I can't even remember what the problem was, which is telling. I only persevered because I'm a fan of Stross.

And it's kind of a mixed bag on the heavy handed-ness. On the one hand, I don't think he uses the names of the politicians, though it's very obvious who they are, and they do some very over the top stuff (plausible to me, but who knows). On the other hand, it's a very short sequence at the climax of the last book, so not the focus of the novels at all. It's no [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(Card_novel)][Empire]].
