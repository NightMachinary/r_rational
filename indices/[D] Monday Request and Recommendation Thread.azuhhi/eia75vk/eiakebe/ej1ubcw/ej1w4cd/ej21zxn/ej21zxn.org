Well I tend to like SciFi more than fantasy (generally, not universally), so it sounds like I might fall a little more in line with you. The main critique I can remember though applied mostly to the middle books which I heard dragged on a bit. I was envisioning a sort of "Wheel of Time" syndrome where the middle 1/3rd of the series could be removed and the whole thing would be improved. Was that your impression, or no? The political figures thing /probably/ won't annoy me unless it gets too preachy/heavy handed. I tend to think both sides of american politics over-react to things so if some particular real life political figure is just ABSOLUTELY THE WORST THING AND CLEARLY EVIL, as opposed to "our goals aren't aligned and therefore we are in conflict with each other", it will probably push my buttons a bit, but I'm sure I'll be able to deal.
