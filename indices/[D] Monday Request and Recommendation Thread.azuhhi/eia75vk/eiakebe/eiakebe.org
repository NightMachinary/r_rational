Can you give a pitch for Cruel to be Kind? The premise seems interesting.

The first thing I can think of regarding your request is The Merchant Princes by Charles Stross. *VAGUE MILD SPOILERS*: It starts off not quite like you're asking for, and by the last book it is exactly what you're asking for.
