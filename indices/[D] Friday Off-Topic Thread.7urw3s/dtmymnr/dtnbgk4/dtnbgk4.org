All my tips assume you're just playing casually (i.e., with some friends on friday evening) and in-person, as opposed to online against professionals or people who want to be professional.

It's pretty common for people to make riskier bets the longer the game goes on. Especially if they have very few chips left. At some point, people just want the game to end. That means that big bets late game are more likely to be bluffs (or at least not correspond so much to the actual quality of an opponent's hand), and also that opponents are more likely to call bluffs late game. Be aware that you'll have the same inclinations. Be as thrifty with your cash when you've doubled your starting amount as when you've halved it.

An excellent tactic is to ask someone close to being out of chips /exactly/ how many chips they have left, to imply that you're considering kicking them out of the game. Whether that's a bluff or a double bluff depends on your hand and their personality.

Don't heedlessly chase flushes. You might think "there's four clovers in play already, which means that there's a 1/4 chance of getting another in the next card." That is, of course, false. At least 4 of 12 clovers are out of contention, plus however many your opponents hold in their hands. If you think an opponent is chasing the same flush as you, then it is rather unlikely that either of you will get it. That being said, you have the best chance at a flush when you have two of a suit in hand, two of that suit are on the table, and you think your opponents aren't going for the flush. Alternatively, if you have one of a suit, and there are three of that suit on the table, and someone folds /after/ the third of the suit shows up, that means it's very likely that both their cards are off-suit, improving your chances..

The more players on the table, the better the best hand will be. With 2-4 players, you'll see a lot of best hands that are high card/pair. With 5-7 players, you'll see a fair number of three-ofs, straights, and flushes. I've never played with more than 7 players, and I don't think it's particularly feasible. So if you're playing with more people, be more willing to fold, even at a loss.

If you win after everyone folds, /never/ show your hand. In fact, never show your hand except when you have to. Don't talk about what's in it, even after the fact, unless you intend to lie. You need to create doubt over how responsive you are to the state of your own hand.

Try to establish a fake tell. It'll need to be pretty obvious to work against amateurs, and it'll only help a bluff work once (unless you're /really/ good at acting, and won't advertise the fact that it was a bluff after everyone folds). But oh boy will it be a satisfying bluff.
