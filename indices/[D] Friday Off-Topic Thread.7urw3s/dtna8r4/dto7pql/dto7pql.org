I agree that I've definitely seen these qualities a lot in works I'd consider rational-adjacent, and they're at least a pretty good predictor of things that I would enjoy.

I'm thinking about the difference between the presence of com/bat/ vs. the presence of con/flict/, and while I do think that the difference is a factor I can't articulate why. Is it something about fight scene choreography? something about physical power, as opposed some other kind of power or control? Is it just something that flows naturally from the kinds of settings that the works take place in?

Also, would it be accurate to paraphrase the second element as "not earthfic?"
