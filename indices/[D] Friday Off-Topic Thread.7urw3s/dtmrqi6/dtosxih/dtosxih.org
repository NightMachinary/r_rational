Calibration charts are useful and commonly used. If you want a single number, compare your actual Bayes score (log probability assigned to correct answer, aka cross-entropy, a common loss function) with the entropy of your prediction (which is its expected Bayes score). If your score is much less than the expected score, then your predictions are overconfident.
