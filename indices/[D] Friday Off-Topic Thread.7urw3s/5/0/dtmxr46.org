I tend to have a similar response with Japanese media in general. My best guess is that this occurs because there's a slight delay between hearing/reading and understanding what's going on. So I focus more on the emotion of the voices first and then focus on the content of what they're saying.

Whereas in your native language, you kind of have to hear the emotion of what they're saying and the words themselves at the same exact time. Also the fact that we're (generally) unfamiliar with the words that are being said in Japanese makes them feel more novel than similar words said in English. We can't really tell if something is trite and overdone instinctively by hearing it in Japanese.

Also the Japanese voice actors have direct access to the original directors of the story and I imagine that makes a difference in their performances at times.

But that's just my guess for why Japanese stuff tends to affect me emotionally more.
