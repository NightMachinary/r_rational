You pose some good points.

I think definitely when it comes to dialogue, subs can make me forget how corny what someone is saying is.

Hearing something like "Everybody let's do our best!" sounds much lamer in English than hearing "Ganbatte Mina-san!" in Japanese and reading the same thing.

Though I think for me personally it's a bit more confusing because I actually do understand a lot of Japanese (I'd say I'm around an intermediate level of understand) so while I'm reading subtitles I'm also listening out for what the characters are actually saying. It kinda muddles the waters for me.
