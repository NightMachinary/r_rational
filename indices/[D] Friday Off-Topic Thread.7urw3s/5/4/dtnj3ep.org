In my experience it really depends on the specific sub or dub. I can more readily think of emotionally moving Japanese examples, but that is probably because subs make a larger pool to draw from. I found the penultimate scenes in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be more moving in English. Planetes seemed different but equally compelling in both languages. I struggle to take Shinji seriously in any version of Evangelion....

I'd probably link to the language I prefer, watch it in both languages just to check, and put in a note if I still felt uncertain after seeing both. It can't be helped that the voice acting varies by series and by language.

I'm very interested in the post you want to write.
