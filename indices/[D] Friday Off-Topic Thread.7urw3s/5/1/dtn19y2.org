I usually watch with subs, because that's what the majority of anime have available, and even when dubs are available, they're sometimes trash. Still, there have been a number of times that I've found dubbed anime emotionally moving (/Your Lie in April/, /Your Name/, lots of the Ghibli stuff), and I don't /think/ there's much of a difference for me.
