I wouldn't say I /cried/, but it's still one of the most emotionally impactful scenes in the series for me and, from what I've heard, they changed basically nothing about the scene between versions. Dubs are the default for me because I find listening to and reading dialogue to be very different experiences, but that might have something to do with being autistic.

The only anime so far where I willingly switched from dub to sub was School-Live! since I found Yuki's voice grating, though I've liked the actress in other roles, but found that the subtitles led me to focus more on the direction and visual storytelling that I hadn't appreciated before. The dialogue was suddenly as simple as it needed to be.

I switched to the sub of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because the dub for Stardust Crusaders is incomplete and, for all of the dub's awkward line delivery, I find the subtitles a bit distracting from the gonzo visuals. I also can't tell if the Japanese voice actors are hamming it up the way the Americans were so I'm laughing less while watching it, even if the “engrish” cracks me up.

So I think there are circumstances where dubs and subs can both be superior experiences, though I'm only willing to go through the effort of trying both if I think I'm missing out due to the way dialogue is delivered. I don't think I would've enjoyed One Punch Man's snappy deadpan in Japanese or Blend S's 4-panel-style gags in English (the former is much funnier FYI).
