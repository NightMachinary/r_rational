Spoiler tags, please.

How you count a cliffhanger depends on how you count plot threads. IMO, it's a cliffhanger if you leave a plot thread without a proper resolution, but that's expected for all but the last installment of any serial. In the case of /Dark State/, I expected one or two of the ongoing plot threads to not be resolved so that there would be something continuing on into /Invisible Sun/ -- halfway through the book, I thought those two would probably be 1) [[#s][]] and 2) [[#s][]], since those are two of the major throughlines started in /Empire Games/.

The [[#s][]] plotline is now divergent from [[#s][]], because those look very much like they'll have different resolutions (and I don't count [[#s][]] separately because they're very likely to have the /same/ resolution).

Other than the ones you listed, the other two I count are the [[#s][]], which I didn't expect to be wrapped up in this book, and [[#s][]], which ends on such a textbook cliffhanger (character being asked an important, defining question whose answer we're not given) that it annoyed me (plus bringing in the somewhat contrived, IMO [[#s][]] as a new plot thread right at the very end).

I think what irritated me most about /Dark State/ was how the few things that got resolved had several complications stemming from them, which undercut the joy of that resolution. It's a middle book, and middle books in a trilogy aren't /supposed/ to resolve everything, but this book hardly gave anything in the way of closure before it ended -- at best, it did "these conflicts are now in another phase".
