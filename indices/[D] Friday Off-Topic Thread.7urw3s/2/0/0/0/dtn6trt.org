Oops. Fixed now. Also, you've attached yours to blank text boxes, which might be intentional, but is not easy to read.

Anyway,

I wouldn't expect 1 or 2 to have been resolved in /Dark State/ at all. The question the trilogy as a whole is focused on is "how does the NAC develop into a stable, functional democracy and engage with the US on its own terms". Resolving [[#s][1]] and [[#s][2]] is the thematic through-line for the trilogy as a whole -- it's not really fair to call those a "cliffhanger" any more than its fair to say "the Empire still exists at the end of /The Empire Strikes Back/ was a "cliffhanger". Although looked at that way, it is kind of weird that [[#s][3]]).

I think it's possible that [[#s][spoiler]] has a different resolution from [[#s][spoiler]], but it probably has the same/a related resolution as [[#s][spoiler]].

[[#s][spoiler]] sure, but that's the core character arc, which gets resolved in the third act. I think the issue is that [[#s][spoilers]].
