  this one ends on no less than six different cliffhangers
#+end_quote

Is it really six? I count:

[[#s][Cliffhangers]]

I don't think you can get to six unless you're counting the different parts of the [[#s][A Cliffhanger]] (frankly, I think 1 and 2 arguably count as a single plot thread).

The thing that bothered me was [[#s][Plothole]]
