More details later, but short version:

I turned a billion seconds old at 11:28 PM. To celebrate, I more or less invited EVERYONE, and cooked food, and happiness and amazingness was had.

In "planning" this, I'd think sometimes, "Oh. Will this person and that person get along?", and then I'd think: "Fuck it. This is a once in a lifetime thing. Shit'll pass." But, nothing came of that worry; everything was fantastic.

In other words, the moral of the story is: Crossing the streams results in great success.
