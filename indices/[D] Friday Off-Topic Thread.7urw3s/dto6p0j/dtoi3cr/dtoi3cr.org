Sweet bejeebus am I an extrovert. I'm absolutely /wired/ from having done that; it's like that bit in Sonic the Hedgehog where you stay in one place and just spin faster.

It was really nice the few moments where I was basically a fly on the wall, putzing around the kitchen but eavesdropping on the conversational hubbub. It's not like that's usually a thing you get to do.

Another really nice bit was just how amazing it was to get the different friend groups interacting; I'm not sure things reached proper peak mayhem (when the existing social groups break down and every one meets new people like they were old friends), but there was /a lot/ of cross-pollination regardless. For me it was a giant "I was there when you met!" moment, for them it was meeting people from ridiculously different walks of life.
