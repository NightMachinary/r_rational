I've been on medication to deal with my ADHD since 3rd grade, I can tell you that how much your quality of life improves depends a lot on the medication. I swear by Stratera - it's always worked the best for me, but it's difficult to manage if you're the forgetful type like I am. One type of medication I recently tried to switch to is Vyvanse, but it makes me paranoid and when I'm on it, I tend to bring that paranoia into my decision-making.

The effects of each medicine vary from person to person, but if you find one that works for you it can be a real life-saver. I went from an almost-failing student to wildly successful when I started taking my medication, but after years of taking it the influence is more subtle.
