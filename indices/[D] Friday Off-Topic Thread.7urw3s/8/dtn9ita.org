I'm finally doing something about my inability to focus on long-form cognitive tasks (most notably, writing) and getting evaluated for ADHD on Monday. It's a psychometric called the Quotient ADHD system; anyone know anything about it? theunitofcaring's tumblr post at the end of last year about the experience of going on medication was really encouraging, and despite the fact that I know not to expect a panacea, I'm still /hoping/ for a quality of life improvement.

Depression continues to kick my ass, though. Paths to long-term life goals seem obscured and unlikely, and given the state of the world it's unclear that I even /should/ pursue the goal of having children. Rationaltumblr is full of proud parents blogging about it, so that's weak evidence it's a worthwhile goal regardless, but honestly the true reason driving me is "I don't know what Large Thing I'd do with my life otherwise." A highschool friend of mine connected to the rationalist community killed herself the other week, which, while not driving me to suicidal-ness myself, is at least forcing me to spend a lot of time thinking about it and what would drive one there.

The Honor Harrington series of space opera is unreasonably sprawling and slow-moving at this point, but I picked up the latest book of the side series /Manticore Ascendant/ this week and /really/ liked it. I am now way more invested in this side series and its crew than I am in the main plotline.
