I highly doubt they would prefer to modify it. I think you'd have to actually do the experiment because, why would they ever even think to do that? I certainly wouldn't have thought to do that in an equivalently reversed case - would you ever suddenly decide it was time to watch Game of Thrones in Japanese, or even considered that as a choice? Also I suspect this is going to vary by reading fluency - If the general population liked reading subtitles better it would already be a thing - but it's not, because I think unlike people who hang out on internet forums such as this one most people don't actually read much faster than the spoken word. And if they're anglophone anime lovers they're also people who appreciate "foreign" things. I think you'd have to find people who fit some very, very specific demographic characteristics to do any real investigation on the question of whether some people liking subs over dubs is due to those people liking subs inherently vs those people finding dubs inadequate as translations.
