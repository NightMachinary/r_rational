I agree with this, though I think it's worth discussing whether subtitles can prevent the viewer from noticing or caring about elements they would otherwise view as shortcomings.

[[https://youtu.be/BvnsxCv8NLo][Explanation Point]] gave an example of how he assumed Attack on Titan had a lot more depth than he could pick up on, until he watched the dub and found the story and characters as bland as they appeared.

I can personally attest to how I found the comedic timing to be completely off in the Azumanga Diaoh dub, to the point where I thought it was some experimental artistic style, until I read the original comic strip.

However, when I watched Blend S subbed, another 4-koma adaptation, I was laughing at jokes that were awkwardly drawn out because my eyes moved back and forth from the subtitles at the right pace.

Digibro has [[https://youtu.be/R1zhW9lAIeY][talked]] about something like this [[https://youtu.be/zIVHXhbRrgs][twice]] in the context of shonen manga adaptations, where using the panels as a straight storyboard can reduce the impact of the imagery and dialogue.

This is probably something that varies from person to person based on personal preference and cultural expectations, I've heard dubs actually tend to have better lip-syncing, but I still think it's worth talking about.
