I once heard Geoff from Mother's Basement mention how learning some Japanese helped him enjoy the comedic timing in Konosuba, which may have kept me from enjoying every joke since I definitely didn't laugh as much as he did.

At the same time, I've also gotten more used to corny dialogue since I watched Gurren Lagaan dubbed just as I was coming out of a really bad depression. A lot of the time I need silly escapism with recognizable archetypes learning a simple lesson in a goofy scenario to help ground me.
