Yes to all this, that's pretty much my understanding of it too. I'm just curious to know to what degree it effects others the same way.

It probably matters less for stories that are less vocally emotional too: like there wasn't a lot of shouting or crying in Cowboy Bebop, it relied more on the setting and music to communicate its tone, so the english dubs never really came off as trite or overdone.
