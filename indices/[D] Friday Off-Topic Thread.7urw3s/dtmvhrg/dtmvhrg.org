Does anyone here cry to anime that's dubbed, who watches both subbed and dubbed anime?

I want to write a post about certain scenes in fiction that have made me cry, two of which are anime scenes, and link to them, but I don't know whether I should specifically suggest/"restrict" viewers to the Japanese audio/english subtitles.

Despite growing up on anime that was dubbed in English (some of which /did/ have good voice acting), for the past few years I've found that I can barely stand English dubbed anime: the japanese voice actors not only seem able to inject far more emotion into their voices (specifically, they can do it without sounding cheesy to my foreign ears), but the written translation is often far better than the rewritten lines of dialogue, to me.

(This is not universally true, sometimes the dubbed dialogue is better, or just more clear in what's being communicated, but in my spot-check of emotional or important moments through the anime I've watched lately, it seems to be the case)

But if there are others here who have seen, say, the second episode of My Hero Academia and cried at the end like I did, but instead watched it with English dubs, then maybe it's just me and I don't have to worry so much about this.
