I just finished /Dark State/ by Charles Stross, which is the second book in the second cycle of the Merchant Princes series. It's the middle book in the series, and while middle books in a trilogy are always a bit weak, this one ends on no less than /six/ different cliffhangers, which should be a crime. The final book is already written and slated for publication in a year, so that's not as bad as it could be, but my experiences with print publication have left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth -- I'm starting to think that it's just an inferior method of publishing serial works, but at the same time, serial works are some of the best sellers (for the same reasons that Hollywood does reboots, sequels, adaptations, etc.).
