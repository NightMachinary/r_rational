*What makes a work rational-adjacent?*

All works that are rationalist are rational. All works that are rational are of interest to the rational fiction community (at least in theory.) But there exist a large segment of works that are of interest to the rational fiction community in general that aren't strictly rational or rationalist. We call these works "rational-adjacent."

I think I've identified a few qualities that make a work rational-adjacent, even despite the fact that they definitely don't qualify as rational.

The most important, by far, is that the work must be driven by *Character Agency*. That being the ability for character to make their own decisions, based off their own goals, wants, needs, and personality. This is very similar to tenet #1, and that's not a coincidence. Rational/ist fiction, since the days of HPMOR and lesswrong, has been fundamentally empowering. Main characters typically struggle against entropy, death, irrationality, the Social Order ^{TM,} or what-have-you. And while the main character isn't always expected to /succeed/, the basic contract of many rational works is that a reader can expect the choices of the characters (main or otherwise) to matter. The author won't have Fate running everything behind the scenes, and if the story is a Shaggy Dog story, it's because the characters has explicitly coordinated to make it so.

That contract is reflected with rational-adjacent works, and to an extent, even magnified. Character actions are guaranteed to matter, even if they probably shouldn't be. Take Isekai works, for example. Very, very few are rational, but they still get a fair bit of traction in [[/r/rational]] because (at least according to my theory), among other things, it's gratifying to watch a character who has the ability to affect significant change on the world around them. Even if (especially if) the plot revolves around their fate to be hugely influential people, and they have plot armor defending them from fatal consequences.

As an example, I recall mooderino's [[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/5288/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis][How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis]] getting some traction here, despite being pretty explicitly non-rational. Because H---B is heavily driven by the decisions made by the main character, we put away our "not sufficiently rational" glasses.

Character Agency even helps soften the impact of works violating rules #2 and #3 of rational fiction. It's less irritating for a character to act irrational, apply their knowledge unintelligently, luck into solving their problems, and be driven by less-than-perfectly-convincing motivations so long as, from the perspective of the reader, it seems like the /character/ is doing these things, as opposed to the author making the character do these things to support some element of the plot.

Look at Coil from /Worm/. He's pretty much straight megalomaniacal douchebag, what with the [[#s][spoilers]] thing and the [[#s][spoilers]] thing. But it's not /Wildbow/ that makes Coil a douchebag; that's all on him. He makes the explicit decision to be a not-nice guy, and that's OK. Worm is rational-adjacent because of (among other reasons) the fact that this is how all the characters operate. They're not all smart, they're not all rational, but they're still making decisions for themselves. (Well, except for that one time...)

The second important element must be that the setting of the world must have *non-real-world setting mechanics*. That is, stuff like magic, or futuretech. I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7mvsux/d_rationalist_fiction_that_takes_place_in_the/drxftmr/][earlier]] arguing that rational fiction with a real-world setting is redundant because nothing simulates the real world better than itself. Rational-adjacent fiction, not being as constrained as rational fiction, can in theory have a real-world setting, but I don't think I've ever seen real-world fiction being discussed by [[/r/rational]].

Part of that is simply the fact that real-world fiction just tends to be discussed elsewhere, part of it is that it's immersion-breaking for most real-work protagonists to have full character agency (How do they have so much time and money? Do they not pay taxes? Are they trust-fund babies? What?), but a lot of it simply stems from the initial conditions of the rational-work fandom. We're predisposed to like fantasy and sci-fi works anyways, and as a community that contains a lot of would-be munchkins, it's a lot more fun to watch someone mess with a ruleset that hasn't had all of its low-hanging fruit taken.

And these setting mechanics don't necessarily have to meet rule #4. As readers, we want to know enough to munchkin them; self-consistency is much less of a requirement.

I wanted to put another big section here, but I realized that that was just my inclination to have at least 3 items to make a list. There are other elements likely to make a work rational-adjacent, but they're less important. Here's a list of the ones I thought of:

- Presence of violence/combat in plot (empowerment)
- Reasonably small core group of characters, relative to work length (increases the ability for each character to have character agency.)
- One overarching plot, as opposed to more episodic arcs. The overarching plot doesn't necessarily need to be obvious at the start of the work, so long as it's obvious at the end. (I'm not actually sure why this is true.)
- Main character has scientific/technical background. (Self-insert potential, mostly.)
- Work is online serial fiction. (Technically not anything to do with rational-adjacency, but accessibility makes us a lot more likely to discuss it.)

Does anyone else have anything to add/disagree with?
