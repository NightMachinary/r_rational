Semi-pro poker player here.

The most important concepts are pot odds (and all its implications for poker theory), bankroll management, preflop hand selection (you should be folding most hands, and raising with the very best hands -- you should call much much less often than most players do). Also very important is understanding the two major reasons to bet (bluff and value bet).
