The plan is breaking his arm , which it's les likely to backfire.the becoming very ill part it's the more dangerous one ( I can't think any way to do it that isn't dangerous like consuming sublethal levels of poison ). I saw some similar ideas somewhere last week but I can't remember where. The fact that mama doesn't seem to have though they could do that is really suspicious , especially nothing prevents them from telling all the other children the truth if mama ends up shipping them , so I' m wondering what is her plan .
