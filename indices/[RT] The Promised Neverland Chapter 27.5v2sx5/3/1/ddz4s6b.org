I think it's possible that mama won't reveal that norman escaped and will lie to her superiors . Anyway it's not really necessary, Norman could breack his arm and consume subletal leves of poison to prevent mama from shipping him in time.their plan is riskier than that but it gives them an enormous advantage , it's possible that the demons will put more guards , but then they would have to ensure the guards can be seen from any high point in the farm , and it is probably expensive to have guards or they would already have them,so I think it's more probable that they will just add more humans to watch them ( which can't be that expensive since they killed crone).
