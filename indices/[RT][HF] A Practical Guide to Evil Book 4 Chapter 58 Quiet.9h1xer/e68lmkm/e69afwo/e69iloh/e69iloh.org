I don't think the drow are anything close to a match for the dwarfs. From their perspective, this entire mission is just expensive pest cleaning from a strategic location so that one of their real enemies (DK) can be contained. So if someone comes along and says "hey I'll take these pests off your hands" then I think they'd be totally fine with it.

Assuming of course, /Akua's/ theory is correct...
