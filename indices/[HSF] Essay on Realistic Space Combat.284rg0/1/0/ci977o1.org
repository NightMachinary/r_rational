  I can't help but wonder about something like a rail gun ... if the munition was cold it wouldn't turn up on IR

It won't be cold. A rail gun involves completing a circuit using your projectile. This generates A LOT of heat in the projectile. And even if you could somehow dump that heat before it left the barrel, that heat will still be visible by your target (just like everything else) and have a characteristic that screams "rail gun." At that point it's just more college math to figure out its trajectory and not be there. Without onboard course correction, dumb projectiles are trivial to avoid in space.
