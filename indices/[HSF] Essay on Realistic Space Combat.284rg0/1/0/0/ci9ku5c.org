My understanding is far from complete but wouldn't a coil gun release a cold projectile? They don't pass current through the projectile like a rail gun does.

And while dumb projections are trivial to avoid in space if you're firing a single lump couldn't a scattered shot have a far larger area of effect? I'm imagining a large lump that breaks down into, say, pea sized lumps once it reaches a certain proximity. Even if only one submunition hits the target it'll still be devastating at the speeds they're talking about.

And yes, before you object, I am aware of just how vast space is and how accurate you'd still need to be. Just kicking ideas about.
