  Aluminium only has a reflectivity of 90-95% at visible wavelengths

Your laser now has to be 10 to 20 times stronger than you intended. The heat sink I need to dissipate your laser's beam just shrank to one tenth or one twentieth its normal size.

And of course I don't have to use aluminum. It was a figure of speech. The spacefaring warmonger will of course have the most reflective missiles science can produce, since the cost of a missile is insignificant compared to the cost of the ship it sinks. Meaning the missile will be better at or as good at deflecting lasers as the mirror at the back of your weapon's lasing chamber is, which also solves the ultraviolet problem in the same stroke. You can't make a beam powerful enough to blow up the missile without blowing the ass off your own laser gun. All I have to do is buy the same mirror you use in your laser, and put it on my missile.

  There is no way you are going to be able to accurately redirect incoming laser weaponry against the originating craft, if that's what you mean by "surrendered to them the targeting control".

Me personally, oh probably not. My targeting computer however is really good at it. It can see your velocity and acceleration quite clearly and knows where you'll be with trivial calculations it can do in the time between when it sees your laser turret turning towards me and when the beam actually makes contact.
