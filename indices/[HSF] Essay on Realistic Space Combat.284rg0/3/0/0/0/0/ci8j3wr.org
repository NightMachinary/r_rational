  You use the better material, it might be heavier, or significantly more expensive.

Still trivial compared to the cost of the ship killed.

  My laser turret only needs one mirror assembly that, compared to the many missiles each needing these defenses.
#+end_quote

So just the one missile your laser is aiming at.

#+begin_quote
  Your missile needs this mirror on every part of the missile that is reasonably vulnerable to attack.
#+end_quote

So just the one, on the front.

#+begin_quote
  but any sort of lead or lag pursuit vector is going to expose the side of the missile to the target.
#+end_quote

No it isn't. I can turret the mirror just as easily as you can turret your laser. We don't have to be aerodynamic about this. There's not really going to be any side-chase. You're either going to turn and run from the missile and I'm going to fly up your ass, and whichever of us has the best ability to cover distance over the time to impact will win, or I'm going to have it fly straight up your nose. At the ranges we're talking about, there is only really "towards" and "away" as directions.

#+begin_quote
  The rest
#+end_quote

You raise significant points regarding sensors and aiming, and I'll counter only halfheartedly that it's a lot harder to target a small specific area like the sensor of a missile, than it is to target "whatever area" on a massive warship. But as far as expenditures of energy, I think you're entirely wrong there. It's hilariously easier to wave a mirror than to generate a laser cutting beam hot enough to punch through silver and then also heat up a missile to premature detonation so you can change course and evade its debris. Aiming the laser back at you is just gravy on the top of 95% or more of your expended effort amounting to literally nothing. But of course, you would have your own mirrors, to protect you from exactly the same kinds of lasers you're aiming at me.
