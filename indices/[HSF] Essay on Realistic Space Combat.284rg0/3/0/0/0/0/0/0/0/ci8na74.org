  On the back. It's just the faintest of shutters that very slightly divert the expulsion of the main engine. I don't need much in the way of attitude thrusters.

I probably should have put an 'etc' after that. I agree, you put the thrusters on the back. But there are a bunch of design decisions that have to be considered and in some cases performance aspects might be compromised to improve defence.

  You aren't going to be juking, no.

That was specifically with regard to lasers (or ballistic weapons).

  I'm not saying there's only going to be one missile, I'd want to fire one missile for each point defense laser you had, plus one. And I'd want to mirror/armor them only enough to stop your burn.

Sure. There is a balance to be struck between how many missiles you need versus how long each missile can withstand point defence.

Regarding your design, fair enough.
