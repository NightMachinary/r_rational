  Where do you put the attitude thrusters so that they aren't vulnerable?
#+end_quote

On the back. It's just the faintest of shutters that very slightly divert the expulsion of the main engine. I don't need much in the way of attitude thrusters. You aren't going to be juking, no. Not until after you kill the missile and then have to dodge the debris. You're a massive spaceship. You can probably out delta-v me, and that is how you'd dodge the missile, by burning your significantly greater fuel reserve until you had a higher final velocity. My missile would fall short as its faster acceleration burned up more of its delta-v. If it were launched from too far away, you'd have time to get up to its delta-v. If you kill it, it's done accelerating, and you would then have a smaller final delta-v for evasion, or could move out of its path.

I'm not saying there's only going to be one missile, I'd want to fire one missile for each point defense laser you had, plus one. And I'd want to mirror/armor them only enough to stop your burn.

Let's drop the reflecting-your-laser-back-at-you aspect entirely. The design I have in mind now is a lot simpler. These missiles are shaped like long needles. They have a lot of surface area, and a very small cross section from your vantage point. Rather than having a blunt head, they have a sharp cone. Your laser hits head-on, and spreads across the entire surface area of the missile, reflecting outwards and backwards at a very shallow angle. This is both my defense and my heat sink. Each square inch of my surface is at a steep angle to your laser and receives very little energy from it. Most of that is reflected away. The rest heats me, and is hopefully radiated away. The longer I can make my missile without it breaking in half when it tries to turn, the less energy you can put on it with your point defense, and the more energy absorbed by it it would take to kill it due to the faster rate it radiates away heat.
