I think you're missing the main advantage a ship has: thermal mass and a cooling system. The laser powers are most likely calculated including the 90% reflectivity of the target. The problem is that even 10% of a 100MW laser is a lot of power. The laser turret copes by having an active cooling system that dumps the heat into coolant. A missile cannot afford the same weight. Instead you use an ablative material as mentioned in the article. Ideally you do both, using an ablative with high albedo (it won't wear evenly enough to bother trying to aim at anything so we don't have to worry about specularity) I've worked with lab lasers that will set Al foil on fire and these are simple benchtop things.
