  It was a figure of speech.

Sure. You use the better material, it might be heavier, or significantly more expensive. You might have to be more careful launching the missile so as to not damage the surface.

  All I have to do is buy the same mirror you use in your laser, and put it on my missile.

That sounds heavy. My laser turret only needs one mirror assembly that, compared to the many missiles each needing these defenses. Your missile needs this mirror on every part of the missile that is reasonably vulnerable to attack.

Maybe you only put it on the nose of the missile, which seems like a reasonable compromise for a head on vector, but any sort of lead or lag pursuit vector is going to expose the side of the missile to the target. What about the missile's sensor suite?

Yes, you can make a missile impervious to laser defenses, but at the cost of making your missiles more massive or expensive.

  My targeting computer however is really good at it.

I obviously didn't mean that humans would be doing the targeting. To put it in similar terms to your response above, it is going to be something like an order or two of magnitude more difficult to accurately redirect an arbitrary incoming laser than it is to target it in the first place.

Consider - first, where is the laser targeting your craft? Am I, the opposing combat AI going to target reflective or armoured surfaces? No, I'll target sensors, radiators, thrusters, communications. How do you propose to place a (highly reflective, non scattering) mirror in the way of my laser? Am I going to be a non-jinking target? Against any sort of laser or ballistic weapon, I'm going to be making constant adjustments to thrust just to throw out such calculations. Obviously those calculations are harder when you have to also factor in the weapon you're trying to direct is under your opponent's control.

Basically, there is no possible way it is more cost effective to redirect incoming lasers when you need significantly more expenditure of resources than it would have taken to use your own laser.

The point of my comment was that this was an arms race situation between lasers and defenses against lasers. While I'm sure one side is going to win out (and I even agree with you about the issues with laser point defense), I was trying to illustrate that you can't just brush off the argument so trivially.
