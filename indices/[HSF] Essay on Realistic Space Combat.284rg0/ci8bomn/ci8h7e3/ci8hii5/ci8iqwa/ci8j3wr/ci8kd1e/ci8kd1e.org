Broadly speaking, I agree with many of the points you bring up.

#+begin_quote
  Still trivial compared to the cost of the ship killed.
#+end_quote

I still think it's getting significantly more expensive to make missiles proof against laser weaponry - not just in pure material expenditure terms, but also in making any given missile less effective in terms of effect on target, number of missiles able to be carried, or acceleration and delta-v capabilities.

There has to be a point at which highly defended missiles stop being cost effective. Do you deal with anti-missile missiles by putting point defense on the missile? At a certain point you're firing what is essentially a suicidal spacecraft at the opposing ship.

This is complete conjecture at this point, but I suspect that apart from a basic reflective coating, missiles would be more likely to be unarmoured and trade survivability for mass of numbers. The laser impervious missiles are great and all, except now you have fewer, slower missiles than might be susceptible to other point defense systems.

  There's not really going to be any side-chase. [...] At the ranges we're talking about, there is only really "towards" and "away" as directions.
#+end_quote

I can see what you're saying - if the missile has significantly more acceleration than the target then any given lead pursuit vector will still look basically dead on towards the target, especially as it closes to point defense range.

#+begin_quote
  But as far as expenditures of energy, I think you're entirely wrong there.
#+end_quote

Not energy, resources, and specifically with regard to redirecting incoming lasers back to their source. You now need to cover (because it's a lot easier for me to redirect my laser than for you to predict and move a single mirror) your ship in articulated mirrors and devote sensing and processing to detecting incoming beams. Seems an awful lot of design and maintenance effort for minimal gains.

On a spacecraft, I actually do agree that you can slap enough armour and reflective coating to make lasers ineffective.

I mainly envisioned lasers as being damaging to sensors and other unarmoured parts of a ship and being effective against lightly armoured swarms of missiles.

  hot enough to punch through silver
#+end_quote

Amusingly, silver is worse than aluminium for reflectivity (from blue wavelengths and smaller) and specific heat capacity. But I get the point. With that said, you don't have to punch through the armour to get a mission kill. The target still needs to cope with the extra heat dumped into it. Where do you put the attitude thrusters so that they aren't vulnerable?
