The idea of using lasers for point defense or any other kind of weapon is ridiculous. Choose a method that isn't thwarted utterly by a thin layer of aluminum foil and the most trivial of heat sinks. Any time you aim a laser at an opponent armed with a basic hand mirror, you have just surrendered to them the targeting control of your weapons system.
