Seems to me that if you wanted to build an unassailable "fortress world" something like Europa might be a good place to do it. There's no atmosphere to cause problems for your mega-point-defense lasers, there's a vast ocean to act as a heat sink for them, and submarine bases could move around beneath the thick layer of icy armor to avoid bombardment.

An artificial version of this can be seen with [[http://gineipaedia.com/wiki/Iserlohn_Fortresss][Iserlohn Fortress]], which had a layer of liquid metal as its outer armor. Weapon turrets moved around within it like submarines.
