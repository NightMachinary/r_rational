I can't help but wonder about something like a rail gun in which the load fragments into pieces once it reaches a certain proximity to the target, if the munition was cold it wouldn't turn up on IR and with sufficient velocity the impact/s would be devastating.

With the fragmentation you'd also ensure that there are multiple incoming targets that need to be stopped before they hit the ship which would likely make life more difficult.
