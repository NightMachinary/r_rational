Good start, seems interesting and characters so far are entertaining. One-outfit rule seems weird, hygiene-wise, so I assume there's something plotty going on there. Noticed â€˜would might be weary' needs to be corrected, but no other errors I could spot.

Holding out for Liar Game-esque backstabbery and intrigue (and penguin factoids)!
