Usually, when I open a Wordpress.com site on mobile, I get a bottom bar with a follow button and a couple other options, but on your site I just get the bar with no “follow” button. In fact, it seems like I can follow the comments on a particular post, but not the posts on the site.

Any idea why that is? I'd very much like to read this, but no way I'm remembering to visit every time---at least at first,---so having the notifications mailed to me would be really convenient.
