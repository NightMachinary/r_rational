I believe you did =) Thanks!

Re: the follow button in the bottom bar (mobile) or in the bottom right (desktop) (spot the difference between [[https://i.imgur.com/vElAW9A.png][a screenshot]] from [[https://wanderinginn.com][wanderinginn.com]] and [[https://i.imgur.com/q6OIws6.png][one]] from [[https://korridor.rip][korridor.rip]]), turns out you don't actually need to do anything, it's just that Wordpress.com refuses to display it [[https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/follow-blog-widget/][until you have at least two posts]].

Only goes to prove that I'm clueless about this stuff as well, sigh.

Thanks again!
