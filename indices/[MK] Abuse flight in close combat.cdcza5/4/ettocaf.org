Given the topic I instinctively interpreted that tag as "Mortal Kombat".

Ahem.

I guess the main obvious use is "grab someone, lift them up, drop them from a lethal height, fight is won". It mostly depends on how the power works though - is it /acceleration/, or is it /force/? I'm guessing the first from your formulation so that would imply I can simply apply any acceleration I want no matter what am I lifting; the only thing I need to be able to withstand is the pressure from the load's weight on the body parts I'm using to lift it. Except, if I can fine-tune that whole "control the acceleration in each part of my body", not, because I can accelerate my skin and flesh so that it doesn't get squeezed by the mass above it, countering the effect of the weight. Though the weight will try to go down at 9 m/s^{2} so there's still a limit there... unless the only thing that matters is that the /average/ over my whole body mass is 3 m/s^{2,} in which case, yes, I can lift anything as long as I'm willing to do it /very/ slowly. Hell, I can push the Earth out of orbit if so I want.

Another easy use in case I can redistribute the acceleration with local values exceeding 3 m/s^{2:} punches. Just keep my body absolutely still (heh, imposing an acceleration of /0/ m/s^{2} also has its uses, I am now literally unmovable), then charge all the acceleration in my right arm, and that's one good hit I get in, without even using my real strength. Or I can sum it with my real strength to enhance my power.

Gets all a lot trickier if 3 m/s^{2} isn't an upper value, but the /only/ value allowed. As in, at any time I'm using this power, I /have/ to accelerate by 3 m/s^{2} in some direction. That's much less useful and much funnier. Though it can probably still be wildly abused.
