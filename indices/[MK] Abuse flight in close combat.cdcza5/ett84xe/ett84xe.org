Is the acceleration capped at 3m/ss? Also does it nullify your already present momentum?

Edit: Wait if you're not affected by gravity at all don't you end up pancaked on the ground/flung off into atmosphere? i think you're dead either way, and it brings up ontological issues with the prompt. So i guess it would be not being unaffected by gravity but the exact inverse of gravitonal force plus up to 3m/s2.
