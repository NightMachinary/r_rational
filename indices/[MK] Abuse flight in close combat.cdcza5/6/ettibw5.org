You effectively have the best form of leverage in existence. So long as your body can withstand the forces, you can take hits without moving, and punch much harder than usual. This goes doubly so if you have a weapon. Standing/lying/crouching no longer means anything to you, which means you can do all sorts of stuff to exploit someone's vulnerabilities that result from them being anchored to the ground. You could easily fight from directly above them and they would be at a huge disadvantage, especially since you can so easily get directly behind them. Of course, you can also do some insane throws. Fighting low could also work, maybe, if you can take advantage of the greater dexterity of your arms versus their legs. You could very easily trip someone, or just grab them and fly up. Thinking in 3D is key.
