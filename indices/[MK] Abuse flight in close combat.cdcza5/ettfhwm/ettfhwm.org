Assuming that's enough force to accelerate the mass of your body at 3m/s/s (essentially making the power generation of X amount momentum (kg*m/s) per second), you could concentrate the momentum in limbs for quick punches or weapon swings.

​

To calculate acceleration of portions of body parts: (mass of power user) * 3m/s/s = total momentum generation, (amount of distributed momentum generation)/(mass accelerated) = acceleration of mass accelerated

​

If there was space enough to accumulate a lot of linear momentum, stomping from odd angles would be somewhat effective, though not as much as a gravity assisted stomp (imagine jumping and falling in essentially 1/3 earth gravity), and it would be slow and predictable even with regular gravity. Stomps because legs and feet are actually made to take large amounts of force (unlike our spindly fingers and feeble wrists).

​

Spinning to build up angular momentum would also be useful, though a regular body probably has a pretty low max-comfortable-rpm.

​

Most useful I think would be general freedom of movement, you no longer need your center of mass always over your feet, you don't have to keep your feet on the ground, and you don't have to push off of anything to move. Most effective I think would either be attacking from directly above and behind the opponent where arms can't reach and turning off gravity nullification sporadically to power attacks (it'd be kinda awkward if acceleration and gravity nullification turned off and on together), or attack from the ground utilizing acceleration in addition to pushing off the ground (again awkward if the power is all or nothing) to outmaneuver, and (assuming using the power isn't tiring) you could probably outlast them by supporting yourself with gravity nullification and using acceleration instead of muscles.

​

Or maybe sacrifice all the momentum generation into one or both hands to wield a weapon heavier than you would otherwise be able to (a weapon weighing as much as the power user would get 3m/s/s (not enough to lift on its own) in addition to what the power user could output via muscles, lighter is faster) (unusable if the power is all or nothing because the weapon's center of mass would become your center of mass and you wouldn't be able to stand without the weapon being directly above your feet), though you'd have to be careful of your arms/wrists.

​

You could also throw stuff, (person mass) * 3m/s/s of force is a lot of acceleration on something only a few grams, though again: wristlash would be difficult to avoid, though maybe not if you had one of those tennis ball throwers, or even a basket on a stick. You'd have to stop all other acceleration to propel the projectile, +and manage conservation of momentum if airborne+ (nope, you're generating momentum).
