Is the acceleration ability pure acceleration, or is it a force? This question is important, because if it's a force then your air resistance property holds true. But if it's pure acceleration, then air resistance's effect upon speed is ignored and the person accelerates at three-tenths of a standard G until the flier burns up from atmospheric friction. After two minutes of full acceleration at sea level, the flier has broken the sound barrier. After 1 hour of acceleration at 3 m/s/s they're going 10.8 km/s, just shy of Earth escape velocity. After 28 hours they're going 0.1% of the speed of light.
