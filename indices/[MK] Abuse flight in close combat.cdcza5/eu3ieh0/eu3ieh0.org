If it works by blocking the effects of gravity you should be able to accelerate (relative to an observer standing next to where you were standing before toggling the flight on) much faster in a certain direction.

Just get below your opponent, grab on, and allow the centrifugal forces (no longer counteracted by gravity) launch the both of you. Let go when you get to a sufficiently advantageous energy state (kinetic and potential energy, or just speed and height)

Another method: since the acceleration is constant (by ommission in the wog), without the normal relativistic decay you'd expect in rate of acceleration, just accelerate to the speed of light and let them die of old age. Or exceed the speed of light at which point I'm pretty sure time as it affects you becomes imaginary from everyone else's frame of reference. That statement is just bullshit enough to abuse the hell out of. I mean being outside of time from our perspective is literally one of the things Christians tend to believe is part of their God's powerset.

If you need a villain idea, how about a lex luthor type who wants to harness your superpower to create limitless free energy by getting you high and making you accelerate a hamster wheel attached to a generator.
