Lighter-than-air is different than from being completely unaffected by gravity though. It's like the equivalent of when the mythbusters fired a cannon ball off a truck and completely cancelled the acceleration of the truck by launching it at the exact speed of accleration but like in theory without the gravitational pull downward. umm that is to say that you'd be missing the firing of the cannon i think. I'm not sure if that's how the physics works actually you might be right.
