i might be confused but, if we're taking the assumption that we're generating a force, and that force is defined as "however much is required to accelerate my body 3 m/s/s" (presumably not including external clothes or equipment), then wouldn't the force increase the heavier you are? You'd want to get built like a sumo wrestler, for the doubled benefits of being stronger and being able to impart more force. (You'd probably want to dress like one too, to minimize the weight of your clothes.)

Aside from re-interpreting "acceleration" into "force", let's take the rest of the description completely literally: When you toggle the power on, you stop being affected by gravity /and/ you gain the ability to apply force to accelerate it to 3m/s/s. Not "up to" 3 m/s/s, it's all or nothing. Presumably, though, you can distribute this force as you wish across your body - if you apply less force to one area you must apply it elsewhere.

I don't think there's any huge consistency problems in this interpretation...? Anyways taking the above and running with it, aside from wanting to be as heavy as possible you'd be able to briefly use the power to help absorb the force of punches - as the punch approaches you, hop and trigger the power. The punch will spend most of its force knocking you backwards, and if something's behind you you can push off of it and use your power to accelerate back towards the enemy, which will probably be surprising and unintuitive to someone who's used to living in a world where objects don't magically have forces imposed on them in midair.

Also, the whole "0 or full force" thing isn't much of a problem either I think?. At worst, you can use it to do simple, harmless motions on your limbs like move them in circles, clench and unclench your fingers very quickly, etc rather than moving anywhere. But I'm pretty sure you could also just repeatedly move your entire body in a very little circle, or even just vibrate back and forth, 180ing the direction of your power's force as fast as possible, and effectively stay still in midair.

In the case that the power causes a constant acceleration and applies arbitrary force to impose it, get your pain tolerance high enough that you can withstand having your hand, wrist, and maybe arm completely broken and then accelerate it through your opponent's ribcage.
