Without weight at all you would be simply subject to the buoyancy due to the air you're immersed into. That's equivalent to your weight in air, so for a human that's 0.07 m^{3} * 1.2 kg/m^{3} = 0.084 kg = 0.82 N of force. Woe is me, how shall I resist such a tremendous upwards pull with my ability to exert a 3 m/s^{2} * 70 kg = 210 N force!
