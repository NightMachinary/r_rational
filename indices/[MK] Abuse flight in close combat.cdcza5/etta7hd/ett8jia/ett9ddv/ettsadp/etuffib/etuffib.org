My favorite two uses of her power are:

1) Applying a downward force on herself to give her a sense of pressure, like a weighted blanket

2) Floating horizontally up the stairs while eating with a plate of food on her belly like a sea otter

She also has super strength/limited invulnerability, so it's not a strict just flying superpower, though.
