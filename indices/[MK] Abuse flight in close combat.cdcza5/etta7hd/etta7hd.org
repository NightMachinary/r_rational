Assuming the opponent is also unarmed, my initial thought would be to fight them from directly above. You would be able to kick them in the head easily, and they wouldn't be able to reach further than your legs. Heavy boots would be very useful both offensively and defensively. If your opponent manages to grab you, you could fly upward and either escape their grasp or leave them precariously hanging off of you. If you have difficulty dislodging them, you can flip around and make it almost impossible to hang on.
