My wife has depression and anxiety as well as ADHD. She has coped for years until she got meningitis last year and now she seems to have lost the critical edge that let her cope with a pretty messy brain stew. I've been wearing myself out trying to keep everything together and stay sane myself while homeschooling a 9 year-old and enjoying a 3 year-old. Recently I realized that I can use Trello project management software to help manage the family and her treatment. It has been working well so far. We just use the free version and set up boards for things like household work and recreation.
