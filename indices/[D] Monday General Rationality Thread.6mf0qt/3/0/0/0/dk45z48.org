Kolmogorov complexity is related. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_message_length][Minimum message length]], in particular, is an attempt to formalize the concept of complexity. I said is was hard to measure complexity and minimum message length doesn't really change that (writing programs that simulate all relevant aspects of the universe is hard) but it at least states how you could, in principle, distinguish between the complexities of competing hypotheses.

You'll notice that it's still fundamentally probabilistic though. It's not competing with the probabilistic analysis I gave, it's just more Bayesian and more concrete about where the probabilities are actually coming from.
