There are three things under consideration here. These are:

- The initial state of the universe
- The laws of physics
- The current state of the universe

The current state of the universe can be directly observed. (Mostly.) The laws of physics can be deduced, and different proposals take a complexity penalty. Once we have the current state of the universe /and/ the laws of physics, we can derive the initial state of the universe.

So, by the time we derive the initial state of the universe, hasn't any necessary complexity penalty /already/ been applied in the laws of physics?
