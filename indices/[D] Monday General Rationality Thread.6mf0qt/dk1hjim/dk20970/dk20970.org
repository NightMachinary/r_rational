I mean, complexity penalties are just a probability thing. If you break one hypothesis down into four propositions, each of which you're 70% sure is true, and another into three statements, each of which you're also 70% sure is true, the first hypothesis will be less likely to be true. "Complexity" is a little vague and hard to measure at this kind of specificity, but it's a hand-wavy attempt to encapsulate the same idea. If there are ten different parts to your hypothesis, I'm going to give it a complexity penalty because even if you're 90% sure of each part individually, it's still unlikely to be true as a whole.

I see no reason to think that this kind of probabilistic reasoning would break down when confronted with the initial configuration of the universe. As long as the penalty applied is proportionate to the complexity of the hypothesis, the math is still going to check out.
