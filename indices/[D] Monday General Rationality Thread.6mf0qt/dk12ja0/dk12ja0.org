I have bipolar-II, and the downswings been kicking my ass lately. As of a couple of weeks ago, I've started writing down anything that seems to be helping me with that, because it turns out that it's a lot easier to just reference a sheet and start going down the list, than to try to redesign or remember a winning strategy at a time that I'd really just like to curl up and die.

I know that a few other people here have depression, so maybe this'll help someone else too.
