Has anyone else's sense of normality just gone and totally broken? Like, if you had asked me five years ago what I actually expected to happen and what constituted "the world is working according to understandable principles", I couldn't have told you most anything about today.

The only things I've managed to get right were that austerity capitalism would continue indefinitely and that global warming will kill us all. Even so, both of these deny normality: most of the time, people are trying /not/ to suffer or die.
