[[/discordjazzhands][]] Oh, but where's the fun in making /sense/?

  It sometimes begins to seem as though, should godawful but privileged people decide the clouds ought to be made of cotton candy, quite suddenly, they'll discover a cheap and convenient engineering technique by which clouds /actually become cotton candy/.

I can't really see this as a negative. This is, if anything, a sign that those people are being very intelligent and finding ways to solve problems. They are saying, in effect, "this is how I wish the world to be" and then they are /successfully making it happen/. Is this not the very definition of technological progress? Not only that, but they're doing this without messing with the metaphorical water cycle - so they're implementing their technologies in a comparatively non-disruptive manner.

I'm not quite sure what your analogy is referring to, and I might well take issue with the goals that are being served here once I know what they are - but your analogy is already suggesting that those goals /are/ being sensibly served, and that /is/ a thing to be encouraged, in my view.
