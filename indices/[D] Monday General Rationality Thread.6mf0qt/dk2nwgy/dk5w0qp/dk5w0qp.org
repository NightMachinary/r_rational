No. Its sole grace is that sometimes it's quite funny. I'm about 17 chapters in and I probably won't continue. The Author states multiple times that some of the events -- such as changes from canon during the current time loop iteration -- will be explained later in-story. There's no sign of that yet.

The worst part is the backstory, which is a huge mess -- about as far from rational as it gets. Every time the character's time-loop-inclusive age is mentioned it goes up by a century or more. I think it was originally noted as just shy of one century. The MC never achieved anything meaningful in 'centuries' of time loops, not even matching strength and abilities of Cinder, let alone anyone beyond them. The MC has had less character growth in that time than most fictional characters in a year. In the story proper, the MC still ignores options, opportunities and basic sensibility because the plot demands it and it's pretty much the same with other characters.
