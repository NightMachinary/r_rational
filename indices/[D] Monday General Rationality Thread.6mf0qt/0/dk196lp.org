In a 5e session I was running a few months ago, my players were looking after a young girl who was about to become a hag. Hags reproduce by eating babies and subsequently giving birth to seemingly-normal girls who suddenly become hags when they turn 13. The girl was understandably upset by this and asked the heroes to kill her, for the greater good, when they avoided the whole moral quandary using an item I gave them without thinking about it.

But what's the ethically correct solution? What about for mind flayers? Without an elder brain they're peaceable, except they have to eat one sentient brain per day. Killing fiends on the material plane is straightforward since it sends them back to whatever hell they came from, but goblins automatically go to a shitty afterlife if they die in battle (hence why they're cowards). There are a surprising amount of monsters who are evil as a terminal goal; is it morally acceptable to just end them? What about Changing Their Minds via magic (I think it's possible in 5e RAW, without homebrew).

Heck, my players spent a small fortune on the potion they were using on the kid, should they have spent it on something more efficient?
