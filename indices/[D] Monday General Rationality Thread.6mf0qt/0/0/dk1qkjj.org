  [[http://d20.sabotender.com/5th/Source/DnD%205e%20Monsters%20Manual.pdf][a young girl who was about to become a hag]] [...] my players spent a small fortune on the potion they were using on the kid, should they have spent it on something more efficient?

approach a: It is their money, they are free to do with it whatever they want (no social responsibility \ chaotic neutral).

approach b: Having to walk through that particular quest makes them emphasize with that specific creature\girl more. So if the group as a whole highly values personal interactions, experiences and connections, it will be more valuable to them to spend large amounts of money just to improve that single creature's life (similar real life examples: personal patronages, nepotism).

approach c: If the players (or their characters) have such personal history that it makes them empathize with this girl's problem more, they will value helping her more.

approach d: If the group as a whole is able to step back and think on a more abstract level, it could end up being more valuable to them to spent the same amount of money to improve lives of as many more creatures similar to that little girl as possible (real life example: Bill Gates' philanthropy projects).

approach e: The group members analyse themselves, the feelings and instincts that are forcing them into the personalities they have, and based on those decide which choice would make them the happiest later on --- often despite their “will” or perceived “preferences”. For instance, if the players' characters were a group of stage-two hags, wouldn't they see forcing the girl into her own stage-two transformation as the “right” thing to do?

approach f: If the girl is an orphan, with no one else existing who would be caring about her, they can quickly and suddenly kill her in a manner that will cause her minimal to no distress. (real life example: parents killing their children before killing themselves)

approach g: Approach f would mean that they would be taking her choice away from her, so they will ask her instead what she wants (“The girl ... asked the heroes to kill her”) and only then kill her (real life example: legalized euthanasia, to some degree). This approach would be conflicting with the “minors can't give informed consent” viewpoint though.

approach h: The players (or their characters) choose whichever flavour of morality has been enforced on them by their country, state, and surroundings to be perceived as the default, the common-sense one.

approach i: The heroes consider and try to predict which choice will make it more likely for them in the future to be interacting with people they find enjoyable more (similar example: RPG systems with karma and fractions, where the player gets variable reactions based on the choices he makes) and to be in situations they find enjoyable more (e.g. legal punishment).

approach j: The heroes consider and try to predict how the girl's society as a whole will change 1) based on their choice 2) based on other people's choices in similar situations. Then from all available decisions they pick the one that, in their opinion, will change the society as a whole to the best degree, and also try to advertise that choice to others.

approach k: a mix of all the above, with different weights assigned to each.

approach l(?): a mix of all the above, with different weights assigned to each.

--------------

The problem for me is that usually when someone uses the words “morality” and “ethics”, I have no idea what they really mean by those --- one of the viewpoints listed above, perhaps, or something else, etc.

Also, as a counter-question, if someone has any other approaches or viewpoints that I failed to list above, please share them as well.
