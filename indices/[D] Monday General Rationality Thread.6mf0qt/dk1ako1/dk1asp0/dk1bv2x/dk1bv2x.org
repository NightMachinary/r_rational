I guess I don't so much mind that new things are invented. I mind that many of the new things that happened, more-or-less happened because someone just /made them up/ rather than because they were built into the way the world works. It feels like a "dream gap": some people can just dream stuff into being (like, apparently, for instance, half the political far-right), while other people have to follow the rational order of the world. I definitely feel that I belong to the latter group.

It sometimes begins to seem as though, should godawful but privileged people decide the clouds ought to be made of cotton candy, quite suddenly, they'll discover a cheap and convenient engineering technique by which /clouds actually become cotton candy/. Then somehow, to boot, the water cycle is not fucked -- despite one portion of it being made of sugar fibers rather than water.
