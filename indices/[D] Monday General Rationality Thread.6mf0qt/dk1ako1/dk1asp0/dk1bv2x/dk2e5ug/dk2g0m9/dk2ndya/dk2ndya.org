  If /you/ know how to replicate feats of a minor god of chaos
#+end_quote

Only a few of them, and only in a severely limited way.

(Lucid dreaming covers most of it).

#+begin_quote
  I should be able to read the patent, so to speak, and replicate everything myself.
#+end_quote

If you can get /hold/ of the metaphorical patent, yes.

David Copperfield (stage magician and illusionist) once made the Statue of Liberty vanish on live television. He walked /through/ the Great Wall of China. (You can probably see both of these feats by looking through old recorded footage). Of course, he didn't publish his patents on these feats; but just because you saw what it /looked/ like does not mean that you saw the patent.

Similarly, "running a sleazy blog and memeing your way into high office" isn't the full story. There's no doubt a /lot/ in that story that is not visible to public view. (Just because I don't know the specifics either, doesn't mean that they don't exist). And you don't have to understand a technology to use it (as proven to tech support personnel every day).

  Overall, though, it sometimes seems like the /real/ magic is /privilege/. Even protexia (connections) is easier to replicate.
#+end_quote

Con men and Bavarian Fire Drills have been taking advantage of this for centuries now. (The real magic isn't privilege. The real magic is /convincing other people/ that you have authority over them, at least temporarily. It's not the actual superiority, it's thw air of superiority)
