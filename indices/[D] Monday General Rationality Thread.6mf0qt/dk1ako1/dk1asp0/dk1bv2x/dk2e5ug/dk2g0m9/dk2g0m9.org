What feels shocking and problematic to me is that intelligence and technological knowledge are supposed to be, so to speak, equal opportunity. If /you/ know how to replicate feats of a minor god of chaos (I /knew/ that was coming from somewhere!), I should be able to read the patent, so to speak, and replicate everything myself.

Instead it now often feels as if somehow some people have access to reality-breaking knowledge, but when you read it, it goes dead on the page. I can't run a sleazy blog and meme my way into high office. For that matter, I can't get game-breaking results and a gajillion dollar company in London (aka DeepMind) off a technology that even I admit nobody truly understands (neural networks).

Admittedly, that latter one looks /more/ replicable and has a clearer path open, but it's not actually in line with what I want very precisely. I might use it if nothing else comes through :-/.

Overall, though, it sometimes seems like the /real/ magic is /privilege/. Even protexia (connections) is easier to replicate.
