  1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.

  2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.

  3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

  ~Douglas Adams
