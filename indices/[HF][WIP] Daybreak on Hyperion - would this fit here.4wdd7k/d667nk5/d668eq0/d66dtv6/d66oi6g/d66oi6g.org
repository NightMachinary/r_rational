Not hypocritical, exactly, but rather ... missing the point? Using the word "damnable" implies that the fanfiction is trespassing on space that was meant to be used for original fiction. That it's not supposed to be here, essentially. Given that original fiction is the relative newcomer, and that fanfiction continues to make up the majority, I stand by my "too many Canadians in Toronto" metaphor.
