A rational story doesn't have to be a fanfictions, one thing I love about some of the stories posted here is that they have well thought out worlds ( Limelight, Mother of Learning, Practical guide to Evil ) but it's something IMO fanfictions always lack. As an example picture Harry Potters character Petunia then read the first chapter of HPMOR, its so confusing considering what the character was like and now suddenly she's completely different. HPMOR would have been better if it didn't reuse characters and only the world because all the character development that was originally made is so hard to preserve.
