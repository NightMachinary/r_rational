There is an explanation for that one. HPMOR has a point of departure (well, several) decades before the first HP book, and the ripples of it change the personalities of many canon characters, Petunia in particular. It's even explained in the first few chapters, though we don't know the deeper causes at that point.

(Many other characters are changed for purely Doylist reasons however.)
