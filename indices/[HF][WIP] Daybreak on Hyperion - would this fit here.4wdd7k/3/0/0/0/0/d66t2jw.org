Different perspectives, I suppose. Damnable doesn't carry that implication with me at all, and I can't honestly pretend rational fanfiction predates all works of original fiction that meet the criteria of rational fiction. Rationalist fiction, maybe, though you'd still have to contend with /The Phantom Tollbooth/. Certainly not rational fiction.
