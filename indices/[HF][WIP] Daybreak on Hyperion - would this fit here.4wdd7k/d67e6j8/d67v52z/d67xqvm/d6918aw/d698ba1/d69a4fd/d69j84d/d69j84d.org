Forgot to mention that all the things I mentioned might not apply to Daybreak because I really don't recall the specifics as it was more than a year ago during a LN binge (it stood out by virtue of its excellent English in the flood of subpar writing/translations). That's why I didn't specifically say dialogue, but rather tone and character interactions. My fuzzy feeling is the characters felt too much like staple anime characters, but that's useless without pointing to details and I don't feel up to combing the whole volume.

I'll PM you a review the summary and Ch. 1 excerpt, but that might not be representative of later chapters. On the other hand, first impressions..
