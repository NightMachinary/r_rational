Actually, they're quite different. Yes, many fantasies tend to overuse flowery medieval language, and some fantasy authors create their own linguistic culture. But the issue isn't the divergence from modern (English) language and culture: it's that LN dialogue is frequently inane, focused more on the "quirkiness," if you will, than emotional coherence in the context, i.e. congruity with the characters' expected spectrum of responses. For example, you get a lot of conversations where characters expatiate implausibly just to show what kind of person they are. LN has a lot of "telling," as opposed to the ideal of "showing."

TL;DR Fantasy characters can talk funny as long as they don't pass the threshold where you lose suspension of disbelief. The threshold, as with any literature, is largely subjective preference/standards, but there is [[http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/11/03/bad-dialogue-bad-bad-dialogue/][a sort of industry rubric that lets critics identify bad dialogue]].
