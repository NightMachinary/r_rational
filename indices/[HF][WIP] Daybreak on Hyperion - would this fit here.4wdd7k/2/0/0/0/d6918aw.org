I actually find this a bit questionable, since anyone who has read Game of Thrones or all the literary mediums influenced by it (i.e. much of today's historical/fantasy drama), the characterization and dialogue is almost always exaggerated. Not quite the same quirky way that Japan does it sure, but pretty much everyone has major issues and half the cast talk a little bit funny.

But alas, thanks for the explanation.
