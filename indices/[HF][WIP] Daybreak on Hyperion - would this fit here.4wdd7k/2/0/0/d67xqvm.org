Sorry for being vague. What I meant by LN-ish tone is that most light novels have a tendency towards exaggerated prose and character interactions (unfortunate side effect of being written for teenagers). Dialogue-driven stories are great, but not when the dialogue feels contrived, e.g. characters are put in annoyingly maudlin moments where conversations get overly theatrical.
