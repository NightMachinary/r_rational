I tried reading it a while ago. The upside is that it wasn't quite Marty Stu-ish, because the charachter described in this blurb isn't as much of a focus as [[#s][Minor Spoiler]] The downside is that the light novel format feels sort of... I don't know, weird, in english. It reads as sort of stilted.
