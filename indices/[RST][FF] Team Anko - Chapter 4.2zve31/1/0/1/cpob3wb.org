  I may have been less obvious about this than I intended: she's matchmaking Hinata and Naruto. That's the entire reason that she's putting Shino and Hinata together.

I'm not sure that would work (in real life, I mean. Obviously you can just say "Yes, it does work." because you're the author). Naruto has never shown any interest in Hinata, so having Hinata and Shino play at being a couple would only destroy any interest in her he might otherwise have developed further down the line.

In order for the jealousy trick to work the victim needs to be /already/ somewhat interested, or else they'll just write the other person off as "involved with another, so not a potential partner".
