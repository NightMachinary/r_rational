Maybe it's just that she's decided to deal with Hinata's issues first, but I can't help but think that Anko is taking entirely the wrong attitude towards teaching (and in general interacting with) Naruto. I think what he needs more than anything is a person who will be completely straight and honest with him. He doesn't have a single person like that: the most he has are people like Iruka and Sarutobi who are kind to him when they can but who are fundamentally unwilling or unable to sit down with him and explain the things he needs to know, or help him with basic issues like the Clone technique. The ability to be self-sufficient is valuable, but Naruto has the opposite problem - he doesn't understand that it's possible for a person to actually help him when he needs it. Anko's mind games might improve his skills but they won't improve his mindset or his relationship with her. As of right now he's only gotten confusing signals and every lesson learned gives him a new reason to distrust her as anything she says or does could just be a trap as part of some new "lesson."

What's more, she's acknowledged to Hinata that Naruto has huge self-esteem issues, but only put Naruto in situations where those issues are likely to worsen. As the appointed tactical planner of the team, he is not only likely to fail in actual execution at some point, he is also criticized at every turn when he suggests something flawed. She also doesn't seem to acknowledge his successes when they do occur. She doesn't even seem to notice that Naruto is actually able to sustain a normal emotional range while under a henge (a skill the other two explicitly are shown to lack initially). She's shocked at how he's able to pull off a large change in mass with his henge, and then just points out flaws in it and moves on. She rightly gets on Naruto's case for not working with the others on tree climbing, but avoids mentioning that he actually did manage to make some progress on his own despite being at a huge inherent disadvantage in comparison to the other two.

While she's taking a hands-on approach to helping Hinata, she seems to be taking the route that every instructor Naruto had in canon did - giving intentionally cryptic instructions and letting him work things out himself. And in canon, that type of method tends to leave him angered, confused, and not making much progress until the shit hits the fan and he comes up with a solution just in the nick of time. It's functional within the story, but hardly an actual good method of instruction.

There's also the fact that she knows about the potential attraction between Naruto and Hinata and chooses to mess with him by having Hinata practice acting like a couple with Shino. That may not be the worst thing you can do to someone with huge self-esteem issues, but it's pretty awful.
