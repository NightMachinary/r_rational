I think you were being perfectly obvious about it, but I also think the "make the girl pretend to like some other guy to make the guy jealous" trick is something that even in fiction only results in misunderstandings and hurt feelings, and it's a particularly cruel thing to do to someone with crippling self-esteem issues.

I'll acknowledge that we haven't seen Anko specifically focus on Naruto yet, and so she might do better in the future, but my point here is that she's made several missteps with him already, and so she's going to have to repair that damage before she's actually going to be able to make real progress with him.
