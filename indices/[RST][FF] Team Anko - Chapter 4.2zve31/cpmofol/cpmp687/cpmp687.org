  Anko sounds like she had a more thorough one overall, though considering she got taught by Orochimaru that doesn't come as a surprise.
#+end_quote

Yeah, Anko's education was better than that of almost any other ninja Konoha has produced in twenty years. It was also /way/ more brutal. Almost all of her issues are a direct result of her time with Orochimaru.

  as a clarification of 'you can make solid or illisionary' is much better than canon's uncertainty.

Thanks. The canon version drove me nuts, so I decided to do this instead.

  The little 'get rid of shyness' bit that Anko did with Hinata was nice,
#+end_quote

I had a lot of fun with that. This is a romance story first and an adventure story second, and this bit was a natural fit. The whole "ugly duckling => beautiful swan" thing is totally a trope, but it's a /really fun/ trope to write.

  ...the Sannin aren't /quite/ strong enough to take on something like a few hundred ninja by themselves,
#+end_quote

It would be an interesting scene to write. The way I picture it, there's two or three hundred ninja trapped in a killbox with the Sannin. The enemy ninja have the problem of avoiding friendly fire, so they have to be careful throwing kunai and can't use area effect jutsu. The Sannin, on the other hand, can just kill anything that moves. Tsunade would be right in her element -- I picture her as having /fantastic/ taijutsu skills and, when you combine it with her medical knowledge (chakra scalpels, knowledge of anatomy for targeting), she one-shots pretty much anything she hits. All three of them are summoning stuff, they and most of the enemy are hiding / fighting underground. It would be a hell of a battle, but I think they would eventually be taken down. They'd do a lot of damage first, though.

  and the acknowledgement that Samurai are decent at combat and can take Ninja if they're in a team.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think that's a bet that canon missed. There should be some counter for ninja aside from "more ninja!"
