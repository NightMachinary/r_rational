  Yeah, Anko's education was better than that of almost any other ninja Konoha has produced in twenty years. It was also way more brutal. Almost all of her issues are a direct result of her time with Orochimaru.

I wonder what issues she shall have in this fic? Has it been hard to separate 'fanon' character behavior and mechanics from the canon stuff?

  I had a lot of fun with that. This is a romance story first and an adventure story second, and this bit was a natural fit. The whole "ugly duckling => beautiful swan" thing is totally a trope, but it's a really fun trope to write.

It's a romance story? That comes as a surprise. I just figured you wanted to write a Naruto rational fic, and it didn't click you'd have specific themes beyond that in it.

Interesting. I agree that they'd fall to numbers eventually, but they'd probably take quite a lot of the enemy with them.

  Yeah, I think that's a bet that canon missed. There should be some counter for ninja aside from "more ninja!"

I stopped following Naruto sometime in the early parts of Part 2, but I agree Samurai didn't live up to their full potential. I think the author fell into the same thing that the DBZ one did - power creep.
