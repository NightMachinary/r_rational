  They were genin at the start of Word War Two

Word War One was the conflict that saw the introduction of typographical warfare, but Word War Two nearly destroyed the entire world, leading to a world-wide ban.

  Hinata had it harder: she was short, and had the typical Hyuuga eyes---pure white, no pupils at all. Being extremely 'gifted' for thirteen, she was able to restribute some mass from her chest and repurpose some of her musculature in order to give herself an inch of height and hair to her waist. She lowered her cheekbones, widened her nose, thinned her lips a bit, and could probably pass for sixteen---just old enough not to get thrown out of bars or gambling dens.

Can't she use her Byakugan? Doesn't that remove the need to be able to see through the henge?

  "So...uh...any ideas on that money thing?" Naruto asked weakly.
#+end_quote

"How much do you think we could sell our kidneys for?"

#+begin_quote
  "Isn't that the standard mission expense money?" Hinata asked reprovingly. Her sensei just laughed.
#+end_quote

This is hilarious.

#+begin_quote
  She assessed Hinata for a moment and put a little extra confidence into her voice. "It'll be great, I promise. We're going to be the prettiest girls in there, and guys are going to be fawning all over both of us. And you're not going to have to do anything except talk a little and dance a little, okay? This is perfectly normal stuff that lots of teenagers do."
#+end_quote

I'm, like, 90% sure that you're not supposed to abandon your ninja on a mission so you can go dancing, Anko.

  "It's a rock clone," Anko said. "There's plenty of clone techniques out there---water, earth, rock, I think I heard about a sand clone, and I know your family can do bug clones. Earth isn't my best element, but I can do a few things with it, and rock clones are great when I need to be in two places at once. I programmed it to teach cards, so Naruto can study while we're practicing."
#+end_quote

Interesting. Anko has a lot more control over her rock clone than Naruto has over his shadow clones.

#+begin_quote
  "I would take the three of us to the other room, but I'm suddenly feeling edgy about splitting up"
#+end_quote

"That's probably because we're being followed by a squad of ninjas."

"What? How do you know?"

"Well, it's been four chapters, and we haven't gotten in any fights."

"Chapters? What are you talking about?"

#+begin_quote
  Anko kept drilling the two on appropriate boyfriend / girlfriend behavior, carefully oblivious to the way that Naruto was occasionally twisting around to look at them and frowning as he did.
#+end_quote

Hinata's not oblivious to it, though.
