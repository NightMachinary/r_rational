  Can't she use her Byakugan? Doesn't that remove the need to be able to see through the henge?
#+end_quote

Doing a physical henge to your eyes (i.e. actually moving parts of your body around and making actual changes in the flesh) ruins your eyes and leaves you blind unless you get it exactly right. Even if you get it right, you may look strange -- e.g. if you make the eyes too big you'll look like an anime character. She doesn't have the skill to pull off a physical henge of her eyes; she could cover them with an illusionary henge, but those are easily disrupted and so Anko is insisting they use physical ones.

Heh. Thank you, this made me laugh

  Interesting. Anko has a lot more control over her rock clone than Naruto has over his shadow clones.

Shadow clones work very differently from every other kind of clone. It was hinted at here and will be dealt with more thoroughly later on.
