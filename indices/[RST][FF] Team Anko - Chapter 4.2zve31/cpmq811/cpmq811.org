I like how you're including Hinata more in the direct training. Anko seems like the type who would try to fix what is broken on that end in the most direct way possible.

Your characterization here is great. I'm not sure if Canon!Shino had an anger issue he was hiding under the monotone, but either way it is certainly a believable character trait.

The only thing you might have missed is Naruto's talent for improvisation. While not very bright or skilled in strategic planning, his instantaneous tactical planning is actually rather good. He always seems to put together a decent response in very short time, especially in a combat situation. This is likely part of the reason he was such a good prankster.

You can see an example in the Canon Zabuza fight, with the fuuma shuriken clone-henge. That was a three level deception that he and Sasuke cooked up non-verbally and almost instantly when it was needed.
