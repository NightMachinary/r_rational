No argument about Naruto. Give him a problem that he can address in the next 30 seconds, he's brilliant. Even pranking, he's great, but that's action with just himself, over a few hours, where he expects to be identified and knows what he's facing.

Pllanning actions over the course of a few days, with multiple people, unknown opposition, and severe constraints against being noticed? Not really his thing. Anko threw him into the deep end here -- she's making sure he doesn't fail, but she's forcing him to do as much of it as possible himself.
