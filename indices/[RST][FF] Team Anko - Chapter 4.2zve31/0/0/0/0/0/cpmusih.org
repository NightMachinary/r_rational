I would recommend trying out the manga. You can read at your own pace, so it doesn't seem so dragged out like the anime. Though I can't really recommend reading further from the Ninja World War onwards. Once you reach Part 2, stop as soon as you start rolling your eyes too much.

Fanon can give you the wrong impression about some of the characters. Some go through character development, but a lot of fanfics start them out with the end result, especially Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto starts out as a bit of a dick and grows up through the Wave mission and meeting Gaara. Sasuke is actually pretty sympathetic until he gets targeted by Orochimaru and is completely broken when he runs into Itachi again.
