  I wonder what issues she shall have in this fic? Has it been hard to separate 'fanon' character behavior and mechanics from the canon stuff?

My knowledge of Naruto is almost entirely from fanfic. I read a few, liked it, went to watch the anime, and gave up either partway through or just after the bridge fight. I just couldn't stand the way things were dragged out and Naruto's obnoxious catchphrase ("Believe it!")

  It's a romance story? That comes as a surprise. I just figured you wanted to write a Naruto rational fic, and it didn't click you'd have specific themes beyond that in it.

Yep. Oh, there will be adventure and fights and such, but I'm mostly interested in the characters and their interactions. I don't think that's incompatible with a rationalist story though, so we'll see how that goes.
