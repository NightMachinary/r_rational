I like how you've listed all the different things the characters learn in the Academy this chapter. Helps us know their basic skillsets. Anko sounds like she had a more thorough one overall, though considering she got taught by Orochimaru that doesn't come as a surprise. The reference to sex-ed and 'trauma' bit was a nice hint of the potential dangers of ninja life, although I'm left wondering why guys don't get the 'trauma' training as well - they're just as much at risk, if they have a rare bloodline. Potentially more, considering male vs female reproduction rates.

The exposition on the differences of Henge were nice, as a clarification of 'you can make solid or illisionary' is much better than canon's uncertainty. Heck, some fanon have it so only Naruto can make solid Henge, which...comes off as a tad strange when you think of all the in-universe research that would've been done once the skill was made.

The little 'get rid of shyness' bit that Anko did with Hinata was nice, as was the analysis of the team's skillset - including comparing how Hinata saw herself with how she actually is, skillwise. I also like the discussion on clones, the somewhat revised history so the Sannin aren't /quite/ strong enough to take on something like a few hundred ninja by themselves, and the acknowledgement that Samurai are decent at combat and can take Ninja if they're in a team.
