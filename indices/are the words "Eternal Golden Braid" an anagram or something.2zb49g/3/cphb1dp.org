I mean, it's an anagram [[http://wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=eternal+golden+braid&t=1000&a=n][for a lot of things]]. But I don't think that it's an anagram for anything specific. (Douglas Hofstadter took over a column called "Mathematical Games" from Martin Gardner and renamed it as "Metamagical Themas", so he is a fan of anagrams.)
