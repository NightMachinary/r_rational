Props to you for trying, and putting yourself out there. Since this is the first substantial thing you've ever written you know that you will make plenty of mistakes.

Being able to acknowledge them, and then learn and improve upon it is an essential skill.

Having a thick skin and not letting criticism hurt you is also very important and a great trait to have. You will enconter well meaning people, assholes who just want to rag on you and everything in between. I honestly don't have the mindset that is neccesary for that. Good luck!
