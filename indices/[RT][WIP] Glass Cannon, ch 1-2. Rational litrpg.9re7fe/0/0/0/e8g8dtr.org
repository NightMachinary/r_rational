  Why does it say "In 50 years" and then happen immediately?
#+end_quote

It hasn't. The merging/transfer is separate from the recreation.

  Do human bodies work radically different
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Why would they destroy the world and than bring up "Unless milestones"
#+end_quote

They're not destroying, they're trimming. Milestones are spoiler material.

#+begin_quote
  Followed by 36 days straight of natural disasters means everyone should just be dead.
#+end_quote

The natural disasters ended the moment the recreation was complete. They basically hit the "reset" button.

  It might be better to have the whole thing start from the moment wifi cuts out
#+end_quote

I debated it. I've never written anything substantial before in my life so I wasn't sure what would be best.

And yes, it absolutely is a rough draft. Don't worry about being antagonistic, It's probably good for my story in the long run, and I have thick skin.

Thanks for reading and commenting, it helps a lot.
