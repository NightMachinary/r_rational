  Okay, basically, what you have here is a solid sketch of a story, but you do far too much telling and not enough showing
#+end_quote

This is sort of intentional. It's early in the story, and is also a character trait. If it keeps hampering the story later on I'll try to change it, but i think things will even out in the next 10-15 chapters.

  Finally.... I don't think you're ever going to have a FULLY believable story that starts with that kind of apocalypse.
#+end_quote

Yep, i agree. Another person had a similar comment and i agreed to do rational-adjacent instead of full on rational. It would be too hard for me to do full rational, i think. As well as maybe alienating the LitRPG readers.

  Now, you can hand-wave it as part of rebuild weirdness, but people will notice and remark on it and at some point investigate).
#+end_quote

They will. I plan for it be a central part of the story.

  You could also take a page from The Gamer (and sort of the Magineer): there's an additional effect (Gamer's Mind, the AI + built-in drugs) that emotionally stabilizes people so that they're not freaking the fuck out. But then you have to deal with the consequences of that.

That was the plan. I haven't read the gamer, I'm a little bit mad my idea wasn't as original as i thought.

  Blah blah, now that I've written that, I think you have an amazing way out: Don't mention it. Something happened. Only relate what the MC experienced, and they can guess about the rest, but you don't need answers. Not yet. Fundamentally, the MC doesn't know what happened - they can't - and so we, the reader, don't need to know either.
#+end_quote

Once again, you're right on the mark. I am going to do this. Confusion is only natural, if you have no questions I am doing something wrong. The rational part of my story should be in the satisfying consequences and conclusions to these questions.

Thanks for commenting, I hope to see you around.
