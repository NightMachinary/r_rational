Okay, basically, what you have here is a solid sketch of a story, but you do far too much telling and not enough showing... although that changed at the end of the story, so it could just be that you want to skip the boring, expository intro part.

Aside from the show/tell balance, I'm confused about: 1) The timeline? Tech got turned off, then nature revolted, then... three hours passed and the screens popped up? What happened in that time? 1a) Would you maybe have tested things like guns in that time?

2) "We were walking west". Who's "we"? Where'd they go? What was going on that MC started injured?

In terms of show/tell -

1) Your first chapter is a voice-over exposition. This is fine! Star Wars did it. Rewrite, leaning into that; don't present it as the start to the story, present it as the expository prologue.

2) Look at how Worth the Candle does thinking-flashbacks for a better way to handle things like Oswald.

Finally.... I don't think you're ever going to have a FULLY believable story that starts with that kind of apocalypse. You'd have to surpass /Worm/ in the dishing out and narrative handling of trauma, and aside from whether that's possible for any writer, and aside from if it's possible for /you/.... would you even /want/ to write or read that story? (Others with that kind of terrible: Gantz, Berserk)

And, sure, maybe the MC and the people in their area are not only no so hard hit, but also the sort that can handle this crap better than the average joe, but still... The still means everyone /else/ is fucked, and that's going to have to show up.

(Also, that kind of devastation doesn't "stop" after a few minutes. The kind of particulate thrown into the air by a mountain formation will persist for millennia, the flooding from water motion will last for days.... Now, you can hand-wave it as part of rebuild weirdness, but people will notice and remark on it and at some point investigate).

I'd say you have options. 1) Accept that you're not going to have that much realism 2) Alter your apocalypse.

Maybe everything broke, but miraculously, no-one died. Then all the trauma is man-against-man, and the monsters. Still get super dark super fast, but maybe only in urban centers (drastic food and water shortages).

Take a page from Singularity Sky: all 1/N of the population disappears and also no-one (or very few) die; then later, something like there's now N earths in a stable orbit. Maybe everyone got moved, witnessed the devastation, and then got put more-or-less back.

You could also take a page from The Gamer (and sort of the Magineer): there's an additional effect (Gamer's Mind, the AI + built-in drugs) that emotionally stabilizes people so that they're not freaking the fuck out. But then you have to deal with the consequences of /that/.

Blah blah, now that I've written that, I think you have an amazing way out: Don't mention it. Something happened. Only relate what the MC experienced, and they can guess about the rest, but you don't need answers. Not yet. Fundamentally, the MC doesn't know what happened - they /can't/ - and so we, the reader, don't need to know either.

Tech shut off, the earth bucked like crazy sauce, then an aggressive stillness descended and then....
