Reading it through, especially the first chapter, didn't /feel/ like what I expected from a rational fic: I think this is a fact about writing style and choice of description (like lots of telling not showing). On the other hand, once you get further into the story and I get used to your style, it'll probably click better. Right now, it feels strongly rational-adjacent, still the kind of thing we will all enjoy.

My thoughts:

- Is the "selected to join the multiverse" idea fleshed out? Similar ideas are common in apocalypse litrpgs, but my gripe is that they don't have a coherent reason why everything works the way it does: Why/How does technology stop working? Why does the planet throw a hissy fit and why is it gradual? Why Ghouls and Bloodbats?

  - What are the motives of the multiverse in including a new member and why does that include culling the population?

    - culling is generally to select for preferable traits (unless thanos); what are they selecting for?

Although I mentioned style, I think that if you want to change the writing style, it'd be better to do later/in a rewrite and not worry about it now. Narrative devices don't matter as much as substance (but if you get back to it later, it'd be cool!)
