Why does it say "In 50 years" and then happen immediately? Surgeries stopped working? What does that mean? Do human bodies work radically different? Why would the "Council of Control" destroy the world, and then say 50 years? Why would they destroy the world and than bring up "Unless milestones"?

36 days destroyed everything, but it began with wireless stuff, moved to all electronics, earthquakes, volcanos, tsunamis, rivers, sinkholes, hurricanes. Hour and a half of destroying electronics, followed by 36 days straight of natural disasters means everyone should just be dead.

The story seems to assume the main character has a bunch of future knowledge, but just flat out ignores some things.

It might be better to have the whole thing start from the moment wifi cuts out, and then progress through the next "few" (5) weeks of near constant almost death, so we are not just handed a shit ton of infor in a disorganized manner.

All that being said, this feels like a rough draft. I feel like I am being needlessly antagonistic, but actually writing and putting out stuff is important, and a very good start.
