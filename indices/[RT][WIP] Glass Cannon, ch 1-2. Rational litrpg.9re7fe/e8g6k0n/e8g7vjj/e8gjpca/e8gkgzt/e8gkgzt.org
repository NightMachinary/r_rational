> LITRPG is a genre with a lot of potential, but seems to often either stray from its game-like roots or just devolve into normal fantasy.

​

That happens because they keep going far longer than they should with the same character.

​

Either you finish the story after a certain point or you change the MC, most stories can't be stretched too far before qualify starts to decrease.

​

Book authors can keep a book series going for many, many volumes, in fact they'd make more money if they did. But money and popularity aren't the only things they are after..
