On second glance i agree, it reads awkwardly. I'll see if i can write something that fits better.

Also, the saga was my favorite series when i was like twelve-ish? That's 7 years ago so I've probably forgotten more than i wish i have. Might be time to both re-read and catch up on the newer ones. Hope it's as good as i remember.
