I think I'm going to go for rational-adjacent. My thought process was something weird like "LitRPG's are the most unrational thing possible, so something slightly rational would be very rational by comparison", but it is obviously stupid logic.

I also think rational-adjacent would be both more fun to write for me as a newbie-author (since i have some tropes to rely on), and a better read for LitRPG fans.

As for your questions about the story, i have answers to all of those. I don't want to reveal them for obvious reasons. I think it will be interesting to figure out the answers to them, as the technical parts of world building is probably what I'm most proud of.

I agree on the style part. I'm just going to write as much as i can, and if i want to change something I'll do it later. I don't think it would be very fun for me to start rewriting immediately.
