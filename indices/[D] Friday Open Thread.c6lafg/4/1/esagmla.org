Because of reasons, I've [[https://irradiate.space/worldbuilding/on-zeonism/][started taking notes]] on Zeonism, to figure out what its core tenets are and how it's changed over the course of the Universal Century timeline. It's interesting how the early statements fused purely-political goals (self-government for Spacenoids) with mystic ideas (Earth as sacred, Newtype theory). Most later expressions of Zeonism drop Newtype theory and even the sacredness of Earth, or justify harming Earth in order to preserve its sacred state from the voracious appetites of Earthnoids.
