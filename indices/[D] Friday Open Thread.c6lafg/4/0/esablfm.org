I try to embody the Martian state of mind from Heinlein's /Stranger in a Strange Land./ Obviously I can't do the time-manipulation shenanigans, but the idea of moving "very fast, but not in a hurry" resonates with me, and I think the detached-from-minutiae, invested-in-significance lifestyle that Valentine Michael Smith and his followers practice is a noble one.
