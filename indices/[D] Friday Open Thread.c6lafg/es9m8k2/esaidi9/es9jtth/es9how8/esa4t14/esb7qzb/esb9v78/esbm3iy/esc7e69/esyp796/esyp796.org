Rationalist poetry might have a surprisingly large audience, as verse, meter, and rhyme have an effect similar to a checksum, so a poem explaining a method or idea can be more easily remembered and communicated correctly than prose containing the same information. (armchair anthropologist moment: this is probably why poetry developed so early and makes up so much of oral traditions) This might make it appealing to any number of people interested in education, self help, or rationality in general who might not be all that into rational fiction recreationally.
