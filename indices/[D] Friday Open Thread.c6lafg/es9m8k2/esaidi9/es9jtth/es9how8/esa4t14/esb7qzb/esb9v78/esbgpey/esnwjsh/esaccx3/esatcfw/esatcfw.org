If you need help or have questions dealing with SV moderation, feel free to reach out to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/blazinghand.10736/][me]] on sufficient velocity. I'm on the Community Council there and can help with dealing with the moderation or any questions you may have. I don't actually have any mod powers and unless I get re-elected my term is up in a couple of months, but I might be able to help out.
