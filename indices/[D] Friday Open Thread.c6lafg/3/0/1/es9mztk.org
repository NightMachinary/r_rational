Yeah I grabbed it at a monoprix on impulse and immediately wondered if I'd get attitude for it - turns out the parisien reputation for rudeness is well-deserved ;)

I did actually have margarine in the fridge and a nice blue cheese I got from jay and joy - I'm going to use that cheese on the rest of the baguette for lunch tomorrow, I think!

I got a baguette de tradition from a local bakery nearby once but the bread was too spongy for me - I like the hard shell and the soft interior that I get from the ones at carrefour. Are baguettes tradition more often spongy or more often soft? I suppose I should just try a bunch more bakeries... you know, for science :)
