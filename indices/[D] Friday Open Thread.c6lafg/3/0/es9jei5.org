Well, it's always good for finishing up the sauce, but if you wanted us to finish the baguette, you should have brought something to spread on it; normally it'd be butter or cheese, I'm not sure what the vegan equivalent would be (fruit jam works, but it's more something you'd eat for breakfast).

Also the baguette was clearly industrially-processed bread, the kind you find in supermarkets. The baguettes you get fresh from the bakery are much better (especially the /baguette de tradition/).
