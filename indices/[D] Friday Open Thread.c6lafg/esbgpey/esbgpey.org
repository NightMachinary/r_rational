Well...a month and a half after visiting London, I expected to be longing to travel again. I planned to be planning out a new trip abroad for next summer. I'm not doing any of that.

Because right now I'm in Edinburgh, Scotland and making my way to Dublin, Ireland with a quick pit stop in Gualway. Does anyone have recommendations for any places I should see? This was a very pleasant last minute surprise vacation!
