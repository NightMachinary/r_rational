Week 1 of the campaign:

Just days after the war began our enemy launched a massive magical attack on the encampment making all of our dishware vanish.

Movement ground to a halt as we found ourselves suddenly unable to cook and serve food. All the pots and kettle's, gone, even improvised utensils vanishing from soldiers hands. We've been reduced to little more than animals, being forced to dump our meals onto the ground before the men scoop up their ration with bare hands. Even the quality of meals is impeded as a cook sampling from a pot results in the pot vanishing and the food being dumped into the fire.

I pray our mages discover a solution before those slaver monsters turn their witchcraft against our citizens.
