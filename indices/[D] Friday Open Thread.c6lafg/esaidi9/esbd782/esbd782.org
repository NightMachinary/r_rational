To be precise, the AI in question is only smart enough to consider the appropriateness of its language use and probably lacks any concious experience given that it lacks neural circutry for self-representation.

More than that, GPT-2 understands english very well - but it doesn't understand the world that english relates to. If you're wondering what the fuck that means, consider playing [[https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=w5s3sv43s3p98v45][The Gostak]], which is a text adventure that uses english syntax but a large fictional vocabulary with precisely zero connection to our world. Nothing is more instructive.

Sorry, [[/u/lumenwrites]] I know you knew that, but wanted to say this to provide context for anyone without much AI knowledge reading. It's not likely in this community, but still.
