I would like to compliment [[/u/CouteauBleu]] on being a good dinner guest, and to state that for the record, i bought the baguette as kind of a joke on how much french people like to eat bread with meals that don't in any way require it (i was offered one as accompaniment to /pad thai/, in a thai restaurant), and yet i'll be damned because both the frenchies were all over that baguette.
