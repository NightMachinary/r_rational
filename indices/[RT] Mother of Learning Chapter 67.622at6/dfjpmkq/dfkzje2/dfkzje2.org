What better way to keep an extremely proud/arrogant mage than to make her seem like forbidden fruit?

Honestly, the fact that mind magic is critical for their bee-keeping specialization, and one of their members tried to use mind magic on Zorian makes the theory more likely to me.

Damien is a natural mind mage (Not sure if the Taramatula are or not.), a genius known across his home country, has huge reserves of magic, and is looking for whatever hidden treasures the lost Ikosian emperor died with in Koth.

He also uses mind blank to defend himself with...suggesting he has little to no actual talent in defending himself from mental magics in other ways. Orissa (or whoever) could have gotten to him pretty easily.
