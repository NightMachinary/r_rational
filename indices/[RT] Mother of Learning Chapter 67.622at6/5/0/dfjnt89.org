Zorian discussed these techniques in chapter 54:

- Filtering out distractions. Potentially useful to ignore pain, discomfort, etc during combat.
- Blunting emotional highs. This sounds easy to abuse (the mind has emotions for a reason), but very powerful.
- Placing compulsions on oneself. Precommitment can be very potent. Also good for defeating akrasia.

The matriarch was also skilled at integrating perceptions of multiple aranea. If that kind of thing is available in their research notes, it would help Zorian to work better with his simulacra.
