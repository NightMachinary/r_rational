Is no one talking about the most exciting thing in the chapter for me? More deep mental self-manipulation!

I am interested to see what kind of stuff Zorian will end up learning in this field - possibly live-editing other people's senses to be effectively invisible or unnoticeable? We saw the Matriarch do this early-on-ish.

Will he become just straight-up more intelligent? I know high-level smart characters are intensely difficult to write, I'm sure everyone on [[/r/rational]] knows that. What's down the pike for this? We already have Zorian with essentially an eidetic memory, though he needs to actively choose the moments to remember at the time that they are happening.

What other stuff has been mentioned? Would a magical calculator be useful? Lots of room for creativity with this stuff! I am excited!
