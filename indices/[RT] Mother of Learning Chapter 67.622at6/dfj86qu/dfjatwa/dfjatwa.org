Considering Zorian would want Daimen's assistance for the rest of restart, refreshing his Koth simulacrum is the most reasonable to do. Meaning, he repeatedly open the gate to dismiss and recast simulacrum spell every, say, 2 or 3 days. Explaining this in the chapter can be tedious. I am fully agree with author to skip the detail.

Edit: I seem to miss the point. I blame it from early morning non-alertness.
