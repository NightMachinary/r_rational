Thanks for the reply :).

While we're on the subject of Black Rooms - how do they get a month's supply of air? I was thinking about whether Zorian could practice Alanic's fire magic inside, and realised it might consume all their oxygen, and then realised that it doesn't make sense to last 30 days anyway. Can they use alteration to convert CO2?
