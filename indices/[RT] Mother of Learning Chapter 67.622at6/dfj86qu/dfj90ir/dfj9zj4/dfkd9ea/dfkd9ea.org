There is possibly an easier way. Zorian goes to Cyoria (or any other strong manna well). Makes a simulacrum, and that simulacrum starts a teleport chain. Since Zorian is still in Cyoria, he and thus the simulacrum will have very high manna regeneration, and can thus teleport often. This should be doable right?
