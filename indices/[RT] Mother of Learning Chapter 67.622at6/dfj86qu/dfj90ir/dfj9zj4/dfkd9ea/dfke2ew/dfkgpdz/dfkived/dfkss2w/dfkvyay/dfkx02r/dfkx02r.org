One thing I overlooked in my initial maths was that mana regeneration is significantly reduced by the presence of active simulacra. Each one costs nearly a third of his regeneration, and since the point of sending one to Koth is to stay productive, he'll probably want to keep at least two around. So paying people - which could be optimised - remains much more attractive.

  Zorian and Zach seem to be able to teleport more often than that

Mana costs scale - faster than linearly - with range. So yes, they can teleport relatively often over short distances, but not continental ones.
