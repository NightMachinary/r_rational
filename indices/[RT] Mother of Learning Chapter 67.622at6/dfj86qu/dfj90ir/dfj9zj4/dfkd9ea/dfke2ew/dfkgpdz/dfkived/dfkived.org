Here's his comment from last month: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5pjv30/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_64/deer3ql/?st=j0vae7jj&sh=135e7db4]] He said it would be a 6 day grueling effort with Zorian alone, and a 3 day with considerable assistance from Zach.

He doesn't go into his calculations, but this is his story and he is an accountant after all.

Tired simulacrum are a non-issue, tired Zorian is, a few chapters back it was mentioned that they go inactive if he's sleeping. Presumably it would be Zach carting him around and teleporting him while he sleeps, and the same for when Zach is sleeping.

Mana regeneration caps out at anything higher than a rank 3 mana well, so being in Cyoria (rank 9) isn't truly necessary or helpful. The 30 minute estimate for mana doesn't take into account simulacra either, and I think Zorian caps out at 3 simulacra right now, which slows his mana regeneration to a trickle, making repeated long range teleports impractical. I think Zorian's just using 2 or so at a time at the moment, so that he and the simulacra have some spare mana for casting spells.

I get the impression now that his simulacra is still mostly relying on paying people to do teleports, and only occasionally using his own mana for it.
