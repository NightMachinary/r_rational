Ah, thank you for that link. I had not seen that post. It sometimes amazes me how much nobody103 spends thinking about details.

Using his information of 200 teleports, and 1 teleport every 30 minutes, which seems to be a high estimate given that both Zorian and Zach seem to be able to teleport more often than that, even with simulacrum of Zorian running around, I get around 4.4 days nonstop work, so then 6 days might be a good estimate without powernapping.

Ps, do you have other links where Mother of Learning is discussed, I only knew the [[/r/rational]] sub, I'd appreciate them
