I would like to suggest a solution. Since Zorian's simulacra already pointed safe places to put down relays (and open a gate, sometimes), then it is make sense if Zorian can simply chain-teleport through the them, albeit needing some time to replenish mana. This way, Zorian can cut the time to move from Eldemar to Koth. As a note, this is only applicable for Zorian who's just exiting the blackroom. Fresh restart will involve uncertain factors on relays' location that might hinder safe teleportation.
