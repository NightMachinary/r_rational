The issue is that the moment Zorian gets into the Black Room, he is cut off from the outside world and every simulacrum gets dispelled. Including one left in Koth. So he would have to send a simulacrum on a multi-day journey to Koth all over again once he gets out. Unless he teacher Daimen the Gate spell and arranges with him to open the gate at a predetermined moment in the future, which neatly sidesteps this problem.
