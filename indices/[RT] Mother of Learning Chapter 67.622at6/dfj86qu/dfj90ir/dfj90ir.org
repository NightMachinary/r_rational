Plot hole! Paging [[/u/nobody103]]

The only way I can think of a way to patch up this hole if we assume that the time of flight back to Koth was fast (so barring chained teleports) is if he taught Daimen the gate spell. They could have set up a predestined time to both activate the spell. Seeing how Daimen is a prescribed genius, it wouldn't be too hard to assume he could learn to cast the spell in a short time.
