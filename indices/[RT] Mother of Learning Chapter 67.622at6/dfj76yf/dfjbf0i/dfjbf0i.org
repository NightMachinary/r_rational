As for me, I couldn't imagine mage of Daimen's caliber would chase something lesser than the Key, if the rumor of his skill-level is to be believed.

At the body of the chapter, his reaction is fully in accord to his reputation. Calm, collected, cautious, while also confident and charming. The thing toward the end though, when he cackling amusedly, is a little out of character. I am imagining the respond like when Zorian gaves to Xvim (/That amount is the pocket change/) will suit him better. But I don't know, the same reaction would potentially make the novel repetitive.
