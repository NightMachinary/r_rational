I viewed that reaction like this: Daimen has been spending so much time searching and obsessing over this artifact for months or maybe over a year now. And then it turns out his baby brother was magically stuck in a time loop and one key to it all is the very artifact he wants to find?

Not only is the irony is maddening, but with Zorian's resources, he is very likely to finally find his treasure. I might cackle too! hahaha
