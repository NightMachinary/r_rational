There's not actually direct causation between "can cast Mind Blank" and "can take on the whole aranean web"; rather, being able to cast MB /implies/ a powerful caster, who presumably has sufficient combat skills to take on the web. Theoretically we could imagine a highly specialised caster who actually has no combat skills at all, but Novelty was making a point about using MB in combat.
