After reading this chapter, I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed. It's a well-written chapter with an efficient progression of the plot, but I was expecting drama with Daimen and to see a confrontation between the brothers over Zorian's psychic abilities and whether or not Daimen has any. I was even hoping to see more of Taramatulas to better understand the family but they barely say anything.

Basically, everyone was in character and mature enough to not act like people on a sit-com, but the chapter wasn't as exciting as I was hoping for and the cliffhanger was obvious coming from chapter #66.

The biggest point of interest is how from the very first meeting, one of the Taramatulas telepathically probed Zorian. It says a lot about a family if a member is so willing to do something potentially politically dangerous so soon after a first meeting. What it says is the question.

Daimen using mind blank so casually makes me think he had reason to worry about mind mages from the Taramatulas in addition to Zorian.
