It's my personal edited version, where I've largely caught up on the proofreading backlog (although I find more to do on each re-read), and carefully replaced/removed expletives. My aim is that if you haven't memorised the original text, you wouldn't notice that there's a substitution.

Of course, it now needs an update for chapter 67 :). Will probably do that in the next day or two.
