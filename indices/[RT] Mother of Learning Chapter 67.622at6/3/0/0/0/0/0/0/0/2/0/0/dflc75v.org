I think that changing those would be over-doing it. It's why I specifically brought up those two. I'm all for editing the spelling mistakes, typos and grammar whenever it's required, but not everyone talks like they're teaching a class of ten year olds, or says "blimey, that's quite unfortunate" when they could express the same emotions with more intensity with a simple "Fuck."

Oh, but if you're going above and beyond in editing, could you consider changing some of the "digest this" to "considered this"? The former expression was just used frequently for a few chapters for a while, then was dropped again. It just stood out to me as odd. Or some of the time passages, where they negotiate for hours about a deal. A single minute is a long time, when involved in a discussion. Half an hour should be more than enough to negotiate everything in details already, most of the time.
