Mind magic is probably how they control the bees they work with, so it's not really surprising.

I rather doubt her probe was ordered by someone else. Zorian is a bit of an unreliable narrator when it comes to standards on mind magic, but with the way he describes it she's barely Tinami level. Even if he was an ordinary mage reading his surface thoughts wouldn't be easy for her, so it makes no sense to use her to spy even if she's deniable.

My guess is Zorian is simply being himself and overthinking things. She was probably just interested and got more than she bargained for.
