I take that to mean just the opposite. :)

If the Taramatulas used mind magic I would expect one of:

- Lots of probes: mind magic users that aren't worried about exposing themselves like the aranea. They would likely be open about mind magic as well, since their use of it would be obvious to anybody else with much mind magic experience.
- A few skilled probes: trained and careful mind magic users who don't want to be exposed. They don't expect someone with aranea-caliber mind magic. A youth wouldn't be allowed to go probing people randomly because it could expose the whole house.
- No probes: they know what they're dealing with an don't want to be exposed.

A single probe from a youngster doesn't fit for me. That suggests they're not public about mind magic, but also aren't careful enough to keep their youngsters in line.

I don't think she's a canary (i.e. they ordered her to probe him) either. The worst case for them would be the probe turning Zorian hostile and him ripping the knowledge about mind magic out of her head.

I guess we'll find out soon enough.
