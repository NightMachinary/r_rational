That's probably because we're in the middle of an arc. There wasn't much tension when Zorian was wandering around the countryside working for Gurey or delving in Knyazov Dveri's dungeon, either.

I have no doubt that the tension will return when they have to fight in the real world, where death is permanent, the primordial might actually get loose, Red Robe may still be unaccounted for judging by how things are going on that front, the invaders have an army of demons added in, and they'll have to deal with Quatach-Ichl /permanently/ in some fashion. Bearing in mind that they have no idea where his phylactery is on Ulquaan Ibasa, it likely has insane defences, and if they banish him, he's powerful enough to teleport back with his new body within hours, and he'll be out for blood (or souls).
