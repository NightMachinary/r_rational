Nah, I don't actually consider the result to be kid-friendly. "Adult themes" at the very least...not to mention Zorian shooting RR in the chest, destroying the minds of cultists for deep memory probing practice, destabilising a magical sphere of blood that came from gruesomely-sacrificed 8-year-olds...

It's just me-friendly.
