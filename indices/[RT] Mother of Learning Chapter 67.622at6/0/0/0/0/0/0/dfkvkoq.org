The lich is not a Controller. The lich does not have a soul marker that actively responds to the presence of Keys.

But it's also possible for the keys to persist in some other fashion, eg you bring one of them to the Gate, the Guardian registers that you brought it, and you get extra privileges, without needing to bring that one back again.
