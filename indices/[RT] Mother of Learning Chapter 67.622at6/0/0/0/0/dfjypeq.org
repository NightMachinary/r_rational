I'm pretty sure the erasure is a Controller function, not a Key function. And the dagger is locked away in the treasury. But yeah, quite possibly they all give benefits.

My big question is, what happens to the keys when the loop resets? Do they have to collect all 5 in the same iteration, or will the keys stay with them somehow?
