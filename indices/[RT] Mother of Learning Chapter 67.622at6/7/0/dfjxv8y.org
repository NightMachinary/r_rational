Nah. Knowing myself, I would just spend too much time on it and end up pissing people off, because a fair amount of people would think I was being serious.

Here is some ideas, though:

Zorian spends the entire chapter tinkering with a complicated assembly of pocket dimensions and mental compulsions that is eventually revealed to be unmistakably a pokeball. "Grey hunter, I chose you!"

Zach and Zorian finally escape from the time loop, only to find themselves on a deserted beach, with a broken down statue of liberty before them. Zach remarks he has the strangest urge to shout "NOOO!" all of the sudden.

Zorian builds a giant +mecha+ /armor golem/ and uses it to fight Sudomir's bone dragon in an Epic Battle of Epic History. Everyone around is just watching and providing over the top commentary, like it's an episode of JoJo or something.

Red Robe is revealed to Kirielle and Nochka standing on each other's shoulders. They did it all in a mad plot to get All The Cookies^{TM.}
