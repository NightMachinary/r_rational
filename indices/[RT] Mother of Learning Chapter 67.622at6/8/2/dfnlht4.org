On the contrary, I think it just got more plausible. Daimen couldn't find the Orb after months of searching, even with the help of his fiancee's family: "I'm close to finding it, I know I am, but I just can't seem to zero in on the actual location. I don't understand. We combed through the whole region -- and I know it's the correct region -- but everything is just..." That sounds like Daimen got close but was misdirected. The biggest suspect for this misdirection is from a family of mind mages: aka, the Taramatula family. They may have found the artifact & used it to establish their power. I find it likely the Taramatula family decided to kill two birds with one stone. By manipulating Daimen, they kept their powerful artifact hidden & gained a psychic bloodline.
