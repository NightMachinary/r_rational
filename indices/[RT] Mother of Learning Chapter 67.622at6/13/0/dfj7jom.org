I think exactly the opposite. Mind Blank cuts the psychic from The Web, granting absolute defense but at the cost of all offense and utility.

He has potential, maybe some innate abilities, but he is not trained. Not trained enough to consider his psychic skills outweigh the defense of MB, at least. Zorian for instance would not use MB.

On a side note, the Tama... the Bee family probably wants his psychic genes.
