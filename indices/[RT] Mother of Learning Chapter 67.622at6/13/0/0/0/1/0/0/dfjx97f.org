Zorian met a lot of people from the bee family, and none of them struck him as Open. So unless there is a serious flaw in Zorian's perception, they aren't natural mind mages.

But that doesn't mean much, Aopes aren't Open either.

I think Orissa knows that Daimen is a psychic, but more importantly knows he is an untrained one. He doesn't know his full value and thus is easier to bargain with. And as a house relying on mind magic, they are /really/ interested to weave some innate ability into their family tree. Remember how Tinami got excited at the prospect of becoming a psychic through some dangerous untested experiment? Same here, through good old safe matrimony.

I wonder whether Daimen's recent failures in his searches are purely coincidental or are a result of sabotage from bee family, though.
