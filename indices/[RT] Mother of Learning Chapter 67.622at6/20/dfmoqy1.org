Btw, [[/u/nobody103]], not sure if you're willing to answer me, but just in case, I'll still ask. Does Zach really not have anyone he'd like to bring in on the time loop, like Zorian does with Taiven, Kael, Alanic and Xvim? Has he really not met anyone who he believes could be useful to drag along? And why aren't they trying to approach Kyron for assistance as well?
