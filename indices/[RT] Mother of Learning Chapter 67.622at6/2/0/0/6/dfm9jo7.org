I just thought of another potential issue. How rare is the Gate spell?

Presumably you have more than one person in each country who knows the Gate spell. It can't be that rare can it? Lets put a theoretical lower bound of one person per country. Say this Gate spell user from Country A has a vendetta against Country B. He could groom a loyal student such that the student learns the Gate spell, no matter how long it takes. The student then goes through the bureaucracy of international travel (Chapter 64, where it states teleporting between countries is slow because of nations wanting to secure their borders). The student then opens a dimensional gate with the help of the teacher connecting Country A to Country B allowing for an invasion.

You wouldn't even need a vendetta. If there is any mage who knows the gate spell under a warmongering government, it seems like it makes it extremely easy for discreet mass movements of people.

So if this is a well known method on how to use the Gate spell, in a world where it seems like there are plenty of imperialistic governments and ill sentiments (Noble houses resenting current governments), it would put the instability of this world at an unrealistic level.

You indicate [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/622at6/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_67/dfjhwls/]] here that other mages do in fact use the gate spell like this, which is why I assume that the spell isn't so rare that there are only a handful of people in the entire world who know how to use it.
