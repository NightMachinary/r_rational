If you looked at the political map of Altazia, you would immediately see that states do indeed have a lot of issues holding themselves together...

That aside, the thing that makes such Gate use impractical for invasions is that:

1. In MoL-verse, there are no mages that can solo entire armies by themselves. If you want to conquer a country, you need to bring an army. Gating in a small battlegroup would be insufficient to even conquer the tiny statelets that exist between major nations.

2. Transporting an entire army in this way would be very slow. Armies are big things with thousands of people, and they come with supplies, war machines, war beasts, and so on.

3. States routinely run patrols and divination of their territory. This is not enough to catch individual mages like Z&Z or small groups violating border security, but any attempt to establish a beachhead for an invasion would be caught very quickly.

4. You cannot supply an army with a single mage gating in things. So this maneuver would quickly see your invasion force run out of ammo, food and such.

5. The student is vulnerable to assassination, and you can bet that the defenders will pull every trick they can to get rid of him (and thus the army's ability to gate reinforcements).

6. If you get put into a bad situation, you cannot easily retreat because you are deep in enemy territory and have no fallback point. You could lose the entire invasion force very easily if things go wrong.

7. There are more than two nations in any given region. If you are committing your army to a distant battlefield, you cannot defend against your regional enemies.

The end result is that a Gate can only be used in this way to conduct raids, terror missions and spitefully go down in a blaze of glory. Which is indeed a known danger. Countries generally try not to back powerful mages and groups into corners because then they have a tendency to use their 'last resort' type magics... and all powerful mages and groups have at least one of those.
