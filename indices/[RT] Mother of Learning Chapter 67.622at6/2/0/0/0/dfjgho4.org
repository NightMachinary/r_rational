hahaha I like your honesty! I was curious about this as well. I forget if the answer to the following was fully explained.

So, to get to Koth in the first place, Zorian used mental relays to inform his simulacrum in Koth that it was time to construct the gate spell?

Or did they agree to check in with each other via the gate spell at regular intervals?

And then perhaps before the black box, Daimen found someone among the Taramatulas to create the Koth side of the gate. The Taramatulas are collecting powerful mages after all. Although, I feel it would be a house liability to link with an unknown gate source.

Perhaps having Daimen learn gate /is/ the easiest solution. Could he really learn it so quickly though? It took Zorian a lot of time learning dimensionalism before he could successfully cast gate, which I believe is the pinnacle of the common variety of dimensional magic (with dimensional pockets the purview of exceedingly rare dimensional magic).
