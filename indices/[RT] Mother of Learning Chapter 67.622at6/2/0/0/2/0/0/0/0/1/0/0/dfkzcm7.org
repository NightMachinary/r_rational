Only problem is that we never see them chain teleports or exhaust their mana from teleporting when traveling around the Eldemar kingdom. It's tough to get a good idea of exactly how far they can go with the basic teleport spell, or how much of their reserves get used up for a max range teleport. Judging from the maps, Cirin to Cyoria or Kynazov Dveri really should be near the range limit for the spell.

Here's my list of factors that affect the mana consumption of teleport:

*Divination component (reduced by divination shaping mastery)

*Dimensional component (reduced by dimensional shaping mastery)

*Range (influences both divination and dimensional components)

*Additional weight (passengers)

*Familiarity with destination (influences divination component)

*Overall shaping skill

*Overall spell mastery

*Teleport beacons and wards
