thrawnca put together a post with almost every MoL link: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/5v0zl0]]

nobody103 has said in a couple places that he had done a lot of world building, and then decided it would be fun/worthwhile to try writing in the world and figuring out/adding new stuff to it, which I think we're all appreciative of.

I don't think either you or thrawnca or I are entirely content with his math, but like I said, he's the author. Even after adding in 12 hours for the two extended range teleports that require long rituals, it still feels like the Koth trip should be shorter to me too.

Mostly though, it would feel like a waste for the characters to spend a big chunk of their limited remaining time (maybe a fifth of it?) just traveling to get to necessary locations, and that will be an even bigger issue for the other Key pieces on other continents later. So there was a need for Z&Z to develop a faster method of travel, such as the Bakora Gates.

Edit: I took too long writing my post, got ninjaed by thrawnca.
