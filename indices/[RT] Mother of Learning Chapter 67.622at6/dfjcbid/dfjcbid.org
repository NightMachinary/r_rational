I am fully aware, Zorian cannot make a scene at Taramatula's estate, so he can only wait until Daimen is ready before he ask for his assistance. On the other hand, Daimen cannot be careless if his little brother's life is at stake in light of high-skill magic demonstrated by suspicious Zorian-shaped guy. It's full of restrained excitement! I love it.
