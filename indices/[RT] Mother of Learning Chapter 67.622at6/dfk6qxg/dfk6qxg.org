What if the giant bees are actually highly intelligent and psychic? (sort of Koth's analogue of aranea).

The bees are the ones mind-controlling the Taramatula family, not the other way around, pretending to be dumb servant animals to maintain the illusion in the eyes of other human communities. That's their way of attaining power and safety, kind of like how the Cyorian aranea planned to integrate into Cyorian society.

That'd also explain their interest in Daimen - as they would instantly recognize him as "Open".
