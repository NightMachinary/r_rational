Fair enough, /however/ the immediate danger is not the most important one.

Let's consider following scenario: there's a significant modification to fake!Zorian. This modification doesn't cause any apparent insanity, but it does make this simulacrum hostile towards Zorian, and intelligent enough to not show it.

Let's also say that evil!Zorian is dispatched to deal with a task (like searching libraries in Kotch), and is far away from Zorian.

That gives evil!Zorian a lot of possibilities when it comes to potentially harm Zorian:

- He can learn a special spell, potion or technique, or just come up with a way to disable Zorian
- He can stealthily modify other Simulacrums, so that they will work together against the original
- He can give Zorian inconspicuous information for future evil!Zorians to use to further their own plans ('Hmmm? Advanced mind magic? Using potions to increase your psychic powers? Quite useful'). It's even more potent if the simulacrum will be dispelled after a set period of time (Remember that prank they pulled off with Akoja? Now imagine they went a step further...).
- He can even, in the end-game, escape the loop instead of the real!Zorian (just like alleged simulacrum of Zach's did).
