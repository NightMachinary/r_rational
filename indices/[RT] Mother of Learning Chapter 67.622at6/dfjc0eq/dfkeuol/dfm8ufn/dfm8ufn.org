Simulacrum have their own mind. This is supported by the fact that the simulacrum need to give original Zorian memories vs. intrinsically already having the memories if they shared the same mind. If you fuck the simulacrum's mind up, just dispell the simulacrum. I'm pretty sure it was fleshed out more concretely somewhere else that part of simulacrum creation is the creation of a fake mind but I can't find it right now. The only precaution is that you probably want to incapacitate the simulacrum in case it goes insane and starts randomly lashing out.
