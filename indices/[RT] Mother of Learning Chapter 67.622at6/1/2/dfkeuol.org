He would need a lot of safety precautions for that. This is the most direct way to change a Zorian, and who knows what will happen to them.

If he ever gets the hang of compulsions (which were used by Cyorian matriarch), he could make his simulacrums a lot more safe and productive. Imagine all of them having the compulsion to not work against Zorian, and focus on their jobs.

Wonder what else he could do to their minds? Make them re-purpose parts of their minds for specific tasks, like learning the local language, so that original Zorian can just 'download' the lessons from them? Or maybe completely change the senses and perspectives of some of them, so they can come to some real creative solutions (I mean, just a few near-death experiences changed the Zorian from the grey hunter ambush somewhat).

So exciting!
