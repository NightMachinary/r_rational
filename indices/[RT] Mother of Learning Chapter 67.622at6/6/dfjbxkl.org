Judging from careless mind-probe from Taramatula younger member, I suspect the family has established mind-magic tradition, training their young so they can secure the House's future. Considering how useful mind-magic can be, that little girl just get cocky (or other more political reason like our most suspecting MC speculated). I love to imagine how would Aopes react when Zorian share this info.
