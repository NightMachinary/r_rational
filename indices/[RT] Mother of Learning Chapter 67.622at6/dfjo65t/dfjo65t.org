This is still such a great story! /squeeee!/

- Interesting new plot/drama setup with the Taranatanatlurna mind mage girl
- Damien mind-blanking constantly says there may be interesting things we have yet to hear about where Koth politics is concerned. (possibly related to the mind mage girl?)
- Damien is looking for a key piece (no surprise) means new mini-arc in the epic quest
- setup for new learning montage & power level-up via learning of a safe way to start on 'inner' mind techniques.

As always I can't wait for the next update!
