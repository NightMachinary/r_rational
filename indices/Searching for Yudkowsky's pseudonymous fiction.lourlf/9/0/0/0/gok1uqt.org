It has occurred at least once that a work I wrote under a pseudonymous name while making no effort at /all/ to disguise my style, was posted directly to [[/r/rational]] without anybody suggesting it was me. Honestly I was a bit surprised by that! I guess that case, plus my experience writing "team tyler's van" with Alicorn, suggests that - even on those occasions where I've made zero effort to disguise my style, and am naming characters "Haroun Pevers, curious boy" - it takes either a lot of cumulative writing, or an extended exposure over time, before people start to perceive such a thing. (The readers got it eventually for "team tyler's van" but it took a while.)
