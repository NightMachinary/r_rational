This whole experiment is pseudo-mystic mumbo-jumbo. It may or may not have happened (My guess it is did happen, but like any stage magician Yudkowsky was simply careful in selecting the right volunteers), but it's obviously designed to build a cult of personality around Yudkowsky personally, and not for any scientific rigor.

The whole "I have a cunning argument that would convince anyone, but I'm keeping it secret" stick to just so transparent. I don't understand why people fall for it.
