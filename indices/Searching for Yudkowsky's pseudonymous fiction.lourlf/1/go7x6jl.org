I mean, think about what this thread is going to turn into (and likely how previous ones on the topic have ended up, I haven't been deep in here for long), it becomes a pseudo-recomendation and analysis thread of other rational works where people actively engage with the connection between the work and the author. Also, puzzles are fun, and any amount of hype and mystery isn't going to hurt EY's own work.

Also maybe it's much less deeply rational and EY wants to be able to write something that's less serious. Or maybe he wants to be able to write something with out dragging his reputation into the discussion, or triggering people's biases/putting them on guard. Or maybe the hint not being revealed after so long was just because he likes trolling people sometimes (if he steps in here to "reveal" and instead links a rickroll then I'm on point with this. Except now we all know to look for it so he won't do it. Unless he wants to move up another level and does it anyway. Ad infinitum).
