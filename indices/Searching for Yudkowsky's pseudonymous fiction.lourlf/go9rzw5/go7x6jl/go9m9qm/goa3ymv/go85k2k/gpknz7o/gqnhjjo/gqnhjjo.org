This is a bit late for the post but I feel like thinking out loud somewhere about this and might as well do it here. So like the thing that feels more like stuff that eliezer writes that I've seen is seeking power. But but the author is obiously not eliezer due to other stuff(like them having a patreon)

I once wondered if eliezer had written forty millenniums of cultivation because he did say he thought of trying to pass of "a girl corrupted by the internet is the summoned hero" as a translated Japanese light novel. (also this means that he might actually have done that for the thing where he changed writing stile) , but forty milleniums of cultivation is actually in Chinese and has stuff that make it very unlike the kind of thing eliezer would write, even if does seem like the author thinks along similar lines sometimes so definitely no.

Anyway extra thoughts, the pseudonym also can't have posted too much other stuff(unless it's an account eliezer uses often for stuff he doesn't want under his name) , probably only wrote a single fic and is most likely newer than eliezers account (though that doesn't narrow it down much) They also almost certainly aren't a regular in the discord. It's possible eliezer is on the discord under that name and has maybe even said something at some point there but definitely not regularly. It's most likely something short, doubt eliezer expends that much time writing.

It's also possible I haven't actually read whatever eliezer has written.

It's also been recommended more than once. And that might discard stuff the authors posted on r/r. It's maybe in hfy.

Could be a glowfic like he might just have more than one glowfic account. Glowfics that have been recommended is probably a smaller category.

I guess he could have written friendship is optimal, even if it's really not his style. Don't know enough about the author to discard it.
