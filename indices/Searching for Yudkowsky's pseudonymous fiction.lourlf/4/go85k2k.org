  if you consider your fiction instructive why not reveal it for the benefit of the underprivileged who have no time to read a lot?

a better question is perhaps "why reveal the existence of pseudonymous fiction in the first place?" I'd've thought there was a general collective incentive /not/ to go thinking too hard about pseudonyms, but stuff like this places more scrutiny on works by seemingly-throwaway accounts, which makes it harder for people to write pseudonymously (regardless of their reasons)
