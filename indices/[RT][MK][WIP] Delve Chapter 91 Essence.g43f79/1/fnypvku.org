It's too bad Rain doesn't know calculus, he would've figured out that it's almost time to switch to training sync instead (assuming his initial training predictions were both off by the same amount).

- Effective Strength = (Base + Tolerance) * Sync

Writing that as symbols:

- E = TS

Taking the derivative with respect to time:

- dE/dt = T dS/dt + S dT/dt

He can only train one of them at a time, so the formula has two options:

- dE/dt = 47(0/day) + 0.24(5/day)
- dE/dt = 47(0.02/day) + 0.24(0/day)

Solving:

- dE/dt (Tolerance training) = 1.2/day
- dE/dt (Sync training) = 0.94/day

For reference, sync training before the tolerance training would have given a predicted 0.56 points per day. Assuming that he doesn't change his predicted relative rate of gains, he should switch over when (Base + Tolerance) = 60, so he's about halfway there now.
