My guess is that he's still exploring the connection between essence and experience, and he'll keep exploring it until he's out for a long time longer. Like, another 50+ chapters away.

He's only got five days of food (less since I don't think he accounted for exercise), and with his new exp exploit (708k in day, which is ridiculously faster than previously), the story would simply fall apart if he could gain a dozen levels in a week.

Still, there's a lot of stuff it can be useful for until he figures it out. All the non-level fuzzy stuff seems to scale with it. But if he can start to break down some of the RPG-ness of the system, he can get all sorts of benefits without a strict level increase.
