He should be able to easily get 20x that, if he figures it out. Refrigerate, Extend, Amplify = 450 mana/s. Channel 1% to bring it down to 4.5/s, and alternate 1:2 Refrigerate:Winter to keep his mana up. Instead of 8.2 XP/sec, he'd be averaging 150 XP/s (from one-third of 450/s from Refrigerate).

He could get ~650/s if he /really/ tried, though. Refrigerate, extend, amplify, focus = 1350 mana/s * 0.01 channel (reduces it to 9-10 DPS), with possible flipflopping with Immolate to deal with the mageburn. Alternate offensive aura use with Winter singularities ~1:1 for sustainability, and he's good.

Now I want Velika get him a Blue and tell him to only come back when he's capped again. Heck, he might even surpass Carten's bets if that happens.

EDIT: Channel goes down to 0%, doesn't it? 1350 XP/s, there he goes.
