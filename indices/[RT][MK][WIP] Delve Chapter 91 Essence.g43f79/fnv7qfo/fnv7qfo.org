Oh snap, did Rain just turn into a Wuxia Cultivator?

Essence is the power of the 'soul', and he can improve his soul through expending EXP. Rain is already stronger in his soul than other people of his level, as noted by the Watch's truthtelling ability.

Rain's most recent development arc is the difference between stats and potential, and how you can raise up potential, then later raise up stats. It sounds like he's going to (eventually) take it to the meta level and do that with his soul -eg level cap. That's completely setting breaking. I guess it explains how the Majistraal (and everyone else) used to be orders of magnitude more powerful in the past.

Still, it's amusing that he's (eventually) going to figure out how to raise his level cap... by sitting and meditating. Effectively a wuxia cultivator.

Also find it amusing that people on royal road hate this chapter so much and call it filler. Last week, I joked that the story was about Rain sitting down and doing math and that it was the best part of the story, but it really is. Crazy that they think it's filler, while I think this is potentially one of the most important chapters in the story.
