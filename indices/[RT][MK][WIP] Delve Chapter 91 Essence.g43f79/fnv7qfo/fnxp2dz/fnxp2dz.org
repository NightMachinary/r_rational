  Also find it amusing that people on royal road hate this chapter so much and call it filler.

Hah, just wait until next week, they might get even more pissed. All the buildup just turns into him getting a fucking pet. And for a moment you think the pet is somehow gonna be a secret to him leveling up somehow like maybe he can level up pets. Nope, just a fucking pet that Rain finds cute.. It almost made me cancel my Patreon subscription. I'm 8 chapters ahead and nothing OP has come out of this little session. I like the math and detail in delve, but much of it is starting to seem self-serving. Its math and numbers for the sake of numbers. But none of it is playing into the story heavily.

1. Rain seems to have gotten no advantage from his heavy use of math. Someone not knowing any math could copy his exact build specs. No one chooses to do so, because its mostly a horrible build for an adventurer.
2. Rain has not discovered anything new or interesting due to math or munchkinry. In fact, without his armor and gear, he'd be horribly underpowered for his level because he chose a highly specialized build path. Doing something like Amelia's build and diverse skill set probably would have been way more useful for him.
