I'm also on the same train as you (also ahead and at chapter 100) and it is getting quite dull to be honest. Like it is almost as if the author didn't plan ahead enough with how the exp gains worked considering he got to lvl 18 so fast but he can't seem to improve anything at all in the last half of the novel.
