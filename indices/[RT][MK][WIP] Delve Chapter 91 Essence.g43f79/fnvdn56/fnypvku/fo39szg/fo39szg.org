After he gets out of the hole, the optimization becomes more complicated since he will no longer be concentrating on strength alone. If he wants to use his ring to boost multiple attributes, he has to take into account that the ring has a total boost cap (287), so at some point that cap makes it more rewarding to increase sync than tolerance, because increasing sync does not require any additional boost points in order to increase the effective attribute, whereas improving the tolerance only increases the effective attribute if additional ring points are allocated to the attribute.

It may seem like 287 is a big number and that is not a concern for now, but if you consider that Rain already has 200 points of tolerance in Clarity and Focus alone, it could be a concern soon. Especially if he finds a use for very high effective focus or clarity, in which case he could probably quickly train the tolerance above 287 total between those attributes alone. Then if he wants to increase a non-mental effective attribute, his only choices would be to increase sync for that attribute or reduce ring points allocated to focus or clarity.
