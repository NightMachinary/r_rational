He had no knowledge of anything in the beginning. I don't remember the circumstances of his class selection anymore, but he is still learning "basic" things others know. He had no way of figuring out a good class anyway. Sometimes you just have to do decisions without full knowledge of stuff and of course that fits a rationalist story.

He needs to keep minmaxing his shit and learn more. It's not a prebuilt class and he could fuck it up too, as the resources (skillpoints) are limited.

And he would have needed to get something intelligence related obviously if the story was going to be about a smart dude.

Edit: And nobody would have told him their build anyway.
