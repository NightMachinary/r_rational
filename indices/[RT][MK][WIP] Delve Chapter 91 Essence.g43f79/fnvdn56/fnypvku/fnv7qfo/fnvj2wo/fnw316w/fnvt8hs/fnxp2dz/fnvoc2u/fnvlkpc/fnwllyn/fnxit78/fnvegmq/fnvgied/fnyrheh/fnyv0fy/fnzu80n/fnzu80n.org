  His current lifetime cap accumulation is 330k.
#+end_quote

I'm fairly sure that's lifetime /spent/ (including unlocks), and any extra is just lost.

EDIT: I'm fairly sure it's XP spent, not earned. IIRC, there are 144 trees, so 144 * (100 + 1000) + 6 * 10000 = 218k on unlocking trees. That would leave 112k for leveling (I forget the formula), and nothing wasted.

  We'd certainly have noticed if he was capable of pulling in 50 million exp a day.
#+end_quote

I'm not so sure about that. Were there any days where he a) used climate control or another similar setup and b) didn't expect to reach his XP cap? He reached his level cap so early (and started unlocking trees so late) that I'm not sure.
