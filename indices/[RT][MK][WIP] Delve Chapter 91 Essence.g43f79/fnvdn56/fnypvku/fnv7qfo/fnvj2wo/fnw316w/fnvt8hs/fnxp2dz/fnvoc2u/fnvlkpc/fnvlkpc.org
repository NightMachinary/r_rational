I mean, the revelation i guess is pretty important but the chapter itself was really short and without much fanfare. This revelation is the only thing really worth mentioning here. It is important for the setting but on its own its not a difficult discovery for rain i feel like. In general i am pretty annoyed with the latest chapters where rain is stuck in a hole and doesnt use his skills to try and break rocks. I would feel like immolate and refrigerate would make the rock brittle and he could also try to purify rocks as well. He might also train at the same time as well and it might improve his soul strenght....

instead he does pushups which....are important i guess but i dont think he super needs it in this situation. Its just weird and kills the pacing of the story for me.
