Any time a chapter is posted on RoyalRoad, a new chapter is also posted on the Patreon. So today chapter 99 was released on patreon.

IIRC this is also the case with thursday bonus chapters when they happen.

The gap between the chapters on patreon and royalroad hasn't increased while I've been a patron (a few months now), I don't think.
