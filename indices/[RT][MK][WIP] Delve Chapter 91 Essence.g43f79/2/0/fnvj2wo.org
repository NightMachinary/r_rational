My current guess is that the Majistraal were the ones to create the system, and before that their mages originally worked by manipulating mana directly.

As a patron, regarding this chapter, (tiny spoiler) this chapter definitely seems /very/ important, as you predicted.

Readers on RoyalRoad have... interesting tastes. A lot of the top stories on the site are just trash - as in clearly written with little to no forethought and sometimes very little writing skill. Basically: "your boos mean nothing to me, I've seen what makes you cheer".

(And RoyalRoad is /also/ the home to some excellent amateur fiction that clearly has a lot of effort and thought put into it, just to be clear.)
