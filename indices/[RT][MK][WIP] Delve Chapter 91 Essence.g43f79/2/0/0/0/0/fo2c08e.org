I absolutely did! In about a week, I dropped forty-ish ranks on Royalroad, and since then have slid another sixty or so. It kinda sucks, but at the same time... I don't ever want to change how I write to appease people who give one star ratings to anything that's mildly gay.

Also, the first person who ever dropped into my discord server to tell me they liked the story had been shipping James and Anesh for twenty chapters, and I could never disappoint /him/.
