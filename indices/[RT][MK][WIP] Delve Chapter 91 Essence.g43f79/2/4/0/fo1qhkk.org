Yeah, I had someone tell me "To be honest, 4 chapters in a month for a fiction start does not look very promising..." Personally, I've always thought that a consistent once-per-week cycle was pretty good so this really took me by surprise. Sure, it was four chapters, but it was almost 25,000 words.
