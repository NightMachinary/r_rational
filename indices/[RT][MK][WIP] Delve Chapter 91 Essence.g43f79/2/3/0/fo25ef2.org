  Doing something like Amelia's build and diverse skill set probably would have been way more useful for him.

Not. He needed to get the language fast. He needed to get the XP fast. He would be horribly underleveled for the stuff he does right now with other builds.

He also gets a lot of friends because he can fill their mana.

This is literally the one build that let him, as a noob, rise to where he is right now. And because this is a story, it's the build that allows him to beat his future challenges, because he is unique and can do stuff that others can not. Instead of being "the chosen one" and having some OP power, he is working with the same system everyeone else is.
