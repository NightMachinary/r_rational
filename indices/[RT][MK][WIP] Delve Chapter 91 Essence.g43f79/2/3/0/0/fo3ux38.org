  Not. He needed to get the language fast. He needed to get the XP fast. He would be horribly underleveled for the stuff he does right now with other builds.

I think we know that now in hindsight. How the hell could he have known these things when he chose his build? That undermines a bit of the rationalist premise for the story. He stumbled onto a decent build for a transmigrator.

A dynamo focused on straight-up magic spells rather than auras might have also been a deadly combination. It's clear the dynamo aspect of his build is what allows him to get so many XP points so quickly.
