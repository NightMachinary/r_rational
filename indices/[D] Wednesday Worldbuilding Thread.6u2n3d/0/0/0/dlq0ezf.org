Yep, that's exactly what I did. I ripped off the Crypt Titans [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/137962/Iron-Edda-War-of-Metal-and-Bone][from an RPG setting]] and threw in some [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism?from=Main.Gnosticism][Gnostic]] Romans with a King Arthur expy. Unfortunately, my creativity has limits so the few names I came up with are /extremely/ obvious references.
