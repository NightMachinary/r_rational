I don't have the talent to write or run it, but I can see the setting being used for either. I just had a flash of inspiration and wrote this out with the intention of leaving plot hooks if anyone wanted to do something with it. Personally, like to play it in a fantasy RPG with a GM who could bring it to life and settle on what the focus of the story should be.
