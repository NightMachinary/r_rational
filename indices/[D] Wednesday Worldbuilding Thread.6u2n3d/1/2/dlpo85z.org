You can control 100 spirits which have telekinetic power. Each one has a (pseudo) mass of 1 kg, and can exert 50N of force.

When you attach a spirit to an object, it attempts to move both the object and itself in the direction you want; if you're trying to move a 1g ball bearing, it would require moving the bearing /and the spirit/, resulting in 50 N vs. 1.001 kg. You can add spirits indefinitely, but that doesn't help much for small objects: 5000 N vs. 100.001 kg isn't much better.

Spirits also have a very tenuous grasp on the objects. They do not add any momentum to them from an outside perspective.

This also limits you to controlling a maximum of 100 different objects at a time, though that may never come up with normal human multitasking.

As written, you can shoot something light at ~5g, hover 400 kg, or pull a 25 ton ship at trolling speeds.

EDIT: as for restricting it to "tactile", the spirits live within you and flow out to any object that you touch, spreading until they find the edges (however they define that) and giving you control over the whole thing.
