I've been trying to work out some rules for tactile telekinesis (telekinesis, but you need to be touching the thing), namely in how to define it.

The spell /Mage Hand/ allows you to move up to 10 pounds of material up to 30 ft. per 6 seconds, but doesn't have any rules about slowing down as more weight is added, making me think that aside from the weight limit, it's weight invariant. I think that's a sensible way for telekinesis to work in D&D, because it eliminates a lot of math, but in prose fiction or a computer game, I think adding some simplicity that generates complexity might be good.

For example, "you have the ability to generate 10 newtons of telekinetic force". =F = ma=, so =a = F/m=, which means that if mass is =1 gram= then acceleration is 10,000 m/s^{2} and then I'd have to do some math to figure out how long you could actually apply that force before the mass was out of your reach in order to determine speed.

I'm having a little trouble making this workable and I'm wondering whether anyone has any bright ideas of how to quantify telekinetic ability in a scalable way, i.e. I want to be able to plug in /x/ for telekinetic power and get increasing tiers of power.

(One of the popular fan theories for Superman is that all of his abilities ultimately descend from tactile telekinesis, and that's sort of what I'm trying to create from base principles, but maybe with some neat unexpected things too. The powers:

- Superman is invulnerable because he holds his body together with telekinetic power.
- Superman can catch a plane without punching through its aluminum skin or tearing it apart with mechanical stress because he's applying telekinetic force.
- Superman can fly because he telekinetically lifts himself.
- Superman can stop bullets because he uses subconscious telekinesis.
- Superman can hit people really hard because he puts telekinetic power behind the punch.

This works less well when you consider things like heat vision, cold breath, etc.)
