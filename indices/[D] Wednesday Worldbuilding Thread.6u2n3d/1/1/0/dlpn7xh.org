Hrm, I think cutoffs for both absolute speed /and/ absolute acceleration are probably what I'll end up doing, probably scaling with increases in newtons of force. I'll have to monkey with the numbers a bit to see what gets the sort of "rich" effects that I'm looking for (e.g. raising a hand and stopping a sword that's slicing right toward you, being able to fly, using a stack of quarters like an automatic machine gun).

The next question would be "speed and acceleration relative to what", but "the ground" or "the user" would probably be the simple answers (that might give weird results).
