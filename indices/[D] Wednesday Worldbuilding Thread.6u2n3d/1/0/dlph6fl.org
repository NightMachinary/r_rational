Earth acceleration is 9.8 you could round it up to 10 for slightly easier calculation. If object is so heavy that you can't lift it with acceleration faster than 10m/s2 then you can't lift it.

So easiest way to do it is do your a = F/m and for objects with a <10 you can't lift them at all.

This could simplify a lot of things. If you have one character with know F you can just created quick excel document and you can just add a mass of any object character tries to move and see if it is more or less than 10.

Things will change in situation like under water or moving object horizontally rather than up and down. But should give you some basics from which you can start.
