Is that how power is normally calculated?

Imagine that you have a 1 kW motor attached to a winch and a 100 kg weight. If you run it for 10 seconds, I would call that 10 kJ of work (assuming 100% efficiency).

Now imagine that you have a broken motor in the same situation. The weight is held above the ground for 10 seconds. I would call that 0 J of work.
