The power limit is maximum amount of work per unit time possible, it does not mean that that much work will be performed no matter what. You apply a particular force over a particular time to an object of a particular mass, all such they come out to, at most, your maximum possible power, and if that force is not enough to overcome counterforces acting on that object, like gravity or friction or tension, the object stays put and no work is performed.
