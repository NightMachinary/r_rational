  You can't have an object of actual zero mass, and an object of tiny mass is not a problem either.

But you can have an object of zero /velocity/, which is a huge problem.

Let's say that you're in an apocalypse, and the ground is collapsing all around you. You run into the empire state building and start lifting it. The ground under it falls away, and the building continues to float upwards at a rate of 0.000000017 m/s. This is from a power that can't outclimb an elite athlete.
