History suggests that indoctrinating people to certain viewpoints is nowhere near as difficult as someone sitting in a comfortable chair and browsing Internet might think. There are, in fact, millions of dead people who walked into a bloodbath with quite a bit of enthusiasm. I imagine vampires with centuries/millenia of experience on their side will know very well how to make newborns loyal and eager to fulfill their intended purpose. For example, if I was a vampire, I'd try to always have a significant population of fanatically loyal humans at hand as a source of both food and recruits.\\
My main point, however, is that without some kind of a drawback, creating a new vampire is basically always beneficial. Vampires are more useful than humans -> getting more vampires is always better than not, unless you fail at loyalty and they walk away immediately, in which case your organization is doomed anyway. How exactly to use the resulting newborns is a secondary concern - obviously, immediately wasting them as cannon fodder is not desirable, but in a dire enough situation you might not have a choice.

  I agree, but that's assuming they're under your control; they're not. Other people can charm them from you, buy their loyalty, etc.

If all major factions are roughly equal in what they can offer to potential traitors, there is no point in becoming one, since you'll get basically all the same benefits you already have, but with an addition of a ruined reputation. If one faction is significantly better at poaching than others, it'll either eliminate them and become a superpower or they'll come together and destroy it (both of these possibilities can result in interesting plotlines).\\
Things become murkier with higher-ranked vampires who might have unique powers or knowledge that are more or less useful to specific factions, but we're talking about rank and file currently. And for rank and file, it's more efficient to make your own vampires rather than spend so much resources getting through all the layers of indoctrination and incentives to stay loyal.
