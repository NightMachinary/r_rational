  My main point, however, is that without some kind of a drawback, creating a new vampire is basically always beneficial.

I suppose to get into the details of the mythology a bit more, there's two main reasons why making a new vampire might not be attractive.

Firstly, you can make a human into a thrall instead. Thralls have to obey you, whatever you ask them, so they're effectively 0 risk, and they don't age so you don't need to replace them every 60 years. This also makes them powerful (not sure how much exactly)^{a}, but holding thralls takes mental effort, so as a rule of thumb a vampire can comfortably have one for every 500 years they've been a vampire, but a young vampire can have 10 if they spend all their time focusing. (Consequence: self-interested vampire might make "brainwashed" baby vampires hold a maximum number of thralls in control and have baby vampire order them to obey self-interested vampire, and thus get a large number of thralls by proxy).

Secondly, creating a vampire is not always successful. The less often you do it and the healthier the human the higher your chances of success, as well as actually being able to do the ritual properly. So if you have a favourite human you're better off keeping them a thrall, which is guaranteed. Depending on your human entourage they might not like that their vampire god is always killing people and they very rarely get the eternal life they were promised. Probably can easily get around that with doctrine, though. A vampire turning humans every 10 years (max speed though I'm not married to it) would have a 30% success rate, so a vampire's cult members would only see one or two successful turnings in their lifetime - which might be enough, I admit.

Add to that vampire society might punish people who create too many babies (or the prolific ones might just stay on their own continent), the real but perhaps overblown risk of vampires you create turning against you, and the security risk of having so many vampires in a comparatively small area potentially attracting hunting teams which can ruin your day if they burn your house down while you're sleeping (you'd never let that happen, you have a thousand security measures against that, but the chance is still worrying).

Oh! A light-bulb went off in my head. The 800 survivors of the Catastrophe are probably the "aristocracy" so to speak and the rank and files are trying to make babies to help them rally in the event that the 800 try anything. After all, the 800 haven't spoken about the Catastrophe, so the babies are very curious/suspicious about what the hell it could have been. Perhaps vampires cyclically kill off the baby population when the world is overpopulated? Well, they will be ready this time.

(Aside: I want the 800 survivors not to talk about the Catastrophe, but that's kind of stupid and tropey and I guess maybe I should abandon it. If the Catastrophe is indeed a plague, then perhaps they'd be better off with all the vampires knowing about it so they can e.g. wash their hands after meals. Even if you assume the 800 would on some level like a new bottleneck that only they know the secret to surviving, you have to assume that one or two vampires of the 800 /at least/ would have fallen in love with younger vampires and tell them. Then again, still others might have predicted this and pretended to fall in love with younger vampires and told them false rumours, so perhaps there's just a ton of rumours? Who knows.)

--------------

^{a} I want thralls to have a "percentage" of the vampire who created them, but that would result in an impressively old vampire's thrall being far more powerful than a 100 year old vampire, which I don't want. Perhaps giving thralls only one or two powers, like super strength and healing, and young vampires have other stuff as well - like super speed. So an old vampire's ghoul would be physically stronger than a young vampire, but the young vampire would still "win in a fight" because of super speed and whatever other powers.
