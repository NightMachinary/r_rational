What incentive does a vampire have to make another vampire? Companionship? Ideology? Or is there something more concrete to be gained from making one, aside from "because I want to"?

I wrote a [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255][vampire novelette]] which has a pretty straightforwardly evil political system, but that comes as a consequence of the rules vampires operate under. As in, given those rules, I think that an evil political system is the natural consequence.

If you're going for blue/orange morality, I think that you first need a base of "how to be an ethical vampire" to build on, because otherwise you're going to descend too often into blackness.

I guess to my mind, the big question that you'd want a cleavage along is whether or not it's ethical to make more vampires, given the risks (whatever they are) involved and the lifestyle that a vampire must adopt. So you'd have:

- a fringe sect which has dedicated themselves to murdering other vampires, because vampires are an evil upon the world and continued existence can only be justified by attempting to dismantle vampirekind, root and stem.
- a sect that thinks it's ethical for vampires to exist, but that it's totally unethical to create more vampires, even with the consent of whoever is about to be turned.
- a sect that thinks making new vampires is totally fine, so long as it's done judiciously and humanely.
- a fringe sect which has dedicated themselves to the promotion of vampirekind and pushing the limits of vampire creation, at least partly motivated by the idea that more vampires in the world puts vampires in a better position.

But I think first you have to answer the question of what a vampire gets out of making another vampire, which helps define what your vampire population looks like, and thus their politics.
