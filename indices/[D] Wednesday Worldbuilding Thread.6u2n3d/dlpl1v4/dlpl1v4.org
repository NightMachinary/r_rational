The Isle of Talis has long been home to the ancestor-worshipping Celta Tribes, who live in unofficial autonomy under the rule of the Red King across the Eastern Channel. They share the land with the Tuatha, a powerful and cunning magical race kept in check by deals made with humans. The Tuatha usually walk invisible among the humans, but have told stories of how they won the land from the savage Formor and will frequently offer deals to transform humans into beautiful and monstrous shapes. The Tribes have thrived under the protection of the Rangers from monsters and men alike, until invaders came from the north and south to claim it for themselves.

The Frost Clans hail from the Colossus Archipelago to the north, a chain of islands they believe to be the corpses of ice giants they are descended from, where they are locked in conflict with the Flaming Horde and their Iron Dragons. They came to Talis in search of power left buried by their ancestors, and found the remains of ancient battles in the Celta's sacred sites. The invaders dug up massive skeletons and armories filled with titanic weapons, reanimating them with arcane rituals and riding them into battle. The Celta cried to their distant king for help, only for the refugees to discover he had traded away his life to the Tuatha so his homeland would be kept safe, leaving a son with no schooling in war to lead the kingdom.

The Frost Clans pushed ever further south, decimating all in their path, and would've continued unabated if not for the Reman Empire. In the name of the Ascended, the man who became a god, they crusade from free humanity from cosmic imprisonment by the Demiurge. They had heard of the Frost Clans campaign and sought to prevent their enemies from surging in strength with their own annexation spearheaded by the Godblood nobility. Despite support from divinity that surrendered to humanity, the Remans did not know the land and could not match the Clans' advance. The two armies finally came to a head at the Battle of Bone Valley, so named for the miracle that happened there.

The Chief of one of the five Clans led the battle himself, slaughtering hundreds of soldiers with his Crypt Titans and Singer Priests who's words rent the sky itself. The Warchief held a sword of indestructible steel, claimed from a village that had revered it for as long as it's recorded history, but set it down to execute the Reman commander with his bare hands. As the man was brutalized before his wife, she snatched the sword and it suddenly burned with a primordial flame that annihilated the Chief and his guard. The Titans came to retaliate, but fell unlifeless to the ground before the sword. The rest of the army retreated in terror, leaving a fraction of the force that had arrived to claim victory.

The remaining Chiefs ordered their men and Titans to regroup at the northern fortress of Frost Landing and prepare for a siege, finally giving Talis a reprieve. The land hade been ravaged by war and many villages had sold their humanity to the Tuatha in desperation, the remaining of which had little love for the new Red King and the contingent of Rangers he had finally sent. Under the new leadership of the Lady of the Light, the Remans pulled their remaining forces back to the cities they had claimed while they waiting for reinforcements to take Frost Landing. Among these three powers, the Isle is now torn.

The child king in the east seeks to preserve his people and restore what they've lost, but he lacks the knowledge or the respect to command them. The warriors in the north seek the glory of uncovering powers long forgotten, but their paranoid leaders think them traitors for not retreating. The lady in the south has had power bestowed upon her not seen since the Ascended himself, but cannot spread the holy word without support from the rival Godbloods and the armies they command. A fragile peace has descended upon Talis, allowing cultures to intermingle and butt heads in the borderlands.
