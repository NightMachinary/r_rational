  What incentive does a vampire have to make another vampire? Companionship? Ideology? Or is there something more concrete to be gained from making one, aside from "because I want to"?
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, it's just companionship/ideology, and because the process isn't perfect the companionship angle is kind of dubious. I imagine it's a lot like the reason people have children: companionship / ideology / teaching. No "taking care of me in my old age" aspect, I don't think, though. I imagine my vampires get more and more powerful as time goes on, though a growth-decline like humans have might be an interesting thing to play with now I think about it.

So, yeah, the vampire population probably has "islands" of worldviews that are generally inherited, but then the young vampire through seeing the world/etc starts to realise that it's not so simple and migrates to other bubbles, but this makes the matriarchs very upset probably. You'd also have vampires making cases for their own world views to try and put more people onto their side and take them from opponents. Maybe some vampires decide it's more efficient to convert vampires to your worldview than to birth them.

But then you have to ask, why do they care how many other vampires agree with them? Is it because we all want our echochambers, or are vampires at an ever-present threat of war? I imagine the vampire "instincts" being quite vicious, which is why they have a lot of culture which requires them to demonstrate restraint, so perhaps they all know on some level that the dam will break, war will begin, and they want to have soldiers when that happens.

(Warning: maths might be wrong) But my vampire reproduction rate is based on 1.5% of vampires each year having a baby, and if you can do it every 10 years that means basically that during each 10 year block 15% of vampires have a baby, which seems like a lot: and if you assume a 50% success rate, you're talking about 30% of vampires trying to have a baby every 10 years (i.e. as often as possible). Reflecting on it, /this seems like maybe a bit too many/? Playing around with the exp growth rate in my spreadsheet, I can put it down to about 1% before there are too few vampires in the present day, which brings the 30% down to 20% - not much difference. Exponential growth is terrible. I suppose we can model this by saying that early on after the bottleneck, 80%+ of vampires made babies as quickly as they could, and then as the population began growing too large political will in vampire society swung another way and reproduction became far more discouraged.

(AOO is unfortunately blocked at my office, but I'll try and make sure I check out your novelette when I get home. Since your evil political system sounds like a great thing to draw on for me.)

  I think that you first need a base of "how to be an ethical vampire" to build on
#+end_quote

I think the agreement of "what's ethical" in vampires is even more fragmented than it is in humans, and my cursory understanding of psychology has me well aware that humans can't agree on ethics at all.

Having "should we make more vampires" as a big point of moral debate has some interesting consequences as you laid out. It looks like those 4 are probably pretty compatible with any of e.g. communist, feudal, democratic beliefs though. Like, "we should make as few vampires as possible" can fit with communism (make sure the pie is split fewer ways) and feudalism (let's not share our power), so I think we need to have more values/etc to layer on top of that.

Have 4 main vampire characters so far:

1. William (protag): feudal

2. Elodia (antag): feudal, but "meaner"

3. Erlis (minor): "Vegetarian", very radical, believes in human/vampire harmony (though not necessarily equality).

4. Cassius (antag): feudal, has made baby vampires, his babies are very important to him (of course, for a not yet specified reason: character not yet developed)

So I think that's why I need to try and develop these factions, as I think factions will help with the development of the vampire characters.
