Interesting ideas.

  Aside: I want the 800 survivors not to talk about the Catastrophe

For 800 people to keep a secret, it must be insanely dangerous. Like, a recipe for creating the plague dangerous, not the fact that the plague happened and wiped almost everyone out. There's no practical value in keeping that fact secret, so few vampires will even try.\\
Regarding thralls, with less than 10 thralls per vampire without sacrificing time and effort to maintain control, they're essentially trusted helpers that handle sensitive tasks and information. Overall, with these numbers, you can't really build a big organization with thralls alone. Especially since they're basically an extention of their master, so if you have loyalty problems, that just means one traitor can make significantly bigger impact because he does several jobs at once through his thralls. On the other hand, less points of failure is always good.\\
Though, if you actually have some reliable, but expensive mindcontrol, enslaving a vampire and then converting him into a bunch of thralls which he then controls 24/7 will allow you to reduce expenses while quickly expanding. It also helps you to keep the fact that you're stealing vampires from other factions secret, since they all sit in fortified bunkers controlling their thralls instead of walking around performing tasks.
