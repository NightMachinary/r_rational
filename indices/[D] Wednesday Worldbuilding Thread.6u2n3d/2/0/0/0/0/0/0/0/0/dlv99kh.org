  For 800 people to keep a secret, it must be insanely dangerous.

Yeah, that's been sticking in my craw a lot lately. I don't know if you've noticed, but I feel like I'm pretty steadfastly against incorporating the deep history of my world into the story, and that is the point of friction that seems to fuck with me, stop me from getting from what I /want/ to what I /need/. I think I need to make peace with the fact that although I want to tell a romance story, it's a romance story set in a /world/, and that world needs to be reflected. I don't have to write a full flashback novella of William's adventures during the Vampire War or whatever, but he and the other vampires would be better to be open about it lest they repeat it.

Because even if, worst case scenario, the knowledge of the Catastrophe requires knowledge of how to build the plague, then that means that 799 other vampires who may not be your allies know how to build the plague. (Then again, those 799 also know first-hand how bad the plague was: perhaps an analogy is if people who were on the ground during the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the ones who were given control over the world's nuclear weapons. They'd be the most trustworthy people).

But back to what I was /trying/ to say, if the knowledge of the Catastrophe requires knowledge of how to build the plague, there must be some level of knowledge that is helpful without being plague-enabling. (You know... "a plague happened once, but I can't tell you the cure because then you'd know enough to create the plague again").

So yeah. Probably actually-secret Catastrophe is a fever dream. "Closely guarded secret", "kept quiet so humans don't ever find out", etc might be more feasible.

Vampires can give normal humans orders by maintaining eye contact (but normal glasses or contacts are enough to stop this). The orders are of the strength "gun to your head" - so mostly irresistible - but the compulsion lasts some 90 seconds. So it comes in pretty handy, but doesn't work on other vampires, and is really hard to munchkin.
