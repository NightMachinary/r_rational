  Having "should we make more vampires" as a big point of moral debate has some interesting consequences as you laid out.
#+end_quote

It won't be a big point of moral debate because every major faction will make as many new vampires as possible. Doing otherwise will mean being wiped out or made irrelevant by other factions. Even if old vampires are orders of magnitude more powerful than newborns, these newborns will eventually grow strong enough to win through sheer numbers. There simply is no incentive not to make new vampires. Even using them as cannon fodder is better than not making them at all, since some will probably survive and grow into something useful.\\
This applies to all fields, not just military. Having one superhumanly good (through centuries of practice) diplomat or administrator is good, but having an entire team of them is excellent. Even one old vampire who studied rhetorics and public speech for his entire life can make humongous impact thanks to Internet/TV, but several of these will be able to cover a much wider demographic.
