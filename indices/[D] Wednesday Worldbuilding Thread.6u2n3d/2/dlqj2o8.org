So, plenty of media deals with vampire internal politics. (I'm thinking of nWoD in this case.)

I'm very interested in some logical and some blue and orange "vampire political factions" for my setting. My vampires are mostly standard, but there are two main differences:

- c. 1700 CE, vampire population crashed from 20,000 to 800: likely due to a supernatural plague (or targeted genocide?) that was brought on by an unspecified enemy of vampires, who managed to be defeated somehow. (Population in 2000 CE has recovered to 200,000)

- making a new vampire is an involved process (think battlefield surgery), has a 30-80% success rate depending on circumstances, and an individual vampire can physically only make a new vampire every 10+ years

Alternatively, ignore the above and put in your own ideas using pulp vampires - it's all good!

Here's some stolen concepts to give you some ideas, mostly stolen from nWoD - but none are blue and orange:

- Invictus: Feudal sort of system: importance of seniority, age, rank, and formality

- Carthian: Democracy, rule for the people

- Communism of some sort?

- "Vegetarian" vampires who try not to kill humans

- Some sort of religious fundamentalists - not sure of what Blue and Orange beliefs we can get from them though

- Quiverful vampires who want to ensure the vampire population grows / Survivalist vampires who have lots of taboos about doing whatever passed the supernatural plague
