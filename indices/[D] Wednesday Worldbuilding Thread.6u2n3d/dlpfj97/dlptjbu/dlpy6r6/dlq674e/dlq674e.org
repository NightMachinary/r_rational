I don't see the problem, this is how normal forces and objects behave. You can't have an object of actual zero mass, and an object of tiny mass is not a problem either. Yes, it is going to accelerate at insane rate, but even discounting air resistance (that is going to stop it from accelerating to any interesting velocity) i.e. in vacuum, it won't be be any more or less damaging than a correspondingly heavier/slower object, since the energy/momentum it delivers to the target is the same.
