Unless I'm missing something, the downside of a power limit taken literally is that you can divide by zero or go into the negatives.

If you have enough power to lift 50 kg at 1 m/s (about the same as a person climbing a ladder), you have enough power to lift 50 000 kg at 0.001 m/s.

It essentially means that you have a magic brace and gearing/winch system so that you can brace against /any/ amount of force.
