The intuition on this is that it should scale similarly to picking things up with your hands (although possibly scaled up if your telekinesis gives you superhuman strength).

For very small objects like tennis balls or pebbles, the object's mass doesn't really factor into it - you can throw a baseball at about the same speed as a paperclip, even though it's 100 times heavier. With heavy objects, you're limited much more sharply by mass (or possibly weight) - you may be able lift a 40kg weight but not a 45kg one, and "throwing" either of those will probably look more like dropping it.

With this intuition for telekinesis: very light objects can be thrown at or near a certain maximum speed, and heavy objects are harder and harder to move until you cannot lift them at all (although you can still push them along the ground, if there's not too much friction).

- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute speed cutoff. You can't move anything faster than 10m/s relative to you, except to slow it down.
- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute acceleration cutoff. You can't accelerate anything faster than 100m/s^{2} .
- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but you need to grip the thing you're lifting with an invisible "hand" of TK. This hand masses 1kg, and moves with the thing you're lifting, so you'll need to spend some of your 100 newtons on moving it as well.
- Same as the above, but your actual physical hand needs to stay touching the thing (tactile telekinesis, remember) so you need to spend some of your 100 newtons, or ordinary muscle power, to move it as well.
- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute power cutoff. You can't transfer kinetic energy into an object faster than 10J, though you may be able to slow it down.
