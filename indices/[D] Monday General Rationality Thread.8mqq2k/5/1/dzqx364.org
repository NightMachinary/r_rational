Let's see... It's still very obviously a work-in-progress, and there are problems that I think will be fixed or streamlined, but there are also things that look like they're here to stay, that I don't like.

- In particular, the fact that half the time when you click a link it opens a pop-up, and half the time it opens widget inside of the current page; both annoy me a lot (although they're handled better that some pages).

- I liked that they added a "click anywhere on the left to collapse comment" function, but it's not as good as the one in the /Reddit Minimizer/ browser plugin.

- I really like that they added a WYSIWYG editor, and if you switch to the markdown the markdown formatting is still there (though I wish you had the "italicize", "bold", etc buttons directly in the markdown editor).

- There's no longer a link to send PMs to a user on u/ pages, you have to go to the old version if you want to send PMs.

- I used to dislike infinite scrolling, but I'm getting used to it. Not having to click to load new content is actually nice.

There's still a few features missing: custom subreddit CSS doesn't seem to be there, the new spoiler format doesn't work on mobile (and in old format reddit), the "show a symbol next to controversial comments" option doesn't work, you can't see upvote percentage on threads, etc.
