What are people's opinions on the reddit site redesign?

I'm finding it to be nicer in a couple of ways such as there being an editor to italicize, bold, and similar editing instead of fiddling around with asterisks. There's also the infinite scrolling that I like.

Features that I miss is the ability to collapse comments to the parent comment, and there's some difficulty in finding my comment history.
