I recently had to (try to) commit someone who had lost contact with reality. Its really a shitty situation - I've had experience with psychosis before so I knew very quickly what was up but to then call emergency hotline was another really hard step.

Unfortunately the person then suddenly decided they wanted to take a drive, and I found myself unable/unwilling to actually prevent them from the driving. I could have taken away their car keys or locked them into a room or something. But that seemed like too much of a confrontation.

If I was willing to commit someone to psychiatric services to prevent them from selfharm, I should self-consistently have also used force to prevent them from driving until the ambulance got there. Alas, that is actually an incredibly hard thing to do.
