Thanks for the contrary perspective, I appreciate it. Definitely sounds logical to base it on tone.

In terms of tone, I don't know. The main characters are a vampire who talks in that very old fashioned way that vampires talk in fiction (I don't think we overdo it, but you know), and a human who is kind of dumb and talks like a kind of dumb human. But the narration is kind of over the top and flowery (or seems so to me when I'm feeling self-conscious about it).

Just a paragraph taken at more or less random to give an idea:

  Red followed, wondering about the wisdom of the decision of following strange women in parts of town he didn't know. He couldn't even be sure that she had even understood what he was looking for. Moreover, he had never seen someone dressed anything like this woman was. It was beginning to get warm out. She would have to be sweltering under that thing; he could only imagine what it would be like in June. Maybe she didn't wear it every day. Or maybe it was a religious thing. Maybe she was a nun. Red had never met a nun before. A nun would have to be trustworthy. He relaxed.
