I vaguely remember some site that had a bunch of rationalist "motivation posters," like one that said something along the lines of "Treat everyone 20% better than you want them to treat you, to correct for fundamental attribution error." I can't seem to find the site, though. Anyone have an idea what I'm talking about?
