Surely doesn't belong in the monday thread, but it can use the traffic.

Redesign destroyed the mobile webpage, someone thought it was a great idea to make the search function field transparent(??) and foregoing the extreme conditioning everyone has for search fields, the layout is optimized for 20" screens and UNUSABLE on 14" laptops, they got rid of the line of subreddits on the top of the page making reddit much harder to explore etc etc. Its in a lot of ways a shitshow.

The nice thing is the improved collapse function - dont need to click [-], anywhere in a straight line below the [-] works as well.
