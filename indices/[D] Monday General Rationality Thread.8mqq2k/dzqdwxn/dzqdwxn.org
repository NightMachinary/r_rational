[using this thread as a substitute for the long-defunct writing skills thread]

So, the story I'm writing, I decided to call Vampire Flower Language because it grew on me, but it sort of stopped growing on me and then I linked it to someone who came to my place for board games and she immediately said:

#+begin_quote
  How come you didn't just call it Vampire "Floriography" instead of "Flower Language"?
#+end_quote

And now I am wondering how the hell I never heard that term for it before especially because it appears in the wikipedia article. Vampire Floriography looks more classy and sounds more intelligent to me.

So... can I just change the title if I still like it better in a few weeks? Maybe next month when I post the chapter I'll add (formerly vampire flower language) afterwards to alleviate potential confusion?

Is it a better title or am I just self-conscious about my titles?
