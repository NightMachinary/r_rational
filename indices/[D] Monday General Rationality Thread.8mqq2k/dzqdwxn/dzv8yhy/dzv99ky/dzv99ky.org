Cheers for that. I appreciate you using the word wanky because I use that word a lot to describe the exact sort of thing.

I wonder, though: don't titles feel inherently wanky? I mean "Worth The Candle" is super wanky IMO, but that gives it a gravitas. So is "The Martian" - I mean /really/.

At the end of the day if it ends up being anything more than an AO3 story that we post on this subreddit every now and then I'll probably wind up shelling some ungodly amount of money for an editor who might be able to offer opinions on titles as a service.
