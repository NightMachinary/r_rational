  What's the point of posting to the Internet instead of dead-tree publishing if not for the ability to make changes to your writing after posting it?

Exactly! Which reminds me I have some formatting gaffes in the first few chapters that I need to look at. And em-dashes :P

Yeah, I was thinking of keeping the parenthetical statement in the AO3 title for a month or so and in the [[/r/rational]] posts for one or maybe two updates.

I've got a week and a half before we're planning on posting the next chapter so I'll let it marinate anyway. I think "Vampiric Floriography" might be even better still, feels like a more effective rhythm.
