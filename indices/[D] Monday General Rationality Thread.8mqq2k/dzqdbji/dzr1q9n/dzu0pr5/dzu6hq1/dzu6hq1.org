I'm alright. It's all voluntary. I'm a grad student in San Francisco, so my income is limited and rent is expensive. My first apartment here cost me $1200/month, and that was to share a shabby room that violated more housing laws that I can count, so... Money's weird for me, and I felt more secure without a stable housing situation, but being able to put money in the bank every month, than I did in stable (albeit illegal) housing that ate up my financial reserves.

I wouldn't say that it's been awful, just that, combined with school and work, it left me without the spoons that I normally allocate to this subreddit. I've been checking Craigslist now and then to see if something good pops up, and I don't have to be in San Francisco during the summer so I'm out of that situation for now, but I'll be okay if I have to go back to it in the autumn. I've got my stuff figured out.

EDIT: I probably should have brought it up in an off-topic thread (or even just asked if anybody knew about cheap housing in the area), since many people here live in the Bay Area, but... I actually don't have any good excuses. It was just embarrassing. >:P
