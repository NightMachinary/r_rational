Which ones did you try? I personally have found his work to be engrossing and refreshingly original. I don't know that one or two sentence summaries would do justice to the stories he's crafted . . . and despite this being [[/r/rational]] it sort of misses the point entirely.

Aside from what I personally consider to be his exceptional writing, he has managed to move away from being just another crypto-Tolkein with a human/elf/dwarf cast in a fantasy-europe. I have historically hardly read any fantasy precisely because of the same old tropes. Sanderson makes me want to read more.

He also manages to bridge the fantasy/sci-fi divide nicely by having elements of both in his writing.
