I read The Final Empire and was unconvinced. Yes, the magic system is interesting, but by god, the plot! It's like every YA fantasy novel I've ever seen. By the time the Oppressed Orphan with Mysterious Parentage discovers her Innate Mystical Power (which is inherently stronger than other people's Innate Mystical Power because she won the lottery), you can pretty much predict every plot point.

I opened Well of Ascension and got as far as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/2g6qka/spoilers_fe_the_most_irritating_paragraph_in_well/][this line]] before the anti-genre-savviness got too much to bear. So in-your-face you'd almost think it was deliberate, but I never saw a hint of self-awareness.

I think I could've enjoyed it if I'd read it years ago, long before HPMOR and [[/r/rational]] got to me.
