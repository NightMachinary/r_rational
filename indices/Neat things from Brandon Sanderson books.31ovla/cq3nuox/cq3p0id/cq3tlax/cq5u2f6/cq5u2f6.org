You're right - I think Sanderson's keeping his prose less flowery is a deliberate choice, though mileage will vary. He tends to work on one or two phrases that build the mental picture. In mistborn, it's Kredik Shaw's spires and "Ash fell from the sky."

On the plus side, Mistborn is the only good Medieval Fantasy story I've found that tells a /complete/ story in under 600 pages. It's "A New Hope", not "Fellowship of the Ring".

I think he got better at this in the Stormlight Archive. He manages to slip in descriptions through events and through character observations, as opposed to thickening the prose:

  Wit: Perhaps a story for a child. I will tell you one, to get you in the mood. A bunny rabbit and a chick went frolicking in the grass together on a sunny day.

  Kaladin: A chick...baby chicken? And a what?

  Wit: Ah, forgot myself for a moment. Sorry. Let me make it more appropriate for you. A piece of wet slime and a disgusting crab thing with seventeen legs slunk across the rocks together on an insufferably rainy day. Is that better?

  Kaladin: I suppose.
