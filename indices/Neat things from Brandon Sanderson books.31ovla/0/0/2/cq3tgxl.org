I can't comment on Way of Kings, since I have not read it.

I really enjoyed the Mistborn series, but start from the first book.

My first book of his was [[http://smile.amazon.com/Elantris-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0765350378][Elantris]], which I found to be quite unique.

Beyond that . . . I guess you've got to read 'em to pull the gems. I liked 'em . . . YMMV.

I would say that since he doesn't start out with the common tropes his books maybe take a bit longer to get rolling, since he's got a whole world to build. I particularly recall Warbreaker taking a while to spool up.
