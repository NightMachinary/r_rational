I've read 4/5ths of The Final Empire and then given up out of sheer boredom. For context, I can count on one hand how many stories have done that to me and the most boring book I have managed to read spent the majority of it's 500 pages describing furniture.\\
Cannot recommend if wendigo found all his other works dull.
