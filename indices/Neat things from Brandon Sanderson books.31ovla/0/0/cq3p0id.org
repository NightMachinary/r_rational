I dipped Well of Ascension, read some Way of Kings and a stroke into Warbreaker, then a random page of Hero of Ages because that was also on the shelf. Clearly not a fair trial of most of them as stories or as speculative fiction, but the bland prose warded me off.

The setting sounds cool but I don't want to mine the book for them. If you have the gem, I'd love to see a photo.
