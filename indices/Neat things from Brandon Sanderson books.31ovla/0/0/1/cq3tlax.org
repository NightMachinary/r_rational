The "bland prose" is an aspect I really enjoy about his books. The prose tends to go for clarity rather than flowery descriptions and it helps me maintain a clear mental image when reading. It reminds me a bit of the prose in Worm.

If you're looking for better prose with a similar ideas about magic, check out " the Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. I mentioned it on my other comment on this but his prose is well and some of the same approach to magic and world building that appeal to the rationalist in me are there.
