The writing quality has some variance to it. /The Stormlight Archive/ has much better writing than something like, say, /Mistborn/. If you just want spoilers for the cool stuff, [[http://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome][check the wiki]], which details some of the magic systems.

The /Mistborn/ books are notable for being one of the few fantasy books that actually show technological progress over the course of the series, which in itself is pretty cool.
