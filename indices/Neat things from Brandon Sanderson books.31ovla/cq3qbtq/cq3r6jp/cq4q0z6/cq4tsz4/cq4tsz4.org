  It also keeps the existing plot hole of "Gandalf doesn't tell a single person his plan to get into Mordor."

Maybe this is because he knew Sauron and Saruman were scrying and didn't want to be overheard? ...and he didn't think of it until after they left Rivendell, where they were safe from scrying?

Man, this hole needs a lot of spackle.
