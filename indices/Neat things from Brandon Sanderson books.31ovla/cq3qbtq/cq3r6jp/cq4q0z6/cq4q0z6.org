Hell yes, we're talking about eagles. I fucking love eagles. Let's do this.

In Lord of the Rings, the giant plot-solving eagles of awesomeness have their nest extremely near to Caradhras, the mountain that they try and fail to cross over. Instead, the Fellowship passes beneath the mountain range, through Moria. Gandalf dies in Moria. His last words: "Fly, you fools." If they had successfully passed through the mountain, Gandalf could have taken them to his eagle bros, and used them to fly to Mordor, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS. Except he dies, and has to use this vague phrase to hint at it to Aragorn, the other person who knows where these eagles live. If he had shouted out "Go north and climb Mountain Blah, there are eagles there!" he would have been overheard by the nearby orcs, and Sauron would know to watch out for eagles. Unfortunately, Aragorn doesn't crack the code, and the Fellowship is broken.

This reduces the plot hole from "Gandalf is an idiot for forgetting about his flying eagle friends" to "Aragorn doesn't figure out Gandalf's plan using only a vague hint." It also keeps the existing plot hole of "Gandalf doesn't tell a single person his plan to get into Mordor."
