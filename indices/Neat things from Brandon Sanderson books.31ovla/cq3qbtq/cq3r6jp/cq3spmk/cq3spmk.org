It was really just the first thing I thought of as a good example. And if reading the silmarillion is required to understand why it seems inconsistent the point still kind of works.

The idea is that your reader understands the rules of magic system enough to understand why the characters don't just use magic to solve the problem.

When the entire plot of a trilogy revolves around this problem that appears to be easily solvable with this magical power, it'd be nice to at least mention why in those books, but nobody even considers it.

I'm not trying ripping on Tolkien or anything. He basically wrote the basis for all secondary world fiction and I'm really nitpicking decades later when the genre is a lot more developed. But the difference between Gandalf's handwavey mostly unexplained magic and Sanderson's magic is what I really like about Sanderson's books.
