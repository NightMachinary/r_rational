I thought Gandalf's ring was what kept him alive because he was so old. But then it turns out he was inmortal all along.

He did use magic when the fellowship was crossing the Caradras. All he did was set some logs on fire so they wouldn't die of hypothermia. He also set some wargs on fire, I think.
