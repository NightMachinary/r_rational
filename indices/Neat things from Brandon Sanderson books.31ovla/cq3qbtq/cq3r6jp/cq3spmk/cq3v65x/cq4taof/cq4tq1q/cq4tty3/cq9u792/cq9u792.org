Exactly. Gandalf has two settings. Subtle as hell, or visible from space. The whole point of lord of the rings is that it's a stealth mission, the only reason people cut loose in Two Towers/Return of the King is to make a distraction.

Also, I doubt Tolkein was aiming to write something that made quite rationalist-fic levels of sense and logic. LotR is a mix of world-building language essay and homage to the Kalevala as I remember.

I'm not entirely sure that Tolkein was setting out to inspire and originate several genres of fiction :P
