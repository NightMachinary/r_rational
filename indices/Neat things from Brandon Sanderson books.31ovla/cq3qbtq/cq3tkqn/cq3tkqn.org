Of course, if Sanderson's writing is a McDonalds Happy Meal, Rothfuss's prose is like a $150 steak. His writing is so good he published a novella set in his (unfinished trilogy) that contains no dialog. It's heartrendingly beautiful.

I will second that his magic system is pretty rational, as far as that goes. There is sort of a conservation of energy/entropy thing which is pretty slick.
