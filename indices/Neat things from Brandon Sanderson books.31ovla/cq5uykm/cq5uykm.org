Hey, though I'm a big fan of Sanderson and am naturally saddened that you don't enjoy the books, I understand that opinions will always vary. To answer the question and try to make an info-dump:

- One book has magic made by drawing symbols, then you find /why/ they're drawn like they are, and it's plot relevant, and even deducible before the characters figure it out.
- The Rithmatist also has a magic system based on drawing magic circles in chalk. It's simple and explained thoroughly enough that you know all the rules and could draw them yourself, and make intelligent decisions like "I would put another line there, which would sacrifice flexibility but improve defense" or "I'd leave that bit out because, though it's useful, it'd take too long to draw and this needs to be fast."
- Warbreaker: animating objects, used intelligently. In particular, animating parts of your clothing.
- Technically a spoiler, but I'd want to know it anyways if I were a new fan: [[#s][]]
- A guy who's probably a genius - he's more-or-less perfectly average, but he hallucinates lots of different experts in different fields, as imaginary friends. He insists they get seats in the car, hotel rooms, etc.
- All the tricks in Mistborn you've probably read. [[#s][Book one spoiler:]]
- Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians has a group of people who have really dumb-sounding superpowers who use them to insane effect. The ability to "get water on the floor while doing dishes" ended a drought. Grandpa uses his talent to arrive late to things in order to arrive late to bullets.
