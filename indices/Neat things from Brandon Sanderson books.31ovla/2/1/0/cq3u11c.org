This is mildly unrelated, but if you like crazy awesome prose and magic check out the Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson.

Really damn long and not rational per say, but he does a great job of extrapolating what mages would do to medieval warfare, and the gods are actual people with stakes in reality. To say the magic is rational is kind a bit of a stretch, because you don't really understand most of it until the end of most of the series, and even then it's pretty convoluted. But damn his descriptions are beautiful and detailed and nobody can pull off a climactic moment from 3-4 different characters perspectives simultaneously than him.
