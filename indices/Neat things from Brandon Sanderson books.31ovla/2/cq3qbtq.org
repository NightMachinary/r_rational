You should check out his lectures on the three rules of magic. It shows how the magic systems he makes are quasi-reductionist. It's not strictly rationalist(rule zero is awesomeness trumps everything), but the ideas he has about how much a reader understands the magic is proportional what magic can solve plot wise reminds me of rationalist fic.

The stormlight archives have some cool scenes of people trying to understand magic through scientific means, and while it's not hugely detailed, there's a feeling that people aren't just "magic works mysteriously because magic, k?" the world building is detailed and takes care to stay internally consistent. You won't see many "well, why don't they just fly on eagles to mount doom and drop the ring in" inconsistencies.

His prose can be a little bland because its so straightforward, but I like the straightforward clarity it lends to his action sequences when stuff gets complicated.

As a secondary recommendation of stuff I'd consider semi-rational fantasy if you didn't care for Sanderson, you should check out "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. The sympathetic(like affects like) magic in that series uses a kind of conservation law in it, but the prose is really fantastic.
