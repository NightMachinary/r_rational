  "well, why don't they just fly on eagles to mount doom and drop the ring in" inconsistencies.

I think there actually was a reason for that in one of the other books. IIRC it was that Sauron was a Maiar (maybe? some sort of super-demonic/angelic being, but I forget the types) and the eagles were a lower form of super-demonic/angelic being. Basically, they literally couldn't go on his turf until he was dead.

I think. A friend of mine who actually managed to (a) get through the entire Silmarillion and (b) remember it explained it to me at one point, but I lost the details. When you have the whole story, LotR actually makes much more sense.
