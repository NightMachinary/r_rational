Thanks. (I'll assume that was a compliment. ;>)

Actually, one powerful character I did ignore was Hammond. I wanted to give the heroes a curbstomp win and some information, and he was a good vehicle for that. He never appeared again, though. I think it was mostly fair, because he was very clear about "I am doing absolutely nothing that could bring Afi down on me", and the rest of the story happened very quickly (just a couple of days) but I could have involved him more if I wanted to. I just didn't want to.
