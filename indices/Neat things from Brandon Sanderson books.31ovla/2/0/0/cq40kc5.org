You can make up various fan reasons why they didn't use the eagles but it probably is just a fan reason- Tolkein likely either didn't want to use the eagles or forgot them. As they said in book 2.

""No, no indeed," said Gollum. "Hobbits must see, must try to understand. He does not expect attack that way [Cirith Ungol]. His eye is all around, but it attends more to some places than to others. He can't see everything at once, not yet."

He can't see everything, so him being stronger than the eagles doesn't mean much since he wouldn't know that they were there. He also lacks clear powers to attack them and deter them.

Really, if he'd thought of it when the council of elrond had talked about it they should have raised some objection. They raised many other plans and discarded them, he should have added this one.
