Oh, no argument here. Tolkien magic system is bollocks and completely unexplained in the canonical trilogy. Shoot, the Silmarillion wasn't published until 20+ years after LotR -- it was basically a fix-fic.

Although, if you actually look at it, I think the only magic that Gandalf actually does in the trilogy is make a beam of light to repel the Nazgul one time and fight the Balrog. Maybe I'm forgetting something, but that's all I can come up with. As I recall, he even had one of the Rings of Power and I don't think we ever saw it used.
