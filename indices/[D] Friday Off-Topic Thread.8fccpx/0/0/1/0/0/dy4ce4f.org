Well there is no strict requirement that each star represent a given state, but if for some reason there needs to be a correspondence between stars and states, then rank-order each star by its distance from the centroid of the rest of the flag, then assign the nearest stars to the oldest states and so on. That way you will have 53 states complaining rather than 52, which is actually a better situation all around.
