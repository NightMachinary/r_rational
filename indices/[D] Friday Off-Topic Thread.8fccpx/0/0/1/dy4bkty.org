In the same way that the current flag is 4 rows of 5 and 5 rows of 6, you could resolve a flag of 53 stars into 3 rows of 7 and 4 rows of 8. Granted, that would squash the flag, but you could make the stars slightly smaller and introduce a small amount of space between each row to compensate.

On the other hand, if you want a return to nice looking concentric circles, you could have a single star in the center, then 4, then 16, then 32.
