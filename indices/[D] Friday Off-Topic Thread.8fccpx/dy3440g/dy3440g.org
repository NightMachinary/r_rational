I'm looking for a story about summoning demons that I read at some point, but can't find. I think I might have originally seen it from the rationalist-sphere, so I figured I'd ask here ([[/r/tipofmytongue][r/tipofmytongue]] didn't help). Does it sound familiar to anyone? Here's what I remember from the story:

Demons are believed to be extremely manipulative, and can trick people into selling their souls. You can summon demons, and they will sometimes do things for you. It is possible to prevent a demon from talking to you when you summon it, so that it can't manipulate you, and this is generally considered safe. The main character at first refuses to learn how to summon a demon, because he knows he wouldn't be able to resist letting it talk. But at some point he is overcome by curiosity, summons a demon, and has a conversation with it. He does this many times, and the demons actually seem like kind of normal people, so he concludes that everyone has misunderstood demons. The demons convince him that selling souls to demons isn't a real thing, and that some demons just pretend to accept peoples' souls as payment for helping them just to mess with people. The main character sells his soul multiple times, believing that this doesn't actually change anything. After the main character starts talking to demons, some people avoid talking to him to avoid demons manipulating them by proxy.

People usually have to pay demons something in order to get the demons to help them. Paying the demons with sex is common. At some point, a demon helps the main character in exchange for blog recommendations, or something like that. At one point, someone says she summoned a demon just to have sex with it, and this left quite an impression on the main character.
