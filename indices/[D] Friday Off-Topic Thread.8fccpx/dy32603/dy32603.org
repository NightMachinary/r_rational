I like worldbuilding and roleplaying, so is there anyone here who would like to play a game over Discord where we cooperatively create a fictional world? It's called [[http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/][Microscope]] and I've had a lot of fun playing it with people online before. I have the PDF of both the rulebook and expansion for anyone interested.
