  The simulations you could make of someone with 2070 technologies and Facebook access will be "imperfect simulations" in the same sense that tigers in Far Cry are an imperfect simulation of real-life tigers.

Uh, that is almost certainly false. Enemies in video games... others have said it better, I'll yield the floor:

  The term "game AI" is used to refer to a broad set of algorithms that also include techniques from control theory, robotics, computer graphics and computer science in general, and so video game AI may often not constitute "true AI" in that such techniques due not facilitate computer learning or other standard criteria, only constituting "automated computation," or a predetermined and limited set of responses to a predetermined and limited set of inputs.

I assume you and I have different ideas about what 2070 technology is going to be capable of. We're talking about an /entity/ capable of /thinking/ here, not "a predetermined set of responses to a predetermined set of inputs" (though if you want to go the /"freshman in college gets stoned for the first time after learning about determinism in his first philosophy class"/ route, then, like, we're all just, like, a complicated set of predetermined responses, man).
