  So what happens 10, 20, 50 years from now, when the technology of creating fake virtual people becomes a regular thing, and when this technology can use mined data to generate simulations of real-life users that, even if imperfect, will still have high resemblance to the originals?

The "while imperfect" here is kind of a cop-out. The simulations you could make of someone with 2070 technologies and Facebook access will be "imperfect simulations" in the same sense that tigers in Far Cry are an imperfect simulation of real-life tigers: they look like real ones, but most people wouldn't be especially broken up about torturing and killing them.

If the practices you talk about emerge, they'll be closer to things like burning someone in effigy, or torturing someone's Sims avatar, things people do right now which aren't really tearing the fabric of society apart. I'm not worried.
