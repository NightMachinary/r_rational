I'm surprised nobodies given the obvious answer that if you've got the technology to create human level AI emulations of people then the world would be so drastically different as to render most of your points a bit irrelevant.\\
If you've got this kind of tech then for one nearly every biological human is suddenly economically worthless. In addition with lots of accelerated simulations of geniuses, technology should be progressing so rapidly that a full technological singularity ought to be right around the corner.
