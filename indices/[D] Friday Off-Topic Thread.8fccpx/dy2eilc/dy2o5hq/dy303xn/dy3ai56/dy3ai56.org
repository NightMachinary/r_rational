When you posted the command prompt code, it seemed to imply to me that you had to manually work in code and spend time to get the videos. It wasn't obvious to me that it was a batch file instead (which I find easier than using command prompts alone). I freely admit your method is superior in nearly all ways except for the ease and speed of downloading a video within a few seconds of deciding to do so.

Since a lot of people would chose a limited program with speed and convenience over a more versatile program that demands more from the user, I thought you would like to know about SaveFromNet.
