[[https://www.youtube.com/user/XxCONMYSTROxX/videos][ConMystro]] (or xXCONMYSTROXx, as he used to call himself) was my favorite YouTuber, years ago. I watched his skillful online gameplay of the /Naruto (Shippuden) Ultimate Ninja Storm/ series (mostly, games 2.5, 3, and 3.5) with the utmost voracity. Eventually, he abandoned those "spectacle fighters" in favor of other games, and I promptly unsubscribed from his channel. Still, I retained many fond memories of the amazing teamwork that the in-game characters exhibited under his skillful direction.
