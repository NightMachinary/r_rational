I feel kind of weird seeing that, since the dude gets more per month than /Wildbow/ (although he has fewer patrons.) Though on the other hand, if Wildbow ever gets around to making a nice print version of Worm I can guarantee he'll make boatloads of money. (I've personally pre committed to spending up to $100 on a boxed set.)
