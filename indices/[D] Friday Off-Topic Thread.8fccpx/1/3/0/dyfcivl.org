I was scrolling through my messages trying to find one and realized that I never replied to this. In short, /Worth the Candle/ has no set update schedule, I release chapters when I think they're ready, and grouped in what I feel are logical or narratively compelling ways. If people donate, they do so knowing that, since that's how I've been doing it since starting the story. Every month, I post an update on how writing went that month, with some basic word/chapter count analysis.

I find writing to a strict schedule to be really stressful when I'm having trouble with some section of the story, and in the past I've felt like I've compromised a work by rushing things. I /also/ find writing "bad" status updates to be really stressful and unpleasant, which can send writing output into a downward spiral.

Doing things the way that I'm doing them has a cost, which is that fewer people are willing to donate if there's no guarantee. That's a cost that I'm fine paying, since I think the freedom is (currently) worth it. If you'd be uncomfortable donating, then don't donate.
