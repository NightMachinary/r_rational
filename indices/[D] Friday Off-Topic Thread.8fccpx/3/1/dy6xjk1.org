I'm not sure how much that'll matter in ~50 years, but you also have to account for the amount of effort the police is putting in different cases. For instance, the cops are more likely to collect DNA samples on a crime scene than in a parking lot where you skipped paying your ticket; the same rule probably applies to internet forensics.
