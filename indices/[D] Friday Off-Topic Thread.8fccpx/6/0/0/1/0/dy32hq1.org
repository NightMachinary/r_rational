  Maybe because it only takes a quarter of a second to copy/paste a link, and you don't have to read a 10,000 word manual to reprogram your entire computer to use it

I'm not some L337 hacker typing this into my GNU/Linux terminal---I'm a Windows 10 user who copies-and-pastes the link into a simple [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file][text file]]. Using youtube-dl does not require significant technical expertise (beyond knowing what a batch file is, which I didn't when I started using the program), let alone "reprogramming your entire computer".

  and you end up with the same end product?

Wrong. If you had clicked the [[https://en.savefrom.net/faq.php][link]] that I included in my previous comment, you would have known that SaveFromNet counts among its limitations an inability to download 60-FPS and 1080p videos, so it's unsuitable for downloading high-quality footage of action-heavy video games. youtube-dl (in combination with ffmpeg) is able to surmount this.
