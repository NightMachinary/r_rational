A big chunk of that command is just because they're trying to run it on windows, normally you don't have to specify things like "where is the tool we use to convert videos into different formats".

You might also note that his example downloaded /all/ the videos that matched the supplied search-term. Where as the method you're recommending seems to be a much for manual process, requiring you to download each video individually.

I mean, you can only take "user-friendly" so far before you're just being lazy. Changing your tires isn't user-friendly either, there's like 3 or 4 different steps you have to take. Computers are important, and basic computer literacy isn't going to magically stop being important no matter how many apps people make. You certainly /can/ eat nothing but junk food, and you certainly can only be willing to use "user-friendly" software in the appified-proprietary-services category, and you can even never learn how to change a tire. But that's all pretty unhealthy.
