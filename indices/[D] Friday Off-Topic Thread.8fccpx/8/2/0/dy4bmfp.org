  99.99999% perfect simulacrum... by triangulating all the decades of data?

No:

1) Human errors on simple tasks - which we might take to be elemental: IE, the basis from which any life action are built - are basically unpredictable by /that human/ immediately before the event, and occur at a rate of about 1% (for broadly interesting classes of actions, IIRC). So it would seem to me that any non-branching/non-stochastic model of a human that does better than 99% is modeling at (at least) a nearly neuron-by-neuron level of detail.

Given that specific neuron changes only weakly effect human output - there's a number of ways to learn something, each of which produce the 1% error at different points, but all which produce the 99% correct signal - this means that you'd have to gather a rather large amount of evidence on any trait you were interested in to produce the model of #1... a data requirement for any trait you care about, not complex position-on-a-spectrum things like extroversion score (which have very limited predictive power for our "nefarious purposes"), but every little thing, like "how did the person encode statement #15 from this 5-minute youtube video?"

I'd expect that people don't write, say, or (probably) leave that much video evidence about their lives. (Consider that a human on traditional English corpuses leaves an entropy of about 1 bit per character. A superintelligence with a "this was written by John" prior, should be able to do much better. (I mean, do you have any idea how often I say "should be able to x y z (punctuation) I mean"?))

This would mean that, since people don't say that much, /the unobserved internal experience of watching/ */youtube videos alone/* - even after you know which ones the person you watched - is sufficient to destroy the accuracy of your model.

2) Constructing a 98% accurate model still requires predicting the existence of each of these very detailed traits with 99% accuracy, requiring 7 bits of information per trait - or about two words at the absolute very least. Most people still don't write that much about their lives.

(Though I bet that most people's internal dialog "says" that much about their life, so an auditory cortex tap would probably be sufficient to get a 98% accurate model, once you fed the data to a superintelligence...)
