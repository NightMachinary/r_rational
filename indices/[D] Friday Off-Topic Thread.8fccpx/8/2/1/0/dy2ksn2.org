  So I'm not asking about an all-or-nothing solution, but about steps that could be taken to at least prune somewhat the number of people who could get their hands on the data-profiles about your person in the future.

I was aware of that. I wasn't talking about basilisks in the far future, I was talking about what you're talking about, something like that Black Mirror episode about the future version of Tinder where it turns out that [[#s][spoiler]]. You don't want corporations/governments/whoever running imperfect simulations of you several decades from now. I'm saying that they'll be able to do it anyway just based on data that already exists today and that the simulation(s) will be indistinguishable from perfect. Maybe not 50 years from now, but 80 to 100 years from now.
