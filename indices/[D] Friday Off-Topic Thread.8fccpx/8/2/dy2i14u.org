  So my question is, doesn't this mean that [we should try to delete ourselves from the internet]?

Do you think that's actually possible? You think deleting facebook and your emails and search history is going to actually remove everything you've done from the internet? You think that even if you succeed in "being forgotten" that it'll make a difference?

It's been a long number of years so I don't remember everything, but around 2012 there were conspiracy theories about a (legitimate, official) government thing called TrapWire where public security cameras were being replaced with facial recognition cameras that could track your movement basically across the entire country. Your face has been seen by at least several of those cameras.

Think of what you're talking about. All the internet activity from all these people who have interacted with you, all the data from security cameras tracking your movement, your purchasing history, your documented residences and education and employment, and you think a sufficiently advanced system with extraordinary computing power couldn't create a 99.99999% perfect simulacrum of 99.9999999999% of all the people to have lived over the past several thousand years by triangulating all the decades of accumulated data? That It couldn't fill in the blank spots ("blank spots" being people who It doesn't even know exist due to a complete lack of data), just based on the way that everything else around that person bounced off of or bent around the "blank spot"?

Isn't that the point of R's B, that in the even farther future It will be even more advanced than sufficiently advanced and have computing power even more extraordinary than extraordinary and be able to triangulate the placement of every individual particle at every point in space/time all the way back to the beginning of existence?
