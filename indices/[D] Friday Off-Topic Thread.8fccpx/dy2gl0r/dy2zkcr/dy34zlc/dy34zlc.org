Discussion thread would probably get more replies than weekly thread. But I checked the rules and it sounded like only about written stories. (But I guess the rules are old, and most don't follow them)

You assume that all superheroes would be fighting. (Yeah, probably true.)

But what we need would be some stereotype superheroes type:

[[http://superheroesandvillains.wikia.com/wiki/Types_of_Superheroes][like the first I find with google]]

And then look who would need how much armor. And what kind. Or what else would they have. Like a brick should have at least a taser (like every hero with instakill powers).

A teleporter (depending on limitations) should have at least 3 secure rooms/holding cells to teleport people in (maybe with less pressure/oxygen). And maybe rope, if they need to touch someone.

A gadgeteer should have always tools and some materials like a power source. Better a tank as a mobile workspace if possible.

A mastermind should have as many ways as practical to communicate with the team. Like gps tracking and conference calls with headphones. Bodycams.

Or for example, I would say armor, that is only supposed to block bullets is quite stupid, if you can take tank rounds naked while sleeping. If it also protects from ABC weapons, it would be worth it for a brick/tank. But maybe not, if nobody uses even mace and the armor gets shredded every fight.

But yeah most could use more armor. At least a bulletproof vest would be nice for most. (Also real spandex suits look stupid, no clue what hollywood does.)

Still you would need to look what objectives they have, what they do regulary and how they be more efficient (while still being superhero, cause Rule of cool). For example spiderman could have rope with him. He would save so much web fluid.

Or airlines would paint markers on the airplane where superman should carry them.

I will read the stories, sometime... I will add it to the list :-)
