Could someone explain the rules to me?

Subreddit Rules

#+begin_example
  Post links to or **discussion of rational fiction only;** otherwise use one of the weekly discussion threads.
#+end_example

I have the question: What would a rational superhero costume look like? For example, a flying brick or spiderman would wear and have climbing/safety harnesses to be able to evacuate/transport people. And most would have backpacks with first aid stuff.

Where should I post that? In the worldbuilding subreddit or does the question count of discussion ofrational fiction?
