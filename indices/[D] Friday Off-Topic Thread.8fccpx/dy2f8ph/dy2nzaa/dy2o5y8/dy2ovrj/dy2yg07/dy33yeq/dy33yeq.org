That's the largesse of Royalroad's readership at work. I've witnessed fans of the xianxia genre and web novels spend mindboggling amounts on their stories (e.g. crowd-funded $80 to translate each 2-6k word chapter). How these stories get hyped in a community and why some stories strike gold in their audience's imagination/pockets is worth studying. I can't imagine a traditional publishing house being interested, but as [[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/print-journalism-may-last-another-10-years-new-york-times-ceo.html][the digital overtakes print]], the niche might grow to overtake the standard.

As for the interruption in WtC's schedule, it /might/ have something to do with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8bhjwe/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8889_solitudeface/dxku1sd/][a recent conversation I had with the recently appointed CFO of WtC]]. Hopefully it's because CRJ/AW is migrating WtC to his own site or adopting a new Patreon system (rather than anything unfortunate like sickness).
