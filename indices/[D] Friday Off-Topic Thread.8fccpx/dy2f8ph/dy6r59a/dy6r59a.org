Honestly, it seems kinda messed up that people are donating money to support a project that is having very little work done on it. WtC is awesome but if AW can't post updates for a while for whatever reason, he needs to make that clear to his Patreon subscribers. I might as well link [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]. Just a little bit of communication regarding the lack of new updates would go a long way towards alleviating this issue.
