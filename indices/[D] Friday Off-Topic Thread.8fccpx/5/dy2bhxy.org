1) Here's a video of a dude in VRchat wearing an avatar of an anime girl while drunkenly philosophizing about existence and stuff. It's kind of surreal, like trying to listen to Carl Sagan while you're tripping on acid. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VahuChwc_O8]]

2) So like, yesterday (I think it was yesterday, I haven't gone to sleep yet so my sense of when-ness is a bit off), Kanye West made a tweet of a cellphone video he took of him recording the screen of his laptop, and one of the tabs he had open on his browser was a Jordan Peterson video. I've been watching JP's videos and following his activity for a few months now. I find the cadence of his voice and his word choices and the structure of his sentences to be very pleasant to listen to. He sounds soothingly rational, even if some of the things he says might be irrational. I already agreed with some of his stances before I started following him. I find that I disagree very strongly with a lot of the opinions/beliefs that he presents as incontrovertible fact. What does [[/r/rational][r/rational]] think about him?
