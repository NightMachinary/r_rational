I don't know that I'd call it "woo" but either way it doesn't make up the majority of his output. As far as I can tell, anyway. That's part of the reason I'm bring it up, he's put out a lot of content over a long period of time and I'm wondering if the submerged part of the iceberg which I haven't seen yet doesn't resemble what I /have/ seen and maybe I disagree with him more strongly than I thought I did.

Not that I'd stop watching his videos if that were the case. I feel like I remember having read something in the Sequences, and I tried to find it a few weeks ago but I think I'd have to re-read all of it to find it again, but it was something about not actually understanding the opposing worldview's arguments from the inside, so I've recentlyish been purposefully exposing myself to more conservative-leaning content.
