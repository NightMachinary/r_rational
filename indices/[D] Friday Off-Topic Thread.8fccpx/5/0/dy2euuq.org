I listened to an episode of Sam Harris' podcast where they have a long conversation about the meaning of the word "truth", and it really did not make me like him. He tried to define truth as both "factually correct" and/or "evolutionarily advantageous". I don't think Harris really got to the bottom of why Peterson wanted to redefine the word like that, but some commenters pointed out that he was likely trying to do so in order to be able to say that his religion is "true" without proving it correct.

I'd be happy to hear that the podcast was a bad first impression, and he's actually completely different, but if it was a representative sample then I have little interest in listening to someone willing to play such word games in order to score points.
