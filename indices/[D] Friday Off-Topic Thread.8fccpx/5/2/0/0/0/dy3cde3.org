I could just as easily point out that the article you shared is from a "sexual diversity studies" professor. I looked over yours and it looks as if the points it raises are addressed and countered in mine, so maybe you should look over mine.

  If he framed it as a slippery slope I might feel more sympathetic,

This is addressed as well. I'm at like 30 hours without sleep, but I think this is the relevant part:

  You'll be keen to note that Peterson hasn't disagreed with anything you've mentioned, in his first video and in the Senate hearing he agreed that the amendments to the Criminal Code are benign on the surface, because they address the things you address; ie; a reasonable amendment to the Criminal Code.

  His objections are in how the Human Rights Act interprets gender identity and gender expression, using the definitions provided by the Ontario Human Rights Code

  "I noted in the videos that the policy statements surrounding similar laws already in place in Ontario and several other provinces were dangerously vague and ill-formulated. I also indicated my refusal to apply what have become known as “preferred” pronouns to people who do not fit easily into traditional gender categories (although I am willing to call someone “he” or “she” in accordance with their manner of self-presentation)."

  "I noted that under the new provisions of federal Bill C-16, now past second reading, discrimination for reasons of “gender identity” and “gender expression” has now become not only illegal, but part of the special category of hate crime."

  He's again, referring to surrounding policies, most notably the Ontario Human Rights Code and their definitions of gender identity and gender expression. The following paragraph is correct in that Bill C-16 will add those two categories protections under the Criminal Code from discrimination and hate crimes.

  Tangentially, it should be noted that the Ontario Human Rights Tribunals defined hate crimes and discrimination differently than the Criminal Code.

  "The fact that my discussion may have already been rendered illegal by legislation of the type I was objecting to was precisely the point I had been originally making. When I first made the videos, several articles immediately appeared, penned by lawyers, stating that I was making too much of the dangers posed by federal Bill C-16 and its ilk. However, as far as I am concerned, the letters from the University of Toronto indicated that my concerns were well-founded. Why else warn me that my actions potentially contravened the Ontario Human Rights Code?"
