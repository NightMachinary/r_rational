I did actually read through yours, it just didn't strike me as particularly unbiased enough for me to trust their analysis, and their refutations all seem weak or disingenuous, as they keep trying to insist that Peterson actually thinks something more reasonable than what he said.

The quoted comment in particular kind of highlights why I feel that way. Peterson is fantastic at saying multiple things in multiple places that each sound reasonable in context but are somewhat contradictory when put side by side, and he does it in that very set of paragraphs. He cannot be calling it just the start of a slippery slope if he is also asserting that his discussion "may have already been rendered illegal." He also has said that his lectures might be labeled a hate crime. There is no call for that sort of implication. It's hyperbolic and just nonsensical, and the only defense he offers is that his university sent him letters expressing concern.

So he trusts his university getting nervous about what he was saying over lawyers telling him he was wrong. There are a dozen reasons why his university may have sent those letters, from being stupid to being overly sensitive to liability to being pressured to appear progressive. The university sending the letters is very weak evidence that his interpretation of the law is correct.

Also, get some sleep :P We can continue this tomorrow if you'd like.
