Hey there! I don't mind continuing the conversation, but I'm afraid I'll have to decline on watching that video for now: I've already spent way too many hours listening to JP thanks to a $100 bet I made with someone, and at this point I find his style of rhetoric grating rather than enjoyable the way you seem to :) If there's anything in specific about him you'd like to discuss, or some time stamped section of that video, let me know!
