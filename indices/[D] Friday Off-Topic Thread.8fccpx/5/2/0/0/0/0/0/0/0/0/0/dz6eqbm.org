That's the very reason I've recommended this video in particular. I wasn't expecting you to respond so soon, since this conversation began like 3 weeks ago. I'm not sending you off to go semi-blindly digging through his videos, I'm recommending a specific video. Maybe watch it for 15 minutes at a time for the next week or two, and then get back to me. There's a very real tendency among liberal voices to out-of-hand dismiss any conservative viewpoint, and while I disagree with the vast majority of conservative viewpoints, I find that out-of-hand dismissal extremely troubling, and that's a major part of what this video is about.
