Sure, but I've already spent hours listening to Peterson about a variety of topics, and my free time is limited. The signal-to-noise from Peterson for me so far has been very disappointing (I don't mean in things I agree with, I mean in things that I've learned from him or his methods of reasoning), so I'm not going to go semi-blindly digging through more of his videos on the off chance he has something interesting to say that I've missed over spending that time on things that I'm more likely to get more out of.
