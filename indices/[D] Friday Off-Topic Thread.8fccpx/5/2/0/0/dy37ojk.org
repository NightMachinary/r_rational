Well, it's a post in his subreddit, so I'm not sure how accurate or thorough their analysis will be. This was the article I found most convincing:

If he framed it as a slippery slope I might feel more sympathetic, but the vociferous nature of his opposition for what the majority of legal experts seem to agree is simply an expansion of protected classes makes him come off as intentionally obtuse due to ideological disagreement. He regularly mischaracterizes and strawmans any kind of progressive position or issue he disagrees with, so this just seems more of the same.
