I've spent the last half hour looking over this thread:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6fli34/did_jbp_misinterpret_bill_c16/]]

I'm unsure, but I'm leaning towards being convinced that he did /not/ misrepresent the bill. Maybe I'm like 55% sure, just ever so slightly out of the 50% zone of not having an opinion one way or the other.
