I find him frustrating more than anything. He's a (Decent? Good?) clincial psychologist who speaks with unshakable confidence on topics unrelated to his field, a self help guru who mixes good suggestions in with lots of philosophical woo, a Narrativemancer who doesn't seem to want to or be capable of distinguishing between the narrative map and the territory, and most annoyingly, an ideologue who bills himself as anti-ideologies.

And he got all his fame by (seemingly wilfully) misrepresenting a Canadian bill about trans people and acting like a last bastion of sanity and freedom from post-modern tyranny, which of course got him legions of fans who have given him millions of dollars in Patreon donations.

There are far smarter people doing all the things he does right, and people just don't know about them because they didn't make a name for themselves in the culture war and don't have as refined an image/speaking voice. In short he's a walking personification of the Halo Effect and the Toxoplasma of Rage. And of course he's just wrong about a lot of stuff, some of which are psychology related.

So yeah. Not a fan :P
