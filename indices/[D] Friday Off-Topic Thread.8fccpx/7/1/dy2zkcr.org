I think you could simply post a discussion thread about superhero armor. It would fit the current rules, as it would be discussion of rational decision making in various rational stories posted here.

In regards to your actual question, I think the vast majority of superhero costumes would benefit from additional armor. Unless some aspect of their power makes wearing armor impractical, it's the simplest way to increase survivability and utility. Especially for the glass canon type people, relying on your ability to dodge any incoming attacks is just silly. Most of the time in comics, they just wear spandex. Which, as far as I know, has no appreciable ability to stop knives or bullets.

One of my favorite regularly updating stories is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With this Ring]], where the main character is a Lantern. It's on the lower end of the power scale for DC, but the main character has stated and demonstrated that his base level defenses are capable of blocking tank rounds, and his active defenses are variable but can hold out against orbital bombardment. Despite this, he has spent significant effort making the best power armor available, and at this point is the second most armored Justice League affiliate. The only reason he isn't the first is that he doesn't have any divinely forged protective equipment, and he won't use any equipment that he can't make/repair/maintain himself (i.e. magical materials). He's mentioned that his power armor is essentially a human sized space craft.
