Flash and Reed Richards have actual restrictions on their ability to wear armor and use their abilities at the same time. Superman's cape is mostly aesthetic, and I could see him having legitimate difficulty in finding armor that would survive in his fights, much less protect him.

I'm more thinking of people like Robin, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Black Widow, or Captain America. They are generally shown to not wear any significant armor, even when armor would be extremely helpful. Maybe Cap's suit is actually some really advanced Kevlar or something, although I kinda doubt it, but Black Canary wears a jacket and fishnets. Their fighting wouldn't be significantly hampered with some additional protection, and as it is they're really vulnerable to knives and bullets.
