How do more expensive mattresses like this compare to e.g. [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q7EPSHI][sub-$200 mattress]]es that you'd get from companies like Zinus (even [[https://www.zinus.com/collections/sale/products/spa-memory-foam-mattress?variant=1259898961928][sub-$100]], depending on the sale)? All my mattresses have been in that price range and last me many years no problem, and we put them through a lot of use (as a bigger, married guy). They seem as comfy if not often much comfier than e.g. mattresses you find in fancy hotels or airbnbs, but I've never consistently slept on $500+ mattresses like the ones you linked (but Casper in particular annoys me, since for a time it seemingly advertised on a bunch of podcasts I listen to).

(of course, there are mattresses that cost several thousands of dollars which may or may not be substantially different from those mentioned)

For 8ish days I'd also just consider getting a blowup, much easier to get rid of/donate afterwards, or keep for occasional guests. Though as a software dev maybe those temporary costs and inconveniences become pretty trivial.
