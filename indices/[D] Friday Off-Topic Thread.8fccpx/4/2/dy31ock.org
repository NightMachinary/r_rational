I have a [[https://www.leesa.com/?utm_source=fuel-x&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=retargeting&utm_content=presday][Leesa mattress]]. I would recommend either that or a [[https://casper.com][Casper mattress]]. [[https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/?size=tn23t][Tuft and Needle]] might be a better option than either of them, I haven't looked into it.

Having a foam mattress for the past few years has been much better than having an innerspring mattress, it's much easier on your back. Also, they deliver it to you in a box (it's shrinkwrapped and "inflates" when you unroll it and take off the plastic) and all three of the ones I mentioned are less than a third of the cost of a good quality innerspring mattress. You could buy a cheap foam mattress from Walmart to get you through the 8ish days it'll take to deliver your real mattress and still come out spending like $2000 less than you could spend on a good quality traditional mattress.
