The high 700s is more than enough to rent decent housing and tenants who can pay ahead of time is every landlord's dream. It's generally wise to settle down your housing before starting a new job in a new place. You don't need the added stress of finding someplace to live while learning the ropes or settling into your new job. Once that's over, I recommend investing in a good mattress because a good night's sleep makes everything else easier. You might want to visit a mattress retailer because you can only trust anecdotes and reviews to a degree - it's more about what your body likes and finds comfortable.

[[/u/phylogenik]] Unless you're a mattress collector/aficionado, you'll never know the difference between a $1000 or sub-$200 mattress until you've tried both. I have a Tuft and Needle myself, but I didn't find it particularly better than my previous decade-or-two-old spring mattress. Don't fall for the fallacy that pricier = more comfortable for your body type. Though, from general reviewer consensus, mattress quality is pretty terrible nowadays at the low/middle-end unless you're buying off a trusted retailer.
