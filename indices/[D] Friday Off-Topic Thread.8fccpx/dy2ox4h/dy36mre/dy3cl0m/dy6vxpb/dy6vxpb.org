Everyone has different body types and preferences - that's why even thousand dollar mattresses get some bad reviews. I do expect that the average consumer who swaps to a T&N from a spring mattress feels an improvement. So maybe my body doesn't like feel of T&N's foam/density or my previous spring mattress was just really well made?
