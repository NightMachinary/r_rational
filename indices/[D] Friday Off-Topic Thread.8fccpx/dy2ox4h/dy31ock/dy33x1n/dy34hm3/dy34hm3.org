  How do more expensive mattresses like this compare to e.g. sub-$200 mattresses that you'd get from companies like Zinus (even sub-$100, depending on the sale)?

I wouldn't know, but I do know that memory foam tends to not do so well with airflow and heat distribution so it tends to get hot, and the ones I listed all do things to counteract that with proprietary foam blends to keep the foam from trapping your body heat so you stay cool.

Casper has advertised on just about every Rooster Teeth show (and RT's subsidiaries like Let's Play) for several years at this point, and that's part of the reason I got a Leesa mattress instead of Casper, just out of spite (also has to do with the fact that they're incredibly similar and are priced similarly, and most people want/need a "firmness rating" of 6 or 7 and Casper's sitting at 6 while Leesa is at 7).

I did the blowup mattress thing the last time we moved, and I wasn't happy with it, but YMMV.
