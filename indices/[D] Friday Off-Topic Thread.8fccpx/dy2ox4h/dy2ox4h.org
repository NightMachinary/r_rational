So I accepted a job offer in San Francisco starting June 11th. So much to work out. The big thing right now is how long to rent an Airbnb and if I should move a week early or two. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm exited and nervous.

*Edit:*

Some more info. I'm starting as a software engineer at a startup right after college. The pay was more than I expected even accounting for the cost of living and I think I should be able to pay between 2k and 3k for housing eventually

My basic plan right now is:

- Fly down near the start of June with a backpack and checked bag

  - Weeks worth of clothes
  - Basic hygiene stuff
  - Probably very basic kitchen type stuff if room

- Find someplace to rent more long term within a week or two
- Buy basic stuff

  - mattress
  - bedding
  - Maybe a bit more kitchen stuff

- Start working
- Ship more stuff from home

  - Extra clothes
  - More kitchen stuff
  - More bedding maybe
  - Desktop stuff

The big pieces I'm unsure about are how long it will take me to find somewhere to rent and if I should actually try to find somewhere to rent and move in before I start work or if it makes more sense to do that while I'm working.

I'm also sort of worried as I don't have much renting history. I do have a fairly good credit score (just under 800) and quite a bit of savings so I could offer to pay for the first couple months ahead of time or something.
