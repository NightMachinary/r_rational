I'm planning on moving very little stuff especially at first as I don't have that much stuff. My plan such as it is was to move out with a couple of suitcases. One of the many things that's going to make this move weird is it will be basically my first substantial one away from home in Ohio.

The job is with a startup as software engineer. The companies small enough that I'd rather not say the name as it would probably be enough by itself to identify me, but they have on the order of 30 employees right now. I don't really want to mention pay, but I did in another thread if you want to dig through. Regardless I figure I could afford between 2k and 3k in housing.
