So, they finally and shockingly caught the GSK/EAR/ONS/BDK/probably known by other names too, after 44 years, with DNA evidence. They apparently got it through Ged Match and geneology, narrowed it down to a suspect, and then identified him based on discarded DNA.

While it's amazing they caught a guy who murdered more than 12 people and raped more than 50, does this spell a death knell for privacy? In 20 years time will the fact your cousin submitted her DNA to a geneology service mean that you will never be able to get out of paying a parking ticket again? Or will criminals get caught more often and we'll live in a crime-free utopia?
