  While it's amazing they caught a guy who murdered more than 12 people and raped more than 50, does this spell a death knell for privacy? In 20 years time will the fact your cousin submitted her DNA to a geneology service mean that you will never be able to get out of paying a parking ticket again? Or will criminals get caught more often and we'll live in a crime-free utopia?

Yes.

Or more realistically, I expect to see in-person crime significantly decrease as privacy approaches zero for your regular citizen, but since offensive technology typically outpaces defensive in the modern era, new ways to commit crime despite the limits placed on privacy will be invented.
