Apparently (I haven't read/watched much myself, but I have read several critiques), Jordan Peterson attracts the support of the alt-right because a lot of his stuff argues for traditional values and his emphasis on self improvement is structured such that it serves as an argument against improving society as a whole. I've heard the term Status Quo Warrior (the polar opposite of SJW and I think it fits). A lot of philosophical stuff (and other areas outside his expertise) he gets outright wrong (and the way he gets it wrong aligns with the alt right view of postmodernism and “cultural Marxism”).

Check out [[/r/enoughpetersonspam]] if you want to see a lot of little potshots at his stuff. If you want, I can post some of the select problematic examples I've seen critiqued. On the surface Peterson may sound okay, but the actual content and meaning is at best empty fluff and at worst outright fascist.
