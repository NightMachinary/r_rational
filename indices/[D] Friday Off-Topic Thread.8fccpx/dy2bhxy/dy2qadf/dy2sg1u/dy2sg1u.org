  his emphasis on self improvement is structured such that it serves as an argument against improving society as a whole

I've watched the videos where he addresses this. The whole "clean your room" bit. I disagree that it serves as an argument against trying to fight for progress, he's just saying that these kids (let's call them what they are, kids) haven't lived in the real world yet and organized their own lives and that maybe the people running things know more about how things are run than the kids do.

I loved (still love) Bernie Sanders and everything he stands for, and I understand that machine automation and A.I. are going to replace /all the jobs/ over the coming decades and there's no way to make a post-jobs economy work without some sort of "socialism." I was big into #OccupyWallstreet while it was going on. Down with the 1% and all that jazz. That doesn't mean it's possible to fix income inequality by going out in the street and yelling about it, or that it's reasonable to expect the system to be capable of turning on a dime and fixing it overnight. That's the problem with SJWs. They think that if you just scream loudly enough at enough people, you can just make problems go away by beating the opposing side into submission. It's SJWs' fault that the alt-right exists. It's SJWs' fault that Trump got elected.

And it's /great/ that alt-right kids / young adults are listening to JBP. He's center-right, it's wonderful that far-right kids on a path to fully embracing fascism are being drawn closer to a reasonable middle.

I don't agree with his rhetoric about "Marxism," but I do agree that SJWs and identity politics are an insidious force. The right likes to say the SJWs are "far left," but they're not, they're totalitarian and authoritarian and in a lot of meaningful ways they're more conservative in some areas than the alt-right kids. It's terrifying. Generation Z is so effing conservative that even the liberal ones are conservative.
