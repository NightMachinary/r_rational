  I disagree that it serves as an argument against trying to fight for progress, he's just saying that these kids (let's call them what they are, kids) haven't lived in the real world yet and organized their own lives and that maybe the people running things know more about how things are run than the kids do.

This is the standard conservative party line to dismiss anything younger generations say about the fucked up things the people with power use it for. This was said during the Vietnam protests, and the Iraq War protests, and yes Occupy Wallstreet, and countless other progressive, youth-led movements. It's not new or any more true just because he put an impossible bar to reach in front of it.

And singling out "kids" is not helpful for this. Many of the "kids" being referred to here are in their 20s and 30s, which is an age group which includes some of the smartest and most informed people I know. Yes, most people marching in the streets are not super informed of all the nuances of the issues they're protesting. Occupy Wallstreet in particular was frustrating because of how much it lacked coherent and knowledgeable leadership to make use of everyone's anger.

But if everyone waited for their lives to be perfect before they tried to fight for change, literally no one would fight for change. There is a grain of good advice in "clean your room first," but Peterson does nothing to distinguish that grain or draw any sorts of lines around when it's okay to fight for what you believe in rather than "mind your own business."

  It's SJWs' fault that the alt-right exists. It's SJWs' fault that Trump got elected.

I'm sorry, but this is just nonsense. This is what alt-rights people and Trump voters love to say, and it's just ridiculous to believe them without actually examining where things stand and why.

First off, the alt-right has existed in some form for DECADES. American fascism isn't new. White supremacy isn't new. If you honestly think that the SJWs spawned institutions like Breitbart or Stormfront, then I legitimately don't know who you think "the SJWs" refer to, or how long ago you think they coagulated as a define-able mass.

Second, Trump did NOT win because of SJWs. People who already have reason to dislike SJWs keep saying this, and it's utter bullshit. Trump won because ~80,000 people in the Rust belt voted for him. Rural voters in dying manufacturing and coal towns weren't sufficiently placated by Clinton and went with the guy who promised them the moon, despite him showing no way at all for how he would fulfill those promises.

Again: rural, older people voted for Trump. And they largely don't give a shit about SJWs. They don't live near or on colleges. They don't get angry about idiots on Tumblr. They care about jobs and immigrants way more than they care about some man-haters giving feminism a bad name.

I get the dislike of SJWs. I get being frustrated by them as a progressive. But all you're doing by buying into and repeating the alt-right and Trump voters' narrative that SJWs are to blame for their own shitty beliefs and decisions is diverting attention from the actual problems.
