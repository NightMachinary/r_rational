I've watched / listened to a few 5 to 10 minute videos that were highlights from the podcast and highlights of reactions by both SH and JP to the podcast (there were actually two podcasts they did together now that I think about it). It's all jumbled up in my memory because I listened to one of their reactions to the second video then watched highlights of the first then highlights of the second video then reactions to the first, or something like that.

Over the past year or so I've begun having a hard time focusing on things I previously took interest in. Like, I would read for hours or watch hour-long videos of people playing video games on youtube or 2 to 3 hour long podcasts, and now I'll watch 5 or ten minutes of a video then pause it and read something for 5 minutes then watch 10 minutes of a different video then look at reddit then circle back to the first video for 15 minutes then go back and continue reading for half an hour then start watching a new video before I go back to one of the ones I already started, stuff like that.

Consequently, even though I've exposed myself to a lot of Jordan Peterson content, it's mostly been in the form of 5 to 15 minute long highlight videos. I feel like I have ADHD. I presume it's a result of some sort of depression.
