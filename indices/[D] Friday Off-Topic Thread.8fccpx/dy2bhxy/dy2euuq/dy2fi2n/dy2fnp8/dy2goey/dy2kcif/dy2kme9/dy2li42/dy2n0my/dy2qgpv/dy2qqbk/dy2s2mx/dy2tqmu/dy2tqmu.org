Everything on that list looks like it costs money, and we don't really have money to waste. There's a pretty small gap below the door, but the door frame and the door aren't perfectly parallel with each other and there's a noticeable gap at the top of the door. If that gap was at the bottom, a towel would work great. I've done that before, actually, in a house we lived in from 2009 to 2012 where there was an inch-and-a-half gap below the doors to all the bedrooms for some reason. And I've slept with a fan running for white noise since college when I lived in the dorms and my roommate snored. I'd imagine it'd be impossible to /ever/ sleep if I wasn't at least doing that.
