Thank you for an excellent suggestion, but it looks like it would feel indistinguishable in a physical sense from wearing a normal headband. I've tried wearing a sleep mask before and /I could feel it touching me/ and I just can't deal with that. I imagine I'd have a similar issue with the headband. I would be aware of the fact that something was touching my forehead and my ears and that awareness would consume my mind.
