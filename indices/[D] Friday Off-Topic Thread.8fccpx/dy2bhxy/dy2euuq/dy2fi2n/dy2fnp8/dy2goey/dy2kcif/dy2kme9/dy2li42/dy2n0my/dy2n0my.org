I've had periods of depression before in my life, I'm quite sure that's what's happening now, and if I'm honest I probably already know the cause.

The remnants of my former friend-group finally petered off about a year and a half ago and I haven't had a job in a long while so I haven't been in a position to go out and meet new people, so I spend most of my time indoors. Vitamin D is involved in serotonin production, and eye contact and social interaction cause serotonin to be released. My serotonin levels are probably low because I've become a bit of a shut-in.

It doesn't help that we "sold" our house in January, but the buyers are leasing until July because they're moving from another state and the bank won't give them a loan/mortgage/whatever until the guy has had a job in-state for six months, so we can't buy a new house and move until we get the money when our house closes, so we've been living at my grandmother's house since February. Being here has significantly impacted my sleep schedule.

She wakes up at like 5am, and by 8 or 9 she'll be hammering and sawing and building and all sorts of other stuff that people people in their late 70s shouldn't be doing anymore (and if she's not doing that, she usually takes a phone call from a friend at around 10am and she's partially deaf so whenever she's on the phone she "talks" (practically screams) like she's trying to communicate with a person standing across from her on the opposite side of a busy street), which wakes me up after I've only been asleep for 6 hours, so I'll lay there for an hour or two until the interruption is finished and go back to sleep for another 3 or 4 hours, and then I'll go to sleep later the next night/morning as a result of waking up later, so I'll only have been asleep for like 3 hours when she starts banging around the next day, and basically it pushes my sleep schedule around the clock until I'm scheduled to go to sleep when she starts doing her thing, so I'll wait until she's done to even begin going to sleep, but then when that happens I'll only sleep for 6 hours for some reason and the next morning be scheduled to fall asleep at the same time again, so I'll try staying awake until 7 or 8 or 9 at night so I can wake up at 4am, but having been awake so long I'll sleep for 9 or more hours and wake up at 6 or 7 in the morning, and then instead of getting sleepy 16 hours later the extra sleep will keep me awake for 18 or 19 hours, and then it just starts going around the clock again.

I'm on a "try to stay awake all day" day today and it's about 2pm, hence the extra ADHD. I apologize for the atrocious 297-word sentence I just spit out, god, if novels are 150 words a page that's a /two page long sentence/, what an unholy abomination.

We'll be doing a cross-country move to another state here in the next few months, and I'll get a job and situate myself and things'll go back to normal.
