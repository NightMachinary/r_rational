Sometimes (25%) Sam's podcast's aren't very good, but I think the average quality is good.

You might benefit from listening to another couple episodes - I did not listen the episode in question, but I did listen to a couple of episodes after that, and Sam spent a fair bit of time responding to criticisms... which suggests that it was one of the "bad ones".
