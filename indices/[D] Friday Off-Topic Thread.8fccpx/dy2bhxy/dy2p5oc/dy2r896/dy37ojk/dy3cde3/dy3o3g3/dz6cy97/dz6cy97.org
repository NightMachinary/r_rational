I'm quite interested in continuing this conversation. I know it's /a lot/ to ask, but this video is an hour and forty minutes long, and perhaps you'd be willing to watch the whole thing. I've delved deeper into JPB, and yeah, as an atheist, it's kinda difficult to take what he says at face value. He's quite clearly wrong about most of the things he says, though I still agree with him about the free speech issue. even the things I disagree with him about are pleasurable to hear in the sense that the vast majority of people are completely irrational and approach these subjects from a point of view that I could never come from, in spite of the fact that I started delving into consrvative ideology beause the sequeces said something about not actually understanding the opposing worldview's arguments from the inside. But maybe you'll watch this whole thing and we can have a conversation about it in a broader sense.

Sorry, I've been drinking, and I copy/pasted some things. I think both of these men are 100% atheists and that they modify their arguments to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Please, feel completely free to give me something to respond to when I'm sober.
