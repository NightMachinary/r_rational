Can you explain what it is about this video that made Peterson more intelligent and rational than the literal dozens of hours of his material I've already consumed? I feel like you're not taking seriously my assertion that I've really spent quite a bit of time listening to Peterson and found him wanting, and are pattern matching me with generic non-rationalist liberals without me giving any real indication that I've dismissed conservative viewpoints "out of hand." Unless I said something that gives that impression?

If you can at least point to a topic in the video that you think is well argued and interesting I'm happy to check it out. But semi-blindly consuming the whole thing 15 minutes at a time is still mathematically the same amount of time I'm overall not spending on writing, reading, research, or listening to people who haven't already demonstrated the many flaws in their epistemology that Peterson has. I don't know you well enough for your recommendation in pointing me at the video without any specific rationale to make it seem any less blind compared to his many other videos. (I also know who Shapiro is and find him less than impressive)
