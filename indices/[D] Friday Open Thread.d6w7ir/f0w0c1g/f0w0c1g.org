What are some good documentaries (movies, tv episodes, etc.) on primate ecology & evolution? Some time ago I asked for resources relating to evolutionary primatology for a new course I was signed up to teach. It went well (though my emphasis on Bayesian computational phylogenetics was... polarizing, let's say), and it looks like I'll be covering it again this upcoming year.

This go around, I'm looking to spice up the content with short video clips, where relevant (lectures are 90 minutes long, and a 3-5 minute video break midway seems refreshing). I've already sliced up a high-res copy of [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1575290/][Life E10]] on primates, which features excellent cinematography and solid narration. Does anyone know of other materials I can use? Preferably something recent (so e.g. blu-rays are available) with high-ish production values. Bonus points if it's actually educational! :D

Thanks for any help!

(also, just finished another new course this week -- had a lot of fun! It was more intro-y, which meant I could focus on the 'greatest hits' of my field without getting bogged down in additional details. Just got student evals yesterday -- and I know we're not supposed to care about them, that they fail to naively predict subsequent performance for whatever confounded reason and are biased towards men etc. etc. -- but reading them is still one of the highlights of the whole process lol)
