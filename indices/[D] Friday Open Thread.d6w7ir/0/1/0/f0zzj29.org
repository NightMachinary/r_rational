Did you message me with an alt account? As far as I know, you expressed interest by replying to my comment. I was talking about people who privately messaged me. If we include you then it's four people, not three.

And it's like the Merovingian says in The Matrix Reloaded: "If we do not ever /take/ time, how can we ever /have/ time?"

And then if we want to be even more insufferable, we could quote some insipid generic inspirational crap: “Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.”

I also read this blog a few months ago:

It is stretches credulity to say that you couldn't carve out three 1-hour blocks of time in your week.

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, do as many push-ups and bodyweight squats as you can do. It'll take you 10 minutes and get you into the habit.

EDIT: Many people can't do even one pushup when they stop doing them with their arms splayed out like they see in the movies and start doing them with proper form. You can work your way up to floor pushups by starting with wall pushups:
