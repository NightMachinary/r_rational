The hardest step of any change is admitting you were wrong. We're not supposed to have that problem in this community, but we're all human and that's a human trait.

Remember that [[https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/related-topics/alcohol-relapse-statistics/#gref][relapse is common]], not indicative of personal or moral failure, and some experts even consider it part of the recovery process. Obviously, if you can stay off entirely you should, but you aren't inevitably doomed if you can't. You should look into [[https://www.addictionsandrecovery.org/medications/antabuse.htm][drugs which reduce alcohol cravings]] with your doctor. They aren't cures, but they do make the process easier. The efficacy of 12-step programs is unclear, but what they definitely do is provide structure and a community of people who understand, both of which are known to be helpful. You may be able to find a secular one somewhere, you may not. Definitely look into therapy/psychiatric care. It is not weakness to admit you need help, it is weakness to deny it.

Also, alcohol withdrawal can be lethal. If you feel truly awful, don't hesitate to go to the hospital.

Good luck. You deserve it.
