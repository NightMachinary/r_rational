Oh, it's not like a chronic thing. My habit has been binge drinking - like, around seven twelfths of a bottle of vodka in one sitting, and then the next night [[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/14/us/aspirin-and-liquor-can-be-a-bad-mix-study-says.html][taking three aspirin]] an hour before finishing off the bottle. For most of the last three years, I was doing that once every three to five weeks (not the aspirin trick - I'm crazy, not stupid), but then about a year ago I had a health issue that kept me from drinking for about four months, and when I started drinking again at the beginning of 2019 it soon became every other weekend, then eventually just about /every/ weekend. Lethal withdrawal with "the shakes" is something that happens to people who drink every day for years. I don't have a physical dependence. What I have right now is a problem with anonymously being an embarrassment to myself on the internet. I'm quitting because that passes a high enough threshold to be recognizable as a problem, and I'm cutting it off so it doesn't continue growing into a problem IRL.

But thank you for the words of encouragement.
