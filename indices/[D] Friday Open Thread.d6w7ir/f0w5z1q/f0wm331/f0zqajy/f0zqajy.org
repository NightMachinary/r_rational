  I had an idea at the beginning, of “Elizabeth as a character” with a meta story alongside the real story... y'know, whatever, that was too stupid to even be worth an explanation.

Oh yeah, definitely.

For what it's worth, "buying into your own hype" is probably, like, the n°1 rationalist sin, so you're 200% not alone. And it's an attitude you quickly outgrow once you identify it.

  Three people have messaged me to take me up on my offer to help with getting in better shape and improving health. I've only gone in depth with one of them. One of the others I should've been trying harder to follow up with after they went radio silent

I wouldn't worry about it.

Speaking as one of the person you message, I have my own things going on; I'm not really in a pace where taking up a new exercise regimen would be convenient or productive.

If someone asks for help, you answer and they don't follow up... well, it's kind of their problem.
