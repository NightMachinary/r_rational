It's very brave of you to stand up here and make that kind of commitment, so: kudos, congratulations, and thank you for sharing that with us.

Several of the problems you describe (addiction, lack of motivation, disinterest in keeping healthy) are both symptoms and aggravators of depression; have you considered seeing a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist? As someone who has struggled with depression myself, I have found it to be helpful, if for no other reason than to have someone to talk to without the risk of being judged.

I wish you the best of luck in your journey to become the person you'd like yourself to be.
