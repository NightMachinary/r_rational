  I don't know if "brave" is a word that I'm really deserving of.

I obviously can't speak for you, but it seems to me that people online, even when operating pseudonymously, have the same sense of community that they do IRL. They value their reputation, their place in their community, their social standing, all of it.

And, sad as I am to say it, substance abuse and related stuff do hold a kind of stigma. People have been attacked and driven out of communities for less. You'd hope that a community based around the idea of conquering your own internal prejudices would be immune to such things, but, hey, 25% of any community is assholes, so you had to know it was a risk to expose yourself.

Put those two things together, and you willingly risked something you valued out of a desire to become a better person.

If that doesn't qualify as "bravery," what does?
