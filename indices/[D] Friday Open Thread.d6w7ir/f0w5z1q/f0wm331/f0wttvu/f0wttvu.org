Thanks.

  It's very brave of you to stand up here and make that kind of commitment

Thanks, but I don't know if "brave" is a word that I'm really deserving of. My IRL self has suffered zero tangible consequences as a result of my online behavior while intoxicated, and will suffer no tangible consequences from failing to honor any commitments made under the name "Elizabeth."

I have goals regarding mental/physical/neurological health. I have goals regarding creative endeavors. I have goals regarding lots of things, like "reading X minutes of fiction and Y minutes of nonfiction every day" or whatever. There are a lot of things I need to be doing. Alcohol is detrimental to the pursuit of all of my goals in all domains. It's actively undermining my capacity to do the things I need to be doing. It would be incredibly stupid - and dare I say /irrational/ - for me to /not/ give up the alcohol.

But thank you for saying that.
