So, I'm admitting to myself that there might be a strong possibility that I might be a person who might be highly susceptible to possibly having a problem with alcohol. So I'm quitting alcohol.

Obligatory /hi my name is Michael and I'm an alcoholic./

I wanted to say this publicly, partially because of the whole [[https://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/does-making-a-public-commitment-really-help-people-lose-weight/]["making a public commitment"]] thing, and partially because I want people to know that /I/ know. I sometimes make /myself/ cringe. I've so thoroughly embarrassed myself with this account that I would absolutely delete it and start over from scratch if it weren't for the fact that the stories I've “been working on” are tied to it.

And while we're here admitting to things, "been working on" is in quotes because “Elizabeth” has been a straight-up liar at times. Especially from early 2017 to mid 2018. I've said things along the lines of “I've got over a hundred thousand words worth of outlines and drafts,” or “I've been working and have this this and this,” nope, that's all been like 97% bullshit. I had an idea at the beginning, of “Elizabeth as a character” with a meta story alongside the real story... y'know, whatever, that was too stupid to even be worth an explanation. Also, I haven't worked on any writing at all in probably over six months, and that was the Mary Poppins story that I came up with around Christmas. It might literally be over a year since the last time I've even touched the HPMOR sequel fic.

Three people have messaged me to take me up on my offer to help with getting in better shape and improving health. I've only gone in depth with one of them. One of the others I should've been trying harder to follow up with after they went radio silent. The other of the others I didn't even remember getting a message from because I was drunk when I opened and responded to their message. I said to them, "Awesome, happy to help, I'll message you tomorrow afternoon." That was last Friday, a full week ago, and I didn't remember it until yesterday.

And yes, I was intoxicated when I made the offer, but the offer is still open.

So, um, yeah. No more alcohol for me.
