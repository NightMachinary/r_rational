[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]] (the ant one) is not even remotely a rational fiction, but it updates daily and I enjoy it. It's about a person turned into a giant ant, it morphs into a kingdom builder of sorts, except with giant ants. Light and lighthearted.

On a not completely unrelated note, I also highly recommend the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/][Chrysalis]] from [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]], it's a completed story about an AI who becomes a psudo Von Neumann probe and attempts to enact revenge on the alien species which wiped out humanity. Just as before, this one is not rational either. Much more serious than the above story.
