Not the one you replied to, but for me it left the promises in its premise. The main character stopped rationally perusing his goals, and he was overpowered enough that he just started drifting, really. Stations of canon were being done basically on a checklist, and after that the story went super meta in a way I didn't enjoy. That's aside from the author's little hissy fit that happened after the mods banned him for a day because of transphobia displayed both within the story and as the author in the comments where he deleted everything and moved to another forum. Actually, that happened twice, but I forgot the reason for the first move.
