*Request:* Stories in which the plot happens at the protagonist's initiative.

Instead of being forced into some kind of plotline by circumstances, the main characters are free agents that decide what goal they want to accomplish on their own, and the plot is about them pursuing it. Said goal could be anything, but I'd prefer a long-term large-scale one.

Things that /aren't/ what I'm looking for:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][The protagonist is trying to stop the antagonist's plot]].

- The protagonist is responding to some kind of novel crisis (such as a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent][mass empowering event]] or an alien invasion).

- The protagonist is taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (such as getting superpowers or being transported into a different universe). (Even if they have a choice in whether to take this opportunity, the plot is still mainly shaped by it, not by the characters' own goals.)

- The protagonist is working for some kind of organization, and the plot is about them completing its assignments. (It's fine if they're part of an organization, but the plot is about pursuing goals /orthogonal/ to the organization's. There isn't a lot of agency in a soldier following a general's orders... unless the soldier's actual goal is to rise in rank until they could implement some particular changes to military policy.)

*Recommendations:* Science Fiction with Weird Technology

[[/u/Veedrac][u/Veedrac]], last week you were [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/csib4y/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/exf14u4/][asking]] for such stories; here's my list. Note that it's entirely possible you're already familiar with most of them.

(Nature of technology is spoilered where appropriate.)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156775.Quarantine][/Quarantine/]] (78k words) by Greg Egan. What if the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics were correct?

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359][/Floornight/]] (70k words) by nostalgebraist. Souls-based technology that allows to create and re-integrate parallel timelines.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/59462-orthogonal][/Orthogonal/]], trilogy, by Greg Egan. Set in a universe with wildly different laws of physics. To be precise: it functions on Riemannian geometry, not Lorentzian. See more [[http://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][here]], down the page.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823062.The_Light_of_Other_Days][/The Light of Other Days/]] (103k), by Arthur Clarke. Easy-to-create wormholes allow surveillance of any location in the past and present.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509784.The_End_of_Eternity][/The End of Eternity/]] (71k) by Isaac Asimov and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10753368-palimpseste][/Palimpsest/]] (28k) by Charles Stross. Same premise: an organization abuses time-travel to control humanity's development from prehistory into deep astronomical time.

- [[https://qntm.org/ra][/Ra/]] (156k) by Sam Hughes. Magic is real. Magic is faked via "nonlocality technology", which allows to directly store and transfer mass, energy, momentum, spin, and electrical charge. Also: simulations are abused.

- [[https://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]] (240k) by Scott Alexander. I mean, it sort of fits.
