You wouldn't happen to be fluent in German, would you? Eschbach's [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausgebrannt][Ausgebrannt]] is about a German dude who comes to the US as a temporary translator in a software project, and has a dream of staying and attaining the American citizenship, and eventually become rich on other people's money and other people's ideas (as you can see, he's not the most alturistic person).\\
The first part of the book is about him determinedly integrating himself into the company, using some almost underhandedly manipulative tactics. The story eventually sees him become a better person, but it's quite a process.

Other than that, I can recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. The main character, Sylvester, is almost /always/ working on some kind of scheme or plan, even if in the beginning he's usually reacting to something his superiors or enemies pull. His increasing ability to act on his own is one of the more important trends in the story. Towards the end he and his friends become a force with an agenda of their own.
