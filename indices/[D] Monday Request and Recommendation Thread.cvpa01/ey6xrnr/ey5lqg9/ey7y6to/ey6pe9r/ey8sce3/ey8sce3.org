Yes, but they're all with caveats.

- Cleanest example: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/276516][/Fifty Years in the Virtuous City/]] (8k words).

- [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][/Twig/]] after Arc 10, as [[/u/Juansson][u/Juansson]] recommends below. It features a cognitively enhanced protagonist attempting to destroy an empire from within. It somewhat runs contrary to my third counter-example. I think the caveat is that the "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" of having been enhanced is sufficiently general that it doesn't force the story in any particular direction.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot][/Mr. Robot/]], which is about a hacker attempting to orchestrate an economic collapse.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][/The Traitor Baru Cormorant/]], whose protagonist is trying to destroy an empire from within.

Okay, maybe what I'm actually looking for is stories about people attempting to enact large-scale social changes for ideological or egoistical reasons.
