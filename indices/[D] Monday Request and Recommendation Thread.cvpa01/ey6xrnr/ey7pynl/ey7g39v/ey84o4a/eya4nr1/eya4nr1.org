I think it's reasonably valid, people are mostly atoms, but we're also an evershifting pattern of energy. I'd be interested in seeing a neurosurgeon work with a demon and a precision defibrilator. I think it's fair to assume it hasn't been tried before or else hasn't been published because of how stigmatized demon contact is.
