Looking for a dungeon core story that isn't just a person in a box.

I would also like to see more of a process of discovery rather then the core being handed knowledge of everything to them because they have been reincarnated, magical companion, or game system.

Picked up Dungeon Engineer from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but havnt started reading it yet.
