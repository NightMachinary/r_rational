Feeling like a broken record, this is the third time in just this thread that I recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]].

Since you've probably already read that one, I'll also recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Girl Genius]]. Mostly Steampunk, but has some bio-punk mixed in.

The first episode of Love, Death and Robots has drawn comparisons to Twig before, also has [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFS2DWgijh4][this]] rather awesome rendition as a music video.
