Try Lawrence Watt-Evans somewhat rationalist Ethshar series like [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320216.With_a_Single_Spell][With a Single Spell]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317497.The_Misenchanted_Sword][The Misenchanted Sword]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/422225.The_Unwilling_Warlord][The Unwilling Warlord]] (they stand-alone). Although they usually start with "a call to adventure" they quickly spiral out of control.
