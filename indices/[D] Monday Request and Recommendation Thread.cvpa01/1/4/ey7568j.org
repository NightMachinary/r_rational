How much are you willing for these goals/plans to be changed by the events of the story?

I can think of a couple stories that at least /start out/ with a goal like that, but I can't think of any story where the character's goals don't at least change somewhat by the end of the story.

Also: how do you feel about revenge stories (e.g. Count of Monte Cristo)?
