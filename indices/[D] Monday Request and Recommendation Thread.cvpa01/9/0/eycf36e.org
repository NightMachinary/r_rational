[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/][The King in the Long Night]] is a crossover with Stellaris, where the Commonwealth of Man (militaristic xenophobic human colonist faction) finds the world on which GoT takes place, and decides to uplift them in order to get access to their relatively strong Psykers. For this purpose they identify key players and place agents near them, to influence them in certain directions.
