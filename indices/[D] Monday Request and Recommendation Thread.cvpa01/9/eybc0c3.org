I haven't visited the rec threads often, and I don't read a ton of fanfic, so I might be missing something incredibly well-known, but...

Anybody got a rec for a rational SoIaF fic? I've been seeing some of the more grandiose conspiracy theories out there, and it's reminding me how good the books are and how much I'd like to see more stories in the world. I'd especially love if there was one that got more into the mystical elements of the world. AUs welcome, most important thing to me is internal consistency.

Edit: I just remembered the Joffrey time loop one, but the synopses I heard didn't sound like my kind of thing.
