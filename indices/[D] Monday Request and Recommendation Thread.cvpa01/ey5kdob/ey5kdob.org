I am looking for stories that deal with the effect that powerful people have on their surroundings and themself. How do friendships work when you can read minds passively. How does a government deal with someone that can wipe its army with a have of their hand. How do godlike individuals deal with normal human interactions. That kind of stuff.

I've seen a good bit of it in TGAB, to give an example.

I prefer original stories, but fanfiction is fine too of course.

Thanks for your help!
