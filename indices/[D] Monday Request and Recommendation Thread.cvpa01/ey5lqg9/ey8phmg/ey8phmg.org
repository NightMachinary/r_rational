The Malazan Book of the Fallen series meets your requirement. It's about a brother and sister who are trying to do the right thing, in a world where might makes right. Maybe just the sister. It's hard to tell how much is her manipulating him vs his nature.

Mind, there are a lot of schemes, meddlers, and pre-cognition/causality to confuse everything. There are quite a few once in a lifetime opportunities, but they were accepted (or more likely, created) for the service of their goal, not the other way around.
