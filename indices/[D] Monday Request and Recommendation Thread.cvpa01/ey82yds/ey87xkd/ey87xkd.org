Have you tried [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]? Sylvester is one of the most fascinating characters in all of webfiction. He's unabashedly villaneous, a mad genius despite having the memory of a goldfish, charismatic, literally toxic, and basically only cares for his group of friends - but for them he cares so much that at one point they have to make a rule that he's not allowed to sacrifice himself for them unless it saves at least two others.

Towards the end of the story his drugs increasingly destroy his mind, and he goes quite mad. But it's still an enjoyable read.

Some of the other people in his group are actually also good fits for your request; Ashton is a mushroom whose favourite color is blood red and who can use pheromone spores to influence people, Mary is literally always a wrong twitch away from murdering everyone in the room who isn't a friend, Helen is a biological experiment that has one single drive that kinda encompasses food, sex, and murder all at once,
