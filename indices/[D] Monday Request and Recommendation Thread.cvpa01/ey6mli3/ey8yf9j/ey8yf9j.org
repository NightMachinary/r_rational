Perdido Street Station and the following books are a good investment of credits in my opinion. They have it all; multi-faceted characters, deep worlds and the sort of plotlines that weave into beautiful creations as you look back upon them.

There is no character I can recall as exceedingly rational, they do however feel like coherent actors whose actions and motivations create the plot rather than the other way around.
