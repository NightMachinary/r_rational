As for perfect prison, in a superhero setting I am working at keeping supervillains in normal jails would be really troublesome, since many of them can easily obliterate any conventional lock-up, so putting them behind the bars is not the best option. That's why someone clever decided to shut these criminals in Virtual Reality and block every movement command from the brain to the body (as well as sensory information from the body to the brain) of any prisoner. Of course they are put in virtual worlds serving their prison rehabilitation.

How would you break from something like that?
