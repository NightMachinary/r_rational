  Perhaps we'll see a minor skirmish or three, but the grand strategy of the Time War can never be written in a way that'll make me happy.

I support that. I liked the way it was handled in the Faction Paradox spinoff novels, or the connected BBC novels. What we /did/ see in /Day of the Doctor/ (and, particularly, the /Last Night/ prequel) was much more like Star Wars than anything else. Very disappointing.
