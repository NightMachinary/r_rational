I'm willing to bite that particular bullet, if it's unavoidable. (Though probably with the in-universe proviso that such energy is no more 'free' than that of the Casimir effect.)

But before I do, do you (or anyone else reading this) know of any remotely plausible design to extract /useful/ work, such as electricity, when it takes at least 20 kilowatts to a ~30 kg gizmo (and probably higher for both numbers, for these smaller, less efficient designs) to produce each Newton of thrust?

Or, is there another subreddit I can ask this particular question?
