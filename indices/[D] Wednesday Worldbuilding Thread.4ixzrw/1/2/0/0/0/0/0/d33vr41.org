Given the numbers I'm currently using for a default spacecraft's mass and thrust (ie, 200,000 kg plus cargo, 3,000 Newtons), then for any reasonable sorts of magnets and wire coils, how much energy could be produced over any given length of time? That is, is this technique any more useful than imparting a one-time burst of kinetic energy through lithobraking?
