There is one way to avoid free energy from reactionless drives. It requires them to break Galilean relativity. That is, give the universe one preferred rest frame of motion that the ke of the device is measured against. Thrust would decline with the square of the velocity in this frame. A reasonable frame to use would be the comoving frame of the cosmic microwave background, a few hundred km/s relative to the sun. For velocities in the tens of km per second around the solar system its close enough to isotropic but at the hundreds of km per second or more required for interstellar stuff, it starts becoming much faster and cheaper to travel against the motion of the sun relative to said background giving a preferred direction for travel towards the blueshifted side of the sky. Side effect: you can tell your exact velocity by turning one of these on and pointing it in a few directions and the universe is no longer isotropic.
