I recognized MiHsC right off the bat, haha.

Anyway, you can't get a reactionless drive without also getting perpetual motion and free-energy machines. Why is this? I'll use your numbers to illustrate:

After 1 year, you get a kinetic energy of 25 petajoules, right? That's after a full year of 60 MW. Well, 25 petajoules per year is equal to 793 billion joules per second. 60 MW is 60 million joules per second. /So you put in 60 MW and get 793 GW out./
