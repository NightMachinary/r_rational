  I sort of imagine a group of people on a pilgrimage -- maybe a wall st type, a hippy-ish college student, a disgraced (male) politician, a woman obsessed with a former lover, someone with depression -- all hoping, somewhat rationally but with some wishful thinking mixed in, that the place of power will solve their problems. Obviously only some of them can make it to the destination.

The book /Hyperion/ by Dan Simmons is basically this. Not rational by any means, but an absolutely fantastic read - probably my favorite science-fiction book of all time.
