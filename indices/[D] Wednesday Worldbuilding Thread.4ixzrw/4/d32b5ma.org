I would love to read something that mixes the modern world (skyscrapers, cars, twitter mobs) with creepy medieval themes (local deities which may be bargained it, kings with royal courts, witches).

At some point, I vaguely thought of writing a story called "Place of Power," taking inspiration from a common trope in computer games -- you visit a difficult-to-reach location to obtain new abilities for your character.

I sort of imagine a group of people on a pilgrimage -- a wall st type, a hippy-ish college student, a disgraced (male) politician, a woman unable to let go of a former lover, someone struggling with intermittent depression -- all hoping, mostly rationally but with a little bit of wishful thinking mixed in, that a visit to the place-of-power will grant them some super-natural abilities, perhaps just enough to solve their problems.

Not sure if I'll ever write anything like this, but there is something about a mix of modern and medieval that feels oddly compelling.
