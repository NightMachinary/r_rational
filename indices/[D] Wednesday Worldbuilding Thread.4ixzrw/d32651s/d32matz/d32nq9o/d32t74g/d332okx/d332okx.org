Alright, how does this sound to you?

  2: Wait, reactionless thrusters... why bother with the pebble-bed reactor, instead of a perpetual motion generator?

  1: Well, about that.

  1: Remember, this thruster-thing works by carefully channeling the way light bounces to mold the Rindler horizons to be asymmetrical in particular ways.

  1: If the thruster is stationary, the math is easy-peasy. If it's accelerating in a straight line, still easy. When it's rotating, though, with an acceleration that's not in a straight line, like going around in a circle to run a generator, then the math combining material properties, EM fields, and the Rindler horizons gets pretty hairy. Maybe not three-body-problem hairy, but still bad.

  1: The general upshot is, the faster the thruster in a generator is spun, the less efficiently it generates thrust.

  1: There are some people who have very good math saying that trying to extract more energy than is put in this way is quite impossible.

  1: There are some other people who have very good math saying that there's no inherent obstacle to extracting useful energy from the vacuum.

  1: And some members of the latter group are pouring gobs of money towards improving the efficiency of rotating thrusters, ala the Big Fusion projects circa 2010s.

  1: And some members of the latter group are crackpots with basement supercomputers and machine shops, trying to gain recognition as 'The Guy Who Cracked Over-Unity'.

If that's a tolerable hand-wave, then this thread may have produced its first bit of worldbuilding that makes it into a story. :)
