My most recent bit of worldbuilding mentioned the existence of reactionless thrusters. They're not particularly powerful, in traditional scifi terms - but they still laugh at Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation. How many ways do you think that the physics that allows such things would have further knock-on effects?

For your entertainment (and assuming Reddit doesn't wonkify the formatting), here's the current draft of the relevant snippet, which takes the form of an IM conversation:

  2: So, what's the most WTF factoid /you/'ve picked up so far?

  1: They've got genuine, honest-to-Klono reactionless thrusters.

  1: Electricity goes in, unbalanced forces go out. No reaction mass, no exhaust.

  2: Okay, yep, not something I'd have predicted. Figure out how they work?

  1: Most of the math seems to be based more on info-sci than physics, but I've got the pop-sci gist.

  1: Premise: There are 'info horizons', from beyond which no information is allowed to leak to a given object. One such horizon: at the Hubble distance, where the universe is expanding away at the speed of light. Another horizon: When an object accelerates, a similar "Rindler" horizon forms in the direction the object accelerates away from.

  1: Theory: The universe treats these horizons /seriously/, and doesn't let you use clever tricks to extract info from beyond them.

  1: One such clever trick would be to use long-wave radiation, part of whose waveforms extend beyond the horizon. So radiation with certain long waves is disallowed.

  1: A common result: there is more space on the side of an object without the horizon than the side with it, resulting in more vacuum energy on the horizon-free side, resulting in a force pushing it towards the horizon. (Ala the Casimir effect, in which disallowed waves lead to lower vacuum energy within the space than outside it, leading to a pressure from the outside pushing in.)

  1: This apparently explains what inertial mass actually is.

  1: Another result: Because the vacuum-energy can't have wavelengths bigger than the Hubble radius, there's a minimum possible acceleration.

  1: This apparently explains galaxy rotations without dark matter, and cosmic acceleration without dark energy.

  1: Various other details explain the Pioneer anomaly, and the flyby anomaly, and predicted a few other anomalies that had gone unnoticed.

  1: Tech: If you bounce light back and forth, the bouncing is acceleration, and creates some "Rindler" horizons fairly close. By some clever building of the thing the light bounces in, those horizons can be tweaked so that the vacuum energy is more unequal on one side of the object than another, leading to what seems to be an unbalanced force on the object.

  2: If that's the best explanation you can give so far, you need to do more reading.

  2: ... The reactionless thrusters. How powerful are they?

  1: One of the first things I asked myself. I've done some modelling.

  1: There's a standard, containerized thorium-cycle pebble-bed reactor which outputs 60 megawatts electric.

  1: Apparently, a reactionless thruster that takes in 60 MWe produces about 3,000 Newtons of force. (I still don't grok Newtons either. That's about 675 pounds-force, or the equivalent of 305 kg in 1 gravity.)

  1: Put together the pebble-bed and its magnetohydrodynamic generator, the heat-tubes and radiators, the thruster itself, a few misc pieces, and round up, and we're talking a minimum of 200,000 kg.

  1: That works out to a max thrust of around 1.52 milligees, or 0.015 m/s^{2.} Nowhere near enough to lift off Earth, or Luna.

  1: But /in/ space, Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation no longer applies. So it would have an annual delta-v budget of around 475 km/s.

  2: !

  1: Yeah.

  1: To put that in perspective: One year of acceleration takes you 50 AU. Well, three years if you want to stop when you get there, instead of plowing into whatever's there with a kinetic energy of 25 petajoules, aka 6 megatons.

  2: !!!

  1: I know.

  2: No, not that. How are we still alive right now?
