Could we add a request to the original text post (and the text posts of future WW threads) that people who explicitly mention if they're offering these ideas to general usage? Sometimes you just want to bat an idea around for a bit and don't actually intend to use it, so being clear about this would be helpful.

(Also, this is really wonderful. Thanks for making it a thing.)
