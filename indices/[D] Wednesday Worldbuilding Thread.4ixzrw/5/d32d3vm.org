Dreams do come true!

One idea, related to magic (When are my ideas not related to a magic system?) I've been holding in my back pocket for a while, is another form of ritualism (a little bit less gruesome than blood ceremony, if anyone remembers my post about that).

The system is based around timely rituals, which I'll call a holiday. When a holiday is instantiated, using a special holiday-instantiating spell derived from unrelated magic, a period is chosem, as well as a depositing celebration and a withdrawing celebration. Anyone who performs the depositing celebration on the same holiday (without being too out of phase) deposits whatever they're contributing the depositing (ordinary items, generally, but interaction with other magic can allow for more interesting deposits) into a shared pool. Once it is in the pool, it disappears from physical reality, becoming almost but not completely detached from time and space. Anyone performing the withdrawal celebration on a holiday can (again assuming they are not too out of phase) withdraw from the associated pool, either with an explicit request, or with a sort of generic withdrawal. A generic withdrawal serves as a sort of limited wish-granting, where the celebration will withdraw an assortment of things, balanced against the needs of other withdrawals near the same time, and also with a random element (which can pop up even with explicit withdrawals in sufficiently extreme cases), which is determined by the length of the holiday period, and exactly how out of phase the celebration was.

This form of ritualism was discovered very, very early. Pre-agriculture.

e-

A holiday is technically a single instant, and has no duration. For an explicit withdrawal, the probability of the withdrawal varying in any way from the request begins and ends one third of period away from next holiday, peaking at half a period, where the probability is approximately 63%. For a generic withdrawal, the probability of variance is never completely zero (since a mismatch between the request and what is available is always possible), but is low, no higher than about 8%, within one twelfth period of the holiday. It rises quickly beyond that, exceeding 80% at around a sixth period, 90% beyond about a fifth period, and from there steadily approaching certainty at exactly half a period.

It is common, but a celebration, just as a matter of practicality, usually needs at least five people, just to make sure that ritual is being performed without faults due to one or two people having to run back and forth between different parts of it.
