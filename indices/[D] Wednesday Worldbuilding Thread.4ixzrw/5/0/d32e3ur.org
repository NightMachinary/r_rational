So my question is how long can a holiday be? In addition how close do you need to be to the holiday to perform retrievals?\\
Oh and how common is this magic? If common, and holidays can be really long then depending on the length of the ceremony people might use it to store everything using a ritual only known to them. If longer and with shorter holidays then people would use it to store things they don't need quick access to.

For items which are interchangeable organizations would almost certainly use secret rituals to store them, for instance they would be used to store gold and other resources you can stand not having access to in full at most times.
