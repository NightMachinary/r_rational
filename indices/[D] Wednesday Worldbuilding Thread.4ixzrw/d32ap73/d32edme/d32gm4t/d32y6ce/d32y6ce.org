  Hmm the option for elves learning things slower goes into the theory many people have that the longer lived races are actually really stupid. However i'm not super fond of elves being slower to acquire skills, because if that were the case they ought to take much longer to get levels skills and feats, (though humans get an extra feat at lvl 1 and 1 extra skill rank per lvl).

It could be cultural rather than innate. In the fantasy web serial Tales of MU, elves are fully biologically immortal, but tend to be extremely lacksidasical about things like building up skills. A human and an elf will go to the same university, study the same major, but the human graduates in 4 years with a typical workload while the elf screws around taking one class per semester for decades before graduating.

On the other hand, an elf not bound by those cultural mores can progress just as fast as a human can, at the expense of social standing within elven communities.
