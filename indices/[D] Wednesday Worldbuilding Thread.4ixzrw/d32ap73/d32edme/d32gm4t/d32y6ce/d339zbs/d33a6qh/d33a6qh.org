That depends on your perspective of pace. If your parents tell you that they expect you to have a degree by your hundredth birthday, so you can show it off to grandpa for his 1,000th Jubilee, and there's a solid subculture of elves at your university working on similar time frames... Well in that case taking /two/ classes per semester will let you blow past your peers, while still flying under the line for being a human-poser.
