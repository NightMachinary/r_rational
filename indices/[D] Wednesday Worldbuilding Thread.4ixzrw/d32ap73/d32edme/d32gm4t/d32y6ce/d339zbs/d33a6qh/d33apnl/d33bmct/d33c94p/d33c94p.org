Well if you did something like that then you would have to assume for some reason that /all/ the long lived races have those same type of weird religious responsibilities. Given how many long lived races exist in any remotely d&d style world you aren't going to be able to find a way to nerf all of them by anything cultural.\\
Plus groups that didn't practice the religion would have such a massive advantage that if any were warlike, they would be likely to overtake those with the disadvantage.
