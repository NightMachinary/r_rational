Right i'm just saying that you would still expect competition to force some groups of elves to acquire skills as fast as possible to best each other, you can sometimes see the same thing among humans.

Say elves start taking 2 classes a semester to blow ahead, soon any elf who wants to best them will have to take 3 classes, and the cycle repeats. Plenty of elves are going to want to be top of their class which will inevitably lead to a subset of elves who are taking as many classes as they can manage.

Better yet those highly motivated elves will be far more likely to end up more influential. Both in academia and potentially elsewhere.\\
Once they get in power they are likely to increase academic rigor in competition to other colleges, or to give elves a edge over other equally longer lived races, and it's unlikely that once they get used to a certain standard they would ever lower the bar again.

Effectively I'm saying that if there is any element of competition you should expect it to eventually lead to people or groups operating as quickly as possible until both reach a a balance where they can't go any faster in their efforts to outdo the other.
