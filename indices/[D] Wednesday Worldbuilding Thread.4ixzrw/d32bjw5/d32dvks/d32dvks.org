I'm curious how opposite values are defined, given not all values have opposites. The thing I think makes the most sense is that sadistic instincts are converted to altruism and vice versa. However selfishness isn't really a value per-say it's just the absence of altruistism, the /opposite/ of altruism as previously stated is sadism, or more generally a deliberate drive to commit actions one considers evil.

So I suspect someone pretty selfish would become selfless, however they still wouldn't care about other people, instead they would just cease to care about themselves, so without any other strong values they would probably commit suicide.

I suspect that the most common reactions to demons would be: Most people would probably end up reversing relationships making them kill their loved one's, after that they might then go onto do small scale serial killing probably targeting people the host would normally sympathise with the most. So most demons probably would go kill a bunch of children until caught.

Given most people are religious you would likely have a fair bit of variation due to that. Muslims and christians hosts would almost certainly go about trying to make people lose their faith, then killing them, and generally try to maximize the people who go to hell. Certain christian hold that once you are saved you can't be un-saved, so they would probably not bother spending their resources killing people who share their faith unless they are a figure who is likely to get multiple people saved in the future. Other religions I can't as easily make predictions about so I won't go into them here.

Oh and if the demons can work to get more people possessed, then they will probably work to do that above all else, provided they care about affecting the world in any way.

Plenty of governments would probably try to get any loyal enemy prisoners possessed, so their loyalty would turn into a strong desire to help their captors. Of course you would need to keep demonized enemies on a tight leash, because if they had any altruism they will likely be super evil (/though/ that may have certain benefits).

Also it would be /really/ good to know whether demon's can be exercised, and how possession works. If you have some specific setting in mind then telling us the details (medieval, or modern, etc).
