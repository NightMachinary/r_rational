Well, part of the challenge here is that you /don't/ know what typical worlds look like and your sample size thus far is vanishingly small and likely biased in several obvious (and non-obvious) ways. But you can't just go off without /any/ plan. If you're part of the first British Interdimensional Survey, you need to know what you're going to do when you run into someone, especially if they're from an "uncontacted" Earth.
