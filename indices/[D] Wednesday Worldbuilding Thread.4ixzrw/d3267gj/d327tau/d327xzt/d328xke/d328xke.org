That doesn't tell me very much without knowing where society/reality lies on the continuum between [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect][butterfly-effect]]-driven chaos, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_%28fictional%29][Psychohistory]]-driven predestination.

As an example, let's say that Francis Bacon was never born in 1561, and this is the point of divergence. When, if ever, does the world discover empiricism? (A strawman of) the butterfly effect says no, empiricism would never be discovered without Bacon, and that loss to philosophy would knock history off course. Psychohistory says that it was just empiricism's time. If Bacon didn't discover it, someone else would have.

There are dozens of hugely influential inventions, such as the assembly line or vaccines, that change the world in profound ways after they are introduced. A world with one less (or more) idea of that scale would be /very/ different than ours.
