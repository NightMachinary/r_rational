Options:

- Go through with a clipboard, stop some random fellow on the street, ask him if he's got time to answer a survey. Leave the questions mostly generic ("What do you think of the current political situation?").

- Steal a newspaper (you probably don't have local currency). Analyse it for clues (or at least the names of politicians to ask about).

- Prepare a document with important information that you don't mind sharing about your home universe. Stick it up near some famous monument or building that's been standing for a long time. Search the vicinity of that monument in other Earths, in the hope that they've come up with the same idea.

- Arrange to get the phone number [area code] 72725535 (typing out "parallel" on the phone keypad) assigned to the Parallel Earth Exploration Department. Call this number on a pay phone in other Earths and ask "I'm new here, and interested in peaceful exploration. What do I most need to know?"
