Let's say that you're the British Home Office. You gradually become aware of other parallel Earths that diverge from your own at certain points in the past, then you gain the technological ability to send out travelers to these other worlds. Most of those you encounter have a divergence from your own timeline within the past six hundred years, typically sooner, which means that they usually speak passable English.

What's your first contact protocol like? What's the fastest series of questions to get vital information about a Britain that's unlike your own? Keep in mind that because of divergence, you don't necessarily share technology standards with the other Earth, and that on occasion you will encounter travelers from other Earths on mutually foreign soil (as others have their own technology to move between worlds).
