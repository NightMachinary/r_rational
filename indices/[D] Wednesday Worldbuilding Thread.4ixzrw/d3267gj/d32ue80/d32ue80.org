Honestly? Probably offer a random sample of people from each world a significant sum of something they value to tell you everything they think is relevant, with a few guiding questions on tech level, politics, taboos, etc. Get a big dataset, cancel out the most common contradictions, and set a bunch of undergrads to doing inductive content analysis. Some people can fool you some of the time, but all people can't fool you all of the time.

It is possible that I am influenced by the fact I'm studying for my psych exam right now.
