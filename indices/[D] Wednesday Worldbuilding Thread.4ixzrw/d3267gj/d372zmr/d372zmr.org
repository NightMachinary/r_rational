Hire a bunch of actors fluent in Original Pronunciation, maybe a few that speak Welsh, Gaelic, and Irish, as well at least one that speaks Middle and Modern French, German, Turkish, and Russian, and have them arrive wearing six layers of clothing, as well as a duffel bag full of various other costumes. Upon arrival, they'd quickly assess what amounts for high fashion, try to approximate it in an alleyway or other area which might allow for a change of costume, then set out asking this question to strangers:

"Excuse me, awfully sorry to bother you, but there is a young man/woman being an absolute bother in pressing for my attentions. To bore them off, would you mind terribly discoursing to me on the [present political climate/level of industrial development/technological advances/scientific inquiries/natural philosophic debates/view on religion/rights of man and woman/foreign affairs/etc.] of our country as though I were the worst, most ignorant sort of foreigner? I would most appreciate your help; the miscreant has been after me for quite some time, now." Adjust the turns of phrase and vocabulary accordingly per setting. Record the audio of the discourse, or report it to a scribe upon interaction's end.
