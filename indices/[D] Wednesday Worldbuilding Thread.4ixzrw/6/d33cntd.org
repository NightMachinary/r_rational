Time stops... Except for bubbles surrounding a percentage of living humans. Or maybe all living humans, but the moving time is just an inches-thick film over most people, with a rare few having feet or metres or kilometres. Or maybe some people have bubbles that have effects other than allowing time to move, but they need to stay within the aegis of another to keep from being static. Or maybe gaining a bubble is a random occurance.
