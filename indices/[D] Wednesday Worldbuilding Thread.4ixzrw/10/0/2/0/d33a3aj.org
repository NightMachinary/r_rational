I don't think he really put forward a 'guess' in that article, and I don't think he was trying to. His top-down analysis isn't useful for a ratfic, unless the writer is willing to make it really meta, and, at least as I read it, his bottom-up analysis concludes that formulating a description of time is fruitless, and that any authors should simply allow it be a black box, available for use but never for in-character inspection, which seems rather unideal for a ratfic, in my mind.
