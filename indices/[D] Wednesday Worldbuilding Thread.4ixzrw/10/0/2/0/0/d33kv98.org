Since ratfic doesn't even try to be canonical, there's nothing wrong with a rational Doctor explaining to his companion the laws of this malleable, living thing called time.

Although /Doctor Who/ doesn't have a canon, and fanfic has become real far too many times in the past to be considered fanfic, but you know what I mean.
