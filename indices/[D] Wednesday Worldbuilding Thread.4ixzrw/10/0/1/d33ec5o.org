I think, if I had to give a coherent account of DW timetravel, it would center around the analogy of time as a river - there are areas where it's fast-flowing and you can't do much or your changes risk being swept away by the time currents, "high ground" where any changes will cause the future to flow along a very different path and alterations are easy, and low points where events almost always converge and it's very difficult to tunnel through to an even lower ground-state.

You can set up an ambush where the river is narrow and there's little room to maneuver, or wage a huge battle in the open water (where you might try to build something bigger, too.) You can seize valuable territory and blockade it to deny it from your enemies. You can poison the well upstream, or overfish. You might even be able to branch into, or merge with, or travel overland to another river.

Basically, time travel works differently in different time periods (an idea /Who/ has played with from time to time in a technobabble way.) You /deliberately try to exploit/ areas with useful properties.

You're safer in a place that follows HPMOR-style rules where you can't change the past, but more constrained; in a region where paradoxes kill you, you have to be incredibly careful; places where Time is flexible and cartoonish give you a lot of room to maneuver and are valuable for letting you build up forces, but you're likely to kill the local wildlife if you build too much there.
