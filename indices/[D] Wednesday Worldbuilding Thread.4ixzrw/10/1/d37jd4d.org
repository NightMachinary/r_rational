I actually want the Time War to stay a black box. Doctor Who has never established any permanent consistent inviolable rules of time travel, and if it did it wouldn't be the same show. Trying to figure out how two skilled opponents would play necessarily requires pinning down the rules of the game. Perhaps we'll see a minor skirmish or three, but the grand strategy of the Time War can never be written in a way that'll make me happy.

I prefer the possibilities of the post-War setting. The TARDIS is the last solar-powered aeroplane in a postapocalyptic wasteland.
