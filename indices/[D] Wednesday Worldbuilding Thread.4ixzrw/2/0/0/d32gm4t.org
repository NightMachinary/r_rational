Hmm the option for elves learning things slower goes into the theory many people have that the longer lived races are actually really stupid. However i'm not super fond of elves being slower to acquire skills, because if that were the case they ought to take much longer to get levels skills and feats, (though humans get an extra feat at lvl 1 and 1 extra skill rank per lvl).\\
And even if you say that all the pc elves are special non-idiots I just can't think of a way it's psychologically feasible that elves can take many times longer to learn everything, and yet remain otherwise intelligent. Another problem is that they wouldn't just be worse than human at learning a skill in a given time, they would also be worse at dealing with basically every situation because of their extremely poor learning.

As for skill mastery, well while they wouldn't necessarily retain mastery of skills they didn't keep using, they would still almost inevitably end up with a low to moderate level of knowledge of most skills and knowledge, so they might be kind of like a bard I suppose. However it seems likely that nearly all elves would remain masters (compared to a human at least) of quite a few things that interest them (after all look at all the human polymaths who don't even have a whole century to gain expertise, yet become masters in many things). The 10,000 hour rule would be nothing to a elf, especially given they are usually depicted as having longer attention spans.

I actually don't think elves (or other longer lived races) would necessarily have very many /class/ levels. Most npc's of any race have levels in npc non-combat classes for one. Secondly is the fact that few npc's have more than a single level in a combat class, and those that do usually plateau at a certain point determined by their innate skill.

Given how quickly pc's can overtake pretty much every other mortal in their class, it seems apparent that in the game time just can't compare to innate talent.\\
Given that few people have what it takes to get to higher levels in classes. It seems likely that longer lived races usually would have a few levels in a few different related classes depending on their aptitudes. For the average member of a race, I would expect levels in classes that based on their RaW descriptions anyone can take, and of course the more people take those classes the more that knowledge will become widespread within that species.

Since these classes would be learned over great time (to make up for lack of any great innate skill) It might make sense to say that when they multiclass they don't get the normal benefits to gaining a level. For instance if someone took a few levels in wizard, bard and any of the other plethora of arcane casting classes, without actually ever seeing combat.\\
It wouldn't make sense for their hp to increase, though actually that kind of applies to any npc who hasn't gotten their levels through any sort of physical experience and hasn't seen much combat (kind of weird that even a elderly archmage still likely has /at least/ 22hp and could probably beat a 1st lvl fighter in a fistfight).

//As for what long lived races mean for society:// In my setting most long lived races have strong preferences for certain climates and environments, which keeps a massive number of them from just migrating to shorter lived races kingdoms so they can have a comparative advantage.\\
However this doesn't change the fact that there will still be many who are willing to try to to leverage their lifespans to gain their family power (you can trust your offspring more with power, if you have have been testing and grooming them for centuries)\\
The question is raised; Is it inevitable that immortals will end up controlling most large kingdoms? The only disadvantages they really have are that they have somewhat longer pregnancies and take 50% longer to reach maturity.

The only method I can think of to keep immortals from ending up in charge of everything, is to make populations too xenophobic to accept anyone of a different species or who is obviously inhuman having power.

(I have significantly nerfed immortality in my setting, it's no longer really easy for any king with class levels and money to keep /reincarnating/ himself, or using any of the other spells that will allow any rich guy to stay young (and mortal) forever. Basically immortality is damn near impossible to get, unless you personally wield powerful magic, what immortality you can get by paying a mage is going to leave you obviously inhuman.)
