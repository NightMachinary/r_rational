Well, part of the problem is that your level is a reflection of your experience, so most elves should just be high level and most humans should just be low level. This would reflect their relative benefits pretty well, since it's just /demographics/ rather than requiring any changes to mental abilities.

If you don't like the mental stat increases, just remove them. I've always thought that it was a little bit weird to get mental bonuses just because you're old. The bonus seems like it's a reflection of experience, rather than biology, and we already have levels to represent the effects of experience. If there's a human who's ninety years old and is only level one, on what basis is he more wise, smart, or charismatic than his fifteen-year-old level one traveling companion?

There are a few ways that you can "fix" things without needing level adjustments or anything like that. For example, maybe the long-lived races are just less good at gaining experience than humans; a human can pick up a trade in a few months, but an elf would take a decade to reach the same level of proficiency. The elf's comparative advantage is that he can keep on going, slowly gaining mastery over what would be a lifetime to a human, and once he's a master, he can keep on going past that, until he's a grandmaster, and it's not like he's going to die anytime soon after that.

The only way that this fails is for player characters, who by necessity need to all level at roughly the same rate. But it's not too hard to just say that player characters are special for some in-universe reason.

--------------

As for how much of an advantage age is ... it's not actually that much of an advantage. Living long allows you to acquire more skills and accrue more knowledge, but both those things atrophy with time. I took French classes in college and remember very, very little. I used to remember all of the lyrics to Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby" but now I'd be lucky if I could get through half of them. And I can't play Halo nearly as well as when I was pouring ten hours a day into it. That's with ten years time passing.

So I think it's fair to say that even a long-lived elf will probably not be a master at too many things, because mastery requires not only intense training and conditioning, but also /continuous/ training and conditioning. It's unrealistic to think that an elf would be able to go a hundred years without using one of his languages and still recall it perfectly. The same goes for archery, or magic, or any number of other things. An elf can attain mastery of things and then do the bare minimum of continuous training necessary to keep himself sharp, but eventually he's going to run into limits in regards to how much time he's got, and if he wants to be the best at something, he probably needs to devote a disproportionate amount of his training time to it in order to stay as sharp as possible.

Where living a long time really comes in handy is in gaining power and money. Once you've got a lot of money (which is the hard part) a smaller portion of your wealth is going into living expenses, which means that you've got capital to invest in things in order to make more money. In the 350 years that an elf lives, a human family would go through something like seven generations, which both dilutes wealth (assuming more than one heir per generation) and runs the risk of loss through incompetence, etc. So I would expect an elf who becomes rich to become /very/ rich, which easily translates to power and influence. Elves can accumulate in a way that humans cannot.
