I always approached Elven immortality's disadvantages the same way I approached human mental difficulties. They have a fixed amount of brain. Human cognition gets slower and slower as they age because the brain has to build everything we learn out of everything we know. Quick recall deteriorates evenly as knowledge increases.

It's not a medical problem so much as a data compression one.

Elves may have developed cultural traditions which slow their acquisition of skills in order to allow them to remain lucid in after the centuries. Investing less energy in remembering anything that isn't critically important, selecting specific skills and dabbling in them only as much as would prevent the inevitable slowing of cognition.

There are, perhaps, ancient elves who have drank deeply from the well of possibility and are full of the wisdom of the ages... but it is slow and delicate work to wrench it out of the tangled knots of their overstuffed memories.

Not that young elves mind slow and delicate work the way young people do.
