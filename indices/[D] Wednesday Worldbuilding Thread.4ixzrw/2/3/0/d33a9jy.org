See the thing is i'm not sure we actually have evidence to show that your brain being bogged down with information, is what causes cognitive slowness.\\
Old humans have aging related cognitive decline, but it's not actually universal or correlated to how knowledgeable they are.

Plus if you were to for some reason buy that theory, it would still require extra assumptions because obviously if that were true then just memory acquisition by itself would make any adult elf basically non-functional. There's nothing to suggest that learning skills would take up more brain-space than that taken up by every new memory you form.
