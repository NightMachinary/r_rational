Even if most elves or other long lived races have a taboo against wealth, that will just guarantee that the elves who /do/ end up with the most power among humans, will be among the more ruthless ones.

As for magic, /so what/ all that means is that the people who end up in charge might not be wizards themselves. It doesn't really matter unless you assume the rulers /must/ be mages.\\
Ok for your third point... What are you actually trying to say? I'm not sure why that would stop a small subset of elves from ending up in charge of shorter lived races kingdoms.\\
As for elves being weak-willed, unless it was a massive weakness that would just ensure the elves in power were the stronger willed one's. If the weakness is universal then that just ensures that ruler has mages protecting him, or that he invests in other countermeasures. As for them being less socially capable; For one that doesn't prevent them from ruling from behind the throne. Secondly that requires that there not be any longer lived races that aren't socially crippled, because otherwise they would probably be able to gain charisma through hundreds of years of training, people forget how many social skills actually be learned.
