I am going to try to address the problem 'immortals are going to be in charge of everything'.

Well, why not give elves (or any other immortal race, for that matter) some disadvantages to address extremely high skills and wealth accumulation?

- The accumulation of wealth is frowned upon in elven culture. If the violation of this principle will lead to worse place in afterlife (which existance is proven in-setting, perhaps), this might stop some elves enrichment.

- Elven magic uses memories as mana. Therefore, irrelevant skills of elven wizards degrade very quickly.

- Alternatively, some unscrupulous elven ruler had sold his/her entire race to demon king, thus casing disadvantages similar to the previous point.

- Elves has much lower resistance to mind magic and (probably) reading social clues. Because of it they might much less capable rulers, even with centuries of experience.
