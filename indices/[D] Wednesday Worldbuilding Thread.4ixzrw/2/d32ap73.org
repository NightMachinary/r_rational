I would like to get suggestions about how much of an advantage, long lived races would have in a fantasy setting. I'm creating a heavily homebrewed pathfinder setting.

I think the long lived races are crazily underpowered in vanilla pathfinder. I just don't see any way that a species like elves, that has potentially hundreds of years more experience than a human can receive no massive skill boosts and other stuff.

Another thing that draws my ire is that races get bonuses once they reach certain age milestones (middle age, old and venerable) which grant bonuses to mental stats and penalties to physical stats. The insane part is that /those two things are linked/ so shorter lived races age faster, but also gain the mental bonuses faster.

I hate this, because it makes no sense that if a human and an elf that are both adult ages for their race that the human would somehow gain a +3 to his mental stats over the next 50 years but an elf living the same life as that human would gain nothing.

So assuming you are willing to accept potential level adjustments, how would you make long lived fantasy races be realistically represented rule-wise due to their age?

Some notes on setting: The setting is medieval, and the world runs on magic not physics for the most part, this disallows most technological advances. Sufficiently complicated machines won't even work due to the random magical effects at small but still macroscopic scales. For instance mechanical wristwatches would fail basically immediately, because of how much precision they require. /I'm also deliberately nerfing permanent magic effects, and items to prevent this from turning into a magitech setting./

I am attempting to make this a setting that is actually modern in terms of say rationality, in some places at least. However I am trying to nerf magic and make many technologies impossible so that the setting stays for the most part pure fantasy with very little magitech/sci-fi stuff mixed in.
