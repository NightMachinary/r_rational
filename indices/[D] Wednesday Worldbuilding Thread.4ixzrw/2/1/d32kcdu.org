Assuming that long-lived races aren't also significantly more hardy than a human of the same level, the only difference in longevity is the lack of death from age-related illness.

If you also assume that the only way to get to a high level is by dealing with comparable risks, then the level distribution shouldn't be too out of whack. Long-lived races can afford to be more careful with their progress, but the unexpected (or simple bad luck) could still kill them.

However, eventually they would become strong enough that most threats in the setting just aren't a concern. We wouldn't expect too many of these people to exist (perhaps slightly more than you would for humans), but the ones that did could continue gaining levels as long as is practical.

So a long-lived character that became an adventurer at 30 and reached the upper echelons at 90 could reasonably be an unstoppable demigod by 300 years old.

There's usually a disparity between adventurer levels and actual game time, however. Players tend to level much more quickly than you'd expect, and this isn't usually reflected in the demographics of the setting. You don't find, for example, that everybody who's been adventuring for more than 10 years is orders of magnitude stronger than the PCs who have been adventuring for a few in-game months.

If you rectified that, coming up with some particular curve for "time devoted to adventuring" and "average level" that all your characters obey, you could come up with a more firm answer for population distribution.

But in the absence of an simulations to demonstrate it, I'd say (using elves and humans as examples):

- The background mortality rate versus age for elves would be comparable to the human equivalent, except stretched out to cover the whole range and normalised.
- They would likely have a commensurately lower birth rate (otherwise they would have just taken over the whole world, unless balanced by other disadvantages).
- Elven military would start at a higher level than a human military (can train for literally decades before being deployed) but would probably have fewer new troops (see birth rate). Depending on how advantageous the level advantage is, this might significantly mitigate attrition. May need to tweak specifics for balance (unless you want elves to ruthlessly outcompete the other races).
- Elven adventurers would have a slower rate of level advancement and be less likely to die to monsters at a given level since they have the luxury of time. Could also start with better training, but adventurers tend to just go off at level 1 for narrative purposes.
- At very high levels, humans would start running into the issue of death. Expect relatively more humans than elves to turn to lichdom (or setting equivalent, if it exists).
- Beyond those levels, the number of humans would drop drastically. Almost every character at the highest levels would be an elf, assuming it takes a long time to reach them.
