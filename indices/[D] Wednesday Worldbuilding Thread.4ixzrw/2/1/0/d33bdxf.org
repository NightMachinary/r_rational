I actually addressed this in a prior comment on this thread, I'll just repost it here:\\
I actually don't think elves (or other longer lived races) would necessarily have very many class levels. Most npc's of any race have levels in npc non-combat classes for one. Secondly is the fact that few npc's have more than a single level in a combat class, and those that do usually plateau at a certain point determined by their innate skill. Given how quickly pc's can overtake pretty much every other mortal in their class, it seems apparent that in the game time just can't compare to innate talent.

Given that few people have what it takes to get to higher levels in classes. It seems likely that longer lived races usually would have a few levels in a few different related classes depending on their aptitudes. For the average member of a race, I would expect levels in classes that based on their RaW descriptions anyone can take, and of course the more people take those classes the more that knowledge will become widespread within that species. Since these classes would be learned over great time (to make up for lack of any great innate skill) It might make sense to say that when they multiclass they don't get the normal benefits to gaining a level. For instance if someone took a few levels in wizard, bard and any of the other plethora of arcane casting classes, without actually ever seeing combat.

It wouldn't make sense for their hp to increase, though actually that kind of applies to any npc who hasn't gotten their levels through any sort of physical experience and hasn't seen much combat (kind of weird that even a elderly archmage still likely has at least 22hp and could probably beat a 1st lvl fighter in a fistfight).
