Nagas: Where is the human snake transition? Weather they have arms or not makes a huge difference, but weather they nurse their young is not unimportant. Where their "crotch" would effect their nudity taboos, but not much else, I think.

Biologically the most natural transition point is probably near the sternum, but I'm not sure that matters.

Egypt: well I think a lot depends on what sort of tone you are going for, and on how much work making and maintaining a mummy is. And how lifelike the undead are. I mean the actual Egyptian beliefs had very life like mummies, with at least one god being able to father a child post death and revival.

An interesting idea is if each generation of Pharoah gets their own eternal kingdom.

If you instead want a more pulp feel. .then I think the revival shouldn't be what the builders of the tombs intended, but rather some sort of later effect that made their material bodies come to life.

Thoughts?
