It would probably break, if you tried starting the motor with half of it time-locked. My idea here was actually to create an apocalypse where survival was plausible, technology still works, but any infrastructure larger than a certain radius doesn't work, or requires fiddly circumstances to work.

A neat idea might be to have a few Sources, who have their own, massive bubbles, and Sinks, who can only have bubbles by spending time around Sources and soaking up power. Maybe have a small subset of Sinks able to spend sourcepower in some kind of a magic system, and an absolutely miniscule subset of Sources able to use that magic system as well, but with no power issues.

Running out of power has the obvious drawback of dropping you into stasis, essentially at the mercy of anyone who might want to come along.

Another idea might be to have some sort of way for time to return to an area - maybe, when a Source dies, their Source remains, hanging invisible at the spot they croaked, and though it doesn't have a bubble itself, it can still charge the bubble of anyone in the vicinity.

The moment everything freezes and Sources and Sinks are assigned, every Source in a moving vehicle is probably going to die in a crash, with a few exceptions. This should litter high-volume freeways with Sourcepoints that communities can grow around.
