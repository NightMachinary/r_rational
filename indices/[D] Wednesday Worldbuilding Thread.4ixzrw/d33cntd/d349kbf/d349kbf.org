That would be... interesting. Would these people age inside the bubbles of time? Imagine trying to grow crops and stuff, but time is literally stopped when you're not present. Would it even be worth it though? I mean, you would be so hungry but you could literally walk up to animals and kill them for food, but at the same time, they wouldn't be reproducing or anything without your presence. You could walk into people's time-frozen homes and just eat out of their fridges. With time stopped, the food would still be cold.

The long term effects of your idea are really cool.

But another thing. If I have a 5 foot radius of unfrozen time around me, would I unfreeze a whole bus/car to make it move, or would the bus object stay frozen unless I was able to surround all of it with my time-bubble?
