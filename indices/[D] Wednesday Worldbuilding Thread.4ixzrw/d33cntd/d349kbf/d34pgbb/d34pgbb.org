Maybe the magic should be based around time acceleration and slowing - Harvesters that can accelerate time on things in their bubble, for example, to provide a way of growing crops. Flickers that can speed up personal time for superspeed. Shields that can selectively slow down areas in their bubble. Juggernauts that can slow down their own bodies selectively, conserving power, making their skin seem much tougher, making wounds bleed slowly, etc.

I think, maybe have the Harvesters and Shields be fairly crude, while the Flickers and Juggernauts have instictual understanding and finesse.
