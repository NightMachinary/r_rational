You might enjoy Charles Stross's /Missile Gap/, [[https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/spring_2007/fiction_missile_gap_by_charles_stross][which you can read here]] (also collected in /Wireless/, which I highly enjoyed because it also has the novella /Palimpsest/). The premise is that Earth gets flattened out and teleported onto the top of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk][Alderson Disk]] during the height of the Cold War, which completely changes the dynamic because of the changed distances of continents and the fact that ICBMs don't work right on a giant disk.
