I like the idea of building [[https://github.com/kiba/writing/blob/master/world-sphere/report.md][an extremely expansive world]] with isolated set of human civilizations with no contact with each other, but so far I am lacking in plots.

I haven't even define much of anything on a human civilizational scale.

Though, my favorite idea for the moment is an oceanic 'space opera', complete with submarine warfare and underwater cities.
