IIRC, nagas are all great swimmers. My idea is to place them around several underground rivers and great underground lake. Sometimes, I imagine, human miners might come to the bank of this lake, scream in fear and run away, speaking of unspeakable horrors of Sunless Lake. (I am a huge fan of Fallen London and Sunless Sea ^_^)
