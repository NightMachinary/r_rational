How do they know people are being sent back? If they can't alter the past, and you can't go to periods other than ancient rome, then all you've built is a machine that makes people permanently disappeared without a trace.

Or if you expand what time travel can do, then you inevitably end up with a singularity that propagates through nearly all universes at all times. That's actually kind of a bigger problem with time travel, how to explain why the future isn't propagating backwards and taking over all times.
