No I mean, /how in the world you started out in/ did the people who used the technology to send you and others, /actually know this technology didn't wipe you from existence?/

If you want to not focus on that, I suppose you could just not explore what caused the people to be sent back in time. Which solves the obvious problems of why people would test /a machine that just seems to just make people disappear without a trace, on humans./

There's also kind of the indirect problem with how to allow time travel tech without having to deal with interactions with every point in the future that also has time travel tech.\\
However you could easily avert this, if you went with the prior suggestion and just had the characters flung through time due to some sort of unexplained phenomenon, which presumably isn't something that could be replicated by any future technology.
