You know other people are being sent back because you can meet or hear about them after you arrive, and about anachronistic technologies that pop up from other parts of the world. For all you know this could be an alternate universe or timeline that doesn't affect your original one.

But that's not the point of any of this, nor why you get sent back, only that it happens and you have to deal with it.
