Well I was thinking about anyone wanting to contribute being sent back to multiple times and locations, kind of giving a broad range to choose from, but if you want specifics then how about a classic. Western Europe at the height of the Roman Empire, around 200 AD.

Don't worry about changing the timeline since many people are being sent back as well and no one's disappearing from temporal paradoxes.
