That's really hard to say without knowing what a "normal" alt-earth is like. Just due to random chance, our Earth is bound to be anomalous in at least one way, and probably more.

For example, maybe 99% of alt-earths have developed strong AI before landing on the moon. Maybe capitalism and democracy are rare, and they have settled on a different set of rights and responsibilities for people.
