1: How many voting blocs, coalitions, political parties, etc with real power are there in your country, and is any one of them particularly "dominant"? Can your country be said to have priorities, and if so, what are they?

2: At what level of financial investment and/or loss of life do you draw the line between a major vs. minor war? Do you believe the majority of the more powerful countries in the world have similar levels of warlikeness? If not, are they more or less warlike?

3: Does your country hold any philosophical or religious doctrine with enough conviction that you believe that the majority of alternate Britains would /also/ have gravitated towards it? If so, on a scale from "kumbaya" to "death to the unbelievers", how would you feel about an alternate Britain did /not/ hold this view?
