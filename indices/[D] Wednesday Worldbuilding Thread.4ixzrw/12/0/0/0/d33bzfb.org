Ah so if you are for some reason ensuring that the demons are thinking more long term then that makes it far worse ;)

I would like to know more about how possession works exactly, presumably most people who become suicidally depressed aren't being possessed. Depending on how it works demons might try to become psychologists, who would then deliberately prescribe medications and manipulate their patients so that their patients would be driven to the state of mind most conductive to possession.

If the setting is modern then you would expect nuclear war to be a likely outcome. Demons would take great care to end up in positions of power in multiple nations, they would then escalate into a cold war and build up reserves of nukes as high as they could, then they launch all the nukes (which were secretly dirty bombs designed to cause maximum fallout) to destroy most non-demons on the planet.

If the demon population is smaller and less powerful they would likely instead pool their resources to develop biological weapons. After spending a few billion on it they would likely be able to develop a highly contagious virus, the important thing would be that it has an long incubation period, in a few years basically everyone on the planet has the disease once it actually starts killing people, you would also design it after diseases like aids that people would have no chance of fighting off or developing vaccines for in the few years before ~99% of people were dead.
