The big thing to keep in mind is that self-preservation is not inverted, exactly - in fact, the demons themselves feel some sense of self-preservation, as they want to maintain a useful vessel. So, I don't think most demons will commit murder unless they think they can get away with it - or unless they see an opportunity to commit such extreme mass murder that it outweighs the personal consequences.

It's a modern, apparently mundane setting. Demons can only be exorcised by the disenfranchised soul completing a difficult quest in an alternate universe. This has either never happened before or no one has ever been believed afterwards. The existence of demons is therefore essentially unknown. Demons (who aren't already possessing someone) will take any opportunity possible to possess someone, but have no control over those opportunities. The frame of mind most conducive to demonic possession is depression.
