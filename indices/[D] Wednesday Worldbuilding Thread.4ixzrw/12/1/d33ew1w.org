I personally wouldn't write about this idea, it sounds un-fun if confronted unflinchingly. Still, people manage to write about serial killers, and I guess it wouldn't be from their perspective.

Cutting themselves; more generally, forms of self-harm that are painful and humiliating, but not life-threatening or even crippling (BDSM people have put a lot of thought into these.) Cutting, slapping and burning onesself are the first things that come to mind for most people.

Psychopathic/sociopathic behaviour. More than that; this is a psychopath with a burning desire to torture and kill other people, which probably means a cannibalistic serial killer /and/ children in the basement /and/ serial rape ... but probably more cautious than the ones you see on the news, who are already by definition pretty darn cautious in order to make it far enough to become newsworthy. But also your usual abusive relationships, scams, and shady financial dealings because money is useful no matter what your utility function.

Since most people are religious, our demon will commit blasphemy and try to get themself sent to hell; more notably, they'll try to get other people sent to hell via the easiest available means. To the extent that people end up contradicting themselves because they want to believe (both in religious and philisophical terms), our demon will contradict themself because they want /not/ to believe but can't deny it (because they retain the host's world-model and (lack of) knowledge.)

Any loved ones they had are probably dead, caution or no caution ... unless they're locked in the basement.

Since it takes a while to reason things out, I'd expect a brief period of spazzing out as everything they did because they /wanted/ to is suddenly inverted without any coping mechanisms. Probably building up from "immediate pain feedback is now orgasmic" to more complex ideas.
