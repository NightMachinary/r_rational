Let's say that there are demons that take over people's bodies, permanently (or, well, at least indefinitely). These demons have no knowledge or skills beyond those of their hosts, but their values are opposite. Notably, this does /not/ cause them to commit suicide at the first opportunity - because they know that the longer they stay alive, the more opportunities they have to do things that would upset the body's original owner. How might we expect those possessed by such demons to behave? Ignoring, of course, the obvious disaster scenarios of people with global power being possessed.
