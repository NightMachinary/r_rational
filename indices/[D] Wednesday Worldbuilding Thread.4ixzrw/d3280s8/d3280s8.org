I've always wanted to explore the idea of people being transported back in time, with nothing but the knowledge in their heads.

How would a rational person use their knowledge or skills to survive and thrive in that world? What would they prioritize first, second, and what realistic problems would they face living in that kind of world to make a story out of? How would they deal with all the different cultures and governments of the time, skipping over the time taken to learn the local languages.

I think some of the basics would be to produce paper and inks of some kind to spread general knowledge, from simple math and science, to agriculture techniques and medicine, anything that could be remembered might be worth writing down before it's forgotten.

Some of this has been discussed before in Ask Reddit threads, from what engineers would create, to how an immortal might live then, to what items they would try to bring back. But there wasn't much depth to any of it, prioritizing what to do first or which idea would gain the most influence and power to actually change things for the better while not being killed by brigands or assassins.
