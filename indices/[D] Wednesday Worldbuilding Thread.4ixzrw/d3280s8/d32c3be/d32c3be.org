Before we go further with your question, we need a setting and some basic information, is this a "what if" (a Self-Insert) scenario or a character? How far back are we talking? Medieval? 1800s? Dinosaurs? Additionally, what's the location? Are they teleported to Japan? Africa? Is the character Male or Female? I would not want to be a lone female in some societies in modern times, let alone in 800 AD.

The more specific you get with this question, the more creative the answers can be, since we're restricted a bit.

These kinds of things depend entirely on the person, their understanding of the world, and their education level/type. Even very rational people can end up seeing a situation/world pretty differently, and will prioritize things differently in ways they feel would be in their self interest as well as any goal they've set themselves to achieving via some personal ethos they've adopted. (Ending slavery before it comes to America? Reducing the spread of infectious diseases? Increasing their own QoL without having a major impact on the future of the planet?)

Just some things to consider when you pose it. If you pick a time and location, I'll go the Self-Insert route and see wehre I can go from there.
