Yeah, I never mentioned the method people were transported at all as that would simply be a mystery to the person being transported and has little bearing on what they'll do after. It also has little to do with the topic I wanted to discuss.

But if you insist on knowing the reason why this happens, it doesn't have to be a one way machine or device like you're assuming, it could simply be dumping people where it wants and returning without them knowing. It could be a phenomenon, machine, or even an alien that does this to people, but you don't even know you went back in time or to an alternate dimension, only that you appear to be in the Roman Empire, or to wherever it chooses to send you.
