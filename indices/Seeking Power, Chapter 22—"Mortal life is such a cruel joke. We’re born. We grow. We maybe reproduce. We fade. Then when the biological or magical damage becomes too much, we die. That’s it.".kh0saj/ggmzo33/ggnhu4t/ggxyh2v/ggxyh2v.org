To agree, ponies can be... grating. I had a "brony" friend in college who implored me to watch MLP:FIM with him. I did one day and watched two episodes he'd selected. I didn't know how to not come off as an asshole when he asked how I liked it, but I guess I said something politic enough to not end a friendship. It just seemed pointless, and I'm not a person who dislikes children's shows on principle or anything.

However, I've weirdly enjoyed some pony fanfics posted here---Friendship is Optimal to name one, so I might give this a read!
