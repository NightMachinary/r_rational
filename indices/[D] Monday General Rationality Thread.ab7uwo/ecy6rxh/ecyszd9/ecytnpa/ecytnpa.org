Yeah? Plenty of obvious things I /should/ spend my time on:

- There is the tidal wave of finals I have to survive, and college education in general.
- There's fundamental bodily maintenance of exercise and sleep I need to get to proper levels.
- As far as non-work reading goes, I have a number of relatively light non-fiction books I basically ignored.
- Also any and all social activity. Internet is not a good place to foster meaningful connections, especially for me.

And that's for the things that come to mind without thinking too much. If I get inspired, I can always start writing too.
