Have you tried using any of the life rpg apps? I've recently seen doitnow (android) recommended, I'm curious but haven't tried it.

Although I think gamifying life could be useful, I think rolling your own system (whether pen and paper or something you code up) might be better than using the existing apps, allows you to modify the system so it fits you better.
