I feel like you somewhat touched on at least one of these two points, but still:

1) The question shouldn't be framed as "how successful a person practising rationality is compared to others", but "how successful a person practising rationality is compared to a version of the same person who /wouldn't/ be practising rationality." For some people developing "rationality"-adjacent attitudes and thought patterns can be the lifeline that allows them to function normally where they would not have been able to otherwise, for instance.

2) Practisng rationality doesn't have to be about "winning" either. Some examples: • It helps Alice avoid joining cults, avoid developing superstitions, spending money on charlatans and pseudo-science products, etc. • It helps Noel improve his everyday decision making. He ends up saving himself from a bunch of potential problems in fields of personal finance, personal physical and mental health, personal safety from various dangers and risks, etc. • It helps Marc build for himself a relationship that's free of needless drama, toxicity, etc. • It helps Nathan confront his own opinions and worldview, gradually adjusting them to more accurately represent the objective reality. • It helps Oliver better understand himself, his own motivations, values, etc.

Are these examples of definite and obvious instant successes in the person's life? Maybe not by themselves, but they both reduce the risks of lowering the quality of life and improve the chances of increasing it.

Promises of any more well-defined and obvious positive changes are usually what self-proclaimed gurus' literature merchandise dabbles in.
