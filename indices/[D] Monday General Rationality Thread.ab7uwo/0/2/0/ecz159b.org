I think I disagree.

You can certainly use rationality to cover ground that intuition normally flies over. I also agree that the people who need rationality most are more likely to turn toward it.

But I don't think that is all it is. You can use rationality to work out things that nobody knows intuitively, at all.

Also it's not like improving your rationalism makes your intuition weaker--if anything, they tend to reinforce each other. That's been my experience, anyway.
