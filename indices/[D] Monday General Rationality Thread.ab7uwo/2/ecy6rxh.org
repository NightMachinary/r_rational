So. New Year is coming. Time for fireworks, drinking, and of course- resolutions.

I feel the most rational resolution to make for me is to simply focus and cut away a bunch of online clutter from my life. Which includes this subreddit, frankly. Not that it's bad- I just don't feel my life right now needs it.

Been wondering about stories and their value for a long time, now. Stories as memetic containers, stories as fake experiences, stories as another type of art. I still don't have any concrete conclusions, at least not enough to speak about them at length, but I feel I don't really get much value out of stories anymore:

For one, I stopped feeling anything from reading them a while ago. Probably overexposure and lack of focus on the content? I know I dunno.\\
What's more, I... well, I stopped writing stories for a long time, too. And that was one of the most certain ways to think about writing in depth. And what's the point of looking at gardening magazines if you don't even have a single fern in your house?\\
This issue extends to engaging specific stories- too little attention to talk about them in depth, or connection to share my reactions with others. It's come and go for pretty much everything.\\
Also, I just have studies to attend to, irl. And while I do want to use stories to enchance my learning, I don't have enough of a grip to make this little dream a reality.

So, in short, I am leaving this subreddit. Not forever, and you probably don't care about a random half-lurker saying this. Still, I feel this needs to be said. Mostly for me, to clarify my thoughts.

Happy New Year and successful resolutions to you all!
