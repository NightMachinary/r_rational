  rationality isn't worth it for a lot of people

I agree. If we substitute 'mathematics' for 'rationality', this discussion would look much the same, with the same exceptions for 'everyone needs math to a varying extent' and 'mathematics has uses beyond compensating for other weaknesses'. Heh, mathematicians also probably unnecessarily jump to the defense of their studies.
