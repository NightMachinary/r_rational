  But I don't think that is all it is. You can use rationality to work out things that nobody knows intuitively, at all.

  Also it's not like improving your rationalism makes your intuition weaker--if anything, they tend to reinforce each other. That's been my experience, anyway.

I only kinda disagree. What you said is true, but I think for people with strong intuition and weaker book learning skills not worth the effort. For the amount of time it'd take your average person to learn all the good rationality knowledge, they could instead have earned a bunch of money at their job or spent a lot of time at the gym getting healthier. There are opportunity costs to everything, and rationality isn't worth it for a lot of people.
