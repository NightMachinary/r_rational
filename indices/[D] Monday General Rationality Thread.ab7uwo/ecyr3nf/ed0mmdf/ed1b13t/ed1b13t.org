This. One book I really enjoyed was a math book called "How not to be Wrong", which sort of covers this except about mathematical literacy rather than rationality per se. Being decent at math isn't going to give you these brilliant insights in your everyday life that let you win the lottery or something dramatic, but you'll avoid simple scams like pyramid schemes or the lottery, and won't be fooled by statistical shenanigans, and the book provides a bunch of examples and explanations.

I expect rationality to be relatively similar, which is part of the whole thing about "less wrong". We can interpret that as having beliefs that are less wrong, but we can also interpret it as making decisions that are less wrong. It isn't always about making the perfectly optimal result and maximizing your utility, sometimes it's good enough to merely avoid a huge swath possible catastrophic failures instead of blindly wandering past and hoping they miss you.
