I've been wondering if rationality actually provided me with any benefits. A well-known criticism: if rationality is about winning, why aren't rationalists winning more? I certainly feel like I could be winning more. The limits of what is 'possible' seem to be far beyond what I am actually achieving.

Then I remembered some things. Since becoming a rationalist four years ago:

- I've lowered my BMI from 29 to 24.
- My salary has quadrupled.
- I have more free time than ever before.
- I overcame two (admittedly non-severe) addictions.
- My relationships with most of my family and friends have improved significantly.
- I am happier.
- I have become vegetarian.

Are these things that would have happened whether I became a rationalist or not?

Maybe rationality is like cloud seeding. We have reason to believe it works, but it is hard to know in a specific case whether it made a difference, and one shouldn't expect dramatic effects. I've been comparing my current situation to an idealized world, but perhaps that isn't a fair comparison. I /am/ winning, I've just started to take it for granted.

I still don't know how much to attribute to rationality. Whatever the case, I intend to continue improving my life and the lives of those around me. I've still got a more-perfect world in mind.
