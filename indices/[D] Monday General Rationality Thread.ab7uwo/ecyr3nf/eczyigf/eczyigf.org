I've made some progress towards learning Spanish this year. I have been using Duolingo for a while, which makes it fun, but recently I started listening to Spanish lectures (on physics) while playing games, social media, etc. to familiarize myself with the sounds of the language.

By turning the speed on the Youtube videos up, I've noticed that although there is some loss in comprehension, it makes it so that normal speed is easier to understand. I can also turn the speed down and deliberately focus, or turn on captions (in Spanish) to get a supply of words to plug into Google Translate to expand my vocabulary. The high speed version is actually easier to multitask with other activities because my conscious mind can't get caught up in what is being said, making it seem like background noise (although it does get in my head as part of the background chatter).

I have basically been treating my life as an RPG this year. I'm not sure it makes self improvement occur any faster, but it does help me stay on task and make it feel more like a fun project as opposed to a criticism of myself. I can imagine getting a +1 to INT when I think of something clever, or +1 WIS when I avoid a disastrous course of action. The WIS stat makes it a bit less scary to try new things with my life, since you can only get gains to WIS when you have a chance of messing up to begin with, and it tends to confer the ability to reduce risks. CHA also levels up in complex social situations, and makes you better able to handle those.

It also helps me build a skill tree. I don't have a consciously formed full list of skills, but when I do build a skill I think of it as having levels (what level, I'm not sure). Beyond INT itself, I've tried to build some skills for accelerated learning. Memorization, speed reading, and multitasked learning (which I call multigrinding). When I fail at using one of these, I tend to think of it more in terms of needing to level it up more rather than it not being possible for me. Hence the attempt to listen to physics in spanish despite not understanding much of it. When I do understand a bit of it, I feel a sense of reward in that I'm probably leveling up those skills.
