My shit is never really together haha, but I've been using trello to keep track of a lot of the things I'm giving my attention to (personal projects, courses/books I'm studying, etc). A lot of the stuff I do is self directed (even the place I volunteer doesn't have managers so the projects there are self directed too) so it helps to have it all written down somewhere.

I then use trello as a kind of menu to make a to do list for the day - usually just on pen and paper. I see what projects/courses are active and pick tasks for them to do (either based on priority or what I feel like doing that day)
