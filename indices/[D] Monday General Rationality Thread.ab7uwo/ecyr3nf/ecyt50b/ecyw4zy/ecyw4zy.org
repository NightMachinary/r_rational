There are very many specifics that went into each of those. I learned a lot to achieve them; if you want me to elaborate on any in particular, PM me.

In general, you need a willingness to try various things and fail repeatedly. I tried half a dozen weight-loss strategies. I applied to literally hundreds of jobs. I forgave myself for setbacks, whether they were my fault or not. Failing often is the price of success, and as much as possible I tried not to take failures personally.

The second thing, is acknowledging that I am not an isolated system. I look for solutions in environment, timing, or chemistry. A good night's sleep is more effective than any amount of willpower, for example, and a multivitamin makes vegetarianism much more reasonable (even if you could be nutritionally-balanced in theory). You can't eat junk food if you don't have junk food in your home. Basically, I looked for solutions outside of myself--I had more luck leveraging 'outside' forces in service of my goals. Or from another perspective, by putting myself in places where I could succeed.

Those things, like rationality itself, aren't silver bullets. The specifics of what you are trying to achieve matter quite a lot.

I also integrated the Sequences into my daily habits. I notice my behavior being affected by something I learned there about twice a day--but only because a few weeks ago I decided to try to deliberately notice. Before that I can only assume I was applying the lessons without reflection.

If I have to say that I learned anything from achieving those goals, is that I'll always want more. I'll never be content--but at least I can be content with that fact, hahah.
