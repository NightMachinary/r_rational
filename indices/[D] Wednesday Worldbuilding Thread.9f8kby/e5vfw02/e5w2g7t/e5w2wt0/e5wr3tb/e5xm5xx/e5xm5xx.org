Geez, looking for references in the original material? I can't compete with that!

It's strange that it seems much better thought out than I remember it being, perhaps it's because you only saw Jonas's point of view so you didn't really get to see the Giver's thought process in much detail. Or maybe my memory's bad, but I definitely was vaguely appalled at how simplistically the moral component of the story was written.

  the main character responds by going to sleep, and lashing out at anyone who talks to him. It requires the combined effort of many people over many days just to get him back out of his bed.

I don't really remember this. Is this when Ender is upset that they're rigging the game against him??

Gotta admit that unlike apparently everyone else in this subreddit I didn't "get" Ender's game, but I've been told you need to read it in your teens to really get it, and being an adult doesn't let you relate to Ender in the same way.
