Regarding the death of rosemary , how it actually happened was different than you seem to remember: she was traumatised from receiving memories of war and death and pain, and so asked to "Be Released", and when she realised that it was death by lethal injection, she asked to inject herself. She seemed complicit in her own suicide. And then her memories somehow leaked out of her brain and into everyone else when she died, so the normal town folk were traumatised by the horrible memories and The Giver had to counsel them. So, putting myself in The Giver's shoes, he's holding memories that are so bad they drove his daughter to suicide, and if Jonas succeeds in his plan, he gives the townsfolk so many memories that they won't be able to "just get over them" like they did with Rosemary's memories which were much fewer. Like, I don't see the Giver being an actual enthusiastic participant in this plan without a lot of planning and reassurance, and I didn't feel like he earned it in the story

So yeah, that's how I feel about it.

I think your example is on the money: the character needs to be shown to be slowly working towards it, inciting incidents need to be shown, and so on.
