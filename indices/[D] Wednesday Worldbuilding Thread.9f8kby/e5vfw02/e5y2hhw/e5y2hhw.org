You've had epiphanies like that, though, yeah? I mean it may have been a few years but all of us come to a number of realizations in our adolescence. Rather the definition of adolescence, even.

How did that go for you?

I mean, it seems pretty crazy from the outside and that's reinforced by how pig-headed we all are about doing it when somebody else tries to force us to... but in my experience, the actual process in the moment is pretty placid. Depressing, sometimes, but that's a placid feeling too.

The first sacred law is scary to break, but after that doesn't end the world the rest get easier. The hard part is picking up the pieces and establishing something new. Always more difficult to create than to destroy.

Now, fiction tends to want things to happen for a reason and tends to want that reason laid out pretty specifically and I do agree that The Giver falls down on that front. That said, the old man seemed very tired of the way things were. When I'm in that state, I'm especially susceptible to other plans.

In rational fiction, I recommend treating character arcs like any other aspect of the plot: Small steps with lots of foreshadowing, followed by a big payoff.
