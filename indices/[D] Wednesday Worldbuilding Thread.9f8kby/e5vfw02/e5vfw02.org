I'm not sure if this fits best in worldbuilding but the thread is empty so you know I can play fast and loose with the rules?

Anyway, a lot of stories are about characters undergoing Personal Growth and Learning A Lesson About Being A Good Person, and other such things like that.

I re-read /The Giver/ about 5 years ago and I was shocked at how over the top it was: the second Jonas finds out the Evil Truth Of The World, he states in a transparently expositional way why that's bad and stuff. Sure, fine, he's a kid. But the eponymous Giver, upon hearing Jonas's outrage, suddenly goes, "oh yeah, my dystopian society is actually terrible, I am now down with you breaking all our most sacred laws". It doesn't feel like the Giver "earned" his epiphany: he hears that the world is bad and accepts it unquestioningly. He only offers minimal, perfunctory resistance to Fixing The World, and gives up on defending the dystopia pretty much immediately, when someone as aged as the Giver would be probably Set In His Ways; not to mention his personal history means that he has seen first-hand the benefits of the dystopia.

So, in rational fiction, how do you make characters earn their epiphanies? How do you make growth, where they change their most central opinions of the world, feel /natural/?

(I'm not specifically interested in /The Giver/, it's just the first "bad example" I can think of.)
