so, i had an idea for a pathfinder setting.

basic concept, in the first age the kobold sorcerers became the world power, and through transkoboldism some of them became dragons. they created some transhuman servants (orcs and elves) as well. then came a war that ended their civilization, and left their towers of arcane power in ruin... and the dungeons are either fallout vaults to survive the magical apocalypse that used many powerful magical creatures, or military bases hidden underground to avoid scrying (including R&D labs to make more magical creatures).

this creates a wonderful setting for human heroes, to explore the lost ruins of a past civilization. and it also explains a lot of the nonsense in some dungeons- there was a war, and the ones making a lot of the old magic were a different species/culture.

this is the post-apocalyptic wasteland where dragons are few, kobolds are weak and hunted, and the great cities are now only ruins lost to time... and slowly, the humans are killing the remaining dragons faster than they breed. the old ways have been lost save for a few ancient dragon scholars, and the 5-headed postkobold dragon god, Tiamat, who is still angry that her civilization lost a major war. weapons left behind from the war range from owlbears and basalisks, to the tarrasque. it was a tippyverse of kobolds that fell to an apocalypse somehow.

and then we can add in a few things like infohazards... the feeblemind scroll is designed to destroy non-kobold minds that try to read that information. most deadly magical traps wont target a kobold (or transkobold such as a dragon), except for those in military instilations.

the war ended when non-kobold slave races somehow attained gods of their own, and many of the kobold civilizations gods were slain, driven insane, or imprisoned. and from there, civilization slowly began to recover as points of light....
