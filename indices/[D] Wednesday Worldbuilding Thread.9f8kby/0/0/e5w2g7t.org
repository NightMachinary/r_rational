  It doesn't feel like the Giver "earned" his epiphany

Huh. It's been a while since I read it, even longer than five years, but I remember it a bit differently. I thought the Giver was most of the way toward rejecting his society already, what with how it unsympathetically killed his beloved (adoptive) daughter. It seemed to me that he just needed another person to tell him he wasn't insane. It's quite possible I remember it incorrectly.

  How do you make growth, where they change their most central opinions of the world, feel natural?

I'm not really sure! But, when you said that I immediately thought of /Tigana/. Characters in that story change their dearly-held convictions. For example, there is a powerful scene where a character realizes his mortal enemy is human and deserving of sympathy. The character is so absorbed in his thoughts that he momentarily forgets to adhere to the social customs of the resistance he founded. Members of the resistance are supposed to choose a certain type of wine as a subtle signal and reminder of why they are fighting. Another resistance member notices that he accepts the wrong type of wine, unthinkingly--it shows how disturbed his worldview is, after learning the man he plans to assassinate isn't wholly evil.

It seems more natural if the character fights back at first instead of immediately accepting. Showing that skillfully, as in /Tigana/, requires setup. It takes work to establish a character so well that when they start acting unsettled it is noticeable. A change in worldview, however warranted, takes time--and although it is a rationalist skill to change your mind as soon as possible when you realize it needs to change, the act of realization should have a buildup or at least a triggering event. It is more believable when characters change in response to stress than when they change without apparent cause, and more believable still when characters spend effort carefully thinking about the implications of their new views.

I guess the problem with the Giver is that 'My student rebels' is not sufficient reason to change your worldview.
