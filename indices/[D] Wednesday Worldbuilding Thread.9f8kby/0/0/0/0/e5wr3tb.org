Ah, thanks for explaining. I assumed that he blamed society for putting her in that situation in the first place. The memories they won't accept are his burden, and were too much of a burden for his daughter, so forcing them to accept the memories would make a sort of justice.

In fact, I have a copy of /The Giver/. If you look at page 144-145, the Giver talks about his anger at the residents. He says he refused to help them with the few terrible memories they had, last time, then goes on to discuss with Jonas how they'd hate it /so much/ if Jonas were to die and give them so many memories. He then thoughtfully excuses himself, saying he needs to contemplate what would happen if Jonas went away. A few hours later, the Giver shows Jonas what Release really means. While Jonas is distraught the Giver promises they can make a plan to make it better. Are you sure it isn't the Giver manipulating Jonas into the plan, after all? He even tells Jonas a few pages later that he has spent /years/ trying to figure out a way to change their society, but he didn't think it could be done until now.

I've thought about the general problem of making epiphanies seem more natural. /Ender's Game/ has a rather famous example; the main character responds by going to sleep, and lashing out at anyone who talks to him. It requires the combined effort of many people over many days just to get him back out of his bed.
