It's really funny, actually. I think Ender's Game is pretty meh (Rackham being kept alive with FTL was really cool, though!), but Speaker For The Dead is one of my favourite books ever, and I love the bizarre conservative wish fulfillment in the Shadow series (moving heaven and earth to save some fertilised embryos being the main plot point, and a gay character proudly saying he did his duty and married a lady and got her pregnant).

I also really liked the World Powers Competing For Supremecy type of plot. Basically Virlomi was a badass in that and I loved it/her.
