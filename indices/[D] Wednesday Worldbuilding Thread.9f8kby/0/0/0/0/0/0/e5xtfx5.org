Yeah, seeing things through Jonas's POV does limit us. It makes one wonder... I'm surprised I haven't heard the theory that the Giver convinced Jonas to kill himself as part of a plot. I might just have to reread the entire story to see if it actually makes sense.

Ender's Game is probably easier to relate to when you are younger, but I didn't get a chance to read it myself l was an adult. The scene I was talking about is when Ender is finally told he was actually fighting the aliens the whole time. He basically shuts down in shock. Ah, I'm not sure I know what you mean by not 'getting' Ender's game, but I'm glad you mentioned it. Others who don't 'get' it are probably silent--they have nothing to say, or worse, they fear the social cost of not identifying with /every/ genius.
