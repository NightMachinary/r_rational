As I've mentioned before, this is because the stories which end "...and thus perished our hero" don't tend to get retold. Legends are evidence, yes, but they're too infected with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias][survivorship bias]] to be used as proper data.

Plot armor is an artifact of poor sampling methodology, not a superpower.
