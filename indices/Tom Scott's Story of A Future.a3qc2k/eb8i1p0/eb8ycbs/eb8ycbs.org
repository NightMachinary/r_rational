I can absolutely believe on a company team just letting one of those running unattended.

I however do not believe at all they could be the ones to create such a piece of software, as they would then be a lot more aware and careful with it.

If it was presented as a 2 part event (company 'A' creates AGI and sell the code, company 'B' buys it, input some objectives and let it loose) then I would have no problems believing what he described.

That said, it's a hell of a scary thought, companies just selling/renting out AGIs.
