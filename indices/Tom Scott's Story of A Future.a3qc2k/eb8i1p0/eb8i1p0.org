I'm not sure how much stock I put in the premise that a company will accidentally create a general purpose AI. That's always seemed pretty unlikely to me.

I can get behind the idea of everything else in the video, such as an AI created for a particular purpose interpreting its goal in a way that is non-beneficial to humans. But I don't think some group of programmers are just going to leave the servers running for a few days and be surprised when an AGI is born out of that.
