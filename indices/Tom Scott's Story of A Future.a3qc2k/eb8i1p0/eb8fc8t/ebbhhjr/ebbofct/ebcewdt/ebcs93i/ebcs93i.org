I agree with basically all of that, but I think that turning it from a case of oversight, to a case of malevolent negligence, kind of takes away from the message. Of course there a tons of better ways that author could have explained how his premise happened, but I think that 'allowing' (storywise) the scientists to have really known that implementing their principles with the right substrate would result in an AGI, would actually make it less rational. Releasing a study like that, when the potential consequences are known, is just straight up insanity, and would have completely destroyed my suspension of disbelief.

I think the whole thing is, to a point, as realistic is it needs to be in order to keep everything short and sweet, and vaguely rational. If the scientists knew what could happen, then there's no real rational way Tom could have explained them just releasing the study to the public like they did. The scientists have to be ignorant, because otherwise, within the bounds of the story, they'd be very, very irrational. It would be an Idiot Ball so big I'd refuse to believe those scientists were smart enough to invent the principles in the first place.

I do agree that in the course of creating their paper, they should have already created an AGI (I even argued that point in one of my other comments on this post), but I'm willing to accept that as a caveat of the setting. Tom could have done more to explain how that specific corporate lab got it right, but from the way he just kind of purposefully glossed over it in the video, I'm thinking he wanted to save time on details to spend on the flavor of the story.

Essentially, while I agree with your points on world building, I don't think much of it applies to this story in particular. Any story can, of course, be more rational and realistic, but I think this story is just realistic enough that it serves it purpose, and conveys its message, without the irrationality getting in the way.
