I think the implication there was basically that the really important work was done by the authors of the paper. The programmers just implemented it blindly on a system with low initial energy barriers, and that was enough. If you hand out buttons that nuke the world when pressed, but only if you use an industrial hydraulic press or similar pressure, then the person to destroy the world is not going to be an authority on nukes, or buttons, or possibly even hydraulic presses. They'll just be the person with a motive to put a mystery button in a hydraulic press.
