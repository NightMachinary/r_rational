Basically, I can't imagine that the company devs would have stumbled upon AGI when the researchers wouldn't solely because they could throw more compute at it. That's not the hard part; the hard part is everything else. Building the system that can do AGI at all. Building it so that it can accept scaling to massive compute.

Tech doesn't leap, it only appears to leap. What happens is you get stuff from elsewhere solving some problem you've had for awhile, and now you can progress, but it's always still incremental.
