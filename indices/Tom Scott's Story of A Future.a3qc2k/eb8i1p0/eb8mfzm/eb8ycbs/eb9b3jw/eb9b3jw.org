  That said, it's a hell of a scary thought, companies just selling/renting out AGIs.

It's an interesting thought-experiment here to replace "AGI" here with "Hansonian brain-emulation with arbitrary ability to horizontally scale its computation, given that there's a bunch of unused compute sitting around and no other machine-intelligences fighting over it." (Well, okay, maybe cryptocurrency-mining worms count as machine-intelligences fighting over compute, but they're probably easy to outcompete, in the same way that the first replicators were easy for cellular life to outcompete.)
