In order to do all the verification and analysis and all that jazz... you would have made the AGI_.

They can ask for my suspension of disbelief, but I don't have to give it. It's also not a commentary on the rest of the artistic nature of it, but I do find that these kinds of simplifications detract from the overall message, not just because people like me pick up on it, and not just because working with the least suspension of disbelief required almost always makes for better fiction, but because your message itself is more powerful without idiot balls and deus ex machina.

Two good examples come to mind, in Europa Report and whatever that documentary/fiction Mars voyage hybrid was. In Europa Report, at the end of the EVA, why was he not tied onto the ship? How much more terrifying and poignant would it have been to have your friend strapped to your ship and slowly dying because they can't come inside? In the Mars thing, why would you have not have run the systems check BEFORE the point of no return on your thrust maneuver, and then had something go wrong anyway - you know, like (AFAIK) the /actual/ training simulations?

Take this piece. Mention that the scientists were stopped from powering their AGI with proper compute by their ethics board, but knew what would happen, and you're basically done. Now it's not just a case of lazy oversight on the part of the dev team, it's case of malevolent negligence. There's also a depth there with the slew of prototypes in the academic and corporate labs (not that would need to be featured in the story, but...)

When you have realism the rest of your world builds itself. When you don't, it doesn't. And usually the realism is not that hard to put in, it just takes considering what reasonable people would have done, instead of what you, the author, need to have happened.

Or, to put it another way, near-future speculative fiction that ISN'T rational suffers that much more heavily for it, /and/ requires that much less effort to /be/ rational.
