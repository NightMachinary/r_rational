The video implied that all of the proper hard work was done by the authors of the paper. All of the verification and analysis and all that jazz was done by the scientists who invented the principals the company team implemented.

It's a bit of a suspension of disbelief, I know, (how likely is it that a team of scientists are going to invent principles that, if implemented, could create an AGI, without realizing exactly that?) but I think we should give creators some wiggle room when they're writing a story.
