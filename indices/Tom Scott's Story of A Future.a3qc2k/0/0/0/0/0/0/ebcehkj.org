Not quite, but excellent and thank you: I'm saying one /more/ step: in course of the research that backs the paper... you probably made an AGI. Maybe not one that can bootstrap to god in a week because your grant didn't afford that much compute... But enough.

This has to do with (AFAIK) most computer science papers being backed by actual implementations. So it would be more like the Manhattan Project and the Tsar Bomba.

Or: I'm saying that the engineers working on the company's implementation would have made intermediate AGIs prior to one as mighty as Earworm, because it's not trivial to build a system that scales that simply to 1000x or more the compute, which is what is implied, and what would probably be required to go from "hey let's use machine learning to do copy right enforcement" to "oops godlike AGI".

Point to ANY technology that doesn't have a trail of incremental prototypes behind it.

Not to mention the underlying assumption that the cognitive architecture ALSO scales to arbitrary intelligence. And if you say "bootstrap" I will ask why you don't think current AI development counts. But, this is an issue with AI fiction in general.
