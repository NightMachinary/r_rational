It's a "what-if" presented as a Youtube video from the future describing a company creating an AI with the directive "Remove content on our systems that matches these examples, with as little disruption as possible." with the examples being the European Union's masterlist of copyrighted works.

It's fairly short (6 minutes long) and, like most of Tom Scott's videos, fairly interesting.
