I understand where you're coming from, but I want to clarify that I was not just saying that to be nice. I genuinely want to see your writing process, and what stays in/gets the knife treatment, along with all the rest of the editing touches.

Take the recent anthology Shadows Beneath (done by the Writing Excuses team), for example. They include multiple drafts for the express purpose of providing the readers, who are probably writers as well, with a view of their editing process throughout.

So while, as a reader, I would want to abstain from reading any of your excellent material before it is buffed and shining, as a writer I want to see it every step of the way.

Will you be taking down the rough drafts as you edit them, or posting the edited version separately?
