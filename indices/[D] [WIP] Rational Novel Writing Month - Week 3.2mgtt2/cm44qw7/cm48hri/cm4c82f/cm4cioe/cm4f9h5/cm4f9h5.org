Not sure what's going to become of it - I think that the first draft will get sorted away as a file somewhere. If I can figure out a way to do it without it getting too messy, I might put it in git or some other form of source control so that I can more closely track the changes.

Current plan is to just take the entire story down once the rough draft is done, and either post it again when the editing is done, or if it turns out good enough, try to get it published.
