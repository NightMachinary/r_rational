35,120. I am ahead of the curve, but still woefully behind on actually getting anywhere with the main plot. The actual chapters are divided into scenes of one or two thousand words each. When NaNo is over, I'll have to go through the current novel with a knife and just cut at things until I'm left with only the most interesting, forward-moving stuff. Hopefully the fact that I'm using Scrivener will make that process a lot easier.

The work in progress - at a slight delay - [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3221980/1/The-Dark-Wizard-of-Donkerk][can be read here.]] If you're not interested in a rough cut, just wait a few months until it's properly edited.
