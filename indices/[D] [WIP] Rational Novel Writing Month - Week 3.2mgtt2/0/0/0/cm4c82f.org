I probably wouldn't be reading it - there are so many great, polished-to-a-shine things out there that reading a work in progress is very rarely worth it. Mostly I'm just posting to keep my honest.

Edit: Oh, and I also generally cease reading for pleasure when National Novel Writing Month comes around, for a variety of fairly obvious reasons.
