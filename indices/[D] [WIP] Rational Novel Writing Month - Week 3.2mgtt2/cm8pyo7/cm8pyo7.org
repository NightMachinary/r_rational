I am writing a Rational version of Supernatural, but I won't get 50k words with the other things I have going on. I am aiming for getting the first arc done and publishing it at the end of November. We'll see how that goes. I guess I don't count since I don't make the goal, but I figured I would chime in anyway since this did inspire me to finally write this out.

I could use an editor if anyone has the time. Good luck to everybody with your projects!
