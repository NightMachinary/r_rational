Knowing that Bostrom is a transhumanist advocate I'd wager this story wasn't meant to have literary merits and the whole things is more like a manifest. If I understood it correctly, the incomprehensibility is the whole point of this letter. "Life can be much, much more than it is now and this is real possibility. The future could be so incomprehensibly awesome that you can't even imagine what you'd miss if you fail at this." I think the story tries to depict what's at stake and how astronomical the stakes are. The same way it's really hard to get a grasp of really large numbers, it's also really hard to actually grasp *how* awesome the future could be, but if you actually understood this, it would override everything else in your decision making process.

I think it was left intentionally vague because it has the same effect as "the unknown is scary". If you compared it to the everyday chores in our world, it would be like describing the 21th century by trying to find the equivalents from the 9th century "superfast flying carriage". If you described in detail what the future could be like, it would look bland, lame and possibly scary at least to /some/ people, see [[/r/RetroFuturism]]. And there are always people who would say "I don't want to live like that" for any kind of scenario simply because everything different seems unpleasant. I personally didn't get the impression that it's just constant meaningless orgasmism every moment from now to eternity.
