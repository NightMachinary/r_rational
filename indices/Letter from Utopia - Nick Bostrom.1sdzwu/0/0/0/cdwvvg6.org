  if you actually understood this, it would override everything else in your decision making process.

You mean like it does for the professional rationalists who regularly semi-trollishly point out that everyone should become investment bankers just to donate to their organizations and thus bring on the Friendly Singularity a few days earlier, thus increasing the future population of immortal, wonderful superhumans by a few more millions?

  The future could be so incomprehensibly awesome that you can't even imagine what you'd miss if you fail at this.

That... doesn't really compute for me. Surely if someone from the future is bothering to write a letter they can be bothered to actually communicate.

  If you compared it to the everyday chores in our world, it would be like describing the 21th century by trying to find the equivalents from the 9th century "superfast flying carriage".

Sure, we ride inside giant metal, mechanical birds that take us where we need to go, even if it's quite expensive. But we still eat breakfast.

  If you described in detail what the future could be like, it would look bland, lame and possibly scary at least to some people

The whole point of the Fun Theory sequence is that it doesn't have to. Though Eliezer does think the real-and-good future can and should be /scary/, which confuses me. Shocking to those of us from the past yeah, shocking like how teenagers' music is shocking to parents, but that's /normal/. I /expect/ my kids to listen to music that shocks me; I'm not /scared/ of it.

I'm sorry, but I really feel a need to reply with, basically, "Do it faggot".

I mean, come on, let's start with lower bounds. Is the proposed future better than living in a volcano lair with catgirls? Is it better than peace, prosperity, and hotblooded awesomeness among a galaxy of Spiral races? Freaking specify something!
