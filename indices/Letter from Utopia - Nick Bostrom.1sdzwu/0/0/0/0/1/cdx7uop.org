What about the existence of inds so vast they chose to suffer realistically from games, grief and loss and rape and the pain of horrifying diseases, just for the extra authenticity?

What about the creation of minds of terrifying evil Unfriendly and alien utility functions, for the sake of diversity (and the fact they wont be able to grow dangerous and their want is not of the kind that makes them suffer all that much)

What about the dissolution of identity, where subjective experience is all had by entities that are custom created for each new subjective-seconds-long experience and then destroyed?
