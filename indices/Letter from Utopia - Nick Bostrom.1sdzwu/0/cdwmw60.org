Very well-written, mechanically speaking, and yet it doesn't actually /do/ much. It almost kinda manages to sound appealing, but largely fails with its talk of, "This is all so awesome we can't even describe it!"

If it's just /that/ awesome, why are you writing? What point do you expect to convey to our mere mortal minds? If it's all so gloriously wonderful, tell us about your freaking breakfast! Tell us what you do all day, who you do it with. How do you work? How do you travel? How do you make love?

And don't tell me that you /don't/ eat breakfast, don't do anything with your days, don't have friends, don't work, don't travel, and don't have lovers. Tell me you don't do any of the things I find meaningful and you've suddenly gone right over the line you were previously stradding into sounding like an orgasmium-driven nut.

/What is the connection between you and me?/
