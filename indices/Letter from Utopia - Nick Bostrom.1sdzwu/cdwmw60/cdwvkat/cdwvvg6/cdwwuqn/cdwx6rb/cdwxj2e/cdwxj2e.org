  What I always wonder is how they choose whether to work on enabling Future Bob's Life, Future Ana's life, or Future Cao's life.

Isn't the holy principle behind effective altruism something like every person has equal value, possibly even every sentient being so that shouldn't be a problem.

  Well, also, how they went insane enough that they consider potential people to have actual moral worth even before they've chosen between Bob, Ana, and Cao for which drops of the potentiality ocean will get to warm themselves around the candle-flame of reality.

It's probably an extension of the timeless way of thinking Eliezer had advocated at some point. If you subscribe to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time][B-theory of time]], which is the more likely version according to physics as far as I know, then those potential people already exist in the future so they're as real as you are so you should give as much value to their existence as you give to present day's people's existence. I'm not exactly sure if this is right reason because I don't remember reading any explicit reasoning behind this, but it's probably something along these lines. Probably something about MWI too. This probably means that they should be slightly against abortion too?
