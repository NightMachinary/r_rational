Yeah, I think Zach's reserves are probably far short. He can shoot 232 magic missles, but his mana reserves are probably only around half that due to efficiency bonuses from shaping skills and near perfection with the magic missle spell. So his natural starting reserves weren't nearly as inhuman as Zorian seemed to think, just on the extreme high end, probably around 29 or so compared to Zorian's 8.
