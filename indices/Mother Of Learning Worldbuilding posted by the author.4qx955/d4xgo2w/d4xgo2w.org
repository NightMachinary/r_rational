"Dragons possess their own brand of structured magic, which has never been successfully copied by human mages. Quite simply, the issue is that dragons possess far bigger mana reserves than humans, and the sheer amount of energies involved in dragon spellcasting is virtually impossible for human spellcasters to match. Not every dragon is proficient in this form of magic, however -- most don't have the talent or patience for it, and instead simply rely on their innate magical abilities."

Go Zach, go Zach ... you can be the first one to learn dragon magic with your enormous mana reserves.
