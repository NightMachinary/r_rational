That's a mistaken assumption on Zorian's part, since he wasn't taking efficiency gains into account. Zach's probably more of a 29.

  Q: Does Zach's "232 magic missiles" comment include the efficiency gains, like Zorian's current 35, or is it as Zorian assumes, and 232 is his magnitude of magic reserves.

  A: It includes the efficiency gains. There is no way to disentangle them from everything else when measuring things.
