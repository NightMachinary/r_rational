Dragons can assume human form the same way humans can assume a dragon one - by chopping a human into pieces and making a transformation potion/ritual. They just need to find a friendly alchemist or learn how to do it themselves.

I confess I didn't put much thought into whether or not shapeshifters can breed with species whose form they assumed. I leave it up to you to make your own conclusions.
