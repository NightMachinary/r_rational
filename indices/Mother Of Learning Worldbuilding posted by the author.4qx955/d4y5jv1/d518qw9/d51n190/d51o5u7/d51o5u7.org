  Was Cyoria ever home to dragons, as a rank 9 mana well?

I honestly never considered it. Let's say no, for the reason you mentioned.

  And it's a bit far off, but do you intend to write more stories set in this world after you finish Mother of Learning?

Not really. I have ideas for other stories, but they're set in different worlds. I did think about writing another (much shorter) story about the events immediately following MoL - a sort of arc 4 to the story, if you will. But that is not even in planning stages, as I don't want to get ahead of myself. Resolution to MoL must come first before I seriously consider something like that.
