How would they secretly control human communities, exactly? It's hard enough to do that as a human, I can't imagine that an 8 meter long flying lizard arriving periodically to 'advise' local rulers would be much of a secret to anyone. These are not quite D&D dragons, with their ability to all assume human form if they feel like it.

Aside from that, there is a matter of dragons being largely ignorant of human society and its rules, and would find it hard to manipulate it - openly or from shadows. They may be intelligent, but they are also largely solitary - social manipulation is not something they're good at.

They do manipulate the human communities that live near them in a way. If one human polity is hostile to them and the other isn't (or not as much), they will sometimes help out the friendlier one by spying on the hostile power for them and doing random acts of sabotage. And if they're pestered by individuals or small groups they can't get to easily, they will sometimes bribe other humans to deal with them.

In short, the dragons are not in position to secretly control any society. They're not subtle, have a hard time dealing with actual societies, not are they so overwhelming they can just move into a large human polity and start giving orders.
