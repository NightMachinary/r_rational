My image of dragons in this world are that they are a bunch of recluses who want to be left alone, with enough strength to deal with most individuals who go after them.

Was Cyoria ever home to dragons, as a rank 9 mana well? Or did they decide it wasn't worth the massive amount of dungeon creatures they'd have to contend with?

And it's a bit far off, but do you intend to write more stories set in this world after you finish Mother of Learning?
