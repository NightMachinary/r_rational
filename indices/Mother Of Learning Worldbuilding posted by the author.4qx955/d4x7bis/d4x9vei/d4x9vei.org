Zach already encountered a dragon. In chapter 14(?), after several short restarts, Zorian reads an article about him killing a dragon that's been troubling humans. We've been wondering for a while if there was a greater reason to this than Zach wanting to do something cool, but we don't know what it could be... Until now, maybe.
