Re: The destruction of Krypton.

It could be a natural disaster like a nearby supernova, or perhaps a black hole's jet clipped Krypton's system. Destroying a planet isn't impossible.

Kryptonians are /not/ an interstellar civilisation. They may have been in the distant past, but almost every story about them makes Kryptonian society stagnant and proud. If they even had one colony on a different star - even if they had any machines that could build things like Metropolitan!Superman - their society would have survived the destruction of Krypton.
