I said the assumption is interstellar capable, not that they are interstellar. There are certain energy capabilities that are to be assumed if a civilization is CAPABLE of interstellar travel. A good estimate if we want to talk kardachev scale is that your not really capable of Interstellar in anything but geological timescales until you have the energy budget of about 1.5 - 2.

Any fun shenanigans like FTL really just means kardachev 1.5-2 is a lot closer then anticipated, not that a civilization with FTL is a necessarily lower energy ranking, just that it turns out you can utilize something equivalent to a higher ranking with a lot less then we humans anticipate with our present understanding.
