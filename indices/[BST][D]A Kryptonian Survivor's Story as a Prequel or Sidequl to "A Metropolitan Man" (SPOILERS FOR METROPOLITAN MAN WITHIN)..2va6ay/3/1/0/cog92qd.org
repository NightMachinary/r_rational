  A good estimate if we want to talk kardachev scale is that your not really capable of Interstellar in anything but geological timescales until you have the energy budget of about 1.5 - 2.

Voyager 1 will be making its closest approach to another star in 40,000 years, that's hardly geological timescale. Building something that will still work in 40,000 years is a toughie, but if the Kryptonians are a "steady-state" sort of people whose civilisation hasn't really changed much in the last half million years, they should have some practice at that.

This is one of those times when the Kardachev scale isn't the best way of measuring a species' accomplishments. If you only live on one planet, but you've had the scientific method for longer than humans have been bipedal, what does that say about your tech level?
