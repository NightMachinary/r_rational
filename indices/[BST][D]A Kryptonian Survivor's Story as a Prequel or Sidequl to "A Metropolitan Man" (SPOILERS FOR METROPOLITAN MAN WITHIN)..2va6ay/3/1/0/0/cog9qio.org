Hum, checking up on that making time in as short a period as a little over a thousand years per light year is actually pretty good time.

So a fair point there.

It also helps a lot with the plot problem of what extinction level events the kryptonians are facing.

And how exactly their resources are going to be arrayed. Probably whatever gets them should sterilize most of the solar system for decent efficacy.

But that presents a some nice human-relatable scale scrounging for story purposes.

I like it.
