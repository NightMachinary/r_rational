I checked. It doesn't mention if he has light speed powers.

For distant stars they often just make an estimate of the iron content of the galaxy, not of the individual stars. They wouldn't necessarily know the exact details of distant stars. In broad details yes, but not the exact composition of extremely uncommon elements. There could also be some desire to send their probe to hidden stars- what if whatever killed Krypton attacked again?

Earth has another advantage. It has a manageable gravitational field and it is protected from stellar radiation. Their electronics and nanites could be vulnerable to EM pulses and so, they might prefer to set their primary base up on the Earth, with secondary manufacturies on Venus, Mars, various moons.
