I don't actually recall of metropolitan man had a FTL capable or just a little under light speed capable kryptonians.

Or if that was determined one way or another.

If anyone remembers if the evidence weighed heavily one way or the other I'd appreciate info on that.

At least some kryptonians PROBABLY had access to observatories, it's tricky but not unheard of that they might be in a position that sending probes far away from the homeworld is more effective then just running starlight through some processing to determine what their metal content is.

Good plan though to make it about the STARSYSTEM, that always bugs me when people make it about earth, and really... everything you can find on earth besides the biosphere is going to be cheaper to refine out using sunlight somewhere else in the solar system.
