Yeah, it definitely does.

But the normal explanation for Superman's powers has too many problems unless you want to bend over backwards to justify it. I mean, the odds against Kryptonians gaining godly powers /naturally/ from the light of a yellow sun makes very little sense for a number of reasons (not just the insane energy output of Superman which exceeds the energy he could get from sunlight).

This is one of those cases where I think that it's more interesting to wildly diverge away from the canon instead of trying to rebuild it, but that's a matter of personal preference.
