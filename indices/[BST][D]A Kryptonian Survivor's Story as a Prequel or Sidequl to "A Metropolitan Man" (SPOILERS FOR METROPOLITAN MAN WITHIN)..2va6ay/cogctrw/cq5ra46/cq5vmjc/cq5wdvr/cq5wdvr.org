I was... kind of hoping that it wasn't that.

I wonder if one of the few working restrictions on the Brainiac is that it can't spread on its own volition. The Jor-El account specifically mentions adding a shard of the Brainiac to the Superman capsules. Is it possible that this implies that the Brainiac was not added to any of the other attempted settlements?

Probably this same restriction prevents the Brainiac from explicitly requesting that somebody help it to spread. But Jor-El sent a copy of the Brainiac on his one-eel attempt, so it can't be just that the Brainiac needed a way off-world.

I have a very bad feeling that creating something like Superman was just what the Brainiac wanted.
