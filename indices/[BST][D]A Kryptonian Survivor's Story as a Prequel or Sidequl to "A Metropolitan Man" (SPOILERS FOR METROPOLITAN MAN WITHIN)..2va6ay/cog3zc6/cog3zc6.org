Brainiac is actually the UFAI to end all UFAI in the DC universe. If you ever saw the Justice League animated series, its interactions with Lex Luthor are pretty great, and a perfect setting for a rationalfic.

Since cloning Superman is actually a thing in the comics, it would be interesting if Lex basically brought Superman back because he realized that, in light new developments, the Earth might actually need him after all. Especially if other kryptonians start showing up.
