Brainiac is a better UFAI exemplar then most, but tricky to manage in rationalfic, he would need to be pretty heavily hobbled/none-functional as an AI to give anyone a chance against it, unless I'm writing a brainiac happens, everyone dies fic.

I was thinkin possibly lex luthor actually ends up making a version of brainiac out of kryptonian technology... That or brainiac could be associated as a kind of semi intelligent infrastructure that kryptonians have access too as a kind of everyman kit.

Really beyond the very broad strokes in some ways the resemblance to the original superman canon starts to crack with bringing actual kryptonians into the mix like I'm planning, I don't mind this but It's a fine line to 'make the balance' of it properly being superman like. I'm thinking of trying to keep to the themes as best I can in order to preserve some of that feel.
