For the last point, and why they chose earth, I'd imagine they'd want certain characteristics for their new planet in terms of mass and star quality and metallicity- you can't build super technology without mass. So perhaps many kryptonian ships were fired out into the void at potential planets but most found dead planets or planets with unsuitable stars (e.g. binary) or planets with life. A larger ship was awaiting a signal from one of their probes that indicated that a planet was ok so they could activate the one way ftl machine- perhaps Lex Luthor's experiments with the technology would mistakenly activate the homing beacon and summon the kryptonian race to a planet that they shouldn't be at because it's got intelligent life. They might have checked out a small number of planets due to the immense energy requirements of ftl as you said.

You could have zero living kryptonians. There might be a low mass limitation on what can be transported, and any new kryptonians would have to be generated in situ, raising issues of what is life if your original body is destroyed.
