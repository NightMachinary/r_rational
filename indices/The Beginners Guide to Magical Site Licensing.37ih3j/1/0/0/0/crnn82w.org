Wildbow is a mad woman* so much quantity and so much quality. I don't understand why she hasn't been snapped up by a professional publisher.

I am planning to increase the speed at which the story progresses as I move into the sequel. My tentative plan is to keep my current median update size but do long updates whenever the story gets slow. Of course, that might work /against/ sating readers, as it will make the story more likely to end in an exciting place rather than in the middle of a sales meeting. Still, always keep 'em wanting more, right?

Anyway it's great that you're enjoying it!

*Or man, I don't think Wildbow has ever indicated a gender in public, but the writing feels female to me.
