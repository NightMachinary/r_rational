Here's a public [[http://forums.webfictionguide.com/topic/thinking-of-adopting-a-pen-name-thoughts][comment]] where he states his name and gender.

I'm actually surprised at the number of people who thinks he's a woman from his writing style. It's a hard thing to do, to write like a woman or in a way that the author's gender is not apparent over time.

I wish I could have tried guessing at his gender to test my ability to infer characteristics of the author, but someone I was talking to commented on his gender when I was only a few chapters into Worm.
