I once estimated that the story would finish in July, but I should correct that. The last update of the current "book" will go live on June 4th i.e. there are three updates more including the one that hits in 90 minutes. The sequel will begin fairly shortly thereafter on around June 23rd.

Er, if it's not clear from the insider information I'm the author. ;-)
