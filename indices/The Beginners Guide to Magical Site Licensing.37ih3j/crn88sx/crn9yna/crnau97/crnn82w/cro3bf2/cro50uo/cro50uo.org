I started reading Worm thinking the author was probably a he because superhero prose is fairly male dominated. I began to think "she" as I read because it has a very constant focus on the relationships of the protagonist and it is via those relationships that the protagonist solves problems. That's something I associate with female authors.

Of course, you can't expect 100% consistency with that sort of thing; it's really down to the individual.
