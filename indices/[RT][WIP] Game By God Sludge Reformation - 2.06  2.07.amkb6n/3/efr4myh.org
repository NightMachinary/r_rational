So Martha is someone else who is trying to improve. I kind of hope this ends up becoming a theme. I love watching characters realizing their flaws and working on themselves to become better people, complete with the minor successes (and possible backsliding).

Prediction time: DM affected the lives of every player in a way similar to what they did with By's. I've thought it was possible that DM's comment was a strategically aimed missile to alter By's life, but I hadn't considered whether it could have been intended to be a /positive/ change.

We have the God/Devil dynamic already, maybe there's angel/demon on your shoulders sort of thing. Dogsi's faction using the DM persona to get the players to confront their issues, and Vedsi's faction using the sludge to try and tempt them to relapse during the dream.
