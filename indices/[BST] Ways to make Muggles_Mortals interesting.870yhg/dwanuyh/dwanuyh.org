In Warhammer fantasy I like how they address this. Dwarves have tech and craftsmanship far better than humans but have fundamental psychological flaws like suicidal stubbornness, pride and desire for vengeance. They're an inflexible species that can't compete with human flexibility. Elves however are yeah, decidedly better in every way except numbers unfortunately. Even their biggest flaw, arrogance isn't really too bad.
