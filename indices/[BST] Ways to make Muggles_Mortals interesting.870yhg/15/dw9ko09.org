  I ran into a roadblock when I started considering ways to find a basic human ability that could be removed from wizards (for example), and still result in them not being too alien to write.

I feel like there's a certain amount of inherent tension here - on the one hand wanting the magical races to not be /too similar/ to the muggles (i.e. not just have some naff shared character trait or cultural quirk as the sole differentiator) but also wanting them to not be /too different/.

Threading that needle is /always/ going to be difficult, regardless of what difference you pick on - might need to just embrace the xenofiction. Although of course that is difficult in a different way.
