Just random ideas

Low resilience. Magicals heal wounds slower, and heal spells is hard, time consuming or something like that. They can get tired quicker. They need to sleep much more.

Lack of simultaneous attention. Since magic requires extreme attention on a single thing, they can't adapt faster in two on one combat. I Don't think it will work on itself, maybe in combination with something.

Need in specific environment. So muggles can live in mana-poor land where magicals will just die in a matter of seconds. Ultimately, they will make mana SCUBA, but not in a stone age.

Impaired cooperation skills. Excessive self-sustainability means no need to really propagate and amplify knowledge like our society does.

Using magic is harmful and emergency only. Combined with low resilience it takes away much of strategical advantages.

0251 here, gotta sleep fast.
