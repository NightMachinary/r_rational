Well, in "No Game No Life", the humans aren't especially more numerous, and their strength is basically pegged as "we got kicked around so much by the other races, we learned how to be shrewd and win by any means possible". So that's a possible answer, though not an especially interesting one.

For something a bit more fantastical - what about humans being the only one with the brain wired in such a way they have a capability to lie? Not just state an outright falsity, but fundamentally convince themselves it, and let it show through all of their body language. That'd make for an interesting dynamic.
