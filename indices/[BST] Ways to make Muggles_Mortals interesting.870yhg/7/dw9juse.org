  In all these stories, the main advantage of humans seems to be 'numbers', which is kind of boring and overused at this point.

I know this doesn't answer your question, but one thing that bugs me is how undervalued sheer numbers are. Numbers means economy, and specialization, and education, and scale. A city with 4x the population only needs to defend 2x the length of wall (the same goes for states). A hamlet with 100 people will have one person in the top 1% of a trait, a city of 100k will have a thousand.
