Ah but the thing is, from an individual human point of view, numbers would be kind of boring to write. It's too familiar to how we operate now; the human response to most animal threats has usually been to either move, or overwhelm it with numbers; working in groups is quintessentially to how we operate.

If I was going to make 'numbers' our advantage, I would have to think of a reason why other sentient magical species can't also form large groups and dominate us that way. Which is actually a really interesting idea, come to think of it.

I already had the idea that elves simply have incredibly impaired empathy, and so their societies are plagued by large amounts of 'cheaters' that make it very hard for them to function; society is based on trust, and elves simply wouldn't be able to trust each other outside of small family based groups.

And so in this way elves would powerful magic, but humans would almost always outnumber them, because we can live in cities and the most they can manage is villages, no matter how intellectually advanced they become.

Any ideas?
