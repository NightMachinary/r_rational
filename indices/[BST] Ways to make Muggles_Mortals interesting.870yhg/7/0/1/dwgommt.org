What would be shocking is what wizards would have to do without economies of scale. This actually plays into the "nature-loving elves" trope - they can trade with their neighbors for things their neighbors make, but there's no goods with long supply chains. Elves have to use magic to write and are shocked by cheap pens and ink, etc. But I suppose that very quickly, the wizards would trade with and become a subculture of the more economically active group.
