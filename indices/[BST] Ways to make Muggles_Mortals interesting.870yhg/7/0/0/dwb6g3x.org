Make magic flow between elves, and not losslessly. Two elves standing or living near each other would, eventually (and if no other action was taken), drain each other of magic over time.

So a solitary elf has the most magic. Elven families would be deliberately giving up part of their magic for the advantages of a group, or at least making it harder to maintain a high magic level. Even with an ability to hold off the drain with an effort of will, allowing meetings and so forth over the course of hours or even days, an elf can't stay awake and mentally alert forever; they'd have to retire and recharge, and for longer depending on how long they'd been in the company of others. A society of elves would thus naturally tend to be somewhat distant, standoffish but polite (because they needed to be able to get along with each other during the times they /did/ interact, without being able to maintain/reinforce those social links every day), and efforts which required multiple elves to work on something or collaborate in any way would take longer to achieve.

Individual arts, skills, and talents would be far more prominent; painting, sculpture, carving, weaving, swordsmithing and armor-making and horse-caring and poetry and mapmaking and so forth. But you'd see far less evidence of /group/work, including things like industry, elves hiring other elves for grunt work, elven businesses which were larger than sole traders (and the occasional very rare family business). Elves would be largely solitary creatures by nature, with society running gracefully, with aforethought, and /slowly/.
