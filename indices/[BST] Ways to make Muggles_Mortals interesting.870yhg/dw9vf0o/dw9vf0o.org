I think the most common (one might say cliche but I think it's common because it's /good/ at tapping into the something real about humanity relative to the rest of nature which /isn't/ the obvious one, intelligence) way this is done is that humans have the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway][Power of Heart]] - as in, humans may have no special powers but are just nicer and more altruistic and love each other more than most other species. This leads to greater levels of cooperation and teamwork that allow them to overcome more powerful creatures.

It also gives humans a reason to exist - if we did not, there would be no one to carry fourth our deepest values.
