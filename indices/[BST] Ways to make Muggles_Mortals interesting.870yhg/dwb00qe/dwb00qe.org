I'm writing this from the perspective of RPG designer. Interesting equals leading to interesting, exploitable situations for PC to participate in.

I have those ideas: 1. Humanity has some kind of arcane pact with magical creatures that gives muggles an edge in certain situations (e.g. fairies can't harm a human person as long as they are very careful about what they say, eat or drink). 2. Magical creatures are a lot more rigid in their ways: i.e. no fairy can go for a simple and brutal solution where a cunning and mocking is available. Every magical creature has weakness you only have to find. 3. Humans are the only species in setting that's not united and locked in wars and alliances as a whole. That means that each individual human is weighted on their own basis instead as a part of group, which in turn means there are a lot of diplomatic opportunities open that are not available for magical creatures.
