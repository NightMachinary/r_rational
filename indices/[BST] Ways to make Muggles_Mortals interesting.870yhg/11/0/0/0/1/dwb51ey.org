You'd need another Hogwarts (or at least a capacity expansion on the current one) if the number of students learning magic increased substantially over time. Like muggle populations tend to do. The world's (muggle) population has /doubled/ in less than 50 years.

In the time the books were set, Hogwarts as an institution was nearly exactly one thousand years old. (/Very/) rough estimates of European population around that are about 50 million, with about 740-750 million today. Even assuming various plagues and wars affected the Wizarding World as much as muggles, Hogwarts back then would have had one-fifteenth of its current capacity. Rowling's said there are around a thousand students at Hogwarts, with fans running the math saying maybe a third of that. So that would put Hogwarts-at-founding with perhaps 20-60 students (again, very roughly). Has it been upgraded over the years, or does it have some kind of standing spell similar to the Room of Requirement, which automatically increases its volumes, grounds, and other facilities as the need arises?
