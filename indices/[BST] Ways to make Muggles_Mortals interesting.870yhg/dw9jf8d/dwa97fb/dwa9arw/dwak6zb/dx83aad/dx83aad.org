people in first world countries have low birthrates.

this is often attributed to having high standards of living, and high survival rates. heck, they'd also been disconnected from muggle life for so long those fully immersed in the culture effectively had no idea how muggles lived without magic.

that suggests that wizards might have had super low population growth for centuries, while muggle birthrates exploded.
