Throw in something like "Wizard fertility is highly dependent on the amount of magic in the area." In areas which had been saturated by repeated magic use for centuries, or which were naturally magical, wizards would have a normal reproduction rate. In areas which didn't have this, wizards could certainly /live/... but probably wouldn't have anywhere near as many children (or as many children who were wizards instead of squibs).

So in the UK and Europe, you have wizards. In the middle-east you'd probably have lots of wizards, although the culture might be different. In Africa you'd have squillions of wizards if there wasn't something else working against that - maybe a far-distant wizard war clobbered the continent or its magic reserves.

In North America, you have a reasonable amount of wizards, and slowly increasing. In South America... who knows? Could be a plot point. In places like Australia, either there's no magic, or the magic is continually drained away, or it's fossilized and can't be accessed easily.

Asia? Lots of magic-users, of a thousand different styles, but not so many in the European mold. Maybe Asia has too /much/ magic, and it's all jumbled up - spells which work in one location might not work the same way, or as well, or at /all/, if you travel fifty miles away.
