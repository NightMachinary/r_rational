Uh, who said anything about dipping below replacement? Evolution only “cares” about /comparative advantage./ A lower birth rate just means that the isolated population in question grows more slowly than the other populations do. It doesn't say anything about whether those offspring are more or less successful, or whether the population in question goes extinct.

For example, elephants have a very low birth rate, but theoretically, even they could have a ridiculous exponential growth in population if all their offspring survived to breeding age and bred successfully themselves. Likewise, out of the millions of eggs that a tuna or sturgeon produces with each spawning, they're doing fantastic /even if 99.99% of their offspring die,/ as is often the case, or more. They only need two to replace the parents, and that applies to elephants as well as tuna. Now, since tuna and elephants are obviously both still around (although both populations are looking rather iffy due to human overhunting, ironically enough) there's no way you can say that a super-low birth rate is any “worse” or “better” than a super-high birth rate.
