I am an ecology student, and instead of viewing things in a strictly direct competition sense, which tends to result in a clear loser and a clear winner, I prefer the interpretation that there are different evolutionary /niches/ that different kinds of intelligence have evolved to fit.

Imagine humans as being your standard endurance-runner savannah-dwelling species, living in small tribes, developing language and intelligence due to strong /intraspecies/ competition and sexual selection. Take any aspect of that formula, and tweak the conditions, and you'll get something different.

Let's imagine elves as being very similar, but evolved for sprinting like a gazelle, ostrich, or cheetah. Suddenly, you have a vastly different metabolic profile, which will affect how the brain develops. You also have an entirely different set of instinctual responses, which means an entirely different /psychological baseline./ How does cooperation for such a species look different? How do they react to conflict or being startled? What draws their interest, what's their beauty aesthetic? All of those things will be reflective of their different niche. And, of course, any clever being might find ways to exploit these psychological differences.

You can do the same for dwarves. Imagine them as being subterranean creatures, like aardvarks or wombats. Imagine if they had a completely alien hierarchy---eusocial, like naked mole rats or ants. Suddenly, the stereotypical obsession with tradition and the social order makes a lot more sense, as they're physiologically and hormonally conditioned to operate that way. Imagine if they live underground because they're more of a prey species in their environment---how might that affect their worldview?

You can do this for any number of fantastical creatures or even magical systems. Magic would be /at least/ as big of an evolutionary factor as the advent of vision or language. In that context, how does it play a role in competition and ecological niches? How does it foster or inhibit competition? Does the way magic is structured incentivize altruistic behavior or selfish behavior? These are the questions you need to ask about the system.
