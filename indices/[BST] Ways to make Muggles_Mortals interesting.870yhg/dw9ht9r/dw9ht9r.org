In TES, mortals have one advantage over dragons- they are familiar with death, so dragonrend has a devastating effect on dragons and no effect on mortals.

I think you get more interesting storytelling when the advantage is something mental rather than just numbers or caloric cost or whatever. Some examples that might work/ have worked in other stories:

-Innovation.

-Lateral thinking.

-Ruthlessness.

-Cooperation.

-Adaptability.

-Emotional resolve.

-Revolutionary spirit.

-Rationality.
