Humanity as a poorly thought out bloodline curse. All humans are wizards, but at some point in the distant past some evil wizard cast a curse on a wizard family so that they'll never perceive magic again. Evil wizard is immediately eaten by a dragon, while the "cursed" family goes on to conquer most of the world because for them there's no such thing as dragons.
