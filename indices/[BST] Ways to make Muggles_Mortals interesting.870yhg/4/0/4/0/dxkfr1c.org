that was actually one of the ideas I had a while ago; prehistoric wizards didn't form tribes of their own and wipe out muggles, because magical predators prefered to prey on wizards and actually avoided muggles.

A wizarding tribe of proto-wizards would have to deal with dragons, kelpies, giants etc.. and would get wrecked because they hadn't invented wands yet; and a wizard that stayed in a muggle tribe would grow old, have a family, be a revered 'shaman', and just generally be a lot more successful.
