no no no let me backtrack here. I said, quite clearly, that I wanted to stop talking about that idea. I have not lost track of who I'm replying to. I just think that you didn't notice the first time I said that I wanted to stop talking about that idea, and tried to guide the discussion back on to what I actually wanted to talk about. I agreed with you; the first idea I posed to you isn't even one I particularly like or want to write (like I said earlier, in the my reply before this one).

I don't know what to say either, because I keep saying I want to ignore 'muggle magic', and I keep trying to change the topic to what I actually want to talk about, and you keep fixating on something I have clearly said I want to stop talking about.

And I don't want a story about people fighting various handicapped people; I just started using the word 'handicap' because you wrote it first and I thought it might help us understand each other better. I don't want magicals to be handicapped, in the common understanding of the word. I want them to be different; I want their mental experience of the world to be quantitatively different from muggles in an important way, and I've been having success brainstorming ideas for that in other places in this comment section.

So can we please stop talking about muggle magic, because this is the third time I've tried to change the topic, and actually brainstorm what I wanted to all along?

In the essence, while I did start of with the whole 'science and technology' idea, I have since tried to move the topic away from 'muggle magic'. This is another attempt to do that; I do not want to discuss how muggles might become magical to fight magical threats. I want to discuss what mental abilities muggles have right now that, if made uniquely muggle in a setting, would give them a fighting chance against magical threats. That is the purest form I can put my idea in right now. I'm sorry if I misled you with that whole 'muggle magic' thing earlier, but it is not the point of this post at all and, like I said earlier, I shouldn't have mentioned it at all.

And I understand if that is not something you find particularly interesting, but in that case simply do not reply. And I feel the need to repeat this at the end because I feel it needs to be said. I don't want a story about people fighting various handicapped people. I just don't want to write a story were magical beings are basically muggles, but better, because I simply don't see any reasons for muggles to exist in such a world.
