I do like the idea of muggles as more customizable than magicians; one my original ideas for a story was how a standard secret magical world would react to more and more muggles suddenly developing superpowers; essentially Harry Potter or the Dresden Files meets the X-men, in a way.

But the idea of muggles being able to 'choose their superpower' is in a way a lot better. Thanks!
