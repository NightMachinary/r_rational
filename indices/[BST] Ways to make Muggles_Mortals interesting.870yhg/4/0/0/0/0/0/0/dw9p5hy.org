You've said you wanted humans to be magical to have been able to survive among magical species. Okay. Make them magical. What I'm saying is, present them as they are, but have them discover, realize, or activate something of their own that was a power they didn't realize they had, thought was something else, thought was a handicap, and/or was something they simply didn't know how to wield.

Have the events of the story force them to develop quickly.

As far as a bias goes, I said redefine it as a feature rather than a bug in the course of this discovery. In what way it is a feature is what you build your human-magic around.

As for boons, give everyone else clear advantages with no tradeoffs or handicaps.
