Ah, but I'm not entirely sure I fully understand your objections. Why would muggle become meaningless? It would just go from meaning 'can't do magic', to having their own magic. From a muggle point of view nothing would have changed; individual muggles would still just be muggles, as vulnerable to everything else in the world as they always were; it would just give a reason for large groups of muggles to have managed to survive. That's even the reason I feel like that is my weakest idea; from the perspective of an individual, nothing really changes, and so it would be boring to write.

And the thing is, this entire post is about adding handicaps, because without adding handicaps I can't figure out how to explain how muggles existed long enough to 'find their ability', whatever it would be. But enough on this topic, because this whole technology is magic thing is not the kind of idea I wanted to discuss in this thread and I really shouldn't have brought it up.

I've brought up a few better ideas in my comment replies, and would be very glad if you read a few of those; I understand that real people don't have their strengths balanced like in rock, paper and scissors, but the thing is that different species are kind of balanced in that way. If one kind of deer is actually just straight-up better than a different kind, than over time the inferior deer will just go extinct or be absorbed. So, in my world where the different magical beings really are different species, not just different cultures, I need to come up with a way to balance muggles. And if I buff them too much then, as you said, the word 'muggle' would become meaningless. And so instead I have to nerf magical beings in a way that lets them retain their classic flavors, and still keep them interesting and enticing; I don't want to risk turning them from different!muggles into worse!muggles.

Naturally the balance shouldn't be as clear cut as Rock, Paper and Scissors; I still want my muggle characters to struggle. But I need there to be a reason they have a chance in the first place that isn't just numbers; because if they really were as straight inferior as they tend to be written they wouldn't have a numbers advantage in the first place.

My other comment replies go in depth on the kind of differences I'm looking for; qualitative differences in mental faculties (usually made up for by magic) that leave magical beings with 'holes' in their thinking that muggles can take advantage of, but don't make magical beings just look 'stupid' or 'dumb'. The difference between being tricked because you're too foolish to know the difference between an apple and an orange, and being tricked because you're blind and your opponent can see.

Any ideas on that front?
