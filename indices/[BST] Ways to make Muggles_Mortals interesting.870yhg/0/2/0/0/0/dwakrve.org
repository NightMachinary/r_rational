We're fundamentally arguing about a fictional thing, so take this with a grain of salt. I'd leave you with this tidbit of information, though---HPMOR explicitly states that the Wizarding world has a far higher standard of living than the muggle world. Many systems work this way, with wizards and witches living lives of relative privilege and wealth compared to peasants.

Also consider that what might be the /single greatest unifying trait/ of the first world as compared to developing countries, aside from their wealth and industrialization, is that the first world experiences a stark reduction in birth rates. The wealthy/privileged tend to have fewer offspring than the poor even within the same society.
