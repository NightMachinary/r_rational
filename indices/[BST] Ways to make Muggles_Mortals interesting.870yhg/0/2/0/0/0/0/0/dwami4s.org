Maybe, maybe not. We hardly have proof of that. Also consider that not all animals have the same strategy when it comes to ensuring the success of their offspring. Some invest great resources in a very limited number of offspring. Others expend their resources producing great numbers of offspring, but by the nature of these things, these individual offspring are often less fit than offspring that have had lots of resources showered on them.
