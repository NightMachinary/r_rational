Birth control is leading to subgroup population declines in Russia and Japan.

Your point about comparative advantage stands. Point is, with the arrow of time, any sub-subgroups that have traits that 'resist' birth control, whatever those traits are (vulnerable to religion, takes impulsive actions, addicted to handling small children) will become more prevalent.

Anyways, since wizards have immense advantages, maybe some of them won't breed, due to their easy lives with trivial to access birth control, like citizens of advanced countries. But all it takes is a subgroup with an inheritable advantage and pretty soon the Weasleys are everywhere. Eventually there would be so many of them they'd crush out muggles.
