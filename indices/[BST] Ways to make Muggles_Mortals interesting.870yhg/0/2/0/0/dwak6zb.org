I'm having trouble seeing a way a trait that makes someone 'superior' doesn't help with the baby-making. Sort of a context thing. I could declare that the mole on my face makes me superior but since it doesn't help me get laid it isn't.

If I were super strong or could mind control people or just make my enemies forget I even exist or die spontaneously...I'd be able to make a /lot/ of babies. And so would other people with my traits.

Wizards are just too powerful for anything resembling a stable ecological balance.
