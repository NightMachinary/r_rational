Well, nothing's known with /certainty,/ but bear in mind that “sexual selection” and “intraspecies competition” are both extremely broad categories that cover practically all the bases, both evolutionarily speaking and in terms of the top theories today. It covers at least the sexual selection and social exchange theories for the rise of human intelligence---it's my own personal opinion that these reinforce rather than conflict with each other, but some consider social (Robin Dunbar) or sexual (Geoffrey Miller) theory to be the dominant, driving force behind the evolution of human intelligence.

The only things /aside/ from those reasons are pretty implausible as applied to human evolution. It's not given much credit that humans evolved greater intelligence to outsmart predators, for example, considering things like /Australopithecus/ also lived in similar environments with similar predators yet never manifested higher brain volumes even remotely as fast as did humans over the same exact time span. Similarly, while hominids did likely come into hostile contact with each other and intelligence probably played somewhat of a role in determining who went extinct, they also were /separated/ from each other long enough to speciate in the first place, and things like Neanderthals and other hominids had often /independently/ developed to be about as intelligent as humans were at the time, or perhaps even a bit smarter, given their slightly larger brain volumes. Thus, the comparative advantage that determined who lived and who died out was probably something other than intelligence.

There are exceptions, of course, as hominid evolutionary history is rather messy, with more primitive species living contemporaneously (albeit not necessarily alongside) other, more advanced hominids. /Homo erectus,/ for example, lived a surprisingly long time alongside more advanced (taller and bigger-brained) descendants. Hominids were constantly migrating from one continent to another, undergoing speciation, and migrating back where they came from.

Long story short, high intelligence is such a wildly useful and broadly-applicable tool that I'd be amazed if there was only /one/ single factor that led to it predominating hominid evolution. If you ask me, it was probably at least partly due to natural selection (given the climate and ecological calamities of the time), but the primary driving force seems more likely to be sexual and social, evolution operating both on the individual (in the context of selecting a mate and successfully rearing children) and on the group (more intelligent/communicative groups being more successful), with the latter in particular determining which hominid species survived when and if they eventually came into direct competition.
