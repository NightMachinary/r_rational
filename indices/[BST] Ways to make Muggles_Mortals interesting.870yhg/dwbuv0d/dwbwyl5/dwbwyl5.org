I got the depiction of smarter elves from Eragon, and it is the main reason I stopped reading the series.

The elves in Eragon are just straight up... better, then all the other races. They're clearly the author's 'favorite child', so to speak. Immortal, scientific atheists whose cultures explores magic in a kind of experimental way (and therefore they are the best at magic, which really is an analog to science in the series).

Even in mental combat they have the advantage; I finished the series a while ago, but I don't think I ever saw an elf depicted as being anything less than an expert in mental combat (which in Eragon is based on things like focus and willpower, so apparently elves beat humans there as well).

And their minds are shown to be special as well; whenever Eragon touches the mind of elf he remarks on how strange and beautiful they are compared to human minds.

So to be honest, the groundwork for my drive to find a way to make muggles 'special', comes from reading a passage in one of the Eragon books where an asshole elf rants about how dumb/inferior 'humans' are, and realizing that, in the context of the book, the elf was kind of right. The elves were longer-lived, faster, stronger, smarter, better at magic and better at telepathy. In Eragon, humans really did have nothing to offer the world, that the other races didn't do better.
