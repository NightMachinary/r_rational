Well, the standard option is usually something like empathy or goodwill, resulting in the magic race failing to form civilizations. Or mental corruption from magical knowledge causing them to go insane or die. Or emotional corruption like Orange Lanterns.

A rarer option is some kind of sensory failure. For example, you could make mages have permanent mage sight, so they always see the world based on how much magic an object radiates rather than how much light it does. That way they are effectively blind to mundane non-magical objects, and can be taken down by sneaky muggle rogues. Or constant communication with the spirit world so they can't hear well over the voices of the spirits.

Some of my own ideas:

- *Sleep*: You can make the mages require way more sleep than normal humans, like weeks of sleep for each day of activity. So even if they have the same lifespan as muggles, the amount of time they can be active during their lives is much less.
- *Facial Recognition*: Do you know how hard facial recognition is? Programming a computer to recognize a specific person's face is ridiculously hard, we only manage it because there's "software" instincts in our brains that automatically recognize faces for us. You could take away this software from mages, so they can't distinguish between two people with similar body shapes. They can still form societies, but they would have a lot of trouble with individual identities.
- *Limited Memory Space*: Give mages a limited amount of memory space, as most of that space is filled up with spell components needed to cast their magics. So mages have to frequently use memory magic to choose which of their memories to keep and which to delete. They would be able to remember important information like their names and properties and contracts, so they would be able to form functioning societies. But otherwise they would behave a lot like amnesiacs, forgetting strangers, forgetting minor things they recently did, forgetting various details about their friends, etc.
