I find it interesting that you immediately thought elves were smarter.

Have you ever actually read something where this is proven? as in, Elves are the ones who push forward science? elves are the ones that are glib talkers who will outsmart you in every deal?

Elves... live in tree houses in the forest.

As far popular depictions of Elves go, they're always wise. Never smart.
