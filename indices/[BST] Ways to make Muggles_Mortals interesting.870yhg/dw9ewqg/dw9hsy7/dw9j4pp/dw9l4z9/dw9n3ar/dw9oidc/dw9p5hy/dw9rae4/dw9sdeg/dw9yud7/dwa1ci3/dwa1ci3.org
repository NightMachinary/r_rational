Create new senses for each race. Existing senses humans don't have and ones you've made up. Including overlapping and non-shared sets with one another and with humans. Give them the base set of problems humans have as a result of living in communities, like for example taking care of the stuff on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Change reorganize and remove those values as necessary, and check that against what you'd expect them to develop like.

Once you have some semblance of what these physical and basic cultural characteristics are, put the broadest skeleton together of a world history between those races. After you have an idea of what that world might look like, throw humans into the mix.

Do you already have a story you want to tell?
