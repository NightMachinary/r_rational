I don't want humans to be magical. That's the thing. I do not want muggles to be magical, as that would take away from them being muggles. My earlier idea, the whole science/technology thing that I shouldn't have brought up and no longer want to talk about because I think the other ideas I've seen/brought up in different places in this comment section are more interesting, was a way to give muggles magic without individual muggles actually feeling like they had power, which is foolish and hard to write and that's why I don't want to talk about it anymore.

So I don't want muggles to be magical, but I do want them to have advantages. And since I can't buff them by giving them magic, it does mean I have to nerf everyone else. I know you don't have to, and asking this of a stranger could be pretty annoying, but please read a few of my other posts in this comment section for a clearer view of what I'm trying to do.

Essentially it boils down to this; in a lot of the old stories I like, the human hero wins not because he's stronger, or faster, or better than the clearly more powerful magic opponent, but because he manages to trick them. And I want to preserve that feel in the story I intend to write; that a human (and human societies) can scrape by, and even manage to thrive in some rare cases, by being clever. Not by being magical, because they're muggles and I want them to stay muggles, but by being clever.

And in order to write that without making every other race idiots/dumb, I've decided instead to add 'holes' in their thinking. Which makes some sense to me because our brains are something that evolved slowly, and over time; magic is such a powerful advantage developing magic could slow down the evolution of other traits.

So in my story, just as magical beings can exploit muggles lack of magic to win, humans can exploit these holes to survive; I wanted this thread to be a brain storm of what those 'holes' could be, and people have already come up with/inspired some ideas I think are pretty good.

I don't want muggles to be magic; I want them to be able to survive without magic. And in order to do that I looked to a bunch of fairy tales, where the only way the protagonist wins is by trickery. And the only way I see to write humans being able to consistently win via trickery and guile (without the other races being idiots) is for there to be certain things human minds can do, that certain races just can't imitate; just like how no matter how hard a muggle waves a wand, they can't cast a spell.

Also I don't see how handing out 'boons' is any different from handing out 'handicaps'; to me they both make the same amount of 'sense' story-wise.
