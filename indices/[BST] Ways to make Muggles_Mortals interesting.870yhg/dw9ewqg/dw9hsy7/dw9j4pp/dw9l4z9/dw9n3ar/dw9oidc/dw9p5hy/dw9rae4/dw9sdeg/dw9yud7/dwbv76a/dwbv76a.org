One of your fundamental assumptions is that muggles and wizards are separate races and that 100% wizard is a potential state. On the other hand, in Harry Potter we see hints that wizards can have non magical offspring and muggles can have magical offspring. Maybe magic is not wholly racial or genetic. Only a subset of humans in any culture may have magical potential regardless of parentage. If all the muggles were to be wiped out the wizards would find many squibs being born. If the wizards self annihilated many natural wizards would be born. Eventually a situation could arise where it is discovered that muggles too have some special talent because they can never go extinct.

To add to this, maybe the advantage of muggles is that they are more customizable than natural magicians, who are already woven into reality in a certain way. Maybe muggles can undergo augmentation via cybernetics, AI, ritual, divine blessing, fey deal, or other mechanic that a wizard cannot without some expensive way of cutting themselves off from magic.
