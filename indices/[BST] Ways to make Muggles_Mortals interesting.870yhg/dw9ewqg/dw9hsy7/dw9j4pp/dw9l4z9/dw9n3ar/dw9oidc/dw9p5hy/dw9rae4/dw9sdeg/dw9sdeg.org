I don't know if you are losing track of who you are replying to or what. You started off saying science and tech would be muggle magic and then described that in some magical way. I rejected that idea. You claimed muggles needed some magic. I gave you an idea for muggle magic. Now you reject muggle magic on the same basis I originally did. So I don't know what to tell you guy.

And no, doing the exact opposite of what I said is not the same "story-wise". If you think a story about people fighting various handicapped people is interesting go write that story.
