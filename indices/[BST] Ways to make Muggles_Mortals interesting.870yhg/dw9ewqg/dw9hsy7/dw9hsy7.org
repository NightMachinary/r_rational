Rather than magical immunity, an idea I've often had is this; science and technology is actually muggle magic.

Magic is all about warping reality; that's the basis of spells. Muggles are always casting a rather simple, but powerful spell, that sorts the universe into the shape we know it to be. The universe is actually a wild place, akin to something out of an animist religion, where everything was a will. Smartphones don't work in Hogwarts, not because magic interferes with it, but rather because if there isn't a muggle nearby the electrons simply do what they want rather than conform to the expectations needed for high technology to function. Muggles would think we 'discover' new laws of nature, but rather this would be 'powerful' muggles or groups of muggles imposing new laws on nature. Science would make sense, because muggles would have to come to some kind of minimum 'consensus' for the law to take affect, and therefore laws that make some kind of intuitive sense would dominate.

A prehistoric wizard throwing a spear would have to worry about how the wind felt about him, his karma, whether or not his pray was in any way 'blessed' or something like that. A prehistoric muggle throwing a spear would only have to worry about wind resistance, weight, and how well he could throw.

And so it wouldn't be that magical races can do everything muggles can do, and have magic on top of that, but rather that they can't do everything muggles can do and so have to use magic.

A story like HPMOR would be about Harry learning that the tradeoff for being a wizard is that he can't make scientific investigations into the world/magic, as the world only 'behaves' when muggles are looking at it. The reason magic is declining could be something as nonsensical as 'the universe doesn't really like wizards that much right now', or anything else, and the reason the Founders so much stronger as simple as 'the Earth liked them better'. Becoming a greater wizard would be less about trying to munchkin spells and less about figuring out how to seduce Nature so that, if you were throwing a spear, the wind would always help you out.

Any thoughts? I just think that this idea would be a bit more boring to write from a muggle perspective, then some of the things I've written in my comment replies below.
