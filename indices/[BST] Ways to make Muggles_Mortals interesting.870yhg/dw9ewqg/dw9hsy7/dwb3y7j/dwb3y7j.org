  The reason magic is declining could be something as nonsensical as 'the universe doesn't really like wizards that much right now'

Or just that the universe doesn't have a preference for chaos over order; lifeforms using one or the other are just evolutionary paths. More muggles + more science = more structure imposed on the magic in and around the planet, but the universe doesn't care any more than it has a preference for orchards over jungles, or canals over natural rivers. It's just what's happening locally on one tiny planet.
