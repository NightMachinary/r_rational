Take inspiration from real life. The neanderthals were arguably stronger and smarter than h. Sapiens, but that had an invreased metabolic cost-- about 200-300 kcal per day-- that made them significantly more likely to starve. There has to be some cost to being special, or everyone would be. That cost doesn't need to be metabolic, but something along those lines could work.
