I think for it to really have impact, a cost like this can't simply be something being /difficult/, it has to be something being impossible. After all, it's not like a muggle can struggle extra hard at magic and achieve things through stubborn force of will. Language is probably the wrong sort of cost, unless you want to go so far as to make Wizards illiterate (which is a bit... off-stereotype anyway. Might fit Sorcerers though.)

I think lifespan as a cost is a little overdone too, especially because it's the sort of narrative cost you don't see in a story if you don't want to. The cost should be something real and everyday, just like magic is. Good examples of costs might be color vision (minor), or the ability to lie (major).
