True, true, true. I just thought I would try to farm the internet for some easy ideas and this seemed like a good place to start. Should be ready with enough of a plot and characters to start writing near the beginning of the summer.

I'm guessing AO3 is the best place to post original fiction on the internet, or is there somewhere better?
