This is exactly what I'm gong for, and is why I've gone for some different examples in some of my replies (like different memory systems or intuition) that I don't want to repeat here cuz it would be a pain to retype and would look ugly if I copypasted it :)

But the 'inability to lie' it something I've been mulling over in my head for a while, trying to figure out how to make it work the way I want to. I want these mental differences to be qualitative. I don't want to make it so that the Fae are basically normal people plus magic powers, but when they try to lie they can't. I want to make it so that the Fae mind works in such a way that crafting a lie is almost completely impossible, as inconceivable to them as imagining a new color is to us.

And I'm having a hard time coming up with a way to do that, that bases the reason in a mental faculty. The only interesting reason I can come up is this; according to some youtube video I watched once, lying involves holding both the truth and the lie in your head, and keeping track of both without getting mixed up.

So maybe Fae minds are easily corrupted by imagination, so that if they tried to lie, the risked overwriting the truth with the lie in their own heads? It would explain why their culture is so whimsical, and rooted in the arts and performance; a Fae person picturing a dragon actually sees the dragon flying in the air around them, and actually hears whatever background music they came up with to accompany it; they'd perceive it as clearly as they would a real physical object.

Muggles evolved the stark difference between imagination and reality to keep us safe, but the Fae can just use magic for that so they never had to.

And so it would be that lying is actually very dangerous to Fae, as they would imperil their own memories, overwriting what actually happened with what they say happened. Exposing a lying Fae would be as simple as probing for details, and then you could just insert your own details into the story, confusing them until they believe whatever you say happened. The Fae sticking so strongly to the truth would be less about being magically compelled to be honest, and more about protecting themselves from being bamboozled; it would be similar to how muggle memories are fluid (experiments on eyewitnesses show how changeable memory can be), but way easier for non-Fae to take advantage of, if a Fae dared to start lying.

And it would also be why changelings are capable of so easily blending in; tell a Fae that it's a four year old named 'Dennis' enough times, and tell it stories about being Dennis, and remind it of days out Dennis went on with you, and eventually the Fae will believe it (never mind if it's really a 20 year old named BlueLeaf or something) much more readily than a muggle would.

Any other ideas? I couldn't think of a way to make lying actually impossible to a truly intelligent, sentient mind, but two heads are better than one! :)
