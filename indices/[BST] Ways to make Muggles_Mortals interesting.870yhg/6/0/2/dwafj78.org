Another consequence of this would be that Fae wouldn't be able to simulate other minds. You can't evaluate a plan very deeply if the moment you start thinking, "If I do X, then she'll do Y, which means I'd have to do Z...", your perception gets overridden and you start to believe that X, Y, and Z are /actually/ happening.

From the point of view of other races, humans would have an incredibly ability to predict future events. In reality, the human power of "Second Sight," isn't magically seeing the future; it's the ability to hold one hypothetical set of events in their minds while keeping it separate from real events.
