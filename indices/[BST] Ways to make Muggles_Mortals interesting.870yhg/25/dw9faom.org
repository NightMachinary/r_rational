Perhaps ambition and innovation? The magical races believe they're great as they are and do not try to change or surpass their limitations. Sorta like those big ainchet civilizations towards the end where they're so confident in their superiority that they resist even the basic change nessesary to remain competitive and end up being concured. So cultural limitations, bogged down by centuries of tradition that they refuse to refine and improuve. Like dragons for exsample, they could make armor and fortifications but they don't. They're smart enough but they're so confident in their innate superiority and still continue to look down on armor even though that opinion was formed long ago when there was just copper sheets and leather but has not changed with steel and heat resistant gels and ceramics. They don't take the time to question themselves and thus don't notice that their tactics are now mearly mindless repitition of manuvers that in different times and surcomstances were once brilliantly insightful but are now tiredly predictable and never notice how outside their own heads they are starting to be regarded less as the terrors of the skys and now more as pests.
