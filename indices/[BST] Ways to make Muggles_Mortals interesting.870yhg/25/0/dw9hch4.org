Ah but that's the thing; that would be less like actually different races, and more like just different cultures. I posted a reply above about what I'm trying to get at, so read that if you want, but I'll give another example here and try to be a lot clearer.

I want the differences between the races to not just be simple cultural variations, but qualitative differences in mental experience. Each race has magic and, as a trade-off, a certain mental quality they simply do not have; muggles, having no magic, would posses the full range of mental abilities, and would have somehow used that to continue surviving in a world of magic. What I'm trying to do here is get help brainstorming what those mental abilities should be, and I think a better example than the language instinct I used above, is aphantasia.

Aphantasia is a condition in humans where, for some currently inexplicable reason, the people affected are incapable of forming mental imagery. Take a moment and close your eyes. Picture a tiger. You can actually 'see' the tiger right? It's nowhere near the same as normal vision, but you can 'see' it in your mind, stalking through the grass. You can picture it's orange fur and strips and the way it might move, etc...

A person with aphantasia is completely incapable of that. They can hold the idea of a tiger in their head, and they can describe it perfectly well (because they are still perfectly clever and witty and everything else), but they simply cannot form that picture in their head. Their mind has no 'eye', so to speak; the difference between their mind and a normal person's isn't quantitative (e.g a lower or higher IQ), but qualitative (Mental Imagery vs. No Mental Imagery).

So in order to make it so that the civilization of a certain magical being doesn't progress, I would have to somehow root that in an actual, concrete mental faculty that would also make them interesting to write. Take Dragons, for example. Another long-lived species that doesn't seem to change much; if I wanted them to never adapt, I would probably alter something in their memory. I'd probably give them a weird memory condition, where experiences actually grow less and less clear as a dragon goes older. It would be almost the inverse of human memory; the memories formed when a dragon is young are crisp and perfect and clear for it's entire lifetime, but as they get older the new memories they form get weaker and weaker (similar to how we find that days get quicker and quicker as we get older, dragons would find that days also get a lot harder to hold onto).

And this would explain how old dragons can sleep for thousands of years; it's easy to not get bored lazing around if each day feels like the first. And it would also explain why they don't adapt; the world that existed when they were young feels far more 'real' to them than the modern one; in order to adapt they would have to make a real, concentrated effort to first notice the change, and then actually retain that new memory as they adapted.

And so I would root the differences between dragons and muggles not in culture, but in the mind (in this case memory), and so give muggles a way to survive dragons. If dragon attacks got to severe, all a muggle village had to do was move. The dragon would keep returning to where they used to live and, due to the long time it would take a dragon to update it's map of the world, give the muggles enough time to settle somewhere it hopefully couldn't find them again. And if muggles invented some kind of awesome dragon killing weapon that hurt any dragon that came too close? Dragons wouldn't all start simply bombarding muggle settlements from long range, not because they weren't smart or sentient, but because, after each battle, the memory would fade, and so they simply wouldn't remember the weapon clearly when they came back.

And this would even fit into the idea of dragons as ancient keepers of knowledge and wisdom. Teach a dragon a something when it's young, and it will always remember it, not matter how old it gets.
