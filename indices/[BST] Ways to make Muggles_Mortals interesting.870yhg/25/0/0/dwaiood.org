I see your point, I do think you should consider mental diffrinces being in how cultures work for diffrent races, dragons for exsample could be solitary by nature, social in the same way that cats are, with no intrest in copereration or teaching beyond what surcomstances make prudent. So each dragon needs to start pretty much from scratch and while they may be individualy a force to be reconed with they are never more than individuals. Elves could be almost literally bound by tradition, incapable of more than incremental changes and refinements. Dwarves could have the opposite problem we do, instead of being easily lead they could be overly willfull, unwilling to overlook even slight flaws in a plan, arrangement or device resulting in dwarven society being in an almost constant state or revolution, dwarven society and machinery could be nigh flawless but spend more time being fiddled with than being used.

Also don't underestimate how deep culture goes, without a culture humans would just be planes apes, if you look through history you can find facinatingly diverse cultures, facinatingly ailen. Ever hear of "feral children"? Babies that were actually raised by animals, they turn out facinatingly weird.
