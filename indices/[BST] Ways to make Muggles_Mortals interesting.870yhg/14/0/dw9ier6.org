I like this, but kind of want ways to narrow this down to 'faculties', rather than something like 'rationality', which is less of a basic mental ability and more of an application of your mental abilities (or at least that's how I understand it).

For example, if I were going for emotional resolve, I would make it less 'humans are more courageous than wizards', and more 'wizards are completely incapable of regulating their emotions'.

So calm, collected wizards are naturally capable of taking full advantage of their magic and dominating stuff (the Dumbledores), but wizarding society is plagued by things like dramatic Dark Lords and dangerous spell accidents because wizards can't will themselves to be calm. They can't take three breaths and calm down, but instead have to let their fear or anger or curiosity play out fully to get rid of it. And this would make them vulnerable to things like taunting or intimidation in a way muggles aren't, and make their groups less effective, because once a wizard's lost their cool, that's it. Wizard armies cannot rally once their ranks are broken, and tons of wizards die during puberty due to the upsurge in emotion mixing badly with the growth of their powers.

And so the differences between muggles and wizards would be due a qualitative difference in experience (the ability to properly regulate emotion vs. the inability to do so), rather than quantitative (humans are more courageous than magical beings). And it would be interesting and easy to write was well; it's a lot easier to show someone steeling their resolve, or fighting their fear in a nice, obvious to the audience way, than it is to show muggles being more courageous without making wizards look like complete cowards.

Any thoughts?
