There is literally no evidence that magic's glory days are behind them.

In fact, evidence points to the opposite given:

1. wolfsbane potion, said to be a recent invention

2. Dumbledore publishing in some Transfiguration journal, implying there is an active research establishment

3. Snape inventing new spells

Why would anyone make a new Hogwarts if one exists already?
