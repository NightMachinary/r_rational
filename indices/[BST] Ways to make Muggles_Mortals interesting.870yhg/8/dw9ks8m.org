There's a pretty cool anime on Netflix right now called Children of the Whales. It's about an island call the Mud Whale that floats on an endless sea of sand. 90% of the tiny population is Marked, meaning they can use a form of telekinesis called 'thymia.' The Marked never live longer than 20 or 30 years. The Unmarked 10%, who live normal human lifespans, form the island's Council and keep its history a close secret.

Makes sense to me that using magic saps lifespan. Similar tropes are used in Wheel of Time, Death Note, and probably more I'm forgetting.
