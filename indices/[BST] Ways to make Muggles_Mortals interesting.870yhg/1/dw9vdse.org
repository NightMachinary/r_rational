  crippling lack of empathy
#+end_quote

Perhaps subvert this - suppose a crippling surfeit of empathy. Along with the ability to do magic comes a new sense: the ability to sense magic and magical connections. This changes everything, but in particular it enables and /forces/ magicals to perceive the interconnected web of all being. This results in much beauty and harmony but also cultural stasis. Inflicting violence on others is literally inflicting violence on yourself, where violence is very broadly interpreted as not only physical violence, but also emotional violence and, at least for a faction, change in general. It isn't that magicals couldn't invent agriculture, but that the resulting 'violence' to the web of being is intolerable. Overpopulation doesn't occur in the first place because the community can perceive the violence it would entail (e.g. agriculture).

Mundanes are blind, but this enables them to commit violence without perceiving the harm they do to themselves - they are like fire consuming its own fuel, inevitably leading to its own doom, but overwhelming in the meantime. The magicals discuss controlling the blind mundanes so they don't do so much damage, but the mundanes are no less strands in the web of being and control is a form of violence. As always, the debates are endless and the action plans have timescales in the order of millennia. As a twist, have the mundanes be a secret weapons program of an anti-stasis faction. The faction protects the mundanes from magical politics and is able to use them to inflict violence on their (pro-stasis) political enemies mostly by reason of their existence.
