it's a good idea that could be written brilliantly, but not by me; one of the tropes I hate most in some of the HP fanfics I read is the whole 'wizards aren't only behind both the world wars, but also, somehow, all the scientific advancements of the last two centuries', that usually goes along with 'all the great ancient philosophers were wizards, as well as all the folk heroes, and the gods, etc...'. It portrays muggles as lacking a fundamental self-agency that makes one question if Draco Malfoy wasn't right all along; if all the greatest 'muggles' are actually wizards, then what do muggles really offer the world?

My main point for doing this is that I want to craft a fantasy world that muggles have a place in. A world where, conceivably, they can actually hold their own and, throw hard, hard work, maybe even thrive. A world where they have their own agency, and make their own decisions and can have a positive impact on the universe.

The idea is good, but it feels like a case of magicals being 'better' than mundanes. The mundane's blindness isn't really an advantage if it's eventually going to lead to their doom, and the magicals are actually right in their desire to control them.

Thanks for offering an idea though :)
