We are all doomed alike, magical and mundane, but mundanes are the agent of change. What greater glory!? Mundanes /are/ adventure. Mundanes /are/ curiosity and experiment. Mundanes possess an innocent freedom that those paralyzed by the relentless Music of the Spheres will never know.

Consider the agony of a society stuck in a local maxima, unable to justify the journey through a social valley to the (possible) new heights beyond. Without the threatening fire of the mundanes, the journey might never begin. Magicals /need/ mundanes. How dark the night without fire's light? How cold the winter without fire's warmth? The wounds the mundanes inflict will never truly heal, but there are no futures without scars, and after ashes comes the ecstasy of rebirth. Even if it were possible to tame fire, who would deprive the world of its fierce joy?
