Girl Genius has its sparks lacking impulse control and common sense, as well as being prone to megalomania, obsessive behavior, and psychopathy. Some inherent personality disorders could offset the benefit one draws from magical ability. To an extent, one could even see a weaker version of this effect as canon in the Harry Potter world.

The one I personally prefer is technology allowing "Muggles" to nonetheless make use of magic through magical items, akin to DnD's "Use Magic Device" skill - but making up for the deficiency that way doesn't exactly fit what you're asking for.
