One thing I've rarely seen explored is that if wizards are common then being a muggle doesn't matter much. There's jobs that require magic and jobs that do not. If you're the only one who can do magic, then you corner the market on all the jobs that require magic and you can make an absurd sum of money. But if you're the only one who can't do magic, then you can still do all the jobs that don't need magic just as well as anyone else. And it's not like those are all terrible bottom-of-the-barrel jobs. You can be a CEO or a lawyer or a banker or tons of other things.

Also, there's the idea that muggles have better science, but that's pretty old hat.
