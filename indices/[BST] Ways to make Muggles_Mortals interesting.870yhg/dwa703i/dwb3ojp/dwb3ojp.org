I kind of like this. Not all humans actually /would/ do this, meaning that for the most part thought patterns would be very difficult to tell apart, and for the greater part of history people wouldn't even have the language to do so. But every so often, humans kick into third gear, even if it's just for a minute or two or after eating that weird mushroom or staying awake for three days or being a hair's-breadth from death, or you get a military or political genius who can switch it on more often, and over the years and centuries it starts to add up - human civilization starts to gain the barest edge, tends to have more ideas and sooner (if only on average), and so on.

And of course no-one knows why. Maybe it's that weird human food. Or that they live in those weird houses. Or that they have those freaky cultural rituals. Or they raise their children in particular ways. Or because they live near rivers. Or grow and eat that odd plant. Or cook in strangely-shaped pots. Or maybe their gods have different priorities to our gods. Or the One God likes them because they're cute. Or... etc etc.
