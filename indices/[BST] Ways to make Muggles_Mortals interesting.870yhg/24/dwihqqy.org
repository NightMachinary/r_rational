In harry potter wizards slowly loose abilities due to the inventors not sharing how to do said ability. Dwarves are notorious for not sharing their forging techniques. In these asian fantasy novels I am reading the sword-arts and potion/alchemy recepies are secrets that are kept in certain states/sects/schools maybe muggles are more prone to share knowledge and thus learn faster?
