Make magic like "real" magic, not fireball +4 but mystical power which can only be attained by rejecting logic and common sense. As result magical beings are not only poor in logical thinking but can barely follow cause-consequence chain and see /everything/ as magic. They don't see difference between mundane and magic, mundane ability to reason and infere looks like just another type of magic to them, different but not worse or better then other magics.
