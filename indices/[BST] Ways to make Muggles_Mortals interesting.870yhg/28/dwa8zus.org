For something a bit different, I like the idea of "little magic" as described by this tumblr post: [[https://imgur.com/EVfY3eF]]

In the story I'm writing, the muggle-wizard divide is not a bright line as it is in Harry Potter: /every single human/ has something magic about them, and they range a spectrum: someone might have an uncanny ability to never burn popcorn (everyone has something at least that powerful), another with the right training can shoot fireballs (one in a billion). And all the shades in between (e.g. visions of the future: maybe one in a million).

It doesn't fill your stated purpose of giving humans an advantage, unfortunately, but I really like the concept. It does mean, I suppose, that enough of the weaker magicians can have an impact if they know what their powers are (next saturday munchkinry thread: "how do you munchkin the ability to never burn microwave popcorn?"), which is "power of numbers" which is exactly what you wanted to avoid.

to maybe better answer your question, I remember starting an audiobook on the now-defunct "podiobooks" site, and they had a story called "hospital earth". I don't remember the actual plot, but the premise was interesting: technological progress is not uniform across species, so some species discovered FTL travel, others discovered advanced chemistry, etc. Each species excelled in one thing, and they all got together and traded. Humanity was good at medicine, hence the "hospital earth". No other creatures got as far as say, germ theory.

Perhaps give humanity something like that: full domain over medicine. Elves have some minor healing spells, say, but they can't heal appendicitis; but because of the existence of the healing spells, they never were motivated to develop medical skills.

Or choose something else - in Stargate, humanity is unique in having ballistic weapons, which are the only things that can harm the Replicators.
