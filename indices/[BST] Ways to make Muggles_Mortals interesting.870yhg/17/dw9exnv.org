I'm generally not a fan of different humanoid races evolving in tandem. Maybe it's just because of the experience on planet Earth, but the whole evolution thing doesn't seem to like it much.

Another couple of unique muggle traits could be ambition and creativity. Do the whole elves never change thing, and Dwarven reproduction is basically they spend their entire lives working on a single original work (their kid) and that's the sum total of their creativity. So humans do all the inventing, art, science, etc. Even better would be just using a single alternate race with these qualities - probably dwarves would work best, but they don't have to look like dwarves (mole people, maybe)

These aren't original ideas (though taking them to the extreme could be more novel), but they're ways to distinguish humans other than population.

If there's actual magic though, and the people that evolved with magic are on the same continent as people without magic, I find it hard to believe that the people without magic would survive (there's a natural competition for resources) long enough for ethics to really come into being enough to prevent genocide. Unless the drawback to magic is huge without being crippling enough that the muggles end up killing the magicians.
