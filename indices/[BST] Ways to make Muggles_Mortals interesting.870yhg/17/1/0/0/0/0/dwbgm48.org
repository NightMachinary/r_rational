Well, I'll give you sloth people. But if you, say, imagine that dwarves have a very different evolutionary niche, basically living underground, there's a decent chance that humans wouldn't necessarily wipe them out. Not saying that it's /unlikely/ humans would wipe them out, just that it's not implausible that they'd still be around.

There's another way to look at it, which is that dwarves or elves or whatever are actually way more powerful than humans, but for various reasons don't bother to wipe humans out. Humans could be to elves what rats are to humans--exterminate it if you see it, but not think about them too often. If elves and dwarves are sufficiently powerful, it the human psychological and ecological profile matters a lot less. You just have to say that this hypothetical pyschological or ecological profile, that you get to make up, doesn't dispose the more evolutionary fit or long-lived species to wipe out humans. This take isn't even a massive departure from many fantasy novels, in, say, the /Prince of Nothing/ series the elf-analogues basically just keep humans as pets and it's only through a bad science experiment that they wind up declining as a species.
