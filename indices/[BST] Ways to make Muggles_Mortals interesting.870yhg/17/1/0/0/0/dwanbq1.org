At least I'm arguing from a data point, and it's one that's very relevant to the discussion. We're not talking about 2 unknown species growing up alongside one another, were talking about 1 unknown species growing up alongside /humans/. Humans really like killing other species, particularly ones that are either competing or edible.

And keep in mind, I'm fine with there being multiple sentient species, as long as there's a good reason for them to never run into each other until +they develop stuff like ethics and shit+ the enlightenment. I specifically called out mole people. You're the one that limited it to primates in the first place, and I still think that humans would kill the sloth people pretty much as soon as they met. Europeans almost killed off the aboriginal peoples in the places they colonized, and that was when it was the same species.

Never read xenocide.
