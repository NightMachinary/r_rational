You're arguing from a data point of one. Not hard to come up with counterfactuals, such as no Bering Strait and isolation for one species or intelligent species based on relatively non-violent herbivores or omnivores, like sloths or bonobos if you want to keep the discussion to primate or primate-like species. You're also assuming that the agricultural revolution has to happen at some specifictime relative to some assumed xenocide or extinction event, which seems like a big assumption. I don't think sapient species living alongside one another strains credulity, they could even be symbiotic as in Card's /Xenocide/.
