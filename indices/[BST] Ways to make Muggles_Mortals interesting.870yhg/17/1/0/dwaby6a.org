But we kiss/killed them into extinction/our genetic code before any species was really socially significant, at least from what I recall. I'm not an expert, and I'd love if an expert were to chime in, but it does kinda seem like there's a funnel when it comes to intelligent life, and if you want more than one to evolve at the same time (and coexist long enough for your story to have dialogue), they almost have to be completely removed from each other.

Every other possibility I can come up with (especially when the two races are as fundamentally different as /magic/) leads to one of them eventually killing off the other before they get to agriculture, unless their biology and/or psychology is totally alien. maybe it's just a lack of imagination, but hundreds of thousands of years is a reallllly long time to assume that they /dont/ end up killing each other.
