Ah but that's the thing; I don't want it to be something like 'ambition' that sets muggles apart, though 'creativity' is somewhat closer to the mark. I want it to be something more basic, something more essential, that muggles could exploit to gain a foothold in the land.

A lot of the old fairy and folk tales I know hinge on the protagonist tricking their magical foe, not on brute strength, and that was something I wanted to maintain without making magicals all idiots/fools. Instead I'm planning on inserting 'holes' in their thinking, that muggles could exploit in order to survive.

For example, if I wanted it to be that muggles advance faster, I wouldn't do it by giving muggles something as nebulous as 'ambition', because then it would be hard to write elf characters in a way that made them seem truly different, not just unambitious muggles.

Instead I would make it so that elves posses no intuition. Their conscious experience is, somehow, the sum total of their mental processing. They never have 'aha!' or 'eureka!' moments, and they never just 'get' a topic; instead they have to laboriously link ideas together every single time. An elf is never just 'good' at something, the way a human can just be talented at maths, or art, but instead must work for every single skill they have. This would be slightly mitigated by their long lives, and explain parts of their culture. Elf society is so striated because, without such a thing as talent, the elves higher up really are better than their peers in every way; the elf capable of becoming the best mathematician is also likely to be the best biologist and the best chemist and the best painter etc... because they have infinite time to learn and only one skill that matters; how well they manually link ideas.

So a human watching an elves would be in awe of their long lives and elegant aristocracy. And an elf watching humans would marvel at how fast humans can learn, how quickly ideas can come to them and how, inexplicably, they just appear to be 'good' at things, where an elf would always, always start at rock bottom. And so the envy would work both ways.

And that's why it can't be something as nebulous as creativity, and why I choose the language instinct as an example. Wizards lacking a language instinct wouldn't mean they are any less intelligent than muggles, or less creative, or anything. It just means that, in some fundamental ways, the two minds work differently, in that if you put a group of 'blank slate' muggle children together they would quickly and almost effortlessly invent a complex, grammatically rich language, while a similar group of wizard children (despite being just as clever in every other way) would have to consciously and laboriously construct a language, and then teach it manually to their kids (who wouldn't just 'pick it up' like muggle children would).
