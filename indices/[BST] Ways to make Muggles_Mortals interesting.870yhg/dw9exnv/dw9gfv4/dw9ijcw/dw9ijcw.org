I get what you're saying about vagueness, but I think creativity is less vague than it is broad. I was using it to mean all original thought, basically saying that they get 1 original thought per lifetime, and it manifests in their offspring, and maybe they can learn from others of their species. Potentially all of their thought is tied into their magic, similar to how the fae in, for example, a practical guide to evil, are living stories.

So like, the first ever magical spell of the first ever sentient being (perhaps it was magic incarnate) was the spell to create offspring, and then the offspring found they could also create food, and then maybe one of them learned how to create multiple offspring and that's how it became a race instead of a single entity that just sorta reincarnates (i think you could probably skip straight to creating multiple offspring, in retrospect), but all the new generation are a fraction as powerful as the original. and then one of the new generation did it again and /that/ created muggles, with the magic too diffused to be even usable, but that generation gained the creativity trait, but none of the "elves" ever did the multi-offspring or creativity thing again because it became idk taboo or something

just a concept for the "evolution" process, a lot of holes, but still
