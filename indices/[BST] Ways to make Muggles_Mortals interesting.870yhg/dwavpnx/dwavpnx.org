"Necessity is the mother of invention."

Remember in Harry Pottter canon when the Weasly twins brew and consume a potion to alter their age in order to put their names in the goblet of fire?

Remember how in that same book Dumbledore asks Harry if /he asked an older student to put in his name for him!/

Take your "muggles" and give them the lateral thinking expected of someone who comes from a world where corporate sends their development team on weekend-long courses about /creative problem solving,/ a world where the hardware store has 1000's of different highly specific tools for highly specific purposes.

Then put them alongside someone who is used to waving his wand and saying a few words to solve most everyday problems. Someone who has never heard of compound epoxy or the ideal gas law, because why would they ever need glue or pressure vessels? Someone whose every solution to a problem involves wand-waving and when that proves insufficient throws their hands up in the air because /absent necessity they have never learned how to invent./
