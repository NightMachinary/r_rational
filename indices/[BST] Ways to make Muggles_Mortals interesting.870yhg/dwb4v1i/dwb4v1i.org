The easiest fix is probably to take the muggle/wizard divide further. "Muggles" can't do magic because they are immune to it or at least are highly resistant. A mage might be able to cast a spell that hurts them by heating up the air or by speeding an arrow on its way, or other circuitous means, but a "magic missile" or a healing spell would bounce off with no effect. Now, all of a sudden it has gone from a complete disadvantage to a situational advantage, but one that leaves your muggle characters unable to seek magical healing directly, leaving them with consequences. This is a fairly common trope applied on the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer][individual level]] at least.

Another approach to keep visibility low might be to incur some sort of karmic debt to everyone you introduce to the magical world. Now everyone could do or know magic, but you are responsible at some fundamental level for either the well-being or actions of everyone you introduce to the system. This requires an annoyingly global system of right/wrong or management though and some sort of control to prevent one person from damning themselves by introducing everybody to magic.

To directly answer your question, if you feel the need to tilt the scales further against the wizarding population, you can always bias their experimental results with their expectations, cause technology to start to fritz out as a result, and you largely rob the magical world of the scientific method -- except for maybe a handful of monks who train to remove their internal biases, hello [[/r/rational]]. This then justifies the more classic wizard vibe in the modern world. This has already been explored pretty effectively in the Dresden Files and the like, though.
