  So maybe Fae minds are easily corrupted by imagination, so that if they tried to lie, the risked overwriting the truth with the lie in their own heads?

I sort of want to say that maybe you can take the next step, and Fae lies have the risk of becoming actually true, but in unpredictable, dangerous ways. That's getting a bit beyond the realm of purely mental effects though.

Getting back to the original point, I think this sort of deficit would also come up in argument; a Fae can't readily be the devil's advocate for fear of accidentally becoming the devil. To even argue something hypothetically, a Fae must actually believe their own words. This could logically be extended to Fae often being surprised by other sides of an argument in ways a mortal might not be. The contradictory nature of human argument might leave Fae often bamboozled diplomatically, since the true intentions of a human can be so difficult to follow and their goals are often unclear.
