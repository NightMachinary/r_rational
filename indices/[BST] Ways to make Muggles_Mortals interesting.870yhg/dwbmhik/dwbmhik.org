One standard one I've seen is creativity -- elves etc simply copy culture and etc from humans and then make small modifications because that's the best they can do.

An interesting twist on that: magical beings can't eat in the human world (or have a finite magic supply and die when it's exhausted), so they need to go back to the Fae Lands for meals. Time passes faster there, so dipping in for breakfast causes you to lose a week in the human world. Unfortunately, the Fae Lands don't have reliable physics so you can't really do science there. As a result, magicals are continuously losing time compared to humans. This explains why they seem to have longer lifespans and aren't as creative -- from a human perspective magical don't have /time/ to create.
