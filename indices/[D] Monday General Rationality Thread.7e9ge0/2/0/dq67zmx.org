I taught myself the basics of Game Theory online back in high-school through some lecture notes, which I think were posted by Yale but I'm not certain. I don't think it was this because they weren't videos.

Fast forward a few years, I got a bachelor's in math without taking any Game Theory courses (since the only one offered was a 300 level Econ course) but am now working in Game Theory in grad school off the back of that knowledge and some additional independent study. Game Theory is cool, and introduced me to utility functions way back when so I already knew what people were talking about when I discovered this sub.
