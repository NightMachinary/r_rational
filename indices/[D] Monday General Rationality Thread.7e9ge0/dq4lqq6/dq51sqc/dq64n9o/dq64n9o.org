I'm not sure I remember where Arc 6 was, but I stand by my point. Early Homestuck was a mix of meta-humor, and Lost-style "Why do all these non-nonsensical things happen? Stay tuned for answers!". I'd say it always was a very good medium, very good narration, and a mediocre story.

Prequel has fewer branching plot points, a single coherent character arc, and no time-travel, better pacing, etc. Though the beginning is pretty rough.
