Kazerad isn't worshiped as a god here yet, so I'm obviously not doing my job. For the record, he's the person writing [[http://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/][Prequel Adventure]], which I would define as "Homestuck except with a good story".

--------------

He's posted quite a few posts on philosophy and epistemology (also writing, game design and gamergate) a few years ago. They're more optimized for the Tumblr community than the rationalist community, but they still felt useful and inspiring to me.

My favourites:

- [[http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/90923468138/depth][Depth]].

- [[http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/92214013593/power][Power]].

- [[http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/86930556353/activism][Activism]], on the nÂ°1 difference between fiction and reality.

Even if you already agree with the message, you might find the perspective and the examples useful.
