Homestuck definitely took inspiration from Lost, but I'd say the end of Act 5 (Cascade, the green sun, the exiles, the scratch, followed by the reveal of Lord English) cashed in all the dangling plot hooks /at the time/ and gave them resolution. It's after that when Hussie starts writing more plot hooks than he can handle, and the end of the story answers nothing.

Anyway, Prequel is a very different kind of story, less mystery focused and more dramatic. Isn't Katia messing up and crying a running gag?
