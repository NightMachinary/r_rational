I don't frequent the sub, but I watch my inbound links for my website like a hawk. Someone clicked your link to Luminosity :)

The index and the how-to do link to each other, but I feel like the how-to link is easy to miss? Maybe I'm wrong about how it looks to someone who doesn't see the page every day.
