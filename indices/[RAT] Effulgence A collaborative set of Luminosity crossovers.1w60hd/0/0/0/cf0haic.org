Holy cow! You replied! I'm a huge fan. This is pretty cool.

Anyway, I apologize for the problem about what to link to; the index was how someone else (EY, actually, iirc) linked me to it, and since there was a link to the how-to-read right up top... Well, I'll not make excuses, but it's awesome that you're here and you know this sub exists and posted in it and have a reddit account etc etc. Awsome.
