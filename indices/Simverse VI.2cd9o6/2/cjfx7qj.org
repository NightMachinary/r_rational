If this is THIS hard, wouldn't it make more sense to just mine normally for almost everything? I mean, you have infinite planets and no travel time or need to worry about lifting it out of the gravity well, so even with 0 duplication it'd be near post scarcity quite easily.

This kind of duplication mainly makes sense when it saves /labor/ or time, which is rather rare given the other constraint of structural simplicity. There are a /few/ niches, but mostly just rare elements or isotopes you have to process astronomical amounts of ore to get a tiny bit of. Maybe if crystals or metamaterials can be managed that's another use.

More intresting I think is mining assisted by swaps; you might be able to have several ships around the system, swaping chunks of rock out of the crust or even deeper untill a sufficetly rich ore is found, then swaping the ore cube near enoguh to a star to melt it, then another swap straight to the inside of a huge centrifuge. Or if you can swap out chunks of the core of a geologicaly active planet that saves a step.
