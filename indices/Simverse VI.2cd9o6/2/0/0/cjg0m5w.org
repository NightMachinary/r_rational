I might be misjudging the scale, thinking in cubes 50 to 100 meters on a side. Planets are /big/, and removing a 50x50x50 cube of molten mostly-iron from the core and puting it in orbit seems easier than moving a 50x50x50 cube of steel from a factory on the ground into the oort cloud, duplicating it, and moving the copies back.
