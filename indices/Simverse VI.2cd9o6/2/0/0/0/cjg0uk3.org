Distance has nothing to do with the difficulty of swapping. The sole difficulty comes from the time-limit for swap calculations imposed by rendering cycles, and if that has been overcome, there still is the risk of triggering the verification tool, causing a reset.

A planet is much better rendered that deep space. If you are the sole inhabitant of a solar system, you might have a chance to swap out pieces of the planet's core. Very quickly though, you'll find that all swap attempted that affect planetary cubes results in an immediate reset.

Deep space hacks always have a much greater chance of succeeding than planetary hacks.
