Once I post Simverse VII, I'll make a 'krakonfour's worldbuilding' page with links to all the posts about my Simverse and Iron Giants settings.

The answer to your question is no. The simulator has a verification tool that checks whether the simulator is making mistakes or not. Humans bypass the verification using hacks. This allows them to redefine reality and allow them to teleport or duplicate sectors.

However, after the hack is completed, things still have to look 'normal'. A few extra blocks of platinum in deep deep space doesn't look too out of place. A 50m spaceship disappearing isn't that dramatic. However, trying to move a celestial body always will trigger the verification tool. This causes a freeze, during which the simulator does not respond to hacks, followed by a reset, where the simulator re-plays everything as if the hack never happened.
