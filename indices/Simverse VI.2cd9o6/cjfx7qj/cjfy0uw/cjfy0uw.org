However difficult the duplication process might be, it is insignificant compared to mining in space... or mining at all.

You basically need 1 fast computer, one man willing to be separated from civilization for a year and a block of practically any simple material.

You are also misjudging the freedom of travel in this setting. While you can freely swap across galaxies, it is only possible to travel to a 'new' location by forcing it to render, then placing an unmoving observer in it.

To explore new sectors, you have to make them interact with their surroundings to a reasonable degree. The easiest and fastest way to do this is to shine a laser in front of you. This easily gives you 1-100 million km of rendered cubes. However, this method necessarily restricts your pseudovelocity to less than lightspeed. Also, keeping an observer motionless (so as to not disrupt the local cubes and render the coordinates sent back home useless) is a big hassle when dealing with orbital mechanics. There are ways to deal with this, but the point remains.

Exploring new territory takes /years/.

As I mentioned in one of these comments, directly affecting celestial bodies is risky. Most likely, it is done in untouched solar systems, and only to gather the initial resources for a duplication operation. /Processing/ the duplicated material if done in a conventional manner. I'll describe a particularly explosive method to extract minerals in my next post ;)
