For really quick single-shot stories, there's always the biweekly challenge threads (each of which links to the previous thread, so you can start from the current sticky and follow backwards in time).

Not necessarily the absolute apex best of the community's output, as it's by nature a quicker and less refined format. But usually at least interesting, and requires less commitment than diving into the lengthy serial format.
