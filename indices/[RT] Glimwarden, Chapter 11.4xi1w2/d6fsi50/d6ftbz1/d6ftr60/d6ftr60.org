Uh, if there are towns where they literally draft petite women only as glimwardens then I think someone half the size may not be that marginal. Still, if one heart on a 6ft male means they can move 1x faster a kid who weighs 1/4 as much as an errand boy is moving 4x faster? Hardly marginal.

Later you could start getting into a situation where you deliberately stunt people's growths or try to select people for Dwarfism since the bind can make up for health deficiencies.
