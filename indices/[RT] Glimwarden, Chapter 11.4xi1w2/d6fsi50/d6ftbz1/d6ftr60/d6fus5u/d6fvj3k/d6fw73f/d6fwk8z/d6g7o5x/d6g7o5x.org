Given that:

1) At least in this region, there seems to be a lack of intellectual thought directed towards the problem of "how does the power of the bind make a glimwarden", including among the glimwardens themselves.

2) The times when the efficacy of the glimwardens is truly important are rare and not conducive to reasoned observation - IE, the fall of a town when it's lantern(s) fail - so there may not be many outside observers who could comment on the effect of body size.

3) Our world's history, where segregation lead to these sort of... market inefficiencies... despite the fact that competition/survival was often of great concern.

...then it is reasonable to think that a segregated glimwarden force could persist as a cultural thing.

...pure evolution is very slow and uncertain, after all, and the darklings (and perhaps the bind) have been around for a short enough time that artifacts (see: radios) of the previous era are still around...
