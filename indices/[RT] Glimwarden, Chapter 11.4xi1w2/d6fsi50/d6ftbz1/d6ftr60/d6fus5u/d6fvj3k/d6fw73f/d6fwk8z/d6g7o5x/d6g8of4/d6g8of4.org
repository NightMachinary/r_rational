For sure, that's a good summary, however I would say the nature of isolation of each community would mean we would see more variations (than reality where no village could be that independent and culturally isolated) and therefore more competition and it should be reasonable to think that a successful shift to a superior protection force should be reflected by the higher odds of survival of that place.

Though as you say in 2) may be low enough where it's not relevant. After all not only does it have to be better it has to be so much more successful as to be replacing all the towns around it (after they fail).
