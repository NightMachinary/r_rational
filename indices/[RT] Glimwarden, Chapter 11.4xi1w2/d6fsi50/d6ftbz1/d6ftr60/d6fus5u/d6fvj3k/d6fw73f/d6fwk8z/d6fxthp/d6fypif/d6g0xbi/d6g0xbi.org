  And yes hearts comes into it too if children are worse at fighting then their heart collection rate might not overcome that their more efficient heart/power increase.

Another thing to consider, 1000 hearts doesn't necessarily guaratee 100% risk free heart gathering. It's not obvious that an average kid could be expected to gather even 1000 hearts to "earn their keep" before dying. And then it would be the question of exact advantage the lower mass gives a kid compared to their reduced general capabilities to figure out at which point it's best to give them the hearts and set them off on the darklings. It you wanted to go "make everyone a glimwarden" route maybe it would make the most sense to give everyone 1000 hearts when they come of age and expect them to repay the debt to society within 10 years, you know, like student loan from hell. It all depends on specific numbers.
