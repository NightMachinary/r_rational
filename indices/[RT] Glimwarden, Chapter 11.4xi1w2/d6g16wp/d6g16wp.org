In that small of a town, Chloe would stick out like a sore thumb, IMO.

The dialogue between her and the random teen she asks about Langust is not believable/realistic. Who asks random people questions with such a thin cover story?

I'm not sure if people bathe regularly in this world but Chloe would also get a little stinky after a couple of days of sleeping on the streets or in warehouses.
