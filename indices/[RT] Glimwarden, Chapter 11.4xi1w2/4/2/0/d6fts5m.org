Yeah you can't have the Auxiliary if everyone had a heart to get through the most dangerous points of their life.

But Auxiliary's seem pretty worthless defensive wise anyway so... Might as well just teach all kids how to use the bind in school.

Edit: Another benefit of giving everyone a heart is that you can find the best signature, some are obviously going to be better than others. Then get the best signature person to actually be a glimwarden.
