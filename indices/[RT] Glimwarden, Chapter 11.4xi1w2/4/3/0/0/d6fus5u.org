  Lack of ageism sounds more enlightened to me

Is it ageism to postulate that a child can't give consent for certain things until a certain age? I mean, we can quarrel about what exactly that age is, but surely there's some limit.

  Uh, if there are towns where they literally draft petite women only as glimwardens then I think someone half the size may not be that marginal.

And there are towns which manage perfectly fine with more egalitarian policies (Light's Hollow) or even chauvinistic policies (Langust). The text suggests that more "backwards" towns don't do this because "evil patriarchy", but considering that glimlight is power I actually think it's more egalitarian to have equal opportunity glimwardens (like in Light's Hollow). Like in the real world strictly speaking men are better suited to be soldiers physiologically (on average), but we want integrated militaries anyway. So I get the impression that the POV character's perspective may be distorted and the size advantage (even if real strictly speaking) is just an excuse for sexist policies. It's clearly not an overwhelming advantage, considering there was no indication that women were significantly more effective during the battle for Healer's Lantern.
