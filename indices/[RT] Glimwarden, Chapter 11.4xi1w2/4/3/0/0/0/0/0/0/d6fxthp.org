  Well yes I thought I made that comment in this subchain, the auxiliary is pretty worthless.

But your said

  Also good *Glimwarden candidates* are children

I agree that it could make for more effective glimwarden force if everyone is given a heart to discover the best signatures. And many other things could be done better. But as said in different places, it seems clear that the civilization is secure enough that glimwardens and politicians can play power games. There is no desperation to fight for every little scrap of efficiency, ethics be damned.

  So my question then is does human propulsion matter at all when moving under the bind?
#+end_quote

The quote is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  The bind had many functions, but two of the most important were to enhance the physical strength of the user and to propel the user across the field of battle. The first function was muscle agnostic; a person grew more powerful in relation to how much bind they had, regardless of their physical strength without the bind. For the second function, size was a detriment, because the bind required to move the body around increased with mass.
#+end_quote

So it seems that glimlight is the great equalizer, and a spherical glimwarden in vacuum would be able to achieve acceleration linearly dependent on their mass, both on muscle power (leaving aside the question how one could propel oneself in vacuum on muscle power) and on pure glimlight propulsion (pulling against the luminiferous aether I suppose). This probably does not translate into anything near linear advantage in battle. And another question is what is the glimlight coefficient, i.e. how much additional hearts a glimwarden must take to achieve the same acceleration with the excess mass of 1 kg.
