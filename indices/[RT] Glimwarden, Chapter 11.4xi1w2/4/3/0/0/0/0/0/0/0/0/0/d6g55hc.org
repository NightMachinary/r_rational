Well from African child soldier armies I would say I would expect children to be reasonably capable, especially since in this case they are at a disadvantage as opposed to in the real world. Since at the end of the day they would be able to run away from any combat I imagine there's some age far below 15 or whatever you class as adulthood where it is reasonable for them to be able to at least collect 1k.

But yes it is very much a numbers game.

Part of the purpose of giving everyone hearts when they're younger, not necessarily the full 1000 is to lower the deathrate which was very high at that age in this time period.
