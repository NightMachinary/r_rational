  If your remove the conscription of everyone who taken a heart, then yes, no problem, vaccinate all you want, but I objected to your original claim that children would make for good glimwardens.
#+end_quote

Well yes I thought I made that comment in this subchain, the auxiliary is pretty worthless.

#+begin_quote
  Glimwarden service is for life, and it involves a lot of danger.
#+end_quote

Yes well a scenario where literally everyone in the town has some form of the bind isn't going to have the same set up for Glimwardens.

#+begin_quote
  So if you suggest to make children into glimwardens, it's not equivalent of vaccination, it's equivalent to drafting children into air force pilots because we can load more bombs or get better operational range that way.
#+end_quote

Well once they're older giving them hearts is less efficient, but sure I would draft children to be airforce pilots anyway if it meant not dying to darklings.

#+begin_quote
  But this is not the case, it presented such as only most "enlightened" towns are able to overcome chauvinistic considerations and make glimawardens women only.
#+end_quote

Well see you thought the character was biased in their understanding of their powers but I thought they were biased in their description of things. From the characters mindset I'm not surprised they think a town where women are in charge are enlightened, but then she might think men being slaves to women are also enlightened.

#+begin_quote
  Which supports my claim that from what we are shown the size advantage is pretty marginal (it's easily outweighed by cultural prejudices).
#+end_quote

I think not that the size advantage is marginal, but that glimwarden power is actually irrelevant. So the size advantage might make for a huge combat difference, but by and large glimwardens don't need to be more powerful from what we've seen and been exposed to.

Edit: I guess that's what you were saying and I just misunderstood, so I agree.

This was brought up in another comment chain, people aren't selected because they are best at fighting the darkling, they're selected because they are the best at filling the cultural role of being a glimwarden. What I was doing was overestimating how much of a threat darklings really are, there isn't as much pressure from darklings as I thought.

That is even if a 40kg person could take down 5 Darklings for ever 1 an 80kg person could it doesn't matter because Darklings aren't the issues that Glimwardens face (by and large). Glimwardens always win darkling and the times when they don't isn't often enough to be the overwhelming selective pressure.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, that's why I'm suspicious of "women only" being presented as enlightened. A policy strictly focused on efficiency would operate on physiological limits (must be this small to apply), and I suppose that would create a natural state of the majority of glimwardens being women, but probably not exclusively.
#+end_quote

I agree.

#+begin_quote
  I'm pretty sure it's linear, because, you know, F = ma.
#+end_quote

So then we can suppose that a person is half as lighter accelarates twice as fast, that doesn't mean "marginal" to me in a combat scenario (though again this seems actually irrelevant). So my question then is does human propulsion matter at all when moving under the bind? If Ussain Bolt and and equivalent weight person took 100 hearts and used the bind to run, would Ussain run faster or at the same speed?
