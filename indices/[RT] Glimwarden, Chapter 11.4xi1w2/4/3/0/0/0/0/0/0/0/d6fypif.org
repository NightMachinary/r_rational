  Also good Glimwarden candidates are children

Well yes, it was a flippant comment regarding the smaller women information, but I meant in terms of combat capability. As I said I've realized that that combat capability isn't even the main factor of a Glimwarden. Also I didn't mean in terms of Auxillary either, I meant giving them 1000 hearts or however many it was something similar to Ender's Game.

  But as said in different places, it seems clear that the civilization is secure enough that glimwardens and politicians can play power games. There is no desperation to fight for every little scrap of efficiency, ethics be damned.
#+end_quote

Yes that's something I had neglected to consider.

  So it seems that glimlight is the great equalizer, and a spherical glimwarden in vacuum would be able to achieve acceleration linearly dependent on their mass, both on muscle power (leaving aside the question how one could propel oneself in vacuum on muscle power) and on pure glimlight propulsion (pulling against the luminiferous aether I suppose).

Yes I agree

#+begin_quote
  This probably does not translate into anything near linear advantage in battle.

Indeed for a start of physical propulsion matters at all look at the fastest runners in the world, most of them are not light petite women. Having more powerful muscles (and therefore being heavier) may make more of an impact than the bind moving you. That is if we suppose acceleration = muscle strength*bind power + bind power/muscle mass then the relation between muscle strength mass is more important. If an 1 extra muscle strength costs less than 1 kg then in this simple equation with no coefficients it would be better to be heavier.

And yes hearts comes into it too if children are worse at fighting then their heart collection rate might not overcome that their more efficient heart/power increase. And since darklings seem to be infinite it seems the fattest (weight) and weakest (muscle strength) of people who is sufficiently skilled could outpower (by outcollecting and making up for efficiency loss) an idiotic but light child.
