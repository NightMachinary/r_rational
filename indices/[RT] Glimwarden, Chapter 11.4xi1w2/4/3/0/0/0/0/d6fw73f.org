  Forcing them to eat a heart is equivalent to vaccinating them.
#+end_quote

If your remove the conscription of everyone who taken a heart, then yes, no problem, vaccinate all you want, but I objected to your original claim that children would make for good glimwardens. Glimwarden service is for life, and it involves a lot of danger. So if you suggest to make children into glimwardens, it's not equivalent of vaccination, it's equivalent to drafting children into air force pilots because we can load more bombs or get better operational range that way.

  That doesn't make sense, if women are better glimwardens and glimwardens are clearly the source of power then cultural history put women in the role of men in our world.

But this is not the case, it presented such as only most "enlightened" towns are able to overcome chauvinistic considerations and make glimawardens women only. Which supports my claim that from what we are shown the size advantage is pretty marginal (it's easily outweighed by cultural prejudices).

  And really the point isn't that women are better, but that lighter people are better.
#+end_quote

Yes, that's why I'm suspicious of "women only" being presented as enlightened. A policy strictly focused on efficiency would operate on physiological limits (must be this small to apply), and I suppose that would create a natural state of the majority of glimwardens being women, but probably not exclusively. EDIT: So it looks like they have women only policy first, and then they select small women for efficiency. Like in the real world in the countries that have men only conscription they then select men on the small side for tank crews. Sexism comes first, efficiency second.

  Now the important information is what factor is on mass, if it's square root of mass, then yeah it's not that big deal, if it's squared then it's more of a deal, etc.

I'm pretty sure it's linear, because, you know, F = ma.
