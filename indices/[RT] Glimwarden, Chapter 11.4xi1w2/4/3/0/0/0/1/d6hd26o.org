  Lack of ageism sounds more enlightened to me ;)

  Plus even if consent was 100% correlated with age, it would still be ageism since it's discrimination based on age.

Out of context most people would agree with your first sentence since its generally used when people discriminate based on age without good reason, i.e. silicon valley preferring young workers to middle aged for "culture fit".

Your second sentence uses a different definition of ageism which most wouldn't agree with since there are often excellent reasons to discriminate based on age, e.g. 1 year olds are not allowed to be doctors, say. In other words, as you define it what you say is true. But your definition of ageism makes it a rather useless concept.

You are (perhaps unintentionally) performing a bait-and-switch.
