  Is it ageism to postulate that a child can't give consent for certain things until a certain age? I mean, we can quarrel about what exactly that age is, but surely there's some limit.
#+end_quote

No the limit has nothing to do with age and everything to do with brain development, example if I freeze a baby, and then unfreeze them after they are 20 years old, they can now consent?

So yes that definitely qualifies as ageism. Plus even if consent was 100% correlated with age, it would still be ageism since it's discrimination based on age.

Anyway even if you assume no one can consent to anything for 10 years we already force them to do hundreds of things for greater societal good (like attending education, eating food, wearing clothes, etc) as well as brainwashing them into whatever ideology we desire. Forcing them to eat a heart is equivalent to vaccinating them.

  And there are towns which manage perfectly fine with more egalitarian policies (Light's Hollow) or even chauvinistic policies (Langust).
#+end_quote

Uh, yes I didn't know the standard we were holding against was "surviving".

#+begin_quote
  The text suggests that more "backwards" towns don't do this because "evil patriarchy",
#+end_quote

That doesn't make sense, if women are better glimwardens and glimwardens are clearly the source of power then cultural history put women in the role of men in our world.

What's a man going to do when he can eat the same number of hearts as a woman yet she is more powerful (or equally powerful but far faster).

#+begin_quote
  I actually think it's more egalitarian to have equal opportunity glimwardens (like in Light's Hollow).
#+end_quote

Yes... obviously it is more equal between genders to have both genders in glimwarden roles...

#+begin_quote
  Like in the real world strictly speaking men are better suited to be soldiers physiologically (on average), but we want integrated militaries anyway.
#+end_quote

Yes and no doubt men's adapted psychologically has developed over all of human history, I haven't heard of female chimpanzee's suffering from PTSD for example. So in a world where females are fighting early they would get the psychological adaptions (though since they'd be on the X chromosome there's no reason why they might not also apply to men).

Of course it may also be the case that men were psychologically adapted for becoming glimwardens when darklings started existing and so the pressure is actually for men to be smaller rather than women more capable.

Also individuals have different psychological suitability for military roles, and some women are better adapted to military roles than some men. Yet again it's a correlation not an absolute.

  So I get the impression that the POV character's perspective may be distorted and the size advantage (even if real strictly speaking) is just an excuse for sexist policies.
#+end_quote

I am running on the assumption that the character who uses the bind understands how it works and since she has actual examples of towns who not only have women but explicitly only the most petite.

#+begin_quote
  It's clearly not an overwhelming advantage, considering there was no indication that women were significantly more effective during the battle for Healer's Lantern.
#+end_quote

Well for a start I'm pretty sure number of hearts eaten still matters more. So not seeing women performing better isn't any indication of anything. What you'd except to see is women with the same number of hearts consumed performing better than equivalent men. And you'd have to see this over a large sample size as to discount individual variation. And really the point isn't that women are better, but that lighter people are better. It may be likely that all the glimmanden are heavier than any glimwomenden but that's just statistics. I don't think we have a description of every glimwarden so we don't know their mass.

Power = Heart

Speed = Heart/Mass

Now the important information is what factor is on mass, if it's square root of mass, then yeah it's not that big deal, if it's squared then it's more of a deal, etc.

Good thing we have a main character who can test this by the addition of people/boulders, fasting, or removing clothes etc.
