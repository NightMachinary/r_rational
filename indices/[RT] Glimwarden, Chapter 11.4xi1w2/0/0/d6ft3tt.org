Yeah thats a mindbogglingly, impossibly big building for a 1000 people village.

I mean, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral][Dome of Cologne]] stood unfinished for 300 years, total building time 700 or so, in a town of about ...40000 people, plus other parts of the country to get ressources from (no darklings).

If building size would scale with normal square/cube law we are looking at 150m vs 30m, eg factor 5^{3=125.} No way a town of that size under darkling restrictions should have been able to do that.

I notice I am confused.
