You are absolutely correct! Most of the time in fiction this would be my main prior. Some handwaved phlebotnium or a healthy dose of narrativum.

However, we /are/ on [[/r/rational]], with author [[/u/alexanderwales]], who I have learned to hold to higher standards. I fully expect him to have blueprints of the the cathedral, pages full of notes about building economies in medieval societies, and a computer model of the building process using magical power armour.

And I am only half joking.
