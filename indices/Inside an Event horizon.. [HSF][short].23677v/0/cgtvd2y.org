I've always thought of the event horizon as being identical to the singularity, at least from an outside perspective. [[http://www.askamathematician.com/2012/09/q-what-are-singularities-do-they-exist-in-nature/][This article]] is pretty convincing. It's essentially just the 3D/4D equivalent of the rubber sheet analogy, but asymptotic. I've always justified it by the time effects around the event horizon, time essentially stops.

Reading this gives me the fanciful idea that the idea of the singularity (lying in your future in spacetime) is actually the point at which the black hole's mass becomes Hawking radiation.

I'd like to see what RobotRollCall thinks of the new 'apparent horizon' idea.
