I'm sure you've seen Mother of Learning, which I really enjoyed. I also liked Threadbare and Epilogue.

A lot of series start off really promising, but then devolve into the standard casually OP MC who never makes a mistake and is always right (which makes sense to me -- being creative is hard, but being consistently creative is nearly impossible). Of course, I appreciate the world building and I find the set ups to be very interesting; I've learned that sometimes it's best to just stop repeating when the author starts dragging things out a bit. You can't really go wrong reading a few dozen chapters for any of the Best Rated list.
