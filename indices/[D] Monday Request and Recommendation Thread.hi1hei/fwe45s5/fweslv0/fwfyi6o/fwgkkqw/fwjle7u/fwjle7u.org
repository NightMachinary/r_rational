Interesting point, at what break point does Superman stop all crime in the city? He doesn't actually need to catch 100% initially, just suppress crime until it gets below his catch capacity.

Say he can stop 100 crimes a day, as a criminal how many daily crimes in the city would you need to feel like you can get away with your own crime? Obviously > 100. 1,000 a day? That's not taking into account that Superman is removing 100 criminals every day, which would effect the averages if repeat crimes are common. Even if you think you will get away with the crime you will have to come to terms with the fact that the only reason you didn't get caught was luck that Superman didn't pick you.

I think Superman would very quickly shut down violent crime within his hearing range even if he could only catch a small percentage initially. I would imagine removing repeat offenders and the threat of capture would create a feedback loop driving cases he can catch to 0 over time. Although crimes of passion would muddy this and potentially give cover to other crimes...
