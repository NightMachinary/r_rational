Agree. Plus the fundamental problem with vigilantism is as unprofessional, biased police with too much individual power, they would commonly kill and assault innocent people. There wouldn't be many of these easily identified straightforward crooks in a superhero world.

In real life if a criminal decides to rob a convenience store or commit a rape or mugging in a back alley, most of the time the crook is assessing the risks. They generally won't do such a crime if there is a hundred percent chance of getting caught - it's why the convenience stores with an armed police officer standing outside don't generally get robbed.

If superheroes with super hearing are patrolling your city it's a similar thing.
