Hi I'm looking for "realistic" Pokemon content with a focus on finding and catching rare Pokemon as well as training and evolving them. I love the world of Pokemon Origin of Species but would be more interested in finding/capturing/training Pokemon. Much of the content in that series is focused on teaching rational ideas or delving into Red's Physic powers, which, while I enjoy, takes away from the story/progression of the Pokemon. I enjoyed "Game of Champions." I couldn't get too far into "The Sun Soul" as it seemed less thought out/structured and the characters completely unbelievable in their response to the major event that happens at the beginning.
