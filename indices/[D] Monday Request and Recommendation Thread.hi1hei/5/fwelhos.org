Any stories in which the main character becomes an unprecedenced expert or a pioneer in deeply esoteric, spiritual, highly abstract Soul-related, almost religious stuff in contrast to the mostly hard fantasy-esque, generic nature of the standard magical system of the setting? To use an analogy, the protagonist might be something of a philosophy/theology/literature major amongst the figurative crowd of STEM dudes. Examples (kinda spoilery, so I'll black it out just to be safe):

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/][The Games We Play by Ryuugi]] --- all the archangel, Kaballah, Chakras, and mysticism shit in the late game. I loved the chapter-long philosophical siloloquies on the nature of soul, identity, and reality that took place in between shounen-esque action scenes. The contrast between a seemingly-hard, easily quantifiable concept like the Gamer powerset and some of the extremely abstract end-game skills like the Ohr Ein Sof, the Arcana, Et in Arcadia Ego was a treat. Actually, many of Ryuugi's crossovers have this kind of hard/soft play, Arana and Prytaneum had some pretty nice descriptions of ‘godly' or ‘spiritual' stuff compared to the shounen anime nature of their original settings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid by ShaperV]] --- the bright kami and demon shit, mental landscapes, the language of creation, the space between universes, the world-wide sealing fate manipulation sealing arrays drawn onto the sky, the aspects, the way chakra is portrayed when looked through the Byakugan, and so on.

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning by nobody103]] --- all the end game unstructured magic, dimensionalism, soul magic, mind magic, and stuff.

On the other hand, I wouldn't use Pact or Unsong as an example, since /all/ of the magic in there is mostly abstract and concept-based. What I'm searching for is specifically the /contrast/ between hard fantasy standard baby stuff every wizard casts and the weird-ass freaking high-level abstract shit the protagonist might attempt to do.

I'd much prefer fanfiction and webfiction/self-published Amazon/semi-amateur internet shit over older fantasy classics, but if it matches, I'll take it.
