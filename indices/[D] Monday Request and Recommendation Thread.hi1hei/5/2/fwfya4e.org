I didn't actually like the endgame of the 'games we play'. What it had right for hundreds of thousands of words was the pacing. Our hero would gain crazy powers and capabilities at a blistering pace, just barely keeping up with the ever rising threat level of his opponents. And getting in crazier and crazier situations.

I want more gamer fics with that kind of action.
