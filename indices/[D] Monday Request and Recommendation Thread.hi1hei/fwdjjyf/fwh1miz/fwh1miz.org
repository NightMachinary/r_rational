The Wiz series by Rick Cook, published by Baen, is my competence porn:

#+begin_quote
  It all began when the wizards of the White League were under attack by their opponents of the Black League and one of their most powerful members cast a spell to bring forth a mighty wizard to aid their cause. What the spell delivered was master hacker Walter Wiz Zumwalt. The wizard who cast the spell was dead and nobody---not the elves, not the dwarves, not even the dragons---could figure out what the shanghaied computer nerd was good for. But spells are a lot like computer programs, and, in spite of the Wiz's unprepossessing appearance, he was going to defeat the all-powerful Black League, win the love of a beautiful red-haired witch, and prove that when it comes to spells and sorcery, nobody but nobody can beat a Silicon Valley computer geek!

Sample ebook chapters are available on Baen's site.

My favorite moment comes in one of the later books when he hops worlds back to Earth at the E3 show in Vegas. One booth is selling the ultimate in untraceable porn, which your boss is guaranteed not to find on your work computer: a program that algorithmically generates a porn still image from any file over 1MB and displays it without saving a file to the hard drive. Wiz asks how big the program's executable file is, and they say it's over 1MB. They feed it into itself, and the resulting porn image is both illegal in fifteen states and physically implausible.
