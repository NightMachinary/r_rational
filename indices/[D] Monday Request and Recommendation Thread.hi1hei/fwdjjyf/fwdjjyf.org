Much of ratfic can be seen as a kind of "competence porn". The protagonist tends to be smart and hard-working, driven to pursue their goals. For example:

- Zorian from MoL
- Harry from HPMOR
- Amaryllis from WTC
- Cat from PGTE
- Red, Blue, Leaf from PTOOS

That's a large part of why it appeals to me. Do you know more fics like that?
