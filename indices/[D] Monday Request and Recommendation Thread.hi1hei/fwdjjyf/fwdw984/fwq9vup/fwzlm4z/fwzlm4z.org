It starts out as a fairly straight-up school adventure. And then gets stranger and stranger. With meta-conflict and metaphorical-not-a-metaphor conflict. There are several sections where I don't quite understand what is going on. It kind of reminds me of Worm, as far as the overarching plotline goes, as best as I can understand it.
