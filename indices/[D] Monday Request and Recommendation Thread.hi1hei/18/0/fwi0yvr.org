Wake of the Ravager, sort of? It's not a deconstruction or reconstruction of harems, but it's a fun and satisfying look at a /barely/ functioning one (where there's a polyamorous triad and a psychotic fourth wheel).

The Demon Lord's Lover is a fluffy romcom with harems, where one of the main characters becomes a member of another main character's harem. It's a very idealistic world with well functioning harems, so take that as you will.

Savage Divinity has a harem, and is slowly starting to get into harem dynamics, but I don't really know if I would recommend it. It's very long and has periods of very slow pace and almost-filler, but it's better than any other wuxia/xianxia so far with harems.
