The second season of To Love Ru has Momo as the protagonist trying to construct a harem around Rito.

I think I've posted about this on Facebook somewhere: the obviously correct viewpoint from which to tell a harem story is the viewpoint of one of the harem members. There's just so much more interesting story to tell that way.
