It is in fact a thing if rare. The Demon Lord's lover below does it, "No Spacebattles, You are the waifu" has this as the main conceit of the storyline, and I've seen a couple more that I don't remember right now. It could be argued that this is how the Daily Grind handles it but the protagonists are fairly equal in terms of screen time.
