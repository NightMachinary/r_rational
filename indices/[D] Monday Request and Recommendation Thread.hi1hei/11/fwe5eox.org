I've been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.789109/][Going Native]], a DC/DBZ light crossover. The premise is that the main character, Tarble, is a self insert of the author. And over the course of the story he "goes native" with the Saiyans, so to speak. By light crossover, I mean that only Frieza's empire and the saiyans are ported into DC. No Namekians and any of the especially ridiculous stuff that happens later on in the dbz series.

The story avoids almost all the pitfalls I normally see in self insert stories, because the human memories and instincts of the author are slowly overwritten by the brutality of typical saiyan life (hence the going native part). It's a fantastic look at the saiyan species and how they are developing from a population of 3,000 at the beginning of the story to more people later on. The author also does power levels pretty well, making Tarble gain power at an astonishing rate that still feels earned. Overall, I give the story a solid recommendation.

As for requests, I'm still looking for stories with a protagonist that has a "tank" build. As in, they can regenerate stupidly fast, are very hard to damage, can take a beating, or any combination thereof. The focus must still be on them being able to take lots of damage. Some examples (that I've read):

- Zac from Defiance of the fall, with his stupidly high endurance.

- That gold guy from Mistborn second era, who can regenerate from decapitated heads, getting his body crushed, drowned, etc.

- The protagonist from A Bad Name, which is a Worm/Gamer fanfic.

- The protagonist from An Exercise in Stupidity, which is a rwby/Gamer fanfic.
