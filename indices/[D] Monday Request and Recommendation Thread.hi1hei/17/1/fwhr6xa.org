I read this a while back (maybe a few years ago?) and ended up dropping this. There's a lot of exaggeration and oversimplification going on in the story.

The main issue I have is that everything comes way too easy to the MC. I got the impression that the world just wants him to succeed - if he needs a witch with a particular ability, she'll show up in a few chapters. If he needs to train an army, the men go from barely literate peasants to fully trained soldiers with a snap. There was too much "he got lucky" moments IMO.
