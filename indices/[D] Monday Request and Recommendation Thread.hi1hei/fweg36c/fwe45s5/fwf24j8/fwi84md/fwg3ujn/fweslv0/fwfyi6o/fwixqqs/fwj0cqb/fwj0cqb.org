Most governments don't allow people to own firearms. Just extrapolate that and imagine what governments would do to people with super powers..

There are many points I have against this. But just think for a second that people with super powers existed, and that they don't just magically show up in the 50s thanks to author fiat but that they've been around since long ago.

Do you think we'd have democracies ? I'd imagine a society with selectively bred supers that actively hunt and eliminate any super that's born outside or leaves their power structures, to be much more likely.
