Assuming superpowers are genetic and not spontaneous I think you would be right. I was thinking more from the 'Things are almost normal, but occasionally someone has a lab accident or gets hit by a meteor, or drinks a 30 year old soda and gets super powers' type of world. Somewhere where superpowers wouldn't be predictable and would be hideable from the world.\\
I think reading a story regarding a world with genetically reproducible superpowers entrenched throughout history would be pretty damn interesting. When would the discovery of new countries have occurred when you have people capable of flight? Would technology even progress much past the stone age? Someone more creative than me should take this and run with it.
