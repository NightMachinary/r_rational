Shyamalan's /Unbreakable/ film trilogy. There's always a doubt as to how real the powers actually are, which is sort of the point- what is the limit of human potential? Subtle, moving, and sometimes downright terrifying.

/Unbreakable/: A man becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, and this feat comes to the attention of an eccentric comic book curator.

/Split/: Young girls get kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities. Said personalities are all struggling to understand the meaning of one dangerous personality in him... The protagonist is one of the girls, a loner, survival-minded.

/Glass/: Brings together the heroes and villains of the previous two for a curious psychological showdown.

/Unbreakable/ has possibly my favourite villain but can be slow. /Split/ is the most accessible of the three, and probably the best. /Glass/ is a mixed bag, but I thought it had something to it.
