/Fleep/ is complete, and pretty short.

(Interesting fact: It was originally a newspaper-style comic strip. The author had to have a cliffhanger on every final panel, and you can sense his struggle sometimes...)

The two other works I've read from this author are [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/7229730][Meanwhile]] and [[http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001][Demon]] (also complete).

/Meanwhile/ is a delightfully creative and technically impressive book.

/Demon/... well I have a love/hate relationship with it. It's pretty rational in /some/ ways (think "sharpened Hufflepuff bones"), and offers intriguing and mostly fair puzzles. But it also has some /massive/ idiot balls, and lots of gratuitous grossness ("see? I'm not afraid to show you sharpened Hufflepuff bones! SEE THEM?! LOOK AT THEM BONES!!!"), and every single character is an evil psychopath. Sometimes it's so outrageous it works as comedy, sometimes... not. Content warning for violence and explicit disturbing sex and assorted grossness.
