It wouldn't have solved his problem. His most effective entrapment would have been trapping them in bones, which would not have held and would have taken materials away from defense.

To bone trap them, when he hit max range he would have had to drop them, meaning he saved them energy chasing him whilst he carried them behind him.

He can incapacitate when enemies are nearby and stay nearby, but he doesn't have many methods to paralyze then flee.

Now he could have broken their bones, but at that point he was still hoping for a minimally injurious encounter.

I think this supports the other commenter's statements about his inexperience.

Flee the spoiler.

Run.

Run.

Okay:

If the book were fully rational he would have spent more time practicing, maybe gaining another affinity. But I think by the time he realised he was close to escaping the loop, he'd already fought the tentacle monster, and wasn't sure he'd be able to pull off a victory next time.
