Also a hard derecc on the tree story. The protagonists personality gets overwritten with tree thoughts and he explicitly stops trying to exploit his situation. Because he's a tree and trees don't do things. The only thing keeping the story moving are the people he doesn't care about because he's a tree doing stuff he doesn't care about because he's a tree while the system hands him s-grade bullshit... because he's a tree? Literally nothing he gets is due to him doin actual work, he just pokes at the system and gives up if it doesn't give him something. It usually gives him something. It's a fucking mess.
