It happens very very far into the Zombie Knight Saga, but we've gotten looks at the more mystical aspects of the world. For the most part, the superpowers from Reapers and Servants take the front stage, but as you get into the story you get more details of the world and the pockets of mysticism that still exist.

  For example, we meet gods and people who ascended to their level with power different from Reapers/Servants. There are items with supernatural powers and lore. At the current chapters, we see zones of mysticism where time acts differently, and the power of soul takes precedence. And so on.
