I've read the webtoon version up to chapter 150 or so, so I'm not sure how much these criticisms apply to the original webnovel.

While it's entertaining, the uplift process felt overly streamlined, with implausibly short R&D timescales, at least until new witch powers are available to substitute for a machine shop and other prerequisites.

Additionally, the main character benefits a lot from low-hanging fruit without much satisfactory explanation of why no-one else has discovered them before. The largest ones are that no other groups seem to have made a systematic effort to use witches' abilities, the solution to witch deaths to their own magic as they come of age is something that anyone else could easily have stumbled upon just like the protagonist or even decided to test, and some witch power evolutions come very easily and don't seem like they required the scientific knowledge to achieve.
