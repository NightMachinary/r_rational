I'd like to second the rec for /The Demolished Man/.

It's not rational per se, but it plays with some fascinating ideas and has stellar scene-setting. Like most scifi stories from the 1950s, this book has an iconic style that makes it feel retrofuturistic in comparison to modern sensibilities. It's a fun read.
