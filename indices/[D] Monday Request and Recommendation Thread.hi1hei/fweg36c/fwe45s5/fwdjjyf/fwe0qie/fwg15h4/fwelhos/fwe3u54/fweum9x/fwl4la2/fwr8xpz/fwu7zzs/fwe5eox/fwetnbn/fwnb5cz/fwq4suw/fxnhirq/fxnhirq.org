This reply's a bit late, but I would strongly recommend The Reckoning. It explores the concepts of the original series, speeding up the plot of the original to get to the interesting parts fast and taking things to their logical conclusions. The characters are punished for their mistakes and the powers are satisfyingly exploited.\\
You don't need to have read the original series, everything is pretty self explanatory excusing a few things that would be surprising without foreknowledge of them.
