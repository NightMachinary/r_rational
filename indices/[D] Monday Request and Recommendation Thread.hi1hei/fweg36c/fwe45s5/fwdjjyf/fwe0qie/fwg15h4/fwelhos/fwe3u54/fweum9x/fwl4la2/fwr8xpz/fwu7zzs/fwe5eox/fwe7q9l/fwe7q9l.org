  As for requests, I'm still looking for stories with a protagonist that has a "tank" build. As in, they can regenerate stupidly fast, are very hard to damage, can take a beating, or any combination thereof. The focus must still be on them being able to take lots of damage.

I'd add Ilea / Lilith from [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer][Azarinth Healer]] to that list. She is now crazy tough, surviving fatal injuries easily.
