That's a big ask. Even long, completed fanfics rarely reach that length. That said, here are some great ones:

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the Stars]]*

(/761k+ words; ongoing/)

The story is set in a far distant future of the deconstructionist magical girl anime /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/.

Humanity has evolved into a post-scarcity, transhumanist civilization spread across multiple star systems and is now locked in an existential war against an alien threat. Magical girls form the backbone of humanity's military forces, their 'magic' providing a vital tactical edge against the technological superiority of the aggressors.

The main character is a young girl who joins the war effort after she contracts to become a magical girl.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8293519/1/Beneath][Beneath]]*

(/1.6m+ words; ongoing/)

This is an /Avengers/ fanfic that diverges from canon after the Chitauri invasion failed and Loki was brought back to Asgard.

Odin shoulders the heavy burden of pronouncing sentence on Loki. Presented with a choice between life imprisonment or a death sentence, Odin picks a third option: exile and a geas to restrict Loki's magic.

The early parts of the fic mainly take place on Earth, but the author has constructed an epic plotline that spans multiple realms with intrigue, war, and the lurking threat of Thanos plucking the strings from the darkness beyond the Nine.
