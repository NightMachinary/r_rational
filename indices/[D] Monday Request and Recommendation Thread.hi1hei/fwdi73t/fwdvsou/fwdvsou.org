[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Luminosity][Luminosity]], a rational /Twilight/ reimagining, and its immediate sequel /Radiance/ are complete at 438K. (Self-contained, no need to be familiar with the /Twilight/ franchise.) If you add 64K worth of omake, you'll be right around the 500K mark. Note that /Radiance/ is an integral part of /Luminosity/ even though it has a different narrator. If you stop at the end of /Luminosity/, you will be left with a very different impression of the overall tone and the direction of the fic.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DungeonKeeperAmi][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] is a semi-humorous semi-rational cross between /Dungeon Keeper/ and /Sailor Moon/. (Mostly self-contained.) Updates have been infrequent as of late, but it's sitting at 866K and has plenty of plot to keep you occupied for a while.

In case you are not familiar with [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning][Mother of Learning]], it's one of the better known original rational fics. It's over 800K and was wrapped up earlier this year.
