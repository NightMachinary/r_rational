The hard part about these sorts of stories is they often take a while to get there.

The only one I can think of that has really started to get there that you haven't mentioned is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy]] by Aetherial, which does that sort of "hard/soft contrast" you described (and they often feed into each other). It's a pretty rough start stylistically and writing style wise (due to, I think, an unfortunate, but intentional, choice by the author). However it is an awesome take on both the litrpg and cultivation genres, with really cool world building, and I think really well done.

I think Delve may be going that way, but it's hard to tell at the moment.
