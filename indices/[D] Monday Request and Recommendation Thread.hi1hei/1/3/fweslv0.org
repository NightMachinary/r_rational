I'd be interested in reading some, superheroes always irked me and always will. They make no sense, economically, or socially. I'm sure you can find some comments of mine criticizing it around the sub.

And no, because I know somebody will say it, the argument that superheroes decrease crime rates doesn't make sense economically. There's a thing called opportunity cost, and yada yada. Superheroes and vigilantes in general make no sense and would serve no purpose other than being cool and aggrandizing the ego of the heroes themselves.
