There's an older scifi short I'd love to find, about a time-traveler official who yoinks people (at the end of their lives, I think leaving a double?) so they can stand trial in the future for their crimes. Starts, I think, with Jefferson and his slaves?

Feels topical, but I haven't been able to find it.
