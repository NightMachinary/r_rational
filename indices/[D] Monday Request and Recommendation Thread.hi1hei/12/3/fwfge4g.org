In no particular order:

- Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought series, which starts with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep][A Fire Upon the Deep]], which you may have heard of before from EY's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The_Finale_of_the_Ultimate_Meta_Mega_Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]]
- Anything by Charles Stross, including [[https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando]] and, with Cory Doctorow, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rapture_of_the_Nerds][The Rapture of the Nerds]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series][The Expanse]]) is a nice series of novels and a nice TV series.
- Most things by Kim Stanley Robinson, but in particular [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy][the Mars Trilogy]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(novel][Aurora]]). If you're into political thrillers, the [[http://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/science-capital-trilogy][Science in the Capital]] trilogy or omnibus are okay, as is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_2140][New York 2140]]. /Red Moon/ I thought unfinished. If you'd like to get a look at Robinson's early style, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icehenge][Icehenge]] was pretty good, and featured themes that will be developed in his later works.
- I recommend 1.5 Neal Stephenson books: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem][Anathem]], and the first two parts of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves][Seveneves]], up throught the Seven Eves are named. Don't bother with the third part; it's the first third of a different novel.
- Poul Anderson wrote some great stuff, including swords-and-blasters books like the womanizing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Flandry][Dominic Flandry]] series and medieval [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Crusade][The High Crusade]]. The Flandry novels share a setting with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Anderson_bibliography#Technic_History][the many other works of Anderson's Technic History]], and today I learned that the excellent standalone novel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Shall_Rise][Orion Shall Rise]] is part of a series. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Zero][Tau Zero]] is no longer scientifically plausible, but was some nice hard scifi.
- Ann Leckie's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Leckie#Set_in_the_Ancillary_universe][Imperial Radch series]], consisting of the Ancillary trilogy, Provenance, and the short story [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212448/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2014/20141110/commands-f.shtml][She Commands Me And I Obey]] are all good.
- Arkady Martine's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_Called_Empire][A Memory Called Empire]]
- Ada Palmer's Terra Ignota series is a stupendous feat of worldbuilding like unto Neal Stephenson, except the author wrangles enough plots for seven different novels into one series, and makes it work. I will let the narrator introduce himself; [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/][the first chapter is here]] and the content warnings in the title page are serious.
- I need to reread Tasmyn Muir's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_the_Ninth][Gideon the Ninth]].
