I've never read a novel as striking as Bester's /The Demolished Man/. Power-hungry protagonist tries to get away with murder in a society governed by telepaths, beginning a cat-and-mouse struggle between him and a psychic cop. But he is haunted by visions of The Man With No Face..."/Looking. Looming. Silent. Horrible. Run...Run.../"

Otherwise for novels, /Ender's Game/. Eminently re-readable classic.

/Crest of the Stars/, a slow-moving space opera anime. Jinto, son of a politician who surrendered to the Abh empire, becomes Abh nobility and enters compulsory military service. He is soon caught up in the struggle between the authoritarian, genetically altered Abh and the democratic free humans. What is most interesting is the personal tone it takes. The struggle is more about the light and darkness of the individual than the galactic incidents that occur.
