Second the rec for Bujold's Vorkosigan books (except /Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen/ which... ugh. I've tried reading it three times and not got more than a third of the way in. I think the problem is that the author is doing her usual trick of writing another genre in her sci-fi setting, but slow-paced meandering old-age romance is not something I care about.)
