[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos][The Hyperion Cantos]] by Dan Simmons is not rational, but /man/ is it good space opera.

Humanity has had its diaspora into the vastness of space - and then developed unlimited-range portals. So you have all these wildly different human cultures on different planets that are now literally one step apart. Tons of great world-building.
