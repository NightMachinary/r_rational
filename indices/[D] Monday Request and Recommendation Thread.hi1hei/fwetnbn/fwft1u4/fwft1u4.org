[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds][Alastair Reynolds]], generally - most of his books are fairly hard scifi space operas. Pushing Ice is a nice high-concept but self-contained novel.

There's also Iain M. Banks' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series][Culture series]], which IMO is one of the things that really informs the characterization of friendly hyper-intelligent AI in fiction.

Less "space opera" and more "space as a metaphor for the age of sail", there's the [[https://www.amazon.com/Quarter-Share-Traders-Golden-Clipper-ebook/dp/B00AMO7VM4][Quarter Share]] series - it's basically slice of life on a sailing ship that's actually a space ship, with a dash of "capitalism, ho!". I don't think there's any combat until like the third book, and even then it's all hand-to-hand.
