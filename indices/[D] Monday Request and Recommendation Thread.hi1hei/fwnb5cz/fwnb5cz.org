I want to get into some large fanfic people on this subreddit are fawning over, but I don't have the time nor the emotional capacity to read several works at once or in quick succession. So I want to commit.

By skimming the first chapter of some of the most commonly mentioned stories, I was left with two options:

- /r!Animorphs: The Reckoning/

- /Pokemon: The Origin of Species/

Which of these two would you recommend more, and why?

(If somebody wants to know my tastes, here are random assessments of works from this sub's wiki:

- I *really liked* /HPMoR/ (and its fic /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie/), /The Metropolitan Man/, and all the short fiction stories from SSC;

- I *generally enjoyed* /Friendship Is Optimal/ and /Three Worlds Collide/;

- I *found okay* /Mother of Learning/, /Luminosity/, and /The Waves Arisen/;

- I *didn't like* /Time Braid/.

Closing bracket.)

Thanks in advance for the answers!
