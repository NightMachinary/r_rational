[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover][The Demon Lord's Lover]] is a really cute isekai romance. The world at first seems to be a generic isekai world, where the demon lord is defeated by the hero generation after generation, but the author does extra worldbuilding on it and makes it much better than it seems. The premise is that the mentor of the current generation of heroes falls in love with the current demon lord, and slowly they get together. Highly recommend.
