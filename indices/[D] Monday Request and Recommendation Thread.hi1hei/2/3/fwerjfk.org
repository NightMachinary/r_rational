  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people

  in honest pursuit of their goals

  , as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot.

It's literally one of the main characteristics of rational fiction, so pretty much anything recommended on this sub counts for your request. The Waves Arisen is really good if you haven't read it yet..

There used to be a page with the best examples of rational fiction on this sub, idk where it is anymore but I'm sure somebody has the link. It lists all of them, hpmor, mol, wtc, pgte, ptoos, twa etc.
