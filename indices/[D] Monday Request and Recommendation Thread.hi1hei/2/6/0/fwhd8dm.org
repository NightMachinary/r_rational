Oh good grief those things, I remember those! They're great fun fluff crack fiction, and I'll absolutely second the recommendation for that reason, but FWIW I'd be hard pressed to describe them as rational, or indeed particularly well-written for a published book (think grammar about on par with the average novelupdates translation).

If you like them, though, you might also enjoy Scott Meyer's Magic 2.0 series - the first one is [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EF8Z32I]["Off to be the Wizard"]] and they're actually pretty much the same thing but with more of the characters trolling each other more of the time.
