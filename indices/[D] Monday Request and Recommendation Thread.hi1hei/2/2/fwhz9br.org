Some more examples, although they are less rational than the ones you've posted.

- The Zombie Knight Saga has a protagonist that constantly tries to work and think hard to solve his problems, although he doesn't start off as competent.

- Castle Kingside has a surgeon get transmigrated into a medieval world, and he is trying to uplift the society around him. It doesn't gloss over the R&D aspect of technology as some other uplift stories do, Dimitry faces difficulty reinventing stuff.
