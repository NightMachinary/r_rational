So this is a bit of an odd one, but I feel like some of you might enjoy the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KojTtZMZm4][KUSOMEGA]] books.

I highly recommend listening to the audiobook versions, but a text version can be found in the description, if you prefer.

I wouldn't call it rational (not the first book anyway), but it does the "isekai light novel that is a deconstruction of isekai light novels" thing way better than most other stuff I've seen. Beyond that, the writing style just really resonates with me in a way that's hard to put into words.

Also, if you start hating it at chapter four, don't worry. That cringeworthy nonsense was setup for stuff later on, not just pointless powerwank.

EDIT: Also, trigger warnings, it's pretty NSFW. It doesn't have any actual explicit sex scenes (as far as I can remember), but it is pretty forwardly sexual. It also has a few slurs of various sorts here and there. I can vouch for the author not actually meaning anything by it, but take care if that sort of thing bothers you. Also TW for suicide, though the title of the video tells you about as much.
