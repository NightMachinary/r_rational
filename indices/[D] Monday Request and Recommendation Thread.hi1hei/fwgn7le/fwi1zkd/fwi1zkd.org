Fork This Life is like that. Really slow updates, but what's there is satisfying I'd say.

Slime Tensei, although it kinda loses its charm later on.

Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka? is like that. I'm not too far into it, but it's been shaping up to be pretty fun.

Biomass Effects start off like that. It was really good when I read it a while back, but idk if you'd find it as good anymore. Some reviews I read of the latest chapters tell of some serious flaws.

Tree of Aeons is like that, although the MC's thought process changes a lot.
