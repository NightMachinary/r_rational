Ex-Heroes by Peter Clines is pretty good. It's not full-on rational, but it's sensible. (This is the usual tradeoff when trying to recommend more mainstream works that people here would likely enjoy)

The series is unfinished and likely to remain so, if that matters to you, but the books are independent enough that that doesn't really matter.
