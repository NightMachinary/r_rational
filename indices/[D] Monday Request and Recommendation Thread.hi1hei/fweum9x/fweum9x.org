I read [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32411/bens-damn-adventure-the-prince-has-no-pants][Ben's Damn Adventure]] over the weekend and it was fun - it's a system apocalypse story but in the [[/r/hfy]] vein. The basic concept is that humanity "won" a previous iteration of the system, so when we get shoved back in we're in New Game Plus mode.

Relevant to this subreddit, there's some interesting munchkinry of the main character's NGP perk - it's essentially an inventory, but it's a lot more diagetic than most, which leads to some cool interactions and (effectively) abilities.
