its his canon... to him pokeballs are containers, nothing more, nothing less. Earlier in the fan fiction it relates that pokeballs aren't perfect in storage... human minds are very complex that those who are balled are effectively reduced to slightly improved vegetables.

Personally, my "canon" is that pokemon are specialized energy creatures... this way i get around the shrinkification of everything... but i can't get around their transportation of regular items with this object. I just reject the idea of instant transmission for regular items and go with the standard shipping via guy using a truck.
