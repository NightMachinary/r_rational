What happens when you put a human in a Pokeball? The scientist guy reacted with terror, so I'm assuming it's really bad, but is it actually death? Mewtwo is half-human, and so they couldn't put him in a ball without risking 'damaging his mind'; is it that putting sapient beings in Pokeballs drives them insane? Is that why the scientist reacted badly; because he was about to be driven mad by an incomprehensible experience?

Or is that it just inflicts brain damage on sapient beings; completely lethal to humans, and with a very high risk of at least significantly damaging the half-human Mewtwo's mind?
