Oh you tease, that Mewtwo part didn't even have a real Mewtwo! Kids these days and their vr tech, cant even have an old fashioned face-to-face anymore.

"Silver blinks, then hurries back to his seat in front of the secured monitor that's connected directly to the camera in Father's office. The candy can wait." The image of Silver reaching for his oh-so delicious candy only to stop midway the moment his dad has another business meeting made me chuckle more than I would like to admit. On a related note, that's some serious hero worship he has towards his dad. If you're going to stick to Silver's og storyline then what the hell happens that'll turn him into an angsty anti-Gio teen/preteen? Gio would have to screw up pretty royally to get such a large change in his son's opinion of him. On another less related note, I now want to see a Blue/Silver chapter. They'd get along so well.

Thanks again for the awesome chapter! See you in one month for the group reunion at the seasonal slaughterfest.
