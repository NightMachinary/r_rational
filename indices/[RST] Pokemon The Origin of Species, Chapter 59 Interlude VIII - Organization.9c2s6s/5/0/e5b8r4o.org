  If you're going to stick to Silver's og storyline then what the hell happens that'll turn him into an angsty anti-Gio teen/preteen? Gio would have to screw up pretty royally to get such a large change in his son's opinion of him.

There are a number of ways I can see this going, including changing the flavor or severity of how anti-Dad he becomes, but in general there's something to the idea of "the higher the pedestal, the harder the fall."
