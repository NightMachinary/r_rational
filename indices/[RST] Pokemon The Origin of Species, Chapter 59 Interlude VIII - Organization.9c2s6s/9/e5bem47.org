How old is pokeball tech? With Sakura, Giovanni seems to be interested in her methods, and he's talking like it's rare and exceptional to know how to actually manually train a pokemon without brainwash- I mean, "conditioning" them digitally. Are the old ways that old, and have they been stamped out that thouroughly? Or is he specifically interested in tricks that are specific to training kill commands, which official channels might understandably supress? But then, without a pokeball programming a pokemon to think that humans are special, surely any hunting pokemon could do that? Either way, I like interaction with the renegades.

Love the dynamic among Team Magma. But then, I'm biased because Courtney is by far my favorite mook in the entire series. Pity that I don't expect to see much more of them now that they've served their narrative purpose to set up Giovanni's machinations.

I agree that it's neat to see Giovanni's different faces all from the outside. Strangely, even after he kills a person, manipulates crime syndicates, and has his own son expect that he's plotting to kill his friends, I was still surprised when he casually murdered a guy. Given how Giovanni is shown to respect his resources, Dr. Collins must have done something quite foolish indeed. Pure coincidence that the timing of his punishment got some unrelated matter resolved instantly afterwards, I'm sure.
