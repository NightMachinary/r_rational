Sakura's part was breathtaking, I really needed some "Renegades are people, too*

Silver made me fangirl scream. Maxie and Archie blew my mind. I had spent time thinking how to make a story about them make sense. I just resigned to "radical religious background", but if someone can find an alternative, that one is you. I'm dying to know more about your version.

Oh, and about Silver... He looks like an amazing character. So much potential. I dream of what story you could make, with a contrasting Gold with the "actually, those heroes had a point"

And more mew2. That's always great. Thank you for all of this
