If humans are water typed simply because their bodies have a lot of water in them, then most large land dwelling Pokemon would also be water typed.

Humans can swim sure, but they aren't the only non-water type Pokemon that can learn surf. As I see it, Human have a few forms with different typing: normal/psychic, normal/dark, normal/fighting and normal. It sometimes might seem like they have more forms than that but they don't. It just seems that way because their signature move, Sapient Comprehension, basically works like a cross between copycat and Smeargle's sketch move, except that it has REALLY high PP, has a low base accuracy which improves every time it's used after the same enemy move (resetting to base accuracy when used after a different move) and it doesn't disappear after it's been used. And since human's special ability, Memory Palace, let's them know a lot more than just four moves...

They basically have the largest movepool of any Pokemon ever so they can adapt abnormally well to habitats and lifestyles that they aren't naturally equipped for.
