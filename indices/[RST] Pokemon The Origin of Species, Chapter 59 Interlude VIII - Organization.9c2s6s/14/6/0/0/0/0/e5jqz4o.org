Well, saying that there are no trainers alive /or/ able to help suggests that they could be alive without being able to help, or they could be able to help without being alive. The first makes sense, the second doesn't. Since what you need is a trainer who is both alive /and/ able, that's what I'd suggest.

However, if you're saying that there are in fact no living trainers at all, incapacitated or otherwise, then it's not necessary to talk about "able".
