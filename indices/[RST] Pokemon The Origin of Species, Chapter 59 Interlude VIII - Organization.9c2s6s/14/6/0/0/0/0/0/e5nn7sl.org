The second one does make sense, actually, when you assume that the reason for bringing it up is that being "able to help slow it" is what's being scanned for as a separate quality.

"No one alive" is reporting on lack of survivors.

"No one able" is reporting on the lack of help.

They're two separate categories. To me the word "and" is actually the one that makes the "alive" redundant, because obviously if someone is able to help they're alive.
