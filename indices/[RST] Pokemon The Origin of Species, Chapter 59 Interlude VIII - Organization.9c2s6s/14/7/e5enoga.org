"She knows better than to stop a bitchfest this massive before it lets off some steam, and despite what Dr. Collins said, she knows what it's like to be hurting for manpower too." It was Dr Sato who pointed out Cinnabar's special status, I'm not sure what Collins said that would prompt this.

"Apologetic Resoluteness" Sounds like it should be Apologetic Resolution. If it's meant to show Silver's childish side in making up words, it comes with too huge a gap between it and the only other made-up word, "judgey".

I think there was a weird instance of "the [word] the", where the first "the" shouldn't be there, or read weirdly or something, but I can't find it again on mobile. May try a regex when I get to my desktop, and edit this comment.

Thanks for the story!
