That was a masterfully interesting way of showing Giovanni without /showing/ Giovanni.\\
So many different people seeing different sides of him, and we're supposed to try and build ourselves an image through their no doubt biased perspectives.

Though I have to ask two questions: Just how common are Renegades, that there are percentile statistics about how many were killed vs abducted? And how did Giovanni manage to conceive a child, if he's always been this cold and distant?
