  That was a masterfully interesting way of showing Giovanni without showing Giovanni.

Thanks! I was actually going to have a section from his perspective too, but decided fairly early on that I like the idea of a Dark character whose perspective isn't given, and that's where the idea of having a perspective from his personal psychic comes in. Like the reader, they're similarly unable to truly understand what Giovanni is thinking or feeling: just observe his actions.

  Just how common are Renegades, that there are percentile statistics about how many were killed vs abducted?
#+end_quote

In my head, a few dozen or so renegades get branded per year per region. The vast majority of them in most regions are killed.

(How many of them are actually renegades is left as an exercise to the reader)

  And how did Giovanni manage to conceive a child, if he's always been this cold and distant?
#+end_quote

Eh, I work with at-risk kids and families. Cold and distant people having kids is not particularly rare, unfortunately.
