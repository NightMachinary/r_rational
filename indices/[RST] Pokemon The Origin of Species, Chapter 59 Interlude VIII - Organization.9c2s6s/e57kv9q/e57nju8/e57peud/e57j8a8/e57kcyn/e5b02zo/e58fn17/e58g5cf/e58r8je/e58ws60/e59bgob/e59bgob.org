  Personally, my "canon" is that pokemon are specialized energy creatures... this way i get around the shrinkification of everything... but i can't get around their transportation of regular items with this object. I just reject the idea of instant transmission for regular items and go with the standard shipping via guy using a truck.

Same, sort of. I go for the idea that pokeballs only reliably work on organic matter, so really they're only useful for pokemon. Maybe some specialized occupations like a butcher or botanist could use them for more efficient transport, but generally shipping still works like it does in our world.

The whole world of Pokemon kind of suffers if pokeballs are just all-powerful containers. Entire cities in the games like Vermilion, Mistralton, and Slateport are all dependent on their shipping industry.
