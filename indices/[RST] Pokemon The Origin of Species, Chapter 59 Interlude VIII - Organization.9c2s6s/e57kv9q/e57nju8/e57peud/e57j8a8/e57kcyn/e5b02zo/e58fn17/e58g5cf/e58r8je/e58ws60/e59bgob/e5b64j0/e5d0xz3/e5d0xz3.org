Pokeballs actually work on everything: if anything they work MORE reliably on non-organic matter. We know this from the games, where pokeballs in the overworld contain items, and it helps explain how you can carry hundreds of potions and other items in a backpack, without invoking generic RPG bullshit-physics :P
