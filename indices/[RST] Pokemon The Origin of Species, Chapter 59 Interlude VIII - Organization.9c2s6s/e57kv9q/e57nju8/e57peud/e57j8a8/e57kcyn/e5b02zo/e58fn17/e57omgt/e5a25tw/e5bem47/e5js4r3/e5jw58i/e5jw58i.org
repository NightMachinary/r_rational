I share your reading, and I expect that she died. I also share your uncertainty. I would only be a little bit surprised to find out that Giovanni spared her. He's an ambiguous enough character that he might have actually gotten her a relatively normal life in exile, or else he might have found a use for her in one of the cleaner black projects. She might end up teaching actual anti-renegade teams; Giovanni's allowed to play both sides. But, yeah, I expect she's dead.
