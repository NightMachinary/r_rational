Pretty close. Not fatal brain damage, but I believe that it was described as turning an adult into a mental toddler. Normal Pokemon aren't smart enough to be affected by this.

There was also that bit about how Bill has his AI programmed to put him into a ball if he suddenly dies, in the hope that the brain damage is preventable and he can be revived when technology gets better. It's why he doesn't leave his house.
