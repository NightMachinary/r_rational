Yeah you are right about the water tiping. I Aso heard that there are gost type humans but aparently that's just an urban legend .

Sapient Comprehesion is really op , and worse ,in the pokeOutside meta nintendo seems to want to add a buffed version of it in new AI mons this century which will unbalance the game even further . On ubers they already had to ban certain used of sapient comprehension like copying poison type moves .

Though for some reason copying vcreate is still not banned even if there is a game breaking bug that happens If two players use it against each other , that can set the weather to "nuclear winter" for a long time and kill all mons in both teams . :p
