I believe you've mixed up least and most.

At least two people -> just can't be one person at a time, must be two or more. Similarly, I think you intended to be a "cooldown" of 3 days, but it actually says you have to use the power once in every 3 day period, as a minimum.

Anyway the mind control thing is just icing on the cake - you should learn as much as possible about social engineering to do most of your work.
