Less of a monoculture than the USA: 70% of them identify as Christian, so rationalists are less atheist than the US is Christian.

IQ I'm still not entirely sure I believe - a mean of 138 is kind of ridiculous even if it agrees with everything else the SSC/LW surveys have measured as a proxy for it. But I don't think "high IQ" is a culture?

And autism going from ~1% to 4.4% does not a monoculture make by any means...
