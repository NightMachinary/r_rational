The obvious response is that the point of the rationalist community is to learn to evaluate beliefs based on predictions and evidence. Given the important nature of the truth of a religious belief, I would expect any person with a religious belief such as Christianity to attempt to present their evidence where it would either be refuted or be spread around. Since such a event has not happened something must be off. One possible explanation is that religion is even more of a mind killer than politics and thus people agreed not to talk about it, but you would expect that anyone who believed they possessed information about life after death would attempt to present their evidence. This is especially truth about religions where all non-believers either suffer eternal torment, or soul death. This should outweigh any other duties that I can conceive of. So if people in the rationalist community disagree over religious beliefs, then someone must be irrational. However I might be wrong. Please tell me if you spot any flaws in my logic. I would however be interested in seeing any data on the religious makeup of the rationalist community
