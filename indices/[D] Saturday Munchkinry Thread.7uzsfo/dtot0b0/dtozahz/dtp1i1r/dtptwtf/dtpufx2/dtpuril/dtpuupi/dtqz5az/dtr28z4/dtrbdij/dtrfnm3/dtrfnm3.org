I apologize if I implied that religions were inherently irrational. I will give an example of my model of the thought process of a hypothetical rational individual belonging to a religion. I will use Christianity as that is the religion I am most familiar with. Let's take a standard Christian individual who has become perfectly rational. This Christian would look at the bible and pick up the fate of nonbelievers from lines such as Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day (john 6:50-71) They would then logical decide the most important task is to persuade people to believe in God. Similar lines exist in the Quran with "Allaah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any way. Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein forever‚Äù [al-Nisa' 4:168-169] (These are quotes found on the internet from a quick Google search. If they are out of context I apologize and request you explain the context to me.

Such a rational preacher would compile a list of the reasons that persuaded them to believe in their god. They would then present this list to others to attempt to persuade them of the existence of their God. Perhaps they would decide to attempt to convert famous outspoken atheists for the reason that they are instrumental in turning people atheists and be able to spot any flaws in the arguments so they can be fixed and others will not be able to use them against you. Every time a argument is countered, investigate and if the refutation is valid alter the list. Eventually the list will be either flawless , capable of convincing any who honestly consider it or nonexistent and the rational preacher will turn to a different religion or atheism. Such a perfectly rational preacher would likely have contact with the rationalist community and would explain their reasons which would convince any perfectly rational person who hears them which would start a chain reaction.

The flaws in this logic that I have realized after my last comment is that this requires several assumption such as the existence of a perfectly rational member of a religion that fits the characteristics above who thinks preaching is the most sensible use of time instead of say charity who thinks that the making of such a list is the best way of convincing people, and that they talk to the rationalist community who consider the argument that no one can find any flaws in as a compelling one. Especially considering the possibility that the evidence relies on the" My friend is psychic" style of argument. So I have changed my mind from my former position.

But I do wish to clarify that my former position was that rationalists should tend towards the religious position with the most evidence which should be one of them not that it would be definitely atheism. This would also not apply with a position that does not require preaching which I believe is some religions through I do not know any

So in summary I have heard of proselyting but I assumed a rationalist preacher would amend arguments and so either be left with no evidence or be left with evidence that is highly compelling to any rationalist. However other factors are involved.
