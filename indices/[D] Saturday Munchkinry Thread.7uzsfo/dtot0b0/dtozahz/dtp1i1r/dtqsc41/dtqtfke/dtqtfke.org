  do atheists deny the existence of any higher beings? or only the existence of higher beings that were invented by us like the christian god and the like?
#+end_quote

Depends on the atheist and your definition of higher being, I guess. I don't think any atheist I know would deny that there are likely aliens with better technology than ours (and I know /quite a few/ from being highly active in the community from ~2006-2013 and moderately active since---I've been to two "global atheist conventions", organised and spoken at student events including one where celebrities such as Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins were special guests, attended creationist talks, etc).

  or is it that you merely won't accept their possible existence until there's any tangible proof of it?
#+end_quote

Basically, yeah. But I want to be very clear: many christians will jump from this to saying "since you think it's /not impossible/ that an alien in another universe created the earth, then it's totally reasonable to believe that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve#Eden_narrative_(the_Fall)][violence exists because people listened to a talking snake once]]".

Also, the word "higher dimensions" - what do you actually mean by that? My husband's a pure mathematician who is interested in higher dimensional geometry and the word "dimension" as used in science-fiction basically... doesn't have any sort of "real" meaning.

  From your point of view is that hypothetical supercomputer the same as God or an higher being?
#+end_quote

The hypothetical supercomputer didn't come into being [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus][after another supercomputer assembled the parts of her murdered supercomputer husband]], so no.

#+begin_quote
  But is something whose proof of existence we don't posses necessarily not real?
#+end_quote

No, just like the platypus still existed before Western scientists had a stuffed specimen sent to them. But of all the strange beasts imagined in mythology, the platypus was not one of them, and it was the strangest beast that turned out to be real.

But there's a huge difference between "maybe we're in a supercomputer isn't that interesting" and "i can't know everything therefore I am going to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism#Ceremonies_and_customs][name my child with a name starting with the first letter of the first page i open the holy book to]]".

  would these people that can't get past stupid memes and stereotypes be of any use to you
#+end_quote

Maybe we could be of use to them?

Besides, the "no fedoras" sign was to appeal to people like myself: people who are interested in atheism, science, and skepticism but who are afraid of joining a group that is on the "wrong side" of the "we-need-feminism/feminism-is-no-longer-needed" divide. It's signalling where we fall, that we a sense of humour, etc.

It was also to be funny and because passers by the previous year had jeered fedora jokes at us. May as well laugh with them, right?
