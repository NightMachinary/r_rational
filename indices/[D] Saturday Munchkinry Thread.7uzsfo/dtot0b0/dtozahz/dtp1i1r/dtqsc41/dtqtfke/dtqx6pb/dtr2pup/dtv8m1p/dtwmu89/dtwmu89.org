Sure, but it /does/ have the fourth dimension! Flatterland has that but moreso and other crazy geometric planes. Like the one were parallel lines meet and stuff. It was a great read. It's really a popular mathematics book disguised as a story. Actually, I think it's just a popular mathematics book.

Regardless my partner had his mind blown when he read the part about things being 2.376 dimensional (which is a thing. for real.)

Kind of like "Story of Your Life", I guess, for a certain interpretation of it.
