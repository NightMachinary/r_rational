  I always found the concept of a being that is to us what we are to a 2D drawing amusing and more plausible than anything found in the bible.

Yeah, that idea isn't really common in science fiction but is basically the "true" meaning of "other dimensions" - Flatland, which can be found free as it's out of copyright, is the canonical treatment of it in sci-fi. Flatterland is a recent fiction book that teaches complex mathematics that is also about the same sort of thing, using the conceit of being a sequel to Flatland, and I highly recommend that one.

Fun fact: I'm writing a supernatural romance novel and I have used the fourth dimension to explain how transformation can work and also change an object's weight. It made writing the transformation scenes really fun:

/There was a momentary pause as the creature's skin began to change its pattern minutely, as though the skin was a pond that had had stones thrown into it, ripples propagating across it. It made Red's eyes hurt a little to look at, as they kept trying to make minute changes to the way they focused on this strange, vibrating skin./

/The gargoyle's tail began to grow thinner, as did the hands, horns, wings, and arms as the whole creature began shrinking. Soon, the wings were connected to its body by only a thin tendril that looked like it could not support them before that too disappeared into nothingness, leaving the shapeless beige blobs that once were its wings seeming to float in mid-air. The blobs began to grow smaller until they could no longer be seen. The creature stretched its body upwards, finally able to stand straight as it reached a more reasonable eight foot height. It shrunk another foot, and settled there. Its horns had now disappeared entirely, and its ears had migrated from the top of its head down to where one might expect them to be, changing from their previously ovine appearance into a more familiar human shape. Thick black hair had begun to grow out of its skull, quickly settling on a fashionable short style with a prominent side part./

/Indeed, the creature was looking mostly human now, and unclothed and clearly male. Red was tempted to look away, preserve some of its dignity, but he could not avert his eyes. This was like nothing he'd ever seen./

/Finally, a brown belt appeared around his waist, looped onto a piece of black cloth that was scarcely wider than the belt itself. A tie appeared around his neck, similarly attached to a shirt collar, but no shirt. A pair of brown shoes - tied with laces - appeared on his feet./

/The scantily clad man grabbed at his collar, and the rest of the shirt seemed to come into being all of a sudden, rippling momentarily in an unseen breeze. The effect gave Red a slight headache. The tall man performed a similar gesture on his belt, and the pants came into view with much the same effect. Red breathed a sigh of relief; he was glad not to have to find clothing for such a tall man./

  Ah I didn't consider that, you're right, you're absolutely right.

And the fedora sign was very popular the year we did it, so :)
