I wanted to ask, since I have never done much research about it, do atheists deny the existence of any higher beings? or only the existence of higher beings that were invented by us like the christian god and the like?

Do you deny the existence of life that could perhaps be capable of creating universes? what about beings existing in a higher plane or dimension than us? or is it that you merely won't accept their possible existence until there's any tangible proof of it?

What about the theories of life as we know it being merely a simulation inside some kind of supercomputer? From your point of view is that hypothetical supercomputer the same as God or an higher being?

Sorry if these things seem obvious or evident, i'm a bit ignorant when it comes to anything religion related. My brain tells me that you simply don't 'believe' in things blindly and until we don't have proof of something it simply does not exist. But is something whose proof of existence we don't posses necessarily not real? I mean, there's more to the universe than the "light" that reaches us, it's not like the universe stops at the edge of the observable universe... but then again we don't really have much proof of that either.

  It got to the point where we put a "no fedoras" sign on our stalls to stop people making fun of us.

This will sound a bit fallacious (and might come out wrong) but would these people that can't get past stupid memes and stereotypes be of any use to you? I'm not trying to rationalize or comfort you mind you, i'm just merely saying that if someone can't get past a shallow concept like stereotypes, then they might be even less prepared to change their way of thinking and/or their beliefs.
