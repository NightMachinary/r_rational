You cannot see into the future, instead, you taste into the future. Any food you eat can be tasted exactly 5 seconds before it enters your mouth. Food currently in your mouth has no flavor because the flavor is sent back in time.

The future is not predestined, so if you taste spoiled milk while bringing a cup to your face, you can choose not to take a drink and the flavor will go away.

What do you do with this?
