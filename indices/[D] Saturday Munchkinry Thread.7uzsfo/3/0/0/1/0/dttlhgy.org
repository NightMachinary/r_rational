See this is why I should write it , there are consistent scenarios where the self consistent loop that happens like that non cositent universes are destroyed , or just a many world interpretation universe where the inconstant parts of the wavefuncntion cease to exist(though I'm not sure how the mechanics of exploting it would actually work ). But that's a special case of the thing I want to discuss(and Im goign to start writing it now , since i said I was going to do it like a few months ago and i've been procrastinating on it).

The general situation is where you have an optimization process exploring some space , ,get some basic heuristics of when this is dangerous , and aply them to the typical case of reseting the universe until you do something. And anything that looks like this is not going to work for anything complicate(I have a good definition of complicated but I should go towrite the thing istead of talking about it Or I willend upwriting it here) , ever , you would need to solve a lot of technical challenges , and solve a more general version of ai alignment ( I would cal that optimization alignment i guess) which humans are specially bad at thinking about, And I'm thinking on the options where you can set up a automatic system (like if the loop happens when you press a button),if you need to be near the thing , and not have it light years away and the solution must involve your brain , then you are going to be reward hacked and that's it ,whith luck and a good design that wont result in you spontaneously dying . Brute forcing means trying all possible solutions , wich means the more rare the thing you need to find is in the space you are searching , the more likely you find something that fulfills the explicit criteria of making you stop searching, and the space of all posible mesages is not precisely the safest space.

Also I do it for fun mostly, your suggestion ot not working to hard sounds weird here , its not like this thread would exist if it wasn't because of people here liking to overanalice things made for narrative purposes.
