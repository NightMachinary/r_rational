  But lets say that your futre contains a superinteliget ai, future you gets get compromised by it , and sends a message to your past self that sends a message to your past self who sends a message to its past self....

The intelligence would have to exist independently of the power. And the power itself only sends messages back in time five seconds, so unless I've already started a chain, the intelligence can't take advantage of it to send messages back in time. And even if I have, it can only send a message back to whenever I actually started to the process. I think it's safe to say that I'm safe from an AI trying taking control of me through this particular precognition ability.

  also an infinite number of timelines whith the correct answer is not stable something will happen to you at some point(quantum randomness still happens I assume, otherwise the universe would look measurably different)

I'm skeptical about this. If that were the case, you'd say that no use of the power yields a stable outcome.

Then again, maybe I'm just fatally misunderstanding the nature of the power. Perhaps it's like this: I go to drink milk, but realize it's spoiled, so I drink cool-aid instead. But since it was less than five seconds from the time I experienced the taste of spoiled milk and the time I gulped down the cool-aid, I never experience the taste of cool-aid. If that's how it works, then I'm back to the drawing board.
