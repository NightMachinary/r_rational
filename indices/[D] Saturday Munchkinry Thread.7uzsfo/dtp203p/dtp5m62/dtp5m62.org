Here's the least-efficient plan, so people can think of smarter ones.

I put a sizeable bounty on the boar's head. The boar is capable of outrunning and outfighting individuals, but eventually it's going to collapse from exhaustion. Plus, I can use the local peasantry for the plan, which is likely cheaper than hiring hunters.
