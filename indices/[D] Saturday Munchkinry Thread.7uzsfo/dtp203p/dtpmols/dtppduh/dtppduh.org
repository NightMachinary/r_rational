The short answer is yes. The technology is medieval probably at this point though I haven't really worked it out

The long answer is that this is from a world where magic doesn't exist yet. Essentially beings exist called the Old Gods and they will make deals with humans. However they always have a catch. This is between the first and second deal with humanity. The First Deal was for shepherds to look after them. The Old Gods manifested aspects into reality creating both the younger gods and the monsters. The Second Deal was for the power to defend themselves. This was granted in the form the ability to manipulate the aspects of reality through magic. With less threat to unite them they began to make war on one another. The Third Deal was for a life after death. This created the Heavens and Hells. People think they managed this one with no cost. Nope. Note that smaller groups can make deals of their own. For instance the protagonists family has made three deals with the Old Gods each aiding them and hurting them. In addition the story kicks off with the protagonist making a deal and the effects of that deal
