Set up some crazy Rube Goldberg-style trap that relies on continued and improbable action from the boar - something that relies on the boar navigating a maze, then solving a puzzle, some chain of events that nobody in their right mind would expect the boar to complete. Then (being sure to keep everyone aware of the plan outside a 0.5km radius) hire a hunter who isn't aware of the boar's magical properties and tell him that he's there to note if any wild animals complete the challenge successfully. Keep him there until the boar, being maximally contrary, completes the challenge and is trapped.

You probably have the time to build this trap within a 0.5km radius of the boar, so build it somewhere else then, again, give a solitary hunter reason to believe that he can keep the hunter away from the maze. Evict everyone else from a 0.5km radius. Let the boar do its thing.

Alternate solution: Depending on how suggestible the boar is, hypnosis might be useful?
