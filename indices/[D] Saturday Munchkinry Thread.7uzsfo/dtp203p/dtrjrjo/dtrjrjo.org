What i would do is to make a bet with some people, so I'll say that i can make a bear walk into a cage on its own, and I'll bet some money, the other people who bet i cant do that, I'll bring them to within range of Bear, where their belief that the bear will not (should not, please don't) walk into the cage, lo and behold, the bear walks into the cage. Note that the people should bet money on the Bear not walking onto the cage, and as it does that, they'll reinforce the Bear as they wish that it not walk into the cage.
