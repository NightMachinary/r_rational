The first one seems like it would need a supply of very specific drugs through it might be doable. The second one however strikes me as a unworkable plan. If you command a person to stop being sad, it doesn't work. They may stop acting sad but if you wish to prevent the emotion itself then this is not a viable strategy.Any sensible UFAI would understand the emotions they are trying to manipulate and would know this wouldn't work.
