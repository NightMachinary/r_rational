On the one hand, there's no stealth in space. On the other hand, every few months NASA announces they discovered a new dino-killer class asteroid just as it whipped by closer than the moon.

A fission fragment rocket would be able to do the launch, but you won't just be obviously doing a bunch of work with plasma and magnets, but also obviously doing a bunch of work with fissionables, which is one of those things that draws international attention real quick.

Unfortunately, running a fission fragment rocket in someone's atmosphere is pretty fucking threatening. And electric arcjet rockets sacrifice TWR for their high Isp.
