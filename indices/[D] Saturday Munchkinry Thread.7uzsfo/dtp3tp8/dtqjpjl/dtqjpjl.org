There is no stealth in space is the main problem, with the secondary problem being that your extractee is squishy and easy to shoot. So.. Sending a lander that can take off is just going to be way too obvious, which makes rendevous dangerous. Uhm. Okay, lets keep it simple: We drop something valuable. A /small/ lander will not trip the meteor warning systems the way a full spacecraft would.

A high-quality fake painting, 70 kilos of gold. Whatever seems best for not being obviously "cash transfer from the sky". Also in care package: High-grade Fissiles. Now we build a /fission/ torch ship.

Using a fission fragment reactor to heat reaction mass will let you build a high-thrust engine with ridiculus isp. It does not even have to expel the fragments - you can convert the output of the reactor to (a gigawatt of) electricity and use an electric arc to heat reaction mass to ten-thousand kelvin with no radioactive release to the environment. This is a single-stage to earth-escape velocity design, and the best part is? Noone will flag most of the stuff you are buying as rocket parts. You are obviously doing a bunch of work with plasma and magnets, but that should not raise flags
