I was referring to how the US failed to develop a BLEO capability with the Ares system within W's presidency, then failed again to develop BLEO capability with the SLS within Obama's presidency, and now NASA is being retasked yet again. It takes a lot of time to develop new launch systems. More, if you're going to trust human lives to them. The first public mention of Falcon Heavy was in 2004.

I never specified a timeframe except the implicit human lifetime, but a decade and a half seems a bit much.
