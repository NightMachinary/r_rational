How would you extract a human from a hostile earth?

You: in the asteroid belt with plenty of mass, energy, and manufacturing capability, but no fusion torches. No new physics.

A human: about 60 kilos of meat and gristle. Usual problems with acceleration, temperature, and pressure. Location/identity known to you but not hostile groundhogs.

A hostile earth: 1g surface acceleration, couple hundred klicks of atmosphere, modern tech. Locals wish to shoot you, but can't strike past LEO. They will settle for shooting your human if they identify them.

Hard mode: no threatening the civilian population.
