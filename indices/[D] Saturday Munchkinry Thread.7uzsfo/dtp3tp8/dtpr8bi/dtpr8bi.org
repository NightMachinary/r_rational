What do you mean with "plenty"? Can I build a few hundred thousand modules capable of landing, taking on board one passenger and returning to the asteroid belt (possibly refueling both on ground and in orbit from yet more modules)? I.e. a bit like a one-man version of Elon Musk's BFR, with off-road landing gear.

And then send them all at the same time, essentially saturating Earth's defenses (bundled up in a black-painted radar-deflecting stealth shell for the approach to make it extremely unlikely to be detected until days or weeks before landfall).

The landers would carefully spread out across Earth or at least the continent to avoid identifying "my" human, and to make sure that all the known defenses are busy shooting down nonessential pods. They would all land and take off, just like the one carrying "my" human. There are no weapons, just flares, radar jamming, etc on the pods. The only damage to Earth is the wrecks shot down, and possibly brush fires started where pods land, although dry areas will be avoided when possible.

Once the human is secured in orbit, the remaining pods would return with it, acting as decoys (or shields) to prevent any rapidly developed or unknown weapons from reaching the human.
