I know you meant it as a joke, but I think this stereotype is harmful to the rational community. Sure, some of us are proverbial neckbeards living in our proverbial parents' basement, but most of us are normal, well-adjusted adults.

An example of the sort of damage that the stereotype does: I used to be extremely active in the atheist community and towards the end of my high activity (~2013) we started to really struggle to get women especially but people in general interested because the neckbeard / fedora / anti-feminist stereotype became so entrenched. And we were a campus atheist club that had a leadership panel full of dyed in the wool feminist SJWs. It got to the point where we put a "no fedoras" sign on our stalls to stop people making fun of us.
