  Yeah, that idea isn't really common in science fiction but is basically the "true" meaning of "other dimensions" - Flatland, which can be found free as it's out of copyright, is the canonical treatment of it in sci-fi.

Remembering, of course, that Flatland is social satire.

As I understand the topic, beings that exist in more physical dimensions may be more geometrically complex, but essentially the same as us. More physical dimensions to operate in may allow for faster computations, but not really different. They would still ponder the unknowable questions of life.

As colloquially used, the idea of beings that exist in a higher dimension is about beings that transcend the essential limitations: thought, time, space, etc. And this interpretation isn't necessarily distinct from the geometric meaning of dimensionality: What if instead of existing in 3 dimensions like us, they exist in 3 dimensions /and also 2 temporal dimensions/?

The problem, from out perspective, is that this plays merry hell with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation][fundamental]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation][PDEs]] of physics.
