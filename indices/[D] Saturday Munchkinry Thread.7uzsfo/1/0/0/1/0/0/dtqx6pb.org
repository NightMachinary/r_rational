Ah I see, thank you for clearing my doubts. When put in that way your point of view sounds logical and very reasonable. I had to ask because I have plenty of atheist friends and acquaintances yet atheism often seems to have a different meaning to different people. Which I guess by itself isn't all that surprising since that's how people are, but as someone who isn't that well versed on both theism/atheism it can be a bit... overwhelming.

  Also, the word "higher dimensions" - what do you actually mean by that? My husband's a pure mathematician who is interested in higher dimensional geometry and the word "dimension" as used in science-fiction basically... doesn't have any sort of "real" meaning.

That's merely blabbing from my part. I always found the concept of a being that is to us what we are to a 2D drawing amusing and more plausible than anything found in the bible. Similar to life as a simulation, if our reality inside this simulation is to the being running the simulation what a movie or a videogame (or our own simulations of the universe and its rules) are to us. That's what I refer to as a higher plane or "dimension", a place with a superior level of reality where we are merely encapsulated. I know this concept probably has another name (that unfortunately I currently am ignorant of) but when explaining it to other people the word dimension seems to be the most easily understood.

  Besides, the "no fedoras" sign was to appeal to people like myself: people who are interested in atheism, science, and skepticism but who are afraid of joining a group that is on the "wrong side" of the "we-need-feminism/feminism-is-no-longer-needed" divide. It's signalling where we fall, that we a sense of humour, etc. It was also to be funny and because passers by the previous year had jeered fedora jokes at us. May as well laugh with them, right?

Ah I didn't consider that, you're right, you're absolutely right.
