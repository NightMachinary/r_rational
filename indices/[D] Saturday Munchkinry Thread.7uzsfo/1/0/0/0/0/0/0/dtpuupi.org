My experience in the general rationalist sort of community has been as much. Some weirdos but no more than I encountered in say, Roller Derby. A subreddit-wide survey would be interesting but the slatestarcodex and lesswrong surveys are also pretty good sources. The aggregate data of those seems to indicate that the average person is an adult and reasonably well-adjusted, FWIW. "Normal" in the context I used it here meant, basically, "not an autistic neckbeard stereotype" rather than "completely average in every way".

Yeah, the rational community is more intelligent and atheist and maybe more autistic than average but we're not... like, even 10% of the way to being aliens trying to understand the human emotion called love.
