What am I digging exactly? I'm reporting my observed facts based on time spend in the community / results of community surveys like this one:

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/17/ssc-survey-2017-results/]]

55% of respondents are "atheist but not spiritual", compared with 10-20% in the general US population.

The mean IQ is 138 - which is two+ standard deviations above the mean. I'd disbelieve it as self-report but /apparently/ it cross-references with the reported SAT/etc scores.

As far as autism goes - formal autism diagnosis was reported in 4.4% of readers but according to the Australian bureau of statistics, its prevalence in Australia is 0.7% .
