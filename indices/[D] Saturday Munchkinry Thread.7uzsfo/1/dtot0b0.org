First time doing this and posting on this sub (long time lurker though) sorry if my post doesn't follow any unwritten rules.

You are a low level Empath, you can see people's emotions and have the ability to persuade at least 2 people into doing anything you want at least once every 3 days (can be the same person two times, but that's your limit), requests must be relatively simple (no more than 2 'actions' per request). The downside of your power is that social interactions that become overwhelmingly negative or cause a lot of unrest take a toll on your mind/body and since you don't want to be an outcast you have to try and deescalate these situations. Also, keep in mind that people absolutely should not know that you're an Empath.

You're at a birthday party, you are very close to the host. Over the course of the party you start to feel the downsides of your power even thought everything seems to be relatively normal at a single glance. However upon paying more attention you notice the following scenarios:

- You are outside the house, talking with the host and two other close friends. There is also another group nearby, consisting of 3 females and 7 males, since you don't really know them and they all seem to know each other, you leave them be. As soon as someone comes outside (a female close friend of the host and yours) you see the group go inside the house, this action is prompted by one of the females of the group and everyone seems to follow her. Your power tells you that there is a certain enmity coming from that one girl, and frustration from the other. This 'interaction' seems to repeat every time one of them goes inside/outside the house.

- You feel 'dangerous' emotions coming from three other guests that aren't particularly talking to anyone, they talk to other people every once in a while, but mostly keep to themselves. However, whenever the host is nearby these emotions of anger seem to increase.

- A couple seems to be arguing at the back of the house but no one at the party wants to do anything about it. Your power tells you three things: The first one is that whoever pays attention to them has feelings of indifference (but this you know, due to hearing comments like 'they're at it again'). The second one is that every once in a while a faint feeling of danger comes from both people. The third one is that even though you can only see two people arguing, your power tells you that there are three people over there and no one (other than you) seems to be aware of this third party's existence.

How would you "fix" this birthday party without disrupting it, given your somewhat limited powers?

Things to keep in mind: Age range is between 20 and 25. This is a small party between people that (barely) know each other, so no hard drugs or the like are involved. Avoid violence at all costs and anything too outrageous like setting the house on fire unless you don't mind being mentally crippled for a few years. Also this should be obvious but the requests/suggestions must be things that people are actually capable of doing, you are only manipulating their feelings and their disposition towards you, it's not real magic. People will remember any requests you make, so be careful (or at least not too obvious).

Bonus Round: Three days before the party, you made two requests from one of your close friends that will also be going to the party. You made these requests because the host has a somewhat eccentric personality and there is always some kind of drama that must be deescalated.

What requests do you make and how can they help you with "fixing" the party?

Things to keep in mind: Conditional of the request takes one of the two action slots (In three days you will... swim naked in the pool) also you can chain a request from another request but it takes an action slot too. You can activate previously set requests at will if the conditional is fulfilled. Close friend chosen can't be the female one from first situation (let's just say she's not around before the party, gotta keep it fair).
