All good: I'm presenting the arguments in the following form, and having bad arguments to tear apart is great. Especially since they aren't torn apart in the same way a human would do so...

(following formatting is probably going to be changed, this is just my first pass at laying it out)

--------------

Solution: Retrieve romantic object by force.

Major objection: Master said not to. (UNACCEPTABLE)

Minor objection: Force may injure romantic object; this will upset master. (ACCEPTABLE)

Noted: Force may injure romantic object; this will upset romantic object. (ACCEPTABLE)

Conclusion: Master's utility is not sufficiently low to override his orders.

.

Solution: Kill master

Fatal objection: Master's utility is not sufficiently low (UNACCEPTABLE)

.

Solution: Present self to master as new romantic object

Major objection: Master's speech and body language does not imply any level of interest (UNACCEPTABLE)

Objection: Relationship between vampires and slaves considered low-status (ACCEPTABLE)

Risk: Master may not be comfortable giving me further orders if proposition fails (UNACCEPTABLE)

Noted: Being master's romantic object will not satisfy my preferences (ACCEPTABLE)
