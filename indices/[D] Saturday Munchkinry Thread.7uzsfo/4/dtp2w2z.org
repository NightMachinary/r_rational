Brainstorming thread:

I'm coming up with a list of ways that a character can solve a problem that comes up in the supernatural romance novel I'm writing. Would love to crownbrain it. The problem-solver (PS) is effectively an UFAI who only cares about solving the problem.

Situation: a couple (V and H) has broken up, and H has moved very far away. V is sad because they miss H. V is a vampire; H is a human.

Problem: You don't want V to be sad; specifically about this, but also in general.

There are a lot more details about what powers PS has (super strength and flight are the most relevant probably), and what V values exactly, and what PS has available to him, etc. (I suppose I should mention it is 1945 though).

I'd encourage people not to get too detailed in their responses since I want one sentence, max, for each.

I'd appreciate deliberately bad solutions that would be pruned from PS's decision tree.

Some of my solutions:

- Kidnap H and bring him back to V

- Kill V

- Find a new H for V to fall in love with

- PS gets into a romantic relationship with V

- Forge letters between H and V

- Distract V with something else

- Kidnap H's family to force H to get back with V

- Kill H in an "accident", show V the body
