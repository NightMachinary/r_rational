Wait , i hadnt considered the details of you case in particular, I'll have to think about it better, it doen't map to a nice repeat timeline until I do x kind of loop .

Of course you can use this for simple things , like choosing between some options , but that's exploring small spaces , exploring any big space is a problem. Right now I'm a bit sleepy and can't think clearly about the mechanics of your loop . The thing I't also that you receiving different messages isn't the only thing that changed here , quantum randomness still happens , which can be a problem. Also you are going to get immediately compromised by a future ai/civilization passing messages down the line. And if I'm not mistaken most versions of you won't get the correct answer right? I'm not sure on how your setup actually works So can you explain what you think that happens timeline wise whith a example , now I'm really interested . And like what happens once the message gets complete ? Maybe I should go to sleep and read it again after and it will make more sense.
