  Maybe I should go to sleep and read it again after and it will make more sense.

I'm not sure it makes sense to me, honestly. I could easily have made a mistake in the setup. However, while I'm not sure I've stumbled onto a correct solution, I do know that one exists.

The key point is that I'm attempting a tree-branching search of the solution space. Despite what [[/u/Gurkenglas][u/Gurkenglas]] says, this is meant to be exponential, not linear. Every time we could receive a signal from the future (every five seconds), we can branch the timeline: maybe into two, maybe three or more; it will depend on how many different signals we could receive.

The second point is that the nodes on the tree are ordered. And in this sense, [[/u/Gurkenglas][u/Gurkenglas]] is correct: we're doing a linear search of the endpoints, to find the first solution that works, after which we halt and don't search the remaining nodes.

  Also you are going to get immediately compromised by a future ai/civilization passing messages down the line.

No, I'm controlling which timelines get created. I'm not searching an infinite set of consistent timelines, I'm creating a finite set of different timelines.

#+begin_quote
  And if I'm not mistaken most versions of you won't get the correct answer right?
#+end_quote

I think what happens is that there is a large, but finite, number of timelines where I get the wrong answer, and an infinite number of timelines where I get the correct answer. I think.
