But lets say that your futre contains a superinteliget ai, future you gets get compromised by it , and sends a message to your past self that sends a message to your past self who sends a message to its past self..... .This is not only for you setup I think its for the power in general . also an infinite number of timelines whith the correct answer is not stable something will happen to you at some point(quantum randomness still happens I assume, otherwise the universe would look measurably different) so Im not so sure about your setup actually producing that resutl. Apart from that you cant brte fornce everyithing ,only problems that are easy enough that quantum randomness causing something to send a message that actually finishes the loop(by making you start sending a message that makes you stop trying and send the same message) .

Te universe is randomly exploring the space of quantum configuration(well actually certain things are more probable than other but you know what I mean) while you do your tree search ,and also i'm not sure of how dangerous your tree search is (certainly less than the universe) , depends on what you are exploring ,but humans are bad at imagining the bad parts of the solution space of complex things ( or at least the bad parts a human wouldn't choose ) which is why people are bat at thinking about evolution without training or about software , so if you actually had to implement this I would be extremely paranoid about it . Also I like discussing things too munch , and I need to go to sleep , so i'm turning off my computer before its too late.
