I wouldn't work too hard on that rant if I were you. Anything concerning time-travel and time loops is absurd, by it's nature. The rules only exist for narrative purposes. If you want to develop rules for a proposed story, the Worldbuilding Thread is over there, somewhere.

In a single consistent timeline system, any message received from the future must eventually be sent back. In such a system, I'd agree that I'm optimizing for the wrong thing. Maybe instead of tasting one of the pre-determined signals, I'd taste blood, be so surprised that I bite my tongue and start bleeding. What's that signal supposed to mean?

But the proposed system is for a multiple time-line scenario. I'm not optimizing for self-consistency: I'm actually brute-forcing a search by branching the timelines until I find the solution.

I admit that I'm making an assumption that wasn't specifically stated: I assume that every time I put something on my tongue, it sends the taste back five seconds, thereby branching the timeline. I'm not sure that's how it's actually meant to work, but it's my best guess.
