One question I have for you. If I put food in my mouth and have it in a container which I could break harmlessly with my teeth could I extend the future predictions for as long as I keep it in my mouth?

One somewhat useful ability is that you can detect any poison with a taste, which makes it slightly harder to poison you.

A second option would be to have a container in your month that would break if you are attacked. Then you have a few seconds warning

The issue with this is that while you could carry around a number of essences with notably different tastes to make a language, you can only send information 5 seconds back in time. The best option I can see is find some gambling that pays out in five seconds with quick betting, have something noticeable to eat that has a distinctive taste and precommit to swig if you win. Its better if a taste means bet because if no taste means go you might get a false positive if something stops you drinking. Try disguising it as drinking a glass of alcohol in celebration
