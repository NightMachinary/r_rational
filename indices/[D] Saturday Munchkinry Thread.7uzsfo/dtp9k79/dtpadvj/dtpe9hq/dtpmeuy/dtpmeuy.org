Doesn't this let you do classic message-passing? Setting up the previously described mouth-capsule set-up, and the committing to popping the appropriate capsule or capsules as soon as you taste the corresponding flavor or combination of flavors? I'm reasonably certain that the taste-notice-bite-taste loop can take less than 5 seconds, so you should be able to gain time each loop, and thus send simplistic messages more than five seconds into the past?
