Can't? Hardly. The infrastructure might not exist, but that's hardly a limitation. The motivation doesn't exist; change that, and we could rebuild the infrastructure faster than you think.

I mean, it's not like calling a cab and saying "Take me to the moon, and step on it. How much am I gonna owe you?" That isn't to say it's impossible. The technology exists, the industrial infrastructure exists. Building the launch systems is the easy part. Expensive, but relatively easy.
