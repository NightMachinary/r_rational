Instead of relying on government space programs, we'll start up a privatized space program.

1. Create a corporation and gather funds. This front will need to be a legitimate business.

2. Develop a division to work on space technology. Start by building rockets to deliver payloads into LEO.

3. Propose a manned mission that goes beyond LEO. A lunar landing, or an asteroid capture. Fund the mission privately, and have it manned by the target human.

4. Pick up the target from beyond LEO.
