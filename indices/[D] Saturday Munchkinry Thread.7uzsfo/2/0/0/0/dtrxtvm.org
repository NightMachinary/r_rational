I was more thinking of landing first and second stage, refuelling from a few other landed stages and climbing into orbit like current rockets do (with a payload of 100kg instead of several tons).

Then refuel again in orbit (or switch to a different vehicle) and push for the belt.

I do a slow transfer orbit (in the stealthed shell) to Earth, keeping delta v manageable, and burn more aggressively when leaving.
