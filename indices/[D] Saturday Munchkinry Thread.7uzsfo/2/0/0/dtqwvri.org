  Can I build a few hundred thousand modules capable of landing, taking on board one passenger and returning to the asteroid belt (possibly refueling both on ground and in orbit from yet more modules)? I.e. a bit like a one-man version of Elon Musk's BFR, with off-road landing gear.

You can build all the modules you want, but remember that a chemical rocket that can even make orbit from Earth needs to be a thing the size of a skyscraper with the mass fraction of a soda can, at the point of leaving the surface. The BFR plan works for Mars because Mars is much smaller, needing less than half the dV you would on Earth to get to orbit. Aerobraking and soft landing something the size of an orbital rocket from a flyby trajectory would be extremely exciting.
