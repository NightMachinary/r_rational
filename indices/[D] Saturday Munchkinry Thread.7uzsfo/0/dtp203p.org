You are a team of hunters sent by the King to attempt to capture a powerful magical creature.

The Contrary Boar. The CB is in most respects a ordinary boar, which is dangerous enough on its own, but what sets the CB apart is its magical ability. The creature will use sympathic magic to forge a link with the mental model of itself in the heads of any creature within half a kilometre. It will then proceed to do something unexpected. This means for instance that if you attempt to ambush it will not walk into the trap, you shoot arrows at it it will dodge. If all options are covered by people within its range, then it will take the option that is most inconvenient for your plan. The boar is capable of both outrunning a person and outfighting most as well, unless you are prepared for that scenario.

Unfortunately, the forest elves who live in the area are willing to let you hunt the CB but you must ensure that any trap will not hurt other wild animals and they would prefer you do this by monitoring it.

The abilities of the boar are not well known, and you can hire other hunters to carry out any plan you conceive. So, how do you capture the boar
