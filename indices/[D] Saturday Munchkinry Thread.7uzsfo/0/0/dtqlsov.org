Obvious: Its a boar. Leave tranquilizer laced truffles or other pig favored food in wicker baskets. Wicker wont stop a boar, but it will stop most other animals (and if a bear eats your trap, it wont kill the bear) Leave the area.

Now there is noone there for the boar to be contrary at - baskets dont think. So it will eat one. Walk back in, check baskets, haul sleeping boar out. To guard against the boar being extra clever, dont tell the basket droppers why they are dropping baskets.
