I think it's then even easier, although it still depends on "more energy out than in".

Open the hole on the ceiling (things inside the hole now fall out of the top). Move the hole onto the floor (things outside the hole can fall into the hole). Drop something into the hole; it'll fall in and then back out.

This allows power generation, but is not yet a perpetual motion machine. You need to move the hole up and down out of phase with the falling object. This causes the object to enter (and then exit) the hole with more momentum (relative to the opening), and to gain a "free" potential energy boost by leaving the hole at a higher real-world height than it enters.

Now you have a resonator and a way to add energy to it. The question is then just wether the cost of moving the hole in this fashion is less than the energy added to the resonation; if so, perpetual motion.
