I'm trying to visualize this and failing, so I'm not sure if the following is relevant:

The gravity only changes when the Hole is first opened; after that it's just a pit in the ground / hole in the wall like any other pit / hole. The gravity won't realign just because the waterwheel turns. You would need to open and then close the Hole again to make that happen.
