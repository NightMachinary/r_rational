  The gravity inside the Hole aligns itself to the outside world when the entrance opens.

First obvious use is power generation.

Place the hole on a large vertical gear. Place an enclosed waterwheel with some water inside the hole, with the axle coming out of the hole, and hook it up to the gear such that when the water turns the axle one way the hole's gravity goes the other way.

As long as much more energy comes from the water falling than is required to turn the gear and make up for losses, you've got yourself an infinite energy source.
