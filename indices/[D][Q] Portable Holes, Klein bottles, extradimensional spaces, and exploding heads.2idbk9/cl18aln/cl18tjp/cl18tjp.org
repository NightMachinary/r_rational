  Can you break the inside of the Hole?
#+end_quote

Nope. It is a self contained universe, and as such is utterly unaffected by kinetic energy.

#+begin_quote
  Is the diameter of the opening 6'?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Can you carry something like a hot air balloon which is incredibly light?
#+end_quote

You mean can you put that in the Hole? Yes, although it would need to be a small balloon in order to fit. Well, you could have it poke out the top but then you couldn't close the Hole and it would effectively just be an indestructible pit in the ground.

#+begin_quote
  Is so, with an appropriately made conveyance such that you could teleport into holes with it and have it poke out of the top, you could sell instantaneous travel.
#+end_quote

How so? I'm not following.

#+begin_quote
  It could make you an awesome bodyguard though, if the hole was in a safe place and you could easily carry your charge.
#+end_quote

Absolutely.

  There are the obvious things about winning the Randi prize, international fame, etc.
#+end_quote

Heh, yeah.
