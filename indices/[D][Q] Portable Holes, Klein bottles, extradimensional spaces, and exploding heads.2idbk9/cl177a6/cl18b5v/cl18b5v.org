Undefined. I could see the following options:

- The Hole is now inaccessible (can't be reopened from inside or out)
- That when you open it it will open on the nearest flat surface. (And yes, that would imply instantaneous movement.)\\
- That it will create a copy of the surface it was on. (This one makes the least sense in my mind but this is all just a thought experiment.)

Choose which one you like, or try scenarios for all of them.
