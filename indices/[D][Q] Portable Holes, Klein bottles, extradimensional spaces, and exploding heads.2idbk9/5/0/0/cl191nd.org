ie. You get a (very large) hot air balloon and fill it with people. Or a blimp or whatever. You can then carry the balloon because it is light because of the upwards force of the hot air. The Hole is left as a pit in the ground far away. You teleport, holding the balloon, and appear in the pit with the balloon above you and out of the hole, teleporting large numbers of people at once

EDIT: Also, what happens if something is sticking out of the hole when it ceases to be flat?
