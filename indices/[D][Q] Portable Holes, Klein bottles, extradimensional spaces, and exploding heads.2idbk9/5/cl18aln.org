Can you break the inside of the Hole? It could make an awesome shield against something. Although, it would only be able to cover a flat 6' circle. Plus, it would make a pretty good weapon if you could detonate a nuclear weapon inside and then open it. It would probably kill you in the process though, which is a slight drawback.

Is the diameter of the opening 6'? Or is the opening small and that is the diameter of the hole?

Can you carry something like a hot air balloon which is incredibly light? Is so, with an appropriately made conveyance such that you could teleport into holes with it and have it poke out of the top, you could sell instantaneous travel. Of course, that has the drawback of needing to travel to the people you are transporting. It could make you an awesome bodyguard though, if the hole was in a safe place and you could easily carry your charge.

There are the obvious things about winning the Randi prize, international fame, etc.
