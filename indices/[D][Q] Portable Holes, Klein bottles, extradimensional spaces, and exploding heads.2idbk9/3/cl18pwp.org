Launch mechanism:

Hole gravity goes out the top. Place object-to-be-launched inside hole, held in place by pins just outside the hole. When the pins are released, the object will fall real-world-up, out of the hole.

Place hole on linear accelerator. When hole is at the appropriate position in the linear accelerator, release the pins. Object falls out of the hole and is now traveling at the speed of the hole plus the speed from falling 10 feet*. Stop the hole.

Cheaper / easier / more reusable then hiding launch mass inside the hole and simply using a rocket.

- For vertical launches, this is actually a slight loss, not a gain, due to air resistance, and so you need to give the object a little extra push to clear the hole's horizon.
