What are the properties of the extra dimensional space itself? Are the walls absolutely indestructible? When you punch a wall is the kinetic energy precisely reflected, and if not where does that energy go? If I set off a nuke in a closed hole what happens? Seems like if you were willing to sacrifice people you could teleport in an arbitrary amount of matter to make a portable black hole. A spell that lets you teleport other stuff but not yourself in would help here.

Is the cloth still as vulnerable as normal cloth when it's in portal form? If so then the moment you open it the cloth will be obliterated, but by that time a massive gravitational wave has escaped anyway, so it's still a massive one use bomb.

If you could find a way to ensure the fabric survives you could also just use it as containment for your fusion reactor.
