If i have a hole on a plate on a stick, what happens to the matter inside when i swing it around? Will the stick be harder to move if the hole has 10 tons of bricks in it than if it had just air?

This is relevant because if you rotate the near side of the hole at 3*10^{7} rpm, the far side would be moving at relativistic speeds.

  Re: the magnet -- you're visualizing opening / closing the Hole quickly in order to generate AC in a wire over the Hole?

I has thinking you could use it to generate potential energy by lifting a chunk of metal, but AC could work too.
