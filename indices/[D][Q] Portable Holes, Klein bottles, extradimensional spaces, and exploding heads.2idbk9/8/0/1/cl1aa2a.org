OK, So primary usages are invincible storage. All the not insignificant storage issues we have ever had are solved by these holes. This includes atmospheric leakage, ultrahot plasma, fictional alien blood...

Surviving in one would have the same requirements as surviving in space, minus atmospheric leakage issues and with the benefit of free artificial gravity. and no inertia. So you can launch a ship with your hole in it but remove the hole from the inside for the duration of the trip.

of course this is irrelevant when you have a teleport spell. Just send the hole off on a spaceship and teleport to it later.

both of these are risky though since you can't be sure where the ship ends up.

There are a number of possible uses that depend upon how the hole reacts to inertia as it is moves through the parent universe (our universe) when open. If the contents don't react, you can also use the hole as an inertial dampener even when open, If they do, you can theoretically get the sides of the hole to push around the contents at FTL speeds. (by the classic counterpoint to relativity of having a pole revolving whose halfway point is already moving at lightspeed... except this time it would work... and also actually succeed in disproving relativity)

(Since the hole is effectively its own universe, I'm guessing it works the first way)

Inertial dampening really only gets us as much free power as the water tricks already discussed as far as I can tell...

Perhaps filling the hole with a massive magnet would be a more efficient way to get power.
