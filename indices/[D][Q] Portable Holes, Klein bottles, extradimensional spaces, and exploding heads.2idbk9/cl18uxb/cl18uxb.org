Energy storage:

Gravity-top hole. Vacuum chamber. Place heavy magnetized disk at surface of hole; disk will stabilize half in, half out. Magnetically accelerate the rotation of the disk.

Zero moving parts, zero friction. Downside: Requires incredible precision and/or disk position/orientation control mechanisms. Also not sure if this is better enough than magnetic bearings.

Fake Edit: Actually, have a 20 foot cylinder.
