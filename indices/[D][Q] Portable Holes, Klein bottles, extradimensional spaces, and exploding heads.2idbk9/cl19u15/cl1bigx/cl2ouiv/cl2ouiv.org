I've realised you seem to intend for us to have only one portable hole. In that case, abuse the hell out of the teleport spell. Actually, how does that work? I can teleport into the hole from anywhere, fine. But can I teleport anywhere from the hole, or just to my previous location?

Send light rocket to LEO, with a payload of the hole. Auto deploy. Pop mini space station out. Teleport back and forth, bringing components for building a station up there. (I assume you can't teleport with a 10' x 6' module, but you could bring trusses, wall sections, fuel, solar panels, electronics, etc and bolt them all together). Come to think of it, a single launch could deploy arbitrary amounts of satellites. New communication satellite constellations, dozens of new GPS/glonass/Darwin satellites, etc...

When you have your station set up to not need any more support for, let's say a decade (of you have people on board, bring some re-entry vehicles up), teleport in a rocket which can bring the hole to a higher orbit. Rinse. Repeat. Send it to the moon. Build a base. Send it to Mars. You can use a fast transfer because you don't have any fuel concerns - you get arbitrary amounts of fuel out of the earth's gravity for free, and your payload is almost weightless.

You can deploy sensing and communication satellites/probes pretty much anywhere you want for very little cost. It would be a new era for astronomy.

Oh, smuggling!
