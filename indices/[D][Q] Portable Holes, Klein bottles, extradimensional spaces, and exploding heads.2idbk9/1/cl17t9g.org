If the mass of anything inside the hole is disconnected from the universe outside when the hole is closed, it should be possible to use the hole to both generate power and also as an inertial drive.

Inertial drive: You have a large, powerful, piston capable of rapid movement. Steam train stuff. On one end, you bolt it to whatever you want moved. On the other end, it butts up against the entrance to the hole, and also wraps around to a plate on the back side of the hole - the hole is placed on the plate.

The piston is retracted. The hole is opened. It contains a very heavy mass, which the unbolted piston end is now pressed against. The piston is extended and pushes against the mass, moving the mass away from the bolted end of the piston, and a reciprocal force is applied to the bolted end, pushing whatever it's bolted to.

The hole is then closed, the piston retracts again with its now-much-lighter load, and the cycle repeats.
