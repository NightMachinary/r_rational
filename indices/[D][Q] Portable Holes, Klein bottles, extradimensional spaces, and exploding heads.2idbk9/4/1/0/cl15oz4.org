Ah, I misunderstood that. The key point is that you can use the hole to transport something much more massive than the hole itself, while only needing the energy to move the cloth of the hole.

You could have some sort of auto-opener, it seems that the slightest non-flat bit is enough to close the hole so that should be fairly easy mechanically.

If you've two holes on opposite ends of an arm, opening towards the centre where there's a fixed turbine. Put water in the bottom hole, close the hole automatically, rotate so it's now on top, open the hole, let the water flow through the turbine and into the new bottom hole and repeat.

You can fit about 8.5 cubic meters in there. Assuming water, that's ~8.5 tons which with a 10m drop will give you around 800kJ per round, and which will last around 1.5 seconds which is around 600kW.

Not that great, and that's before allowing for losses.
