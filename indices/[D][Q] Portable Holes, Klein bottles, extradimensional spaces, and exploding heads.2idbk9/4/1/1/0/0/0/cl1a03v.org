Aha. That is what I would have expected at first, but I interpreted this differently:

#+begin_quote
  The gravity only changes when the Hole is first opened
#+end_quote

I thought this meant that the interior gravity of the hole was established upon opening the hold and stayed constant relative to the opening despite motion in the outside world. Aka, that the direction of gravity inside the hole only changes when the hole is first open, and does not change when the opening is rotated.
