Actually, I think there's a better way... Again, hole gravity is towards top. There's a widget at the bottom of the hole that will grab and hold the object. Hole goes on inside of wheel. Widget releases object so that it falls out of the hole when the hole is at the apex of the wheel; wheel spins so that the hole is at the nadir of the wheel when the object finished falling the diameter of the wheel.

Energy gain is the potential energy of the object at a height of the wheel's diameter, energy cost is the friction losses of the wheel during rotation.

Bonus: Take enough holes to cover the inside of the wheel. Energy cost remains the same, energy gain is multiplied by the number of holes.
