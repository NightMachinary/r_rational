Better method for this: vertical assembly-line-style setup; conveyor belt lifts the folded holes upward, where they are opened on the ceiling, dropping a load of water below, over a waterwheel (or similar) and into another hole open on the floor. They might be brought down open or closed on the conveyor belt, whichever, but then they are re-opened on the ground and filled with water, closed, and lifted up again. Generates a bunch of energy with fairly small human intervention.
