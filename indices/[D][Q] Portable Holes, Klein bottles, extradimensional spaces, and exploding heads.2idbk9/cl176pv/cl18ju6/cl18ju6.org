  What are the properties of the extra dimensional space itself? Are the walls absolutely indestructible?
#+end_quote

Yes. They are the outer boundaries of a universe.

  When you punch a wall is the kinetic energy precisely reflected, and if not where does that energy go?
#+end_quote

They are always at a comfortable temperature (20C), but any outside thermal energy that contacts them simply vanishes.

They work like a Middle Ages wizard who didn't know much about physics would expect them to: if you drop something, it behaves as though you dropped it on a tile floor. Rubber balls bounce, then eventually stop. Beanbags just lie there. If you punch it, you hurt your knuckles and the walls are totally unaffected -- they do not distort at all, much less break.

  If I set off a nuke in a closed hole what happens?
#+end_quote

You get a big explosion that is completely contained and has nowhere to go. All the energy remains bottled up and when you open the Hole you get an enormous plasma lance.

#+begin_quote
  Seems like if you were willing to sacrifice people you could teleport in an arbitrary amount of matter to make a portable black hole.
#+end_quote

That works.

#+begin_quote
  A spell that lets you teleport other stuff but not yourself in would help here.
#+end_quote

Let's skip that. It renders the thing trivially abusable and therefore less interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Is the cloth still as vulnerable as normal cloth when it's in portal form?
#+end_quote

Nope. It's not really there when the portal is open, but if you grab the edge of the Hole and pull the cloth will reappear in your hand and the portal will vanish.
