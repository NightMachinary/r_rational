  of course this is irrelevant when you have a teleport spell. Just send the hole off on a spaceship and teleport to it later.

Yeah, I'm irked with myself for mistyping that. I meant the teleport spell to only work into a *closed* Hole, but that's not what I wrote. Meh. It wouldn't actually change things much, I suppose -- you could still send the cloth off on a ship and teleport into the Hole. You wouldn't be able to open it from the inside though.

  There are a number of possible uses that depend upon how the hole reacts to inertia as it is moves through the parent universe (our universe) when open.

When it's open, it's the same as any other hole in the ground. (Well, except that the walls are indestructible and thermally isolated.) That is, whatever is in it is affected by outside conditions such as gravity, temperature, vacuum, relativity, etc.

Re: the magnet -- you're visualizing opening / closing the Hole quickly in order to generate AC in a wire over the Hole?
