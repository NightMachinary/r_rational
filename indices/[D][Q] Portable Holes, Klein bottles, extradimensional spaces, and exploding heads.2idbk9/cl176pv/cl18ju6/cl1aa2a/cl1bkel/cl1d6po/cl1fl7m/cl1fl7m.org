  If i have a hole on a plate on a stick, what happens to the matter inside when i swing it around? Will the stick be harder to move if the hole has 10 tons of bricks in it than if it had just air?

  This is relevant because if you rotate the near side of the hole at 3*107 rpm, the far side would be moving at relativistic speeds.

If the Hole is open, then it works exactly like a regular hole in the ground -- you have to spend energy to accelerate all the mass inside it. If it's closed then the interior mass is isolated and you only have to accelerate the cloth itself. If you accelerate the cloth up to speed and then suddenly open it, the internal mass will be reconnected to the outside universe and moving at the same speed as the plate. Which means creation of kinetic energy. Wow, cool. So long thermodynamics!
