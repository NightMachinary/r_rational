great chapter so many good things going on, Cat can give winter mantles, she basically corrupted Thief into villiany, I imagine Daoine is giving cat full support, what did she offer her? and the Wild Hunt is +comming+ coming to munch on the Leaders of the Crusade.

What did Diabolist's Call aspect did?

Edit, another thing confirmation that Cat still owes the crowns to Larat
