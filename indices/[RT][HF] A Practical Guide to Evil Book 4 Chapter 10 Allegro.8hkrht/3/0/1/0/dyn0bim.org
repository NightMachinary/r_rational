The end game is to go beyond good and evil. That's only become clear to me in the last few chapters. Cat wants the world to be run by human decisions and laws made for the good of the many. But the structure of the world requires "good" vs "evil" which do not map onto utilitarian good. Heroes and Villains will always exist, so Cat wants to confine them to do battle in a fighting pit. They can have their stories and kill each other where they don't ruin the lives of ordinary people.
