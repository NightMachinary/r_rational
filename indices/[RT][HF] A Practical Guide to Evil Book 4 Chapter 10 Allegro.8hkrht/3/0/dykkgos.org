Diabolist's Call let her directly control a thousand devils. I imagine Cat's version would be similar but with Fae, although I wouldn't be surprised if Larat had a way to avoid it. Also, Thief being corrupted into a villain makes me pretty sad ngl :( I liked it when they had a hero in the Woe, but I guess that doesn't fit the narrative anymore
