That would be top notch (consistency? Word building? Story interaction?) if Absence did make everyone forget about two heroes and it was never mentioned again. It might be that Saint and Pilgrim aren't with them, but I think it's better if it's Absence. After Books 2 and 3, Demons just aren't interesting anymore and I would prefer it if that particular fight happened off screen.

I think it's a symbolic parallel, but I have no idea where EE is going with it
