  Strange, it hadn't occurred to me before now that the muster of heroes on the other side was essentially a tenth and two officers. I had been tired, and there'd been a few days a while back where I'd had vicious headaches. Must have been the lack of sleep having unforeseen consequences. We were all feeling the pressure: even Vivienne and Masego had been out of sorts.

This stood out to me. The commentators seem to think that this and the differing number of heroes (14 a few chapters ago, only 12 now) means that Absence was discovered, fought, and erased two of the heroes, as well as the memory of the battle from everyone's mind. Not sure if that's the case, but I don't know what else this headache could mean. Also not sure why them making up a tenth and two officers is important.
