One of the themes has been Good and Evil versus good and evil.

Cat has been playing that out on a practical level, and it's only natural that starts affecting the broader narrative and the Names. Cat has huge narrative importance and that's reality-bending in this world.

I think on a narrative level Cat has to more explicitly move beyond Good and Evil. I'm excited to find out whether she does that by becoming fully Fae, or by some other means. I'm hoping it's the latter!
