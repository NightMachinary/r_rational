Not the leaders of the Crusade, the lowborn officer's in the Crusader army. It serves multiple goals.

First it is a show of force, a way to communicate to the enemy that she could kill any of them at any time.

Second it reduces the enemies capabilities by reducing the amount of officers they have to lead their troops.

Third, and most importantly, it accomplishes the first two without pissing off anyone politically connected. If she kills highborn officers, their families will oppose any peace - so she must target the lowborn officers.
