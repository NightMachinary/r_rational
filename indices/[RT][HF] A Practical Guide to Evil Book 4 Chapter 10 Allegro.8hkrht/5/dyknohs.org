I'm calling it right now that there are two outcomes for this book:

Callow falls

or

Cat rips herself free of winter and ends up with some other Name like Foundling or Black Queen or something.

or both I suppose.

It is becoming abundantly clear that Cat cannot continue the string of successes she's had if she's constantly having her mental processes fucked with by Winter. It doesn't matter that she knows it or can plan against it, it's too powerful a checkov's gun to not fire into her foot at this point.
