Huh, I don't think Thief is "corrupted" at all. Corruption has negative connotations and the realization she came to is anything but.

The only Gods worth believing in are the Gods Below because they champion agency. You can do whatever you want. It's just that most people who swear themselves to them tend to have homicidal and/or sociopathic tendencies.

In other news, this Crusade doesn't seem like a Crusade to me. The folks in it don't seem "brainwashed to fight any evil anywhere at all costs" (Book 2). If this was the case then Cordelia wouldn't need to have struggled to get the Dominion or her allies committed to the cause. The Angels can just descend from the Heavens in each Principate, brainwash everyone and declare somebody in Procer as the champion of the Crusade. Said Champion can then lead all the armies East. Why haven't we seen this brainwashing yet?
