I think we should all be a bit more concerned with the fact that apparently Cat can create magical artefacts now, and as we all know those things tend to backfire more often than not for Villains. Black had even stated this multiple times.

And now Catherine can turn Aspects (and presumably Winter boons) into items? And she intends to use them?

There is no way this ends well.
