They backfire if you /rely/ on them, which makes stuff like flying fortresses and magical swords a more unreliable variety of the artifacts, since they are used continuously until they break. The artifacts that have discrete uses (like the Greater Breach generator in Liesse) are essentially guaranteed to work at least once when properly foreshadowed. This is why stuff like the signal whistle and the Stairway is remarkably story-proof: they both were designed to work only once.
