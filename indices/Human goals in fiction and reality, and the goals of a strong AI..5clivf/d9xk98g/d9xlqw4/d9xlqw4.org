But why use it in place of the word "goal"? As far as I can tell they mean the same thing. Does use of the more obscure term signal to the reader that he knows what he's talking about? Is it a nudge that the reader should go and read up on economic utility to more fully understand what "goal" means?

I was also considering the difference in meaning between "power" and "intelligence". I guess what it comes down to is that power is intelligence plus resources. So a not particularly intelligent person could, say, find an advanced beam weapon lying around and use it to vaporize something she didn't like without having the intelligence to build the beam weapon, or even to guess at how it works. But /something/ had to have the intelligence to create the beam weapon, and when they did that they used intelligence to create resources, resources which do not require the same amount of intelligence to utilize.
