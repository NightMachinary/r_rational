  But why use it in place of the word "goal"? As far as I can tell they mean the same thing

Goal implies conscious deliberation and choice, whereas utility is also useful from a behaviorist perspective. So it's still useful when looking at behaviour without having to guess what the internal motivations for that behaviour where. If you aren't guessing then you are asking for a self-report and might as well be guessing given how often people are unaware, inconsistent or just lying.
