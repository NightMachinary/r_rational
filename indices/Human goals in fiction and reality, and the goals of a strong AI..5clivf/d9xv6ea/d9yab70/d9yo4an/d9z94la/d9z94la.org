  The main issue is that pleasure/pain is as useful a distinction as good/bad or "things people are motivated to do"/"things people are motivated to avoid". It adds no information and merely gives labels to the binary you already decided you wanted to investigate.

Yep. To begin formalizing our folk-psychological theory of mind, we need to admit multiple reward channels (that is, the possibility of pleasure/pain in all sensory modalities, including intellectual ones) and with multiple levels of subtlety or precision.

And then we need to figure out how the brain combines those signals into a representation of a causal trajectory it "ought" to occupy, which is a totally open problem in cognitive science right now AFAIK.
