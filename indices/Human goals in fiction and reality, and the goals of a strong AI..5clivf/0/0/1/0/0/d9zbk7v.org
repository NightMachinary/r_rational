What about all the motivators that have nothing to do with pleasure or pain?

Habit, social pressure, ideological constraints on which options you even consider, etc.

I think that pleasure/pain is the wrong framework to try and understand these things, you end up having to have such a loose definition of "pleasure" and "pain" to account for the choices humans make that you end up with no predictive power and only a behaviorist model rather than a psychological one. Now you might as well just use the term "utility" because that's what you're talking about, and that's the word people who think similarly to you use.

To be fair, you are coming at this from a direction of looking at a "rational actor" type model of humans, which I find extremely suspect. Human behaviour isn't the result of the brain choosing actions based on expected outcome/utility/reward, it's just a bunch of habits and a mishmash of heuristics pattern matching against what's expected of you, what you normally do with a veto vote given to your fears. It's not fundamentally a rational decision making machine we're examining here. People do disagree with me, many of them, but it's pretty definitively proven that the irrational collection of biases model has more predictive power than the utility function model. Of course, we have no idea how to apply the irrational models to large groups so economics still has to presume rational actors ... hence the predictive power of economics being so infamously bad that it's called "the dismal science".
