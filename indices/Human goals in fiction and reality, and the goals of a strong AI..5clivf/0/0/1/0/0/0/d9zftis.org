  Now you might as well just use the term "utility" because that's what you're talking about, and that's the word people who think similarly to you use.
#+end_quote

Not quite. "Reward" would be a better term. "Utility" implies a VNM-rational utility function which is neither learned from evidence nor conditioned on sensory evidence.

  To be fair, you are coming at this from a direction of looking at a "rational actor" type model of humans, which I find extremely suspect.
#+end_quote

That depends on what you mean by "rational actor". I certainly agree that /economic/ rationality has basically no predictive power when dealing with real humans outside isolated "purely economic", perfectly-understood experimental conditions. I'm coming at this more from the perspective of embodied cognition theory, and using "rational" more in its colloquial meaning of "responding to reasons".

  Human behaviour isn't the result of the brain choosing actions based on expected outcome/utility/reward, it's just a bunch of habits and a mishmash of heuristics pattern matching against what's expected of you, what you normally do with a veto vote given to your fears. It's not fundamentally a rational decision making machine we're examining here. People do disagree with me, many of them, but it's pretty definitively proven that the irrational collection of biases model has more predictive power than the utility function model.

Try building a brain and see how far you get with that ;-). Heuristics-and-biases models are currently disfavored because there's /just too damn many of them/. How do you even program (from the AI/ML perspective) or predict (from the cognitive-scientific perspective) which heuristic or bias to apply in which situation? It's gotten to be an unfalsifiable paradigm whose only descriptive/predictive content is that humans /won't/ act like perfect /economic/ agents, which was only ever considered a real paradigm because economics professors mounted a decades-long campaign to claim the word "rationality" as a term of art for how their models act.

  Is the human brain just a rag-bag of different tricks and stratagems, slowly accumulated over evolutionary time? For many years, I thought the answer to this question was most probably ‘yes'. Sure, brains were fantastic organs for adaptive success. But the idea that there might be just a few core principles whose operation lay at the heart of much neural processing was not one that had made it on to my personal hit-list. Seminal work on Artificial Neural Networks had, of course, opened many theoretical and practical doors. But the cumulative upshot was not (and is not) a unifying vision of the brain so much as a plethora of cool engineering solutions to specific problems and puzzles.

  Meantime, the sciences of the mind (and especially robotics) have been looking increasingly outwards, making huge strides in understanding how bodily form, action, and the canny use of environmental structures were co-operating with neural processes. That was a step in a very promising direction. But without a satisfying picture of the role of the biological brain, ‘embodied cognition' was (I fear) never going to look very much like a systematic, principled science.

  Ever the optimist, I think we may now be glimpsing the shape of just such a science. It will be a science that will take many cues from an emerging vision of the brain as a multi-layer probabilistic prediction machine.
