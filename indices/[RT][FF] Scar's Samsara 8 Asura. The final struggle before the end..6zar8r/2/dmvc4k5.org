I can't help myself: I have to show off all the set-up and foreshadowing that was necessary to justify the awesome magic stuff that happened in this chapter:

Chapter 2)

- "the extraordinary boon of divine status shall be offered as a reward for the king's most loyal and able servants.”
- "They say you could call down lighting from the sky and bathe your enemies in fire. Surely no mere monkey could possess a stronger connection to the spirit world than you."
- “And then we pounce on him, take his bakora staff, and use it to reawaken your divine powers!"

Chapter 3)

- The walls of the tree were filled with incomprehensible scribbling and mural paintings picked out in shades of red.
- When she opened her eyes again, she saw to her amazement that the shapes were moving. "You can see quite clearly already, for one so recently introduced to Hakuna Matata.”
- “Oh man, I love this place,” said Timon. “Just the smell of these paints... hmm-hmm. This is great. Life is great. Everything's great.”
- "Trust me: Inhale vapours, meditate on infinite. There is no more I can do -- enlightenment must come from within.”

Chapter 4)

- “You and I have a spot in the afterlife now -- fantastic! But we still don't know if it really works that way" Slowly, Banzai's eyes opened -- but when they did they stared out at nothing.

Chapter 5)

- "The Mufasa I knew would never have said that to you, not in a million years!"

Chapter 6)

- He dipped his staff into the bag, causing a red mist to pour forth. There was no spell that could force out the truth, but there were certainly powders and charms that affected the mind.

Chapter 7)

- "That powder... Rafiki used the same colour paint to mark Simba during his presentation! It's not the staff -- it's the fruits that are attached to it.”
- "Spiritual power comes from being enlightened. All you need is to find something worth focusing on." Zira hesitated for a second, and then beckoned to her cub.

Chapter 8)

- "And if death ever does us part, then I swear I will drag your soul back screaming to where it rightly belongs.”
- "Spiritual power comes from gaining awareness of your own soul -- and that means being honest with yourself, and with how you feel.”
- "I don't have any spirits to call on, remember?” He closed his eyes in search of a connection, and this time he felt a second spiritual presence responding in kind.
- "Spirits might be stronger for their lack of flesh to weigh them down, but they're ultimately still just animals with the will to keep themselves together after death."

Come on, that has to be enough set-up to justify an impromptu ascension to god-hood, right??? And on top of that, there's also the fact that in the Lion Guard, the MC acquires power over the elements by focusing inwards and connecting with the Kings of the Past, and literally raises a dead king as a cloud of flaming smoke by awakening a volcano with his roar while someone else tossed a bokara staff in there. I realize most people don't watch the Lion Guard since it's not very good, but anyone who does would totally have seen this one coming :p
