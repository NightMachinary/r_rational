Those are not so much logical leaps as they are liberal application of Occam's razor. Sure, it's possible that you become immortal a week after becoming a king, but it's a needlessly complicated way to explain Scar's observations. Scar only ever credited the original “Lion Kings become immortal becomes they're lion kings” story because it was the official explanation: When it turned out that Rafiki was full of crap, there no longer was any reason to privilege that particular hypothesis.

“Lions are special” is still simple enough to be worth considering, but that doesn't explain why a mandrill is the world's strongest magic user. Also, as Scar remarks to Zira in the cave, the common thread running through Magic monkeys/magic captains/magic kings is the red fruits and the unusual levels of wisdom involved with each, not the fact that some of them are lions (most lions seem exactly the same as other animals in this regard).

  Maybe enlightenment in unnecessary, and the magic red fumes do everything?

The main argument from Scar here is that all known magic users and spirit kings were considered to be very wise, which seems like a bit much of a coincidence otherwise. Also, he already knew that Rafiki was teaching his acolytes enlightenment using those fruits, and he has a low prior for “these particular fruits just happen to be magical”.

  I'm not seeing the connection.

This follows from his generalization of “magic comes from enlightenment” and “Enlightened spirits persist after death”. Scar distinguishes between two hypotheses:

1) Enlightenment gives you a connection to spirits. ALSO being a spirit gives you power.\\
2) Enlightenment gives you power, immortality, and allows you to connect with others.

He concludes that 2 is more likely as it posits only one mechanism for magic, rather than two, while explaining the same data. (Also, Zira saw a vision of her living son with no known spirits involved)

Like I said, it's not a logical proof, but IMO it presents a series of very reasonable educated guesses.
