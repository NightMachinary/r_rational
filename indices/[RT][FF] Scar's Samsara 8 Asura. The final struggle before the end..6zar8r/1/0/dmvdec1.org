Hmm, I kind of agree that it broke up the action a bit too much, but I don't think this is the kind of revelation I could have put in a previous chapter. Set-up like realizing that the fruits are the key and their meditation in the cave, definitely. But the last-minute epiphany that results in a power-up that allows the hero to beat the villain is an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind][old and proven trope]].

Of course, if you feel that the set-up and the lore provided so far doesn't justify Scar's realization, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asspull][that's something else entirely]].

I don't think it was unjustified though: Everything Scar realizes follows logically from what had been revealed before that point, or at least it seems that way to me.
