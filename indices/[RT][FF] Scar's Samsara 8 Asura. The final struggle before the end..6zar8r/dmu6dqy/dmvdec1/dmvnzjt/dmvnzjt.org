From "'Yes', Scar shouted" to "why should /you/?" I felt you were very rapidly covering ideas that had not been adequately presented in previous chapters. I think it's valid to have one final puzzle piece slot into place at the moment of a story's climax, but this felt more like several puzzle pieces, and we weren't even given a particularly definitive explanation of how they fit together, which is why Scar expressed uncertainty in that very section.

Keeping the revelation shorter helped prevent it from breaking up the action, but also meant you couldn't do as much to justify it. I would have preferred more solid justification even if it meant you needed to break up the dramatic tension somehow. But best of all would have been to provide more groundwork for that justification in earlier chapters.
