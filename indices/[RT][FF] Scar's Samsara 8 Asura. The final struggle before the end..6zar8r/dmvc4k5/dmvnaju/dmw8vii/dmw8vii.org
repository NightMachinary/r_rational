Fair enough, it's more a smattering of evidence and foreshadowing than any deductive proof, but I do think that Scar's conclusions follow logically from the information as given: He starts out thinking that A) becoming king allows you to live on in the afterlife, and B) Magic comes from said spirit kings granting you power. However, he then tests A by scouting the afterlife with Banzai, which only leaves him braindamaged, and B) is put into question as both Simba and Nuka only see and say what they already believe. This convinces him that magic does not come directly/exclusively from the Kings of the Past.

Then Zira tells him about her vision while looking at the red wall paintings, and Rafiki's “Hakuna Matata” teachings which involve animals breathing in vapours and getting high from his red paints. Scar adds two and two together and concludes that magic comes from enlightenment, and that the fumes from his red fruits help you achieve this.

So then during the fight, he tells Zira that spirits are just enlightened animals who persist through their magic after death, and it's only through her words that he realizes that this means they can also draw on each other's power despite still being alive. And of course, she realizes that she can negate her own death as well as her son's by drawing on their connection which after all was the object of her meditation in the first place.

The rest is just foreshadowing, with Zira talking about stealing Rafiki's staff, using it to reawaken Scar's power and bathing his enemies in fire, which is of course exactly what happened - though not the way she imagined.
