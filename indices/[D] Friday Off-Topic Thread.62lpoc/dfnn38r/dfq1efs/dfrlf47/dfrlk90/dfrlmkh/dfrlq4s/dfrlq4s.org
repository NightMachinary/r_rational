I spent a surprisingly long amount of time pondering what my flair should be. Wanted something related to rational fiction but that wasn't one of the four dozen options we had to work with. Dragon's Egg naturally sprung to mind. Now I think of it, I wonder if there's a thread about it on here? Not sure if it counts as Rational though, but the extreme focus on neutron star physics is really cool.
