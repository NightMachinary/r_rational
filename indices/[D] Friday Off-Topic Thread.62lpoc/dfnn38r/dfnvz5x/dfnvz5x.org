  Is the step up to a vacuum robot worth it?
#+end_quote

A sweeping robot is good if you have a shedding dog with hardwood/tile floors, but it's not a substitute for cleaning. It just gets rid of the excess hair.

I don't have any experience with vacuum robots, but I doubt they could take the place of an actual vacuum.
