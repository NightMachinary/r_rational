I recently ordered a dewalt cordless wet/dry shop-vac. They take electric drill batteries.

The trade off with a conventional vacuum, the kind you push along the floor, is dubious. It's less good for mass cleaning floors, but better for reaching into crevices in furniture, or doing the first pass on cleaning large spills, or detailing a car, etc. It seems to have a lot more suction for the price than most the vacuums I've used. If you're house has a lot of carpets, go with a traditional vacuum. If not, a shop vac like the dewalt portable one might be a good choice. It cost me cad $115.
