I just discovered that [[/r/ynot][r/ynot]] wasn't taken, so I've started a subreddit there for topics where someone can hopefully give a nuanced answer to why something isn't possible/true/feasible in the present sense.

The idea isn't to make flat assertions for or against, but to explore why expert opinion may lean skeptically on certain possibilities. I've found that this is in general a pretty good way to learn more about topics -- find out what the known limits are and what the reason is for them.
