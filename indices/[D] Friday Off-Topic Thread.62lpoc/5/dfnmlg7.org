I'm running a SufficientVelocity Worm-based Quest (AU) where you, the player are a shard (name for the mechanism that people receive power) known as, among other things, Counter.

Essentially, the host takes damage and you the reader are to counter the damage they receive. The story is the host learning to live with the adaptations you vote as they about their life of conflict, some times desired some times not so much.

I'd love it if you guys joined in.

Additionally, I'm writing a worm fanfiction based on With Friends Like These. I'm trying to keep it rational, but I make no claims that it will be able to stay that way. I'm doing much less planning for friendbringer than I am for the pokemon fic.

Read it on SV here (do not read unless you have already read worm): [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-friendbringer-recursive-fanfiction-and-night-a-pokemon-story.36692/]]
