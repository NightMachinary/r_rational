Hi, I'm a long time lurker of this sub and it's great to finally post. Last week I taught a class on Fermi estimation and problem-solving skills to high school students! It was a fantastic experience and doing the prep work finally gave me the motivation to read through "The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering", "Sustainability --without the Hot Air", and "Guesstimation". Does anyone here know of any other good sources to expand on this kind of reduced and simplified model thinking?
