It occurs to me that the ideal forum probably would have these three attributes...\\
- Each comment can have multiple children. Conversation threads can be followed even after they diverge (e.g., two people reply to the same comment).\\
- Each comment can have multiple parents. Conversation threads can be followed even after they converge (e.g., one person replies to multiple comments).\\
- All comments are easily searchable by full text and permanently archived. Conversations can be found and read long after their original production.

Consider...\\
- On Reddit and Voat, a comment can't have more than one parent. Conversation threads can't converge and be consolidated. If I want to reply to multiple people with one comment, I have to use username alerts for all but one of them.\\
- On XenForo and vBulletin forums, a comment can't have /any/ children. You can follow a conversation thread /backward/, but you can't follow it /forward/!\\
- On anonymous imageboards, archival is temporary, incomplete, unsearchable, and/or conducted primarily by third-party sites.

(I don't at all understand the popularity of Discord.)

I'm rather surprised to have accumulated /two/ glowing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panegyric][panegyrics]] in the past two years...\\

I remain skeptical of such claims as the second (see the [[http://i.imgur.com/qmXYYEt.png][previous episode]] and subsequent [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5p4cvt/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dcoxezg][discussion]]), but I can at least embrace the first.

The choice of where a link should be placed in text often is quite interesting. Take [[http://i.imgur.com/BbksgtS.png][this Slate Star Codex post]] as an example...\\
- =Related: Leave voters prefer=...: I would have placed the link on =Related=, =prefer=, or =prefer their steaks well-done=. Putting it on =prefer their steaks= seems a little disjointed, to me.\\
- =Also in European polling news:=...: I would have extended the link leftward to include =are=, at the very least--or just put it on =Also in European polling news=.\\
- =Jared Rubin on why=...: Why not include the entire sentence in the link? Or at least add =during the Renaissance= to it?\\
The list goes on.

At the beginning of this very section, I had to choose between placing the link on =this Slate Star Codex post= and placing it merely on =post=. I feel as if placing the link solely on =post= would have seemed like... an affectation, maybe? I don't know.

(At the end of that last sentence, I had to choose between =don't know= and =dunno=, too. Endless decisions!)

(And all this is without even getting into whether =<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644"><em>Time Braid</em></a>= or =<em><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644">Time Braid</a></em>= is preferable...)

Watch out, [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]]! The admins [[http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/621gs3][apparently]] think that saying =bash the fash= is grounds for being banned. (rolls eyes)
