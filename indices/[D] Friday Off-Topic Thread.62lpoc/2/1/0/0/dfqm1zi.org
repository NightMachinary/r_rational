Oof. So, I listened to the first part, then skipped ahead every so often, and skipped entirely over the part that where he records a new phrase to try.

So I was listening to it and got near the end and thought "Wow, it's like it's trying to say 'This is the only thing I can say.'"

And then slowly became closer and closer to sounding like that, and then it actually said it.

I thought "No way" and went back over it and saw that he recorded that line himself, and was vastly relieved. Because for a moment there, that was genuinely creepy :P
