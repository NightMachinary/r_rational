I have recently come into some disposable income (from poor student level) and am trying to identify good housekeeping investments, in terms of money per time saved.

Dish washer and vacuum cleaner seem like the two most obvious points on that list. Is the step up to a vacuum robot worth it? Anything else thats in the magnitude of those two?
