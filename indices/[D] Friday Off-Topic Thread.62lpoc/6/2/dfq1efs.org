With a dishwasher, save up and spring for a decent one. We got a Bosch (AU$1000) one and my parents got the cheapest one they could (brandless, ~AU$4-600). Whenever I'm at my parents' house using their dishwasher I am constantly amazed by how.... clunky it is. The trays don't roll smoothly, and it's really irritating to use. We chose the Bosch one because our consumer reports magazine (Choice) rated it the highest (well, it and I think the Asko, which was another $300-$400). But very glad for it. Do your research!!!!
