Wow, that's amazing!

I found out about it on Wikipedia when I was going down a rabbit hole in high school, and I thought about how badly I wanted to read the book because it seemed so good. Unfortunately none of my local libraries had it. One day when I'm in university, I'm reading about the book on Wikipedia again and there's a button to search local university libraries for it. I find out it's in another university's library in my city.

Trembling I manage to put a request for an inter-library loan for it (I was worried on some level that they might say "this is a novel and not at all related to your degree, request denied!" but they didn't). It arrives about a week later and I read it, all the while thinking how lucky I am to have been able to track down a copy. After reading it two or three times I return it and then do the same thing with /Starquake/, which I have to inter-library loan from /New Zealand/.

Eventually I managed to find a bootleg Kindle copy of dragon's egg (at the time it was not on Amazon, I am pretty sure I've bought an official copy from Amazon since because the bootleg copy didn't have the pictures in the appendix) and bought Starquake for Kindle.

I've never gone through so much trouble before or since to read a book, and if I wanted to read it today I would have gone to [[http://www.booko.com.au][www.booko.com.au]] and looked it up and probably bought a second hand copy for under $10. Isn't technology wonderful? (And I must have first read Dragon's Egg circa 2009?)
