Today I saw yet another video making fun of the Westboro Baptist Church, which reminded me of that SSC article where Scott says there are orders of magnitude more people being afraid of the KKK, than actual KKK members.

So I researched it, and found out the WBC had... ~70 people in 2007, probably fewer now, all from the same family (clan? familial network?). I think this is the religious equivalent of the dumb reality show star who gets and stays famous by saying dumb things all the time, and that we really, really ought to ignore more on a global basis.
