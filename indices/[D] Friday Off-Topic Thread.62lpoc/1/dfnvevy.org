I recently set up a dual boot, windows 10 (came with the computer), and ubuntu. At first, ubuntu was amazingly fast, but I figured once I got everything set up that it would slow down.

It didn't. It's still fast, and my system isn't struggling to keep up like it was with windows. Ubuntu has it's own annoyances (like having to work your way through technobabble for even the simplest of problems), but I'm happy with it so far.

With windows, even after disabling almost all startup programs, gutting [[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/632984/how-to-completely-stop-microsoft-compatibility-telemetry/][windows telemetry]] (highly recommended), and making sure I was clear of viruses, windows was still /cripplingly/ slow.

It's amazing that the same computer can run so much faster just by changing from one modern operating system to another. Where are these speed gains coming from? I honestly can't figure it out.
