I love the nods to canon here after the last few chapters seemed to veer wildly away from it. I'm glad (/heartbroken for her) that we got the same reckless!Cassie that canon gave us. Cassie was always a wildcard in canon, even more so because none of her friends ever particularly recognized her as such, which made it all the more damaging when she did break ranks and do something unexpected.
