When I saw the author's note at the beginning of the update and read that there were only three chapters left, I got too sad to even read the chapter, and I put it down until now. Every chapter has been more intensely bittersweet for the whole last stretch here. I don't know what I'll do when it ends - probably throw myself back at Annotated, I guess.
