As excited as I am to see how this ends, I'm so bummed out to think about it ending. One of my favorite stories of all time. I wish this wasn't fanfiction so that physical copies of this great work could be produced, I would definitely buy them

I was wondering if physically attacking the computer itself was a viable option, glad to see the characters thought of that as well. Although I have to say, I don't really want the earth to be destroyed and for Jake and Marco to die...but we will see
