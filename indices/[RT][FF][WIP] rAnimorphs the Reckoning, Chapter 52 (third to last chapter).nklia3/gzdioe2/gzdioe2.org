This chapter might be summarized as "remember all those NPCs? Turns out they can make decisions, too. Oops."

There's something thematically relevant, there, but I'm still trying to process the last scene and comment simultaneously, so I'm not sure how to phrase it better than <3 <3 <3 .

So I think the idea here is that Crayak put too much of himself into the Arbitor, that's the megastructure that showed up around Earth, and their plan was to distract Crayak so they could do as much damage to the physical structure as possible, possibly while blowing up the Sun and/or Earth, in whole or in part, whichever works. Something went wrong. Feels like the Howlers leaving a contengency deadman's switch type thing, more than direct action from Crayak, but that last scenehappened so fast I'll have to reread.

Thank you!

Edit: Eddris may or may not have screwed everyone over by allowing Bosco to morph, thus revealing the plan to Crayak?

And it really sucks to be Cassie right now. Though I guess it really sucks to be within 1AU of Earth right now, in general.
