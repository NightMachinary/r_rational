So, in an earlier draft of the chapter, Cassie was going to head to Mars /as Rachel,/ in a seven-Potters-style deflect

and the idea was that Cassie was going to just grab onto, like, /an entire Bug fighter/ and take it into her morph so that her time limit was like 3sec and then she'd die and be Rachel and the Chee ship could burn away the tissue

and that was Dope and Rad until I remembered that morphing would totally let Crayak know what was up, under some pretty reasonable assumptions, so instead of having Cassie sac herself I went with what you see above

but anyway long story short is, you can just morph with a boulder and hey, presto, very very short time limit.

Fenrir's also correct that you could just burn away the control tissue, but that feels more ... violently unpleasant, or something.
