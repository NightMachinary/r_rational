You may or may not be familiar with Madoka Magica (another of the worlds that spawned [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ToTheStars/][a very popular fic]] in a similar vein to others on this sub), but if not, the despair event horizon is a pretty key concept in that world. And as such, it's the people with the most deeply held idealistic principles that end up snapping the most severely.

This Cassie is not unlike Madoka Magica's Mami when she (in that one timeline) learns the truth about the world they live within. Naturally, she takes it upon herself to 'save' everyone she can from an even worse fate by deciding the best thing for everyone is for them to die then and there instead of possibly facing future tortures and suffering. And with that goal in mind, she's very quick to lean in to the fact that no-one expects it of her to quickly restrain and kill half of the team before the news even sinks in properly for them.
