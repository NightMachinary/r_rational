plot twist: Crayak deduced Toomin's gambit and knew all of this was coming. So it's pretending to put up resistance while quietly guiding the Animorphs along a path it wants. Also destroying the arbiter is bad actually, and just helps unleash Crayak sooner rather than hurting it.

not sure how confident I am in that line of thinking, but it could be a thing. especially since there were two separate attempts to destroy the arbiter, and Crayak seems pretty content with sitting there and letting the second one happen after the first one foiled itself.
