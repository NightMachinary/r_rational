This chapter was great. Answered a lot of questions but, of course, raised plenty of others too.

One thing is that I'm super curious about what's really going on with Crayak right now. On the one hand it's possible that it really /did/ spend its initiative down so low that the best it could do was mobilize the remaining Howlers and also launch a few whatever-weapons-they-were from the not-really-Earth-anymore's surface. But on the other hand, maybe it didn't and it's holding its initiative in reserve for... something. But if that's the case, what kind of /something/ is worth risking the hypercomputer that it currently lives in? I don't feel like getting Marco and Jake to sacrifice themselves is itself enough of a reward for that kind of risk, if it could kill them off and more in some easier way.

And of course the other thing is what's the deal with all the unanswered alternate universe/alternate timeline shenanigans, and how will that play into the endgame? Is something going to happen soon that's the actual cause of those shenanigans? It's been claimed that time travel is impossible in this universe, but do we really /know/ that? Maybe self-consistent loops are possible Ã  la HPMOR, and we've just seen the weird effects of some future cause radiating backwards in time. Or maybe there's a DBZ-style immutable but branching timelines thing going on, and the current universe is the result of intervention from another timeline. But if that's the case, who intervened and when? All in all, I still have no idea what to make of it and I guess we'll have to see what the next chapters bring us.

There's also the question of what part the Visser has to play in the remaining chapters, if any. Does he have backups that would have survived the quantum virus? If not, then he's presumably still backed up inside the hypercomptuer several times over like every other morpher. Would Crayak have a reason to bring him back after wiping him off the game board? Would /Rachel/ have a reason to bring him back?
