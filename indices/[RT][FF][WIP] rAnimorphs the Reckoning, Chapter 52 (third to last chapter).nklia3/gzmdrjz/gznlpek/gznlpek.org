  The halting problem implies you can't make an absolutely perfect virus-checker, right?

Please, explain.

(I think Crayak is too intelligent for the Visser to hack him in this way - Toomin hacked Father because of his special talent for probability meddling. If Visser can do the same, I'm not sure it's been foreshadowed. But anything is possible at this point - I have no idea why Crayak isn't responding, so something I didn't think of must be the right answer in any case.) It's connected to the Visser, probably, given a spoilered comment from the TK.
