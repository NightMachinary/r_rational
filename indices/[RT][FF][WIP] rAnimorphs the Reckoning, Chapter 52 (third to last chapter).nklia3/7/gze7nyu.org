[[/u/TK17Studios]] - thanks so much for writing this! FYI, I've recently moved it to our wiki's 'Defining Works' section, on the basis that I think of it as part of the /reflectively/ rationalist canon along with /Luminosity/ and /HPMOR/.

Very few stories, even here, so strongly convey the experience of reflecting on rationality that readers can learn from it. (in HPMOR we learn mostly from the /inadequacy/ of reflection, but he /was/ eleven...)
