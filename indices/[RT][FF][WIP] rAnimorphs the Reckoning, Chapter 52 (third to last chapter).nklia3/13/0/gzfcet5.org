As Invisible Pony points out, Edriss had no incentive to tip off Crayak.

In my headcanon, she was /aaaaalmost/ not self-aware, in the way that you can kind of sneakily let yourself do something you know you shouldn't do, while humming innocently to yourself/distracting yourself/not thinking about it too closely.

So she stuck to the plan, in a fashion that would be visibly hard to distinguish if somehow anybody checked, in a way that would allow her to truthfully say things like "yep, I've told him to morph at the appropriate time, I've told him to launch at the appropriate time, we're all set."

But she slipped a couple of digits---enough to ensure that he'd come out of hyperspace /not/ in the middle of the sun.

BTW his morphing was part of the bluff---he was meant to morph so that Crayak would /see/ that they were alive, that they were coming, that the sun was going to get rammed. But if Crayak did in fact see, Crayak would have noticed that the course /wouldn't/ take the ship into the sun, so I wonder how Crayak would have reacted/how Crayak would have interpreted this weird bit of data...
