I remember this cover project from way back, but I didn't know any of them ever actually got finished. I kind of assumed it had been abandoned. This one looks great! For some reason, the tardigrade is a hilarious choice for a cover morph, but one that totally works. Also why is that kid instantly recognizable as Garrett, even though Garrett's face literally does not exist?
