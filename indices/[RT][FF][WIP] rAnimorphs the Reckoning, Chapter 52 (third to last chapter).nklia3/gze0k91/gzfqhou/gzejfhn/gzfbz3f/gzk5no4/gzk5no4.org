I was really not expecting to get such a heartwarming scene between Marco and Jake (Edit: and not only the care in the first scene, but the trust at the end! Perfect!) or Tobias and Garrett, this late in the story, and thought there was pretty much no chance you'd wrap up Tobias' conflict about identity and death.

Great chapter.
