The hologram conversation was an opportunity to collect every last shred of data they could about Tobias-and-Maninho, so Terra has a way to reconstruct Maninho's requiem and return it to the sharing.

*Edit:* I just realized that if the holograms transmit thought-speak, Maninho could have quietly morphed into a tardigrade and talked privately with Terra. Maybe he sent them something like the /delest/, to carry his final thoughts back to the sharing. He could have also asked the ship to scan him and store a backup before he morphed (the only reason individual yeerks can't be morph-resurrected is that Seerow's tech tries to extrapolate from DNA when it scans an incomplete organism, but Good Ship + Quat's lab tech wouldn't have that limitation).
