In Roman mythology, Jupiter was the child-- the "joint creation" if you will-- of Saturn and another titan. Saturn tried to eat Jupiter when he was a baby, and was tricked by the other titan into eating a rock instead. He believed Jupiter was dead. Saturn was later defeated by Jupiter, who reigned over the new age of gods as God of the Sky.

In this chapter, a bolt of fire the size of Jupiter is flung at a titan the size of Saturn, who is consuming a very large rock. As best as I can discern, this chapter takes place sometime around Halloween in the late twenties, meaning the Earth and Saturn are aligned.

The Fury of Jupiter will destroy them both, before hurtling onward into the void.

Years later, if alien beings come to the solar system to see where it all began, they might search the skies for the receding blaze of glory, exploding in slow motion due to time dilation as it carries away the age of titans, and marks the dawn of the age of gods.

They can find it in the constellation of Aries.

The Ram.
