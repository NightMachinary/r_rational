Tobias is going to the Pemalite homeworld 11 days away; it's the only other place that even might have technology that could be a threat to Crayak.

The only other move I can think of that even /might/ force Crayak to respond would be going to Leera, abducting a bunch of Leerans, and dropping them into the middle of every gathering of sentient minds he could find, anywhere.

I predict that this:

  A billion simulations began, then, as the player checked and re-checked and re-re-checked its assumptions, making sure that it had not missed anything of import. A billion Vissers crawled through the simulations, encountering the information under a billion slightly varied sets of circumstances, reacting to it in a billion slightly different ways, creating a billion branching futures.

will end up having been a bad idea, or at least an interesting one. The halting problem implies you can't make an absolutely perfect virus-checker, right? So as soon as Visser 3 realized he was being studied and modeled, he would have started trying to make a program that models his behavior a virus that takes over the Arbiter. And he would obviously base the exact strategy on the subtlest quantum randomness, to ensure that all billion copies throws something different. And even if no copies succeed, some copies might come close enough to warrant further investigation by Crayak (copying himself, for example), thereby spawning more copies of the Visser. This is exactly what Toomin did to Father: as a simulation, take over the platform. I wonder if the trap Toomin set with Rachel is intended to distract Crayak from this, and to incentivize it to consider low-probability events, such as being taken over by copies of one of your simulations.
