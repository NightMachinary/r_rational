That's what I thought too at first, but what the Ellimist really failed to realize is that Crayak was going to unlock the Chee at all and then leave it holding the bag. And the key thing is once that realization hit, the Ellimist also realized it was in checkmate.

Eliminating the Chee requires actions that violate the rules of the game (bringing out the hypercomputer and using it to zap them away), which leaves it vulnerable to a killing blow by Crayak or the arbiter itself or whatever. Not eliminating them means letting them run rampant and free since Crayak purposefully rendered itself helpless to intervene. Eventually they'll figure out how to get into the arbiter, take out the Ellimist and Crayak both, then continue doing whatever they want with the universe uncontested.

So the Ellimist knew it was fucked and the only thing it could do was choose between the lesser of two bad futures.
