  Was Rachel the one responsible for taking down the z space rift? She had to because they were all outside it at the start and Cassie had to make it to Mars ASAP, am I right?

Z space rift surrounds the solar system, not the Earth. The Visser was doing stuff on Mars before he discovered the bridge, and I think with Serenity they figured out the barrier was past Neptune.
