I have some plans for physical copies in the works; basically the way it'd have to work is there would be a printer who would have the files, and people could pay the printer directly to whip up a personal copy. Like, as far as I can tell it's fine as long as I'm not profiting off of it and it's just individuals asking the printer for their own personal vanity copy, and paying strictly for the printing/binding/shipping.
