thing is, doing that would cost initiative, wouldn't it?

I believe you said that the rift was a collaborative effort between 2 Players, which kinda gives the impression that playing with solar system sized z space rifts has a non trivial cost

(unless the setup was more a formality, akin to setting up a game board? but that would make unilaterally removing it even costlier)

the thing is that NONE of this is in the text proper, we're going entirely of author notes here
