What a way to go, ramming the sun. The sheer spectacle is dimmed only slightly by the fact that presumably everyone has backups of everyone else, and even one survivor means everyone lives.

Wonder what's going to happen with Vasco. Probably we'll get to see what V3's quantum virus contingencies are from his POV.

What would Cassie want to do with a shelf of quantum viruses? Was this part of the plan?

Tobias gets it... finally. Took him long enough.

I see the original plan for 1 narrator per chapter (as described in Ch. 44's notes) has gone out the window. Probably for the best, and I'd likely have done the same. It doesn't set off my OCD as it's limited to the final and suitably epic arc.

Only 2 chapters to not only resolve the present crisis, but explain and deal with the canon-discrepancy stuff, as well as the narratively mandated return of V3. Those are going to be tightly packed no matter how you dice them (I'm hoping for more 30k word chapters personally). But however it turns out, there HAVE to be only 2 chapters left, by hook or by crook, to make the total 54. If I was writing and really needed the chapter space, I'd relabel Ch. 48 into an interlude, freeing 1 more Chapter number. Very clever to pad out/hold in reserve a flexible number for the crucial chapter count.

Questions I'd like to clear up:

- Was Rachel the one responsible for taking down the z space rift? She had to because they were all outside it at the start and Cassie had to make it to Mars ASAP, am I right?

- Possible snarl Re: short term memory
