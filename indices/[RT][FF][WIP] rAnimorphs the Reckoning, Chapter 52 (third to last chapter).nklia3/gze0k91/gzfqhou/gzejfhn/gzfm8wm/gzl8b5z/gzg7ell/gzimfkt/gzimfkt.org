Always on the edge of my seat to read through another one of these updates. :)

I have a question: Regarding everyone generally avoiding morphing before the arranged countdown-end time so as not to give anything away...

And regarding Tobias and Garrett acquiring one another shortly before the arranged countdown-end time...

Does the acquiring process itself not access the hypercomputer, and the characters know that it doesn't? Unless this was explained or discovered at some point that I missed, I would have thought that it does, the same way that morphing does, to upload and process the acquired pattern so that it can be used later.
