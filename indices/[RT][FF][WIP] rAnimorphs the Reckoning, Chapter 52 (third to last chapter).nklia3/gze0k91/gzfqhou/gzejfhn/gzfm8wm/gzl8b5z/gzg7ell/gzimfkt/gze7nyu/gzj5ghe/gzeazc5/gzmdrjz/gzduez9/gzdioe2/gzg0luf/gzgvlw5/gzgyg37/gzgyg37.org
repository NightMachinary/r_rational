On that note I kinda have been wondering what drove the Ellimist to play along after he got backed into the corner by Crayak. The only move he could make was to use all the initiative he had to eliminate the Chee, but wouldn't he also know that doing so would cause him to forfeit the game? If his choice was between losing the game by inaction and losing the game by action, it seems like he could have thrown up his hands and been like "You wanted unlocked Chee, Crayak? Okay, hope you have fun with them!"

I'm guessing that the Ellimist must have had /some/ hope that he could wipe the Chee out while keeping the game going, or else he wouldn't have given it a try. Or maybe his actions didn't /directly/ lead to a forfeit according to the rules of the game, but still left him open to some kind of direct attack from Crayak that he didn't anticipate. But I'm not really sure how that works since we don't know the exact rules of the game.

Does it allow the players to directly attack each other if they accumulate sufficient advantage, or does one of them have to break a rule to be open to attack? And is it the opposing player that has to do the kill, or does the arbiter do that automatically? It /seems/ like Crayak is the one who did the Ellimist in, and seemingly in a way that the Ellimist didn't predict in advance. But it's still hard to tell from an outside perspective.
