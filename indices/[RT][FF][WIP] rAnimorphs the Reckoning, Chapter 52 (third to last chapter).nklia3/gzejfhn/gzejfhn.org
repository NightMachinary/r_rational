Oh that was so good!!! I was literally screaming "Ram the sun!!!" by the end! In no other story could I be so incredibly excited by the protagonists making a suicidal move to explode the solar system but that's part of what makes this story so good!

Also <3 <3 <3 at Maninho sacrificing themself to give Tobias a Garrett, that was so sweet and touching.
