Just FYI, the fic appears to be originally hosted on spacebattles ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/applied-cultural-anthropology-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cruciatus.256787/]]).

If you prefer reading it with other readers and the author's discussion included, go there instead.

Yeah, and the story is great.
