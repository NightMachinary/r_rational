I think that there's some sort of disconnect here, and [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Gelifyal][u/Gelifyal]] can correct me if I'm wrong.

We've spent a bunch of time in the story so far with Seti, and some incredibly high level people(dragon, high level shepherd), but we haven't gotten a real look at what your average Prestige student is supposed to be capable of. Without a real mark for comparison, it's hard to say whether the judges are being unfair(don't like low tiers) or lenient(Seti's bullshit mind-controlling air). We saw glimpses of Aiden, and that one vivimancer lady, and I would speculate that their abilities could be just as bullshit(no-impact /Limitless/ style unlocks, anyone?).

I would encourage the author, if doing a rewrite, to add a short encounter with a random Prestige student earlier in the story for reference, so as to establish power levels appropriately.
