lol I'm tight lipped about Dream Eater, so no secret will even be hinted with that plot line.

Don't worry too much about my comment o.o! I don't think Seti would even be capable of differentiating between Prestige level strong and Dragon level strong, as both are astronomical levels of power in comparison to himself (think of Henry's analogy in chapter one: one million seconds versus one billion).
