My guess is that they publicly reject people but in the private interviews they offer them some type of probationary position. This judging literally has a crowd and is being broadcasted to the public.

Think of the spectacle that would result of Seti, as a tier one, being publicly accepted into prestige. I think it's fairly obvious that his joining won't be made public.

Think of this as a reality tv show. The one girl accepting while the other two rejecting makes perfect sense. They just want to appeal to the public right now. So of course its unfair.
