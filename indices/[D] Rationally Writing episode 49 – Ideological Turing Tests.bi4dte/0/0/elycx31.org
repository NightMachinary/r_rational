I think part of the issue is that even if people have reasons for their beliefs, and well-considered ones at that, people also overwhelmingly use shorthand for their own belief systems. They don't try to justify every little thing and address every little point against their belief system, they just react in a way consistent with how they believe when the case arises, or don't bother to explain or mull over the reasons they give for reacting in a certain way.

I think the origins of this problem is how we try to model beliefs we don't actually hold. I think many people, myself included, try to model it as if we were pretending to be a convert to that way of thinking, and explaining all the reasons why we changed our minds. Like the podcast mentioned, that says more about the arguments that /you/ find persuasive than it does about the arguments people with that position would actually offer.

I've tried to break that habit by modeling other ideologies in a different way---basic mimickry. Going to the original sources of these kinds of ideas and these kinds of people, and paraphrasing them as best as I'm able, in circumstances as close as I can match to the situation. Of course, you have to throw in a bit of understanding of human nature as well, or else you're basically just trying to become a human chatbot, but I think it is like the difference between figure drawing a person and tracing a picture of that person---the former requires more skill to do well, and the latter is more cheap and easy. It really comes down to circumstance and preference which kind of model I think is “best” for any given situation.
