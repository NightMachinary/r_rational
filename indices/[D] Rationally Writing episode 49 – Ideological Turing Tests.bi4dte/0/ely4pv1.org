This was a wonderful and thought-provoking episode. Thanks!

This reminds me of an issue I had a while back, that I'm not sure I resolved very well. I was trying to write a a dialogue and a point came up that was (roughly) consequentialism vs deontology, and I wanted to pass the ITT but had trouble getting into the deontologist's head. I knew what /I/ would think if I were a deontologist. It would be something like "arguments about how you should do something bad for a greater good are often much sketchier than they appear and have second order effects that you won't think of, and therefore the best thing to do is to have deontological injunctions so you don't do those bad things". (This is actually fairly close to what I do believe.) The problem with this was that I felt it was still a very "consequentialism-backed" version of deontology and not representative of what a deontologist would think. In other words, a deontologist might agree, but it's not the /framework/ they'd use to approach it. Even now, I'm not really sure how deontologists think and I didn't resolve this dialogue I wanted to write to my satisfaction.
