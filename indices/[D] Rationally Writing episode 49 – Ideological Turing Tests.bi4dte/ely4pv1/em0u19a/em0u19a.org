I think it also depends on the /type/ of deontologist, for your case. They come in religious and secular flavors, and that makes a big difference in terms of how they see the world and frame their arguments, even if they agree on particular points.

Something that might help, in that case, is to imagine the different types of deontologists arguing with each other? Not just a Christian and a Kantian, but also a progressive Christian vs a conservative Christian, or a Kantian and your own type of deontologist.
