I was a bit confused by the start wars canon.

  We are ruled with an iron fist by Emperor Anakin Solo, son of Han Solo and Leia Organa. It was not always like this- Anakin Solo was originally elected a Senator, like his predecessor Palpatine. He proved to be a good leader, and successfully maintained order over his territory even as regional flare-ups plagued the other regions. But when his beloved and elderly parents were both murdered while attempting to negotiate a peace treaty between two warring systems, Anakin became enraged. He blamed the non-interventionist policies of the New Republic for their deaths, and many in the Senate agreed with him. With their help, he instituted a massive rearmament program, ostensibly to restore the credibility of the central government and crack down on criminals, terrorists, and local warlords who had gotten out of hand."
