i know this is coming quite a bit late, but i finally found a good description of what made this story so thoroughly unsatisfying (other than the infuriatingly stupid speech q ends it with) and it's diabolus ex machina. all the important moves of the story are shit the emperor did behind the scenes before it even starts. he perfectly anticipates and manipulates every single thing an entire galaxy of alien sophonts with myriad alien cultures, mindsets, and biologies do well in advance, all of which are entirely new to him and his entire galaxy. the readers don't get to see him planning all this, we just get a lot of descriptions of starfleet ships blowing up.

add to that a starfleet that acts like a bunch of dipshit precontact hillbillies, klingons who act like petaQ, and borg just plain too stupid to live.
