I don't recall ships in Star Wars having force fields around them

+Anyway, excellent fiction, I'm about 1/2 through so far - very fast pace, very action-packed, highly recommended.+

Edit: I finally managed to finish the story, which came off as too much SW fanboyism, where they were far more cleverer the the Trek characters, outsmarting and outmaneuvering even Trek's best. Picard didn't act much at all like he did in the show, and I think the only character that seemed really consistent was Q.
