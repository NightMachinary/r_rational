It seems like the people depicted as focusing on the Dragon rather than Mulan's Gender reveal are the three footsoldiers that she befriended during training. It would make sense that they would be more accepting of her and focused on the appearance of an Actual Dragon than the elite leadership who never knew her personally and have a stronger interest in maintaining public appearance.

This actually gives me the idea of a story where Mulan uses the presence of her supernatural support and friendship with the regular troops in order to stage a mutiny against the incompetent or outright treacherous leadership of Chi-Fu. This seems like it could be the start of an interesting journey where Mulan transitions from a single courageous soldier into the revolutionary leader of a mass movement.
