Okay, I've thought it over, and tweaked upcoming chapters a bit. Not a lot--I'm bound by my own conception of realism in relationships, here--but the trajectory has changed significantly. I'm kind of surprised how much readers (not just you, but in general) seem to like Darun. She's more likeable than she was in the first draft of the story, when she was just an irredeemably selfish troublemaking bitch with barely any backstory, but still, I never thought of her as fan-favorite material. Maybe it's just because she takes such a prominent role here.
