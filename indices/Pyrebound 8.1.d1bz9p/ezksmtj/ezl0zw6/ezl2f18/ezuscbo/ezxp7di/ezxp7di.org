In a way I think its because of how things are set up. Right now we just have two characters to focus on, pretty much.

​

Personally I actually like Darun, because generally in books unless they really hone in on the misery they've caused with their actions or their actions can easily be imagined to cause misery (rape, murder, etc); I give a lot more leeway in the things they do. Also her mix of flirting, competence and desire for adventure/freedom is compelling - to me at least.

​

Also great job! really enjoying this. Though I do feel like its lacking a defined goal at the moment, because to be honest them toppling the leader of country seems pretty unreachable right now and thats the only goal/direction that is available right now.
