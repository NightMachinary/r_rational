I'm not sure I get where Rammash is going. He says he'll get killed "if" he ever goes back to Dul Karagi... but he's obviously going to sneak back in the city, to overthrow the government or something. So why does he act at the end of the chapter like it's a permanent exile that he can't do anything about?

Overall, I like the general shape of his relation with Darun (it reminds me of Fenn in WtC, except everyone involved is shaggier), but it is starting to feel a little... not grating, but painful to watch. Rammash still doesn't have any friend or positive relationships with anybody he respects. Darun and Rammash's relationship seem to end at her trying to get into his pants, and him treating her with contempt. I hope they move past that at some point.
