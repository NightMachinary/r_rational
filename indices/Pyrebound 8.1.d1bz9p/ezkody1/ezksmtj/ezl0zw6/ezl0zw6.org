It's not a typical relationship, for certain. I've deliberately omitted the gorier details of Darun's past on "rather too horrible to read about" grounds, but she's a very damaged human being who doesn't entirely know what she wants. (spoilers for this update, sorta) She was not sincerely coming on to him on the boat; she spent a lot of her childhood powerless and being used sexually, and enjoys using her sexuality to get power over people, in this case by needling Ram's more conservative hearth-reared mores. But even cheating at tiles, or shaking down male customers, is more of the same. Maybe this doesn't come across very clearly, IDK.

Ram is, at present, confused about his place in things. This will not repeat NOT last much longer. But the present goal is to get to Imbri and ask for her help puzzling things out. For the time being, he's an outcast. I hope this isn't too downbeat--I try to keep a full-chapter backlog (five updates), so reaction to reader feedback is greatly delayed.
