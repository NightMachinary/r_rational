Oh, I don't mind the magic part, I meant the "be a man, men don't give up their ideals" stuff. That's just a personal thing though, it's not a critique of the story. Didn't realize you were the author! I like it! I'm currently at 3.4, and enjoying it a lot. Any critique I have is just personal preferences, and I love the world system.
