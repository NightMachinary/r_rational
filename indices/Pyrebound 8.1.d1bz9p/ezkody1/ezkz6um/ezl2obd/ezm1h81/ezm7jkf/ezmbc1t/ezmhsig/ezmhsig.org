He does, it's simply a pet peeve, when half of his motivation for what he does in the bazu place is "I"m a man, and men keep their debts". I don't mean to trash on the story, I'm really enjoying it, and I appreciate that he gets called out for things(the girl in 4.2), rather than being hailed as some chosen one. To be clear, the "man" thing isn't a writing flaw, it fits the world and how he grew up, just an uninteresting motivation.
