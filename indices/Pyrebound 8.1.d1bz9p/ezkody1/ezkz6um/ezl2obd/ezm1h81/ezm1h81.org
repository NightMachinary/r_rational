Always glad to hear from readers; it's a serial so I can get feedback. I don't know what you mean by making a big deal about gender; where in the story are you at? The magic in this world (at least the human kind) is linked to biological sex, and this is a conservative society with traditional gender roles. If not exactly healthy ones, much of the time--hence the eunuchs.
