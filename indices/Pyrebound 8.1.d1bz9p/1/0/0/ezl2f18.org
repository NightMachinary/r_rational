Yeah, I got the "uses sex as a means to get control because ex-prostitute" part. But... I mean, that's really the sum of their relationship so far, her trying to an edge on him, and him basically slut-shaming her.

I get that it's realistic, but it's kind of bleak for that to be the only interaction we see between the two main characters so far.
