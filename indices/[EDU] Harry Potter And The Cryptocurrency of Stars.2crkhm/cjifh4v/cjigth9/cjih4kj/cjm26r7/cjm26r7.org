Well, no. BitCoin and Stellar are very different models -- as this story addresses. Stellar's like a distributed credit system, kind-of like a distributed version of how a lot of traditional banking works -- and can represent things like real dollars from a real institution (such as Stripe). BitCoin's more like virtual gold - a resource available in limited quantity, produced through an expensive process.
