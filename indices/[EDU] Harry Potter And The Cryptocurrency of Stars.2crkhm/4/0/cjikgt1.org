Or the API documentation for "amounts" in general:

This is distinct from the code path for /sending/ money as opposed to making markets in money -- on that one, you don't specify whose GBP you want to have sent, it will pick one acceptable to the sendee (if possible -- when not possible, your software should ideally recover for you, like Harry's wand does).
