  Cho Chang: Alright, as a favor: Stellarmus, I offer to buy one Weasley!GBP in exchange for ten stellars.

This doesn't seem to be how the system works though, I think the assumption is that 1 USD is worth 1 USD no matter where it comes from, as long as you trust the source. So Cho can decide to trust Weasley, and send an order to buy 1 GBP for 10 stellars, but as long as she trusts any other kinds of GBP they can also fulfill that order.

  We recommend you only trust one gateway per currency for that exact reason. You can only paid in currency issued from accounts you trust. Lets say your friend holds Euro credits from a gateway in London, and you live in San Francisco and therefore only hold USD credits from a gateway there. All she has to do to send you USD is specify "Send him X USD". She doesn't have to care about your issuer. It's taken care of by the protocol.
