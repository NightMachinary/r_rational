You wrote out the conversations very well. I clearly saw Paul as a gifted student with his quick, clear, and simple responses to Thufir's questions. I can't say how well you explained the concepts for the reader, because I already have a decent understanding of calibrating my confidence levels and predictions. But if it's at all possible, I recommend including an illustration of the graph that Thufir is drawing to make it easier for the reader to understand. In addition, include examples for the nine out of ten and two out of ten predictions that Paul made to help the reader better understand what was happening.

The only correction I actually want you to make is the 15 second breathing cycle Paul is doing for his meditation. I typically breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, breathe out for 5 seconds, and hold for 5 seconds in a 20 second cycle. It's called [[https://www.google.com/search?q=square+breathing&tbm=isch&imgil=3_w6sWrgDiuAhM%253A%253B8Gboznfl0NC-nM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fvisuals.autism.net%25252Fmain.php%25253Fg2_itemId%2525253D138&source=iu&pf=m&fir=3_w6sWrgDiuAhM%253A%252C8Gboznfl0NC-nM%252C_&usg=__9YEadTlIuODDBaYjQQJQ84kqIpk%3D#imgrc=3_w6sWrgDiuAhM%253A%3B8Gboznfl0NC-nM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvisuals.autism.net%252Fmain.php%253Fg2_view%253Dcore.DownloadItem%2526g2_itemId%253D138%2526g2_serialNumber%253D4%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvisuals.autism.net%252Fmain.php%253Fg2_itemId%253D138%3B900%3B870][square breathing]] and I was mildly surprised to read a version where Paul is breathing in immediately after breathing out.

I liked the story enough to follow it for at least the next few chapters. Try posting about this on a few other subreddits or social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.
