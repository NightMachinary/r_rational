Thanks!

The 5-5-5 breath cycle is from an actual book I read, but it was a book on mesmerism, so maybe not the best. At least the author thought 5-5-5 was good. Like you, I find the immediate in-breath unnatural... I figured it was "logical" though, because you are not gaining anything by holding for 5 seconds with nothing in your lungs! I'm going to take your advice nonetheless and change it to square breathing.

Quick googling found this, which recommends 4-7-8 (again with immediate in-breath after out): [[http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART00521/three-breathing-exercises.html]]

As for adding an illustration and more example predictions, I definitely agree, but I'll probably just move on to the next chapter rather than putting that much effort into this one... (to keep it a fun project for me).
