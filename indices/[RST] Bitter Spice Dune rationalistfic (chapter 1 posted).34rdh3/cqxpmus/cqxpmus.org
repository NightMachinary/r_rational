This looks very promising. /Dune/ is one of my favorite series (excepting the prequels of which we do not speak), so I'm glad to see rationalfic in that universe. I look forward to this with great interest. :D

How often do you plan to update?

Also, are you going to keep up the little blurbs at the start of each chapter in the style of the original books? I always enjoyed those.
