Right there, already something I hadn't thought of. Thank you. It does have the disadvantage that the most powerful enemy magicians can read it in your mind if you know it yourself, but that can be circumvented, depending on the situation.

Both sides have between tens of thousands to millions of magicians, depending on how long things are allowed to escalate. The White have a numerical advantage, the Black have research. However, the White do have the ability to /trust/ their researchers, while the Black have to account for the possibility that their own minions might try to supplant them.
