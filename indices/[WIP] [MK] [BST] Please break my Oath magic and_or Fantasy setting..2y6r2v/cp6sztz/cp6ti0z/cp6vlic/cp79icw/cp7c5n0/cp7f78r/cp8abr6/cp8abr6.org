It seems like either this oath could be simplified to be un-nuke-able, or even trivial oaths would be nuke-able.

Eg. You could simplify the above oath to be: "I will follow [person who made me swear this oath]'s commands in spirit and definition, to the best of my ability, even if I forget them." Then have that person explain Rouninscholar's plan. Give the plan top priority over future commands.

If that doesn't work: the nuke would completely counteract any form of mass-oath taking. Eg. Detect the pattern for a soldier's oath and then nuke all their soldiers. Black would only need to do this once. After that, the majority of white's military is gone.
