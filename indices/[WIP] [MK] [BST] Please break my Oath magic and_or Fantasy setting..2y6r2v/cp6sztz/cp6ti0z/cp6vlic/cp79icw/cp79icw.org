Nice try, but the very best mind readers can find out the oath even if you don't remember it, and if too many people are using similar oaths the Black will focus their efforts on developing soul magic that identifies particular patterns. The Black's WMD can also be tuned to target patterns in soul. Usually they use it to wipe out blood relatives of their prisoners, but they could target people with the same oath instead.

(I realize that I'm adding new information, and your solution is appreciated. I just don't want to add too many rules for your consideration, since I'd get fewer people willing to read all this if it was even longer.)

It's possible to defend against the WMD, but not on a mass scale. So they can keep key personnel safe, but the vast majority of people under the White would be very vulnerable if the Black could get hold of a prisoner under a too similar oath.
