I swear loyalty to rouninscholar. When he has no needs for me I will continue to live my life and try to get as many unique people as possible, with no qualifiers,to swear this same binding oath. I will not tell anyone about this oath, and I will seek to have it removed from my mind by a trusted associate as soon as possible. I will work with others who have taken this oath for anything that I do as a result of this oath. For the first year I am under oath will try my hardest to not get caught converting people. I will regularly find out if rouninscholar has need of my services, and accept word of a trusted person who has taken this oath of this fact, with an inquiry of when the information was ascertained by a primary source.

Victory in one?
