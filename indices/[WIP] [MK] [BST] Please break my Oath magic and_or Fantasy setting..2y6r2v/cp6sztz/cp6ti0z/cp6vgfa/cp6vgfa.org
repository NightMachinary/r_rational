Nicely, this is something that can be tested so you don't have to worry about what their current count is. You say the phrase, then you hold up an orange and say "tell me that this is pink." If they can, then they are now "turned off." Or, simpler, make them swear an oath that whenever they hear the phrase "betamajigger", they will always answer truthfully as to what their truthfulness state is.
