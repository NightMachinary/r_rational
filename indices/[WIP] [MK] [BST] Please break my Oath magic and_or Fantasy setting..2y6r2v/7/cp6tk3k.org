The obvious thing to do is to get your people to swear loyalty to the black.

Ok, so in order of priority your goals are.

1. Stop the nuke. The reusable nuke is going to destroy the world in a couple decades.

2. Ferment dissension within the ranks of the black so civil war can weaken them.

3. Destroy and weaken the armies of the black.

4. Destroy the civilian support for the armies of the black.

5. Achieve alliances with members of the black.

6. Enhance the armies of the white.

Onto the points. 1. So given that your top priority is to stop the nuke you need spies. Careful use of the oath can ensure people always give the correct answers, are loyal to the cause of the black, and will freely tell you everything you need to know and not reveal any information about the white to anyone.

You need to find where sacrifices are being gathered for nukes. You then need to find ways to disrupt it. Can you use genetic engineering and mind reading to disrupt it? Perhaps you can implant a mass mind suggestion into the sacrifices to have their dying wish be to slay some members of the black. Perhaps you can make them into beserkers who might kill the mages. Perhaps you can help them let you scry or die, by implanting radio devices in their bodies which communicate to you their location.

What would be an especially humiliating way to hurt nuclear bomb mages? Perhaps you could force them to take an oath to constantly empty their bladder and bowels and display them to the masses? Perhaps you could drug them into making an oath to devote their life to being a toilet for peasants in the street. That and torture, make being a nuclear bomb mage a very unpleasant career path for people.

You need to ferment chaos between the black leaders. 2. That means training fanatically strong mages, making them take oaths where they claim to be controlled by some black mage or other, and having them enact schemes, subtle and overt, against other black mages. Maybe they'll try an assassination and 'crack' under torture to reveal another black mage, maybe they'll steal civilians to set up a nuclear bomb against another black mage. Regardless, if questioned, they are loyal to the black due to their oaths. After

1. Nukes and

2. Dissension.

3. Make incompetent armies. Use your magic and oaths to create doppelg√§nger that can pass a casual inspection, replace people in enemy armies. Subtly encourage paranoia, dissension, vengeance, suicide, whatever you can to weaken the armies with corrupted leaders who literally can't say anything that indicates their loyalty to the white.

4. "Though usually they'll ask nicely before making any threats, and most of the really bad things aren't common knowledge, and the rumours are just rumours, after all. Keep your head down. Love your gods. Remember you are mortal." make this false. Have black oath'd servants. Explicitly and sometimes accurately tell people what the black intend to do with them, do such things to them, don't ask nicely. Ferment rebellions.

5. In the chaos some of the black are likely to seize a chance to even old scores. Create brainwashed oath bound dopplegangers of your own leaders, with similar magic and looks, who can promise particular black leaders that they don't care about their experiments and actions and that they'd be happy to ally with someone who helped them take out their enemy. And we're not expansionist no, we'd leave you alone if you left us alone. Although of course your research looks fascinating, we'd love to trade it for some of ours, privately of course.
