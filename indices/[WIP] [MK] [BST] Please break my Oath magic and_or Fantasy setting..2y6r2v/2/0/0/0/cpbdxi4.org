1) To take a look under the hood of the magic system, the reason lightning experts get genetics is that they manipulate life. So they get mind magic, healing, the power to fiddle with inheritance, and genetic rewriting. Earth or Water magic could technically be used instead, but that would be like a brain surgeon going in through the nose. Ultimately inheritance is not stored in genes in my world, but in magic, allowing for Lemarckian evolution. As a third year Genetics drop out, I feel uniquely qualified to depart from reality for no particular reason.

Ultimately it will turn out that all the elements are constructed, and lightning is the force that controls and animates matter into life. Water is really Time and Potential. Fire is Destruction (And less than perfect destruction releases heat, because something has been destroyed but part of the energy has been conserved). Earth is Space and Matter. And Air is not so much Souls & Destiny as a force built to keep these in check. Because Destiny is... All the gods are dead, but let's say they left something broken and inconvenient behind.

2) Yah. It would be. As part of what happens after the war is that people and religions turn really really anti-Science & Progress, I want to make it so that this change makes at least some sense from their perspective. That said, numbers have a few hundred years to recover between the end of the war and when the books start.
