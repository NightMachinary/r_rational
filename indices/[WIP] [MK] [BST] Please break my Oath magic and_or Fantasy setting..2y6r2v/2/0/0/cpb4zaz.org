1) I think lightning would serve as well or better than thunder for your purposes. As you said, none of the other names encompass much of the "element's" full range of capabilities either. That said, I'm not sure it makes sense to have an underlying science system that means only water manipulators can do magic genetics.

2) Fair enough. Both 100M and 2-3M are VERY small populations though. The U.S. alone has over 300M. In a hostile world ravaged by war it'd be easy for a population that small to just die off completely from accidents and attrition.
