1) I am considering this. The thing is, the elements are ultimately /all/ poorly named, and named by humans. I intend to have them talk about this, and reveal that these are just the labels slapped on by early humans on forces they did not understand. You are however not the first one to bring this up, and it seems that a significant fraction of people who have given me their opinion really don't like me calling it Thunder. So... maybe. I do eventually want the reader to go "The characters should really stop thinking the elements have anything to do with the names they have," and I figured naming the seemingly-electricity one Thunder was a reasonable step, but... Maybe Lightning would do just as well. I just don't like the idea of having people use both lightning bolts and non-physically-manifest Lightning magic in a fight.

2) Genetic engineering is extremely powerful, but while it is in the domain of the element which must not be named, it is an application of it that requires time, and trial and error. It /is/ powerful, and while the best healers can keep key personnel almost perfectly safe, part of what happens during this war is that most of the world's population dies. Mostly from disease, with nuking and combat distant seconds. They go from a world population of around 100 million to maybe 2-3 million at the end of the war, all spread out, every city nuked, engineered monsters and plant life that used to be inconveniences left to grow until they render entire regions uninhabitable. Halfway through the war a magical seal will be put in place which weakens magic, removing genetic engineering as an option, but before then... Yeah. A lot of people will die.

Thank you for your time and input!
