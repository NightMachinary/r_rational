Thanks! As I've said at other places in the thread, the actual books take place a few hundred years after this war. It'll build back up to world war levels of magic warfare, but I don't feel confident I could start in the middle of such a massive conflict and do it justice.

I have maybe 90% of a first acceptable draft of the first book. Just have a hole in the middle to fill.
