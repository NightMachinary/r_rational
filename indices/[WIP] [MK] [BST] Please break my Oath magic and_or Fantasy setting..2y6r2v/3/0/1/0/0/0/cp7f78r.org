The nuke is complicated. Like the soul destroying magic it's easier to destroy a lot than to do a surgical strike, but if there was a highly specific pattern in the oaths, then yeah it could wipe out every single person with a similar oath (Though there would still be a few safe locations where leaders can hide). Another problem with a self-propagating oath is that the Altar cannot be moved, and is a thousand miles away from the front, and a thousand more from Evil Capitol.
