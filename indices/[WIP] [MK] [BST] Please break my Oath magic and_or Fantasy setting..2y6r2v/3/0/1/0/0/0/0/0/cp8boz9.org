The White will suspect the nuke can be used that way beforehand, and will avoid mass oaths. They can set up local protection, but they need powerful magic to anchor that protection to, so unless it's exceedingly important they can only really protect a few key locations. In those locations they can use any oaths they want, but other than that they go in with the expectation that almost anything can be used to make the nuke go after someone. Ie, sacrifice someone to the nuke and you can make it go after everyone with a closeish blood relation, or everyone they have a two-way strong emotional bond to, or everyone who lives in the city they grew up in, or everyone whose soul has been bent in a sufficiently similar way by Oaths... The Altar rewrites the soul, so there isn't an oath 'marker' written in, just patterns that weren't there before. The soul in turn forces the brain to behave according to the oath. So yes, if the Black successfully captures someone and manage to take them to their capitol, they can wipe out almost everyone with a very similar oath. They are wary of broadening the targeting, because as there is no 'marker' that identifies those with Oaths, they would risk killing a lot of people without oaths who just happen to be similar. The White tailor their spies to be as similar as possible to ordinary Black followers for this very reason. So... The Black can up the death count very quickly if they want to, but they are going to pay a high price in loyal followers if they do.
