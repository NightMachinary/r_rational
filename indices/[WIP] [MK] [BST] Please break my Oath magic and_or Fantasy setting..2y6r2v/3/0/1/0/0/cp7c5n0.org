My goal was a self propagating oath, the secrecy was an attempt to make sure that it wasn't cut off as soon as the first person makes it. Also, notice that each person has their own year of secrecy, if my boss gets outed then I still have a year of recruiting. By 5 years I wanted the whole nation to be capturing heretics and forcing them to swear to me.

Is the nuke capable of killing all those people with no additional cost? I will have to rethink my strategy if that is so. I think I figured out how the end comes.
