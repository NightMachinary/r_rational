Take advantage of oaths... Lets get started.

First off, I don't have numbers for the sides, so I'm going to guess small, dozens and hundreds. Scale up. Go wild.

First I am going to grab two dozen really smart people. They will swear an oath to follow and research under the head of "Lab A" (give it a cool name, please) this oath will include the necessity to share all findings within the reports of the lab, and communicate with anyone the head of the lab designates.

The head of the lab will be given several oaths to find and learn about better tech, magic, oaths, etc. he will also have an alliegence oath and an oath about limits, he isn't allowed to start human sacrifice on a mass scale for example. The limiting oath will require him to go to me for requests, and to resubmit the requests as he sees fit, he won't take a no and just assume I'll never fund it.

3 hundred people. They are given oaths to move into Black Country and make friends, turn people and make sympathetic towns for the white.

5 hundred. Assassains. "I will do my best to kill the leader of the enemy. I will make no overt move and act as a perfectly loyal minion of the enemy for at least x (time period). Vary it. After the first few they won't be able to trust anyone.

Another few hundred. "I will become an agent of chaos when within enemy territory, I will look like an upstanding member of society and will not do anything where I can get caught"

"When in negotiations I will believe whatever I am planning on saying and I will say whatever X says to say." Bonus points if you make him able to read minds or otherwise communicate silently.

Those are the basics.

"I will not lie when I have heard the phrase "alphamajigger" an odd number of times total." Use this wording to turn off any oaths you don't want. Make another oath to never mention that part of the oath.

"I will design a better gun than what our armies are currently using."
