Changes to your personality do change your affinities with the elements, so going into a murderous rage certainly does increase your power with Fire. That said, mind magic is dangerous like brain surgery is dangerous. If you are really desperate or your allies are exceptionally skilled, your mind can be changed significantly, but sooner or later someone is going to slip up and leave you like Khepri in Worm without all the power up.

In my world the White use the Oaths to set up 'modes' people can shift into, and the Black get to experiment on prisoners and use more active forms of mind control.
