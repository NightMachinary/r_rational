It doesn't necessarily have to do with oaths, but the thing that instantly comes to mind is using belief-altering magic to give yourself arbitrary power with an element. This would be especially potent if you could create some triggers, i.e

About to cast a fire spell

You trigger the "I'm damn near incomprehensible with anger" belief/alteration

Cast the fire spell, either remove the belief or have a contingency spell to remove it

Enjoy the resulting overpowered spell.
