  What element gives you more proficiency in soul magic?
#+end_quote

Air magic. The soul is separate from the mind, but there is a lot of bleed over in both directions, and your mind can be rebuilt from your soul if your brain has been destroyed (At prohibitive energy expenditure). The Oaths bind the soul, so even death and resurrection does not cancel the Oaths.

  With the ability to self-modify, it's insanely easy to completely change yourself however you like.
#+end_quote

It is, and I have some characters who will do this, with a vague sense that I should do it on an industrial scale.

3) Yes. And the White will certainly protect themselves from any unlikely scenarios where agents of the Black try to trick anyone into swearing unfortunate Oaths.

4) This is something I am thinking about and will have to think more about. The very best best mind readers can detect Oaths with a 100% success rate, but it's resource intensive and there aren't many of them, so while triggers can be worked in, sleeper agents do have limitations, and have no hope of making it into the inner circles of the leaders of the Black. Personality rewrites are a go, though.
