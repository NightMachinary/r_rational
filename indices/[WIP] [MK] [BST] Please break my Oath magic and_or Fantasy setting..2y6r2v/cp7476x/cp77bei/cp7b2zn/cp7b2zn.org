It might not work very well, but if you want to hide evidence of an oath, just publicize the fact that you've taken a different oath. Say something like you are a Champion for morality and have taken oaths to never lie, to always be generous, etc, etc, etc... This way, when they check for oaths, they'll only see that you have taken an oath (which is already known, but not that you have a second one), and don't forget the idea of triggers to temporarily be able to ignore the first oath.

This obviously won't work if the Black Hand already know about the mechanics behind how oaths work, but if they don't know how flexible it can be, then this might work to some degree.
