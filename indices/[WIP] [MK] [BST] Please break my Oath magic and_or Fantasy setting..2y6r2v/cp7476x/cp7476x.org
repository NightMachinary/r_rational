What element gives you more proficiency in soul magic? It sounds like a good fit for Air elementals and they need something more substantual than prophecy, because the more useful variant of a few seconds belongs to Water instead.

Onto the oaths-

1) There is the obvious tricks to use for ensuring loyalty and perfect spies.

2) It's should be in mandatory use to make everyone perfectly disciplined and to eliminate akrasia.

3) Can you swear an oath that you will never follow any future oaths, unless you want to? If oaths conflict, then the earlier oath will win negating future oaths. This can block people from forcing you into oaths you don't agree with.

4) Key the oaths to triggers. There's an example somewhere on this thread that you can activate the oath for not lying when you hear a phrase. But this can be extended further by swearing an oath to try as hard as you can on a certain goal when you tell yourself "Goal Oath Activate For Goal [random thing that might involve petting a kitten]". Attach emotional trigger to an action to make yourself a good actor. Modify your personality by swearing oaths to be more charming, nicer, more brutal, more willing to kill in combat, etc, etc... You can do so many hacks to your personality, emotions, perspective on the world, estimation of skill (be more confident), predetermine responses to certain actions, and more. With the ability to self-modify, it's insanely easy to completely change yourself however you like.
