The main thing about the oath is that it makes this cheap and efficient. If the black have to use countermeasures that slows them down, it means the mages have less mana, it means they are more stressed from paranoia, they're a bit less calmed down from friendships with other mages, and hopefully with the efficiency that the oath brings it means one mage can say tie up or weaken a dozen or a hundred mages on the other side.

It means you can turn enemy spy networks to support your goals too.

Anyway, yeah, increasing the volume of this is good. A fair fight, or even an unfair fight using fancy magical tricks is expensive. An unfair operation that makes others fight for you helps you win the logistics war.

Good luck with all that.
