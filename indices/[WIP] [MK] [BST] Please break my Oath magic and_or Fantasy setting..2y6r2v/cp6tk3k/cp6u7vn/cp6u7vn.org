There are some great ideas here. There are countermeasures to them, but then war isn't about a 100% success rate, just about defeating your opponents. I'd thought of using the oaths to shape spies and saboteurs, but you are helping me see I need to scale up the sheer volume of harassment. The Black are already predisposed to mistrust and plot against each other, and over the course of the war they will pick each other off, and the White will certainly help this along and strike the occasional deal to weaken the Black as a whole.

I have the advantage of knowing who the (five) main leaders on each side and most of their successors are, and while it would drown you all in too much information to give you a bio on each of them, I already know roughly how the war develops, in which order I intend to bump them all off and when who is desperate, etc, so the ideas you mention stir concrete thoughts in me. Thank you.
