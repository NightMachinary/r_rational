Thanks, that's encouraging! It's also great that someone found the post again.

  Is soul-destruction the dominion of fire?
#+end_quote

Almost exclusively. You could destroy the soul in other ways, like you could destroy paper with a shredder. Wouldn't be as complete as burning it. The Soul is a construct, and Fire can destroy everything that makes it up.

  Are all magical things decompositional into these five categories?
#+end_quote

No. The elements were put in place by beings of great power to limit the ways in which will power could warp reality. If five extremely robust locations operating on fairytale logic (one per element) were destroyed, magic would return to a freer state, and humans would be even more free to munchkin the world to destruction. If the human world itself was destroyed, magic would be freer still. Basically, the beings were gods, and wherever they warped the fabric of reality, they shaped the ability of others to do so too. Things that were done with magic before magic was made more limited persist as they were, however, so there are some objects that cannot be replicated without tearing down the five locations. The gods are dead now (We may have killed the last one just before this war started), but their influence lingers. Given sufficient scientific progress, and assuming we don't destroy the universe first, godhood can be attained, and while the word god is vague, I have in mind exactly how they came about and work. It's just /too/ spoilery to include in a post like this.

  Can Earth's Space-bending be used to travel?
#+end_quote

So this takes some explaining. Technically, you can use Earth to compress space in the direction you want to move, shortening the distance you have to travel. This takes an incredible amount of energy to do, however. So, if it was absolutely necessary to travel a short distance /right now/, you could bend space to do it, if you are very good with Earth. It is /very/ unsustainable, though, and you would be much better off in most situations just raising a wall of earth behind you and pushing that wall forward, carrying you with it. Doesn't work so well in cities, of course. There is also flight in my world, though flying with magic is highly impractical in battle, since you will have to spend a lot of your energy and concentration on keeping from crashing, plus with offense almost always beating defense, flying is an excellent way to get yourself set on fire from halfway across the battlefield. So neither Earth nor any other element is super useful for most travel (though flying a few kilometers up is usually safe). You can however use Earth, if you have sufficient manpower for it, to permanently stretch places to pack in more space or create perpetual motion machines (Water falls 100 feet, flows to the side, only has to rise 10 feet to be back at the top of the fall), etc.

If the five locations were to break, then you could use Earth to create portals. Given my characters, this would absolutely destroy my setting in at most a few days, so in my books, I don't intend on this happening until late into the final book.
