With everything that is going on in this thread, I am really looking forward to you publishing.

I don't have much else left to add but this: Is soul-destruction the dominion of fire? Are all magical things decompositional into these five categories? Can Earth's Space-bending be used to travel (like Vista's power in Worm?)
