True. I did say my world is short on straight fights. Water experts can see anything coming, but you usually only get really good with one element, and knowing that all the air in the room is going to ignite in three seconds isn't much help if you don't have the incredible skill with Fire it would take to redirect all that incoming energy. You can create heat in my world, but only the most powerful Fire magicians can destroy it without moving it somewhere, and the Fire expert can keep going until the steel walls and ceiling around you melt, which isn't going to take very long. But yeah, barring exceptional skill differentials or being far outnumbered, whoever strikes a hit first just flat out wins.

The Hand names were assigned by historians afterward. Historians with very specific goals in mind. What they actually called themselves was "The True" for the Black Hand - because they did not have access to the Altar, and so it was common knowledge that they couldn't lie even if they wanted to, and the "White Hand" for the White Hand, because they wanted to slap the pure evil sticker on the opposition.

As for Evulz motivations, I have to say that the whole idea when I started to design this world was to make villains that I like. That said, they do have complex personalities. We'll see what people think of them when they show up in the actual text, but the motivations of the five original leaders of The True go something like:

Exuro, the Wildfire King: He started out good, and he has the prophetic gift of being able to see kindness and empathy in others. But he was raised to follow an authoritarian religion, and there was little room in those teachings for judging people by intentions or love for their fellow man. He was forced to take part in a war against the last people of another faith, and try as he might, he could not turn off the ability to see the good in those he had to destroy. Because his prophetic abilities were fairly strong, he saw the best in every person he had to kill. Eventually he sort of... snapped. He began to see kindness as weakness, the letter of the law as the only thing that mattered. He began to try to eliminate the spark of beauty in those he conquered. When the enemy was finally defeated, the high priestess of that religion cursed him with a share of her own prophetic vision. He no longer saw only kindness in others, but also what they were 'meant' to become in time, if they lived long enough. Seeing not only that his faith failed to distinguish between kindness and cruelty, but also the immense potential that was being lost with every person he killed, he lost his religion. And that can do horrible things to someone who has already sacrificed so much for their faith. He came to see the world as a torture chamber. And indeed there is reincarnation in this world, so it is a torture chamber without end. But in facing the 'world-ending threat' before the War of the Hands, he came to see that his god was very literally real, and that the god was trying to end the world. His god shared his conviction that life was suffering, and that the suffering must end. So when his Oath no longer bound him, when he had helped murder the god he finally understood, he set out on his own quest to end suffering. And because his conviction is absolute, he cannot tolerate that spark of goodness he sees in those he meets; the world must be black, and anyone who thinks differently is just deluding themselves. So when he sees someone of exceptional kindness, or someone destined to be a force for good in the world, he tortures them and breaks them, until they beg him to let it all end. And so, one soul after another, the suffering ends.

Poena, the Cruel Mother: An orphan girl with some demonic blood in her (The race of demons have since been utterly wiped out, but a few half breeds still exist) who saw her mother be burned alive for the crime of being raped by a demon, and attacked whenever she approached a human settlement. She was found by a band of robbers and taken as a sex slave. They discovered she had an incredible potential for healing magic, and she gradually rose from slavery to being a concubine of the gang leader. With the development of her healing ability her charisma blossomed, and she managed to manipulate her master until she was the real power in the gang. She got the most problematic people conveniently killed and just flat took over. Then she grew the gang, and she found that while nobody would care for a girl with demonic blood or listen to her out of respect, they would obey her out of fear or hopes of sexual favour. So she grew her gang of outlaws, and she carved out her own little kingdom. When the world-ending threat came, she saw her opportunity to get a seat at the real table, and she proved her leadership abilities and her exceptional talents for healing. And in time, for genetic engineering. Most of the worst plagues and monsters and nightmarish things in the world came from her labs, and the more people feared her, the more powerful she grew. Her motivations are as simple as they are unfortunate. She trusts nothing but her own power, and she fears death and weakness. She wants to never die. She wants control. She wants /absolute/ control. Her end game includes rewriting everyone in the world with mind controlling cancer. She's the Mengele character.

Graven, the Last of Dragon Blood: The last human alive with the blood of the ancient race of dragons flowing in her veins. She ages very slowly, and was long the ruler of an old kingdom. From an early age she had prophetic visions of bringing back a lost age to the world, of gods and magic more powerful than the elements, and of destiny. She was brought down by Exuro's empire, and condemned to live for centuries in a dungeon until she died of old age. Eventually the world-ending threat emerged, and her prophetic powers being extremely strong, she was rescued by those who would save humanity at any cost, even be it serving those once condemned as evil. She used her prophetic abilities to turn the winds of the war in humanity's favour, and being once again in charge she saw renewed the visions of eternal empire and of destiny's completion. She doesn't have the ability to see into future as Water experts do, but her dreams and visions show her snippets of the future years ahead, of things that must be and things that must not. And in the shadow she weaves. Destiny must take its course.

Gyges, Inviolate: An inventor who cares little for world affairs, but who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is obsessed with his own safety. So while they didn't need him to take up a leadership role to start with, he made all his help against the world-ending threat conditional on ever more resources and scientists to control. He sits now on his throne in his extra-dimensional maze, laying traps and making weapons of war. He blinded and deafened himself to let his magical senses grow more acute. The others of the Black need him to make weapons for him, and honestly it would probably kill them to go after him anyway. He can wait until they have everyone else taken care of. In the end he won't be paranoid enough, and Graven will capture him alive, rewrite his mind to her liking, and stuff him into a machine so he can be an absolutely loyal machine mind and take care of her domain for her while she focuses on the war.

Remina of Otherworldly Grace: Alone among the Kings and Queens, Remina is not human. He is the brother of an otherworldly queen of Faerie. He was sent to the human world to aid in defeating the world-ending threat, and while here he found that he quite liked being number 1. He does not age, and so has a nice, cushy eternity to look forward to if he does not get himself killed. He sees the world as his own personal sand box, and in time, when the other nine leaders have been defeated, perhaps as a base from which to attack the world of his sister.

Melicia Seldon: Not an official leader. A bureaucrat who once made a mistake, and lost everyone she loved. In her jealousy and grief she is manipulating the Black Hand from behind the scenes, keeping either side from getting the advantage, keeping the escalation going. She is trying to change the nature of the "reusable nuke", which is called the Tower of Souls. If she ever succeeds, and it will take decades if she does, there will be nothing left of the world but fire. If she has any pleasure left in this life, it is in manipulating people to destroy everything they love.

...Long again, but I wanted to show that the baddies have personality.
