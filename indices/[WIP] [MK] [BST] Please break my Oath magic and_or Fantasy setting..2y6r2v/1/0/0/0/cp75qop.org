The economic and social implications are interesting. It is surely not feasible to replace each and every contract with an oath, but for important contracts (multi-million $ deals, big lawsuits, political campaigns) it seems necessary. This means a very centralized society. Every enterprise, every court, all of government is concentrated at the capital city with the altar. The rest of White's realms is second class, because nobody with ambitions would want to live there.

Also, I imagine a certain social stigma if you refuse to take an oath or maybe even if you never took an oath. Are you really a reputable citizen if you never swore an oath? There is probably also a counter movement of philosophers and anarchists see the bad effects of the altar. Maybe sponsored by Black?

Do you have to pay for access to the altar? Certainly, demand is very high and waiting queue long. So rich and influential people have easier access. Thus, taking lots of oaths is a display of power. So rich kids make bindings oaths for party games, while the middle class waits months to make contracts binding, and the poor ignore it.
