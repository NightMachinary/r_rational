I had not given thought to people paying for access to the altar. Certainly it is controlled by the military, but life must go on even in war times, so I imagine I will make it so that people can apply for oaths for non-war related reasons. The White don't have a perfect society, but I don't think I would let it be a privilege of the rich. Though travel there from far away would be. Hm. I guess life isn't fair.

Certainly there is a massive stigma against anyone who has not sworn any oaths, though that would only be close to the Altar. Further away it would be a mark of distinction to have taken an oath, but not something most could do. You might fly someone there if it was really important, but there are no airplanes, so we are talking using highly trained military personnel to transport one or a few people at a time, likely for a whole day, or two if you have to bring them back again.
