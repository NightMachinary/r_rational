Is there a logistics problem? You plan to have millions of people take multiple oaths, most certainly at multiple times in their life. Since there is no teleportation, travel is a burden. Is it really worthwhile to send someone to another continent to take on oath to go to the dentist? How many oaths per day is the throughput? For [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba][comparison]]: "In 2013, the number of pilgrims coming from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform hajj was officially reported as 1,379,531."

Can the altar be moved?
