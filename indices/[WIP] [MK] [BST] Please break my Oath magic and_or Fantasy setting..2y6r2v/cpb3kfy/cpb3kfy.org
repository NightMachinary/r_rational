1) Please, please call your thunder mages lightning mages. Like, really. Please. Unless you change their powers from electricity-based to sound-based.

2) Bioweapons are terrifying in the modern age, but your medicine seems pretty absurdly advanced. If people can regrow organs from scratch (and resurrection exists), there is at least a small pocket of people for whom bioweapons are not a threat. However, based on your description you made it sound like extreme healing powers are less common than extreme bioengineering powers. This means, in a no-holds-barred conflict, that basically everyone loses, unless the genetic engineering is good enough to turn humanity into rapidly mutating/reproducing things so that the immune defenses can stay sufficiently ahead of the pathogen offenses.

Country A launches bombs/suicides/whatever that infect solid seed populations of country B with the most horrifically weaponized smallpox imaginable. For each infected, the infection will naturally spread via every possible vector to another 100 victims on average. Symptoms don't appear for weeks, but it's contagious in days, and it's impossible to diagnose because it hides in the nervous system like herpes, so attempts at quarantine would be too late and mostly fail. Day 1: 400 infected. Day 5: 40,000 new infected (4400 total). Day 10: 4,000,000 new infected (4,044,000 total). By the time symptoms show, most of the world is infected, and promptly dies.

This isn't strictly accurate, it glosses over details and hurdles, but if you can make magic viruses it's going to be at least that bad.
