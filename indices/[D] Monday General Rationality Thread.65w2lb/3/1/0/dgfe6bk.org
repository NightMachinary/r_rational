  This is a really cool idea, but I'm not sure where the demand would come from.

Video games already tend to have policies it banning bots. They would be /better/ at the job, but they just wouldn't be allowed to play.

The decision, would be between paying underlings, or not having underlings (at least for very large groups). And as it turns out, stuff like that already happens-- esports. Of course, I'm not expecting those to be the direct motivator.

Rather, I expect companies to design their business model /exclusively/ around whales, and making them feel powerful as they lead massive armies/cut through disposable pawns, as the regular person won't be able to afford the in-game cash shop. But then a problem occurs-- if an average person is getting shit on by whales, why even play a certain MMO over another? And I think the answer to that is out-of-game compensation by companies, in a similar way as youtube pays people who make content so they draw other people to youtube, and then youtube takes a cut of their profit.

It's similar to what I see in Planetside 2-- even though the devs primarily target whales (that is, people willing to pay for a subscription), they still need to consider non-paying players. Because they're effectively the product used to keep the whales playing.

From there, while my "armies of online mercenaries" may or may not be the way game companies choose to orient their business model, it's still possible to see how wealth can be redistributed on a large scale through capitalism even when robots are mostly better than humans in every scenario.

Of course, you're right:

  But at the end of the day ... if the "dancing for rich people's amusement" industry is worth a billion dollars, and feeding everyone on Earth costs two billion dollars, we're going to have a problem

But then the solution might not necessarily be UBI, but reducing the population of the planet by half. After bear-human-level AI, poor people won't be able to impose their political will through force, because military robots don't feel bad about killing poor people. So my argument is basically that in the transition period, there will still be enough employment (when combined with COL decreases) to prevent the sort of violent unrest that would provoke the political will to have UBI.
