  Imagine an MMO that simulates wars where most people play as mercenaries, and the rich can hire them for a dozen dollars a day, with the company that owns the IP getting a cut of that payment. Right now, something like that doesn't work primarily for networking reasons-- whales already exist that will drop hundreds a day on a game.

This is a /really cool/ idea, but I'm not sure where the demand would come from.

- Because you need lots of players on your side to win? Bots are generally better than humans.
- Because you want servants to do the boring parts so you can focus on the fun stuff? We have this, it's called gold farming. It doesn't really look like what you describe.
- Because it makes them feel good to boss around lesser players? Maybe. But under current systems, whales get to /beat up/ lesser players, or to lead them in exchange for in-game scraps rather than real money.
- Because you just want to spend money to show off how rich you are? Here's an in-game hat that costs a million dollars, knock yourself out.

Game developers have no incentive to build games that funnel money to people who are not game developers. When it happens (again, see gold farming), they generally try to stamp it out and/or replace it with a version where the money goes to them rather than other people.

And game devs have a natural advantage here. It's pretty much always going to be cheaper for them to provide whales with gold conjured out of nowhere, NPC minions, or "I win" buttons than it is for other players to do the same. And if it's not, then they can easily change the game rules until it is.

Of course, this is just an example.

But at the end of the day ... if the "dancing for rich people's amusement" industry is worth a billion dollars, and feeding everyone on Earth costs two billion dollars, we're going to have a problem.

Even if feeding everyone on Earth only costs half a billion dollars, what if there's only demand for two billion rich-person-dancers? There are diminishing returns to these things. Once you've exhausted even the truly horrible ways to amuse rich people, like genuine hand-made pyramids, what then?

I think it takes more than "well, labour will be cheaper if living expenses are cheaper" to demonstrate things are going to be OK.
