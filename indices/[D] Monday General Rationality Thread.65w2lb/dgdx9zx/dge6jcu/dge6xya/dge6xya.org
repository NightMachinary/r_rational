Maybe the smaller garden had greater value to him than a large garden? So by choosing the smaller garden he WAS maximizing his values. And perhaps if he spent too much time pondering how to make his garden exactly how he likes it, he will have less time to make the garden exactly how he likes it, and even less time to spend in it overall. So by not taking too much time to think about the decision of big garden or small garden, he was also maximizing his values?

Just a thought.
