What combination of traits leads to paperclipping?

A well-defined utility function is a must. (Most) humans don't have a well-defined utility function. Is that sufficient? If we could work out the formula for the human utility function, would that automagically make all humans into paperclippers?

Actually, the human utility function probably integrates a bunch of diminishing returns and loss aversion and scope blindness, so that probably balances out and makes it seem like humans aren't paperclippers.

Programming in multiple utility functions with diminishing returns? Probably someone smarter than me has already thought of that one before.
