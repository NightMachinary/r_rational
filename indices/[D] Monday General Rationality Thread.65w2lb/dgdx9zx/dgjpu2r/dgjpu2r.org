I believe that humans, and any ration agent, can be modeled using one single utility function, but the output of the function looks like a weighted average of a bunch of more basic utility functions. Humans numerous things like health, sex, love, satisfaction, lack of pain, popping bubble wrap, etc... Each of these imparts some value to the true utility function, with different weights depending on the individual person, and also depending on the time and circumstances they occur in. So, if we want an AI to be well behaved, I think we need something similar. To get more specific, I think the features that are relevant here are:

Robustness: There are a wide range of actions that provide positive utility, and a wide range that provide negative utility. This means that if certain actions are unavailable, others can be taken instead in the meantime. Some people go there entire lives without eating a certain food that someone else eats every day. Some people enjoy learning about random things, some people hate it and would rather carve sculptures. This allows for specialization among individuals, it allows for adapting to new circumstances that never existed when evolution or programming occurred initially, and it prevents existential breakdowns when your favorite activity becomes impossible. Even if all actions exist to serve the spreading of your genes, sex doesn't need to be the only thing you think about since you only need to do it a few times in your entire life (or even zero if you help by supporting other humans with similar genes). A robust utility function will probably look like a weighted average of a bunch of simpler utility functions.

Diminishing Returns: The amount of utility gained from actions tends to decrease as those actions are repeated. Maybe you get 10 points the first time you do something, then 8, then 6.4, and so on. Maybe it's exponential, maybe it's linear, who knows, but the point is it goes down so that eventually it stops being worth the cost and you go do something else instead. People get bored of doing the same thing repeatedly, but also people get used to bad things so they don't hurt as much. Usually the utility goes back up over time, like with eating or sleeping, but it might be at different rates for different activities.

I think these two combined prevent paper-clipping. Even if you deliberately program a machine to make paper-clips, you can prevent it from taking over the world if you give it a robust and diminishing utility function instead of just saying "maximize paperclips". A robust machine will also care about preserving human life, protecting the environment, maintaining production of whatever the paperclips are used for, preserving the health of the company that built it and is selling the paperclips, etc. Manufacturing paperclips is likely its primary goal and the most significant weight in its utility function, but if it starts to make so many that they can't be sold anymore then it will slow down production since the costs start to outweigh the diminishing gains.
