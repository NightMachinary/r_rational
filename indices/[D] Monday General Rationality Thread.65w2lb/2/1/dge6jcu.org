Humans can't become paperclippers because most human goals cannot be endlessly maximized. For example if someone wants to have free time than thinking to much about optimalizing is counterproductive. If someone wants to have children he doesn't think about infinite amount. /"The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm."/
