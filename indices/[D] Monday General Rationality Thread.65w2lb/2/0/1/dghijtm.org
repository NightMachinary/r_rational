I don't quite think so. There are sensory experiences we can have (eg: rewards) which /change/ the internal models our brains use to represent motivation and plan action. A paperclipper, by definition, never updates its motivations. Thus, with a human, you can argue: you can bring to their attention facts which will update their motivations. With a paperclipper, you can't: unless you're giving them information about paper-clips, they'll just keep doing the paper-clip thing.
