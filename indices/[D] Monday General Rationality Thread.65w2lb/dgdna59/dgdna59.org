I'm trying to find my rhythm doing sports; I really don't know what I'm doing, but I'm trying to be more fit and more... I dunno, energetic?

Do you guys have any advice on what kind of training regimen I should adopt? How should I even decide? I'm not trying to lose weight (I'm kinda scrawny), and while I would like to gain muscle mass, it's not really a priority for me. What worries me most is akrasia; I've still haven't managed to keep doing the same sport for two years, and often miss sessions every few weeks/months (my beeminder page has a few bumps).
