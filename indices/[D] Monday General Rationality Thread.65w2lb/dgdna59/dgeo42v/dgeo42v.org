I'm a cycle commuter, it's the only way I'd get exercise apart from walking the dog.

Using a bicycle in your daily life is an easy way to force yourself to exercise, I would recommend it if you can make it work. Even one or two days a week (like I used to do when I had a 14km commute each way) can be really helpful.
