  Relatedly this has reminded me about my biggest problem with the idea of a totally material universe. Something about consciousness always seems weird to me coming purely out of meat. I acknowledge that it almost certainly does, but there's a part of me that wants to go. I think therefore there is something more to meat to me.

What dissuaded me from this perspective is the idea that if the mind is nonphysical that doesn't help questions about consciousness. "Just" because there's something nonphysical interacting somehow with brains, why does /that/ lead to consciousness?
