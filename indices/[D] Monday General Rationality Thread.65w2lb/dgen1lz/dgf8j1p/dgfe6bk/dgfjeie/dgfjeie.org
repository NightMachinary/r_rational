  But then the solution might not necessarily be UBI, but reducing the population of the planet by half. After bear-human-level AI, poor people won't be able to impose their political will through force, because military robots don't feel bad about killing poor people.

I feel like "war between the poor and the rich kills half the planet" is the very /definition/ of "a problem". This is exactly the sort of thing UBI is intended to prevent!

You may be right that it still wouldn't produce the political will to institute UBI because "poor people won't be able to impose their political will through force", but ... at what point in this scenario was democracy abolished? The moment strikes ceased to be effective?
