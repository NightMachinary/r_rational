an edit of something I posted to spacebattles a little earlier, explaining why I don't think UBI will happen. Does anyone have counterpoint? I'm honestly a little iffy about my own reasoning, and it's the sort of thing I don't want to be wrong about because it affects my long-term plans.

--------------

I don't think UBI is going to happen, but not for the reasons everyone else has been talking about. Assume computers can automate basically every job, and assume that computers can do so in a way that's better and cheaper that people can. Considering how cheap cost of living can be for humans, that would mean cost of living can become even cheaper. Thus, people are cheap enough to hire not because it's necessary, but because it's /prestigious./ Imagine an MMO that simulates wars where most people play as mercenaries, and the rich can hire them for a dozen dollars a day, with the company that owns the IP getting a cut of that payment. Right now, something like that doesn't work primarily for networking reasons-- whales already exist that will drop hundreds a day on a game.

So I predict the confluence of extremely cheap labor and better AI will result in the continuing existence of a job market no matter how good automation gets. There will probably be a period where massive job deficits exist and cause civil unrest, but COL still isn't low enough for this to work, but I don't think that period will last long enough to cause the political will to have UBI.

My back of the envelope calculation goes like this:

Let's assume Moore's law more-or-less holds, and a human brain requires ~an exaflop of computing power. An i7-4790k has a theoretical maximum of 43.92 gigaflops. Obviously that's never getting hit, but it's an older machine regardless. Therefore it'll be about 2*log2(10^18/(43.92*10^9))=~49 years until a home computer is as computationally powerful as the human brain. That doesn't necessarily mean we're getting strong AI then, but AI will still be incredibly smart and relatively cheap by at most 2070. And considering that's just for near-human-level AI, which isn't necessary for most jobs, I think we'll be hitting peak automation at least a decade earlier for basically every single job. so that gives us 40 years to play with, so until ~2060.

Meanwhile, coming from this end of the scale, according to the [[https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm][Bureau of Labor Statistics]], by 2024 they expect that ~25% of jobs will be in "Goods-producing, excluding agriculture," or "Retail trade" or "transportation and warehousing." These will probably get automated first, but it'll take a while, and some people will sucessfully re-train. On the downside though, losing that many jobs will likely cause a recession of some sort. But still, I don't see unemployment breaching the mid-thirties until past 2035 or so. And even that won't be enough for massive civil unrest if Greece is any indication.

That effectively leaves about 25 years for UBI to be implemented. Now, it's not impossible that UBI gets implemented in that window-- 25 years is a decent amount of time, but I personally don't think a government will be able to reform the entire welfare system around it in anywhere near that timeframe.
