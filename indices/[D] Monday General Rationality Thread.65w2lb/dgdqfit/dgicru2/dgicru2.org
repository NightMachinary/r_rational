I think of religion as an exploit. I think that we are evolutionary rewarded for figuring things out, understanding our environment, and feel low level fear when we don't.

As we became more and more intelligent, we came upon questions that can not be answered with things like "tiger bad", "blue berries good". Questions about life, death, purpose. Being unable to fully understand our "environment" we feel anxiety.

Along comes religion and gives simple, understandable answers. And once we accept those answers, the anxiety drops away and we are rewarded by ancient systems put in place to promote adaption.

Combine this vulnerability with another vulnerability - our sponge-like to ability to soak up information as young, often with little or no verification, and you have a potent security hole for a "memetic virus".

Other traits, like wanting to conform to the tribe, be in the "in" group, etc. add to this effect.

Struggling with the nature of consciousness is fine. Taking the easy answers not from evidence but just to feel good is in my opinion less fine, in any context.
