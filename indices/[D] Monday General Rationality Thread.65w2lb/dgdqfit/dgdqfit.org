This is perhaps slightly off topic, but I ended up at a church service again the other day. I'm assuming like myself most of the people here aren'tâ€‹ religious, but every time I do go to a church service I'm stuck again by the staying power of the institution. It's a meme in the fullest of the original meaning I feel. With a more negative mind you can see how the various institutions work to propel it on. The social censor is obviously mostly gone now, but I still felt bad having to step out of the line going up for communion. You can really see how in days gone by the church would be nearly inescapable.

Relatedly this has reminded me about my biggest problem with the idea of a totally material universe. Something about consciousness always seems weird to me coming purely out of meat. I acknowledge that it almost certainly does, but there's a part of me that wants to go. I think therefore there is something more to meat to me.
