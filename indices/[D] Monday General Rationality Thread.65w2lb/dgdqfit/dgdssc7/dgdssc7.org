  Relatedly this has reminded me about my biggest problem with the idea of a totally material universe. Something about consciousness always seems weird to me coming purely out of meat. I acknowledge that it almost certainly does, but there's a part of me that wants to go. I think therefore there is something more to meat to me.

Try reading up on predictive coding and see if your intuitions don't start to shift the other way. For me, the Hard Problem sounds like a problem if I think of the brain as a passive, bottom-up signal transducer, but not if I think of it as an active, top-down signal predictor.
