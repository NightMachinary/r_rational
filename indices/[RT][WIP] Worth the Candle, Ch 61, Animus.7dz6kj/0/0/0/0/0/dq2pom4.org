I have SAD (mostly) handled now, through a combination of different remedies. I'm (mostly) mentally/emotionally back to how I was before. The big problem is that I'm sleeping two extra hours a night (from 5-6 hours during summer, up to 7-8 now), which directly cuts into my writing time, because that's where the slack in my schedule is.

I was planning to cut back on sleep a half hour at a time to see whether that's one of the important interventions ... but I'm currently sick, so that experimentation will have to wait until I've recovered.
