Looks like a plan is starting to come together.

So both sides have something to gain from cooperating, yet are willing to (or at least considering to) screw each other over for a stronger negotiating position. It's an interesting situation.

Fallatehr is almost sympathetic. Makes it easy to forget just how dangerous he is.

  “And you, quarter-elf,” said Fallatehr, addressing his attention to Fenn.

  “You're a half-elf?” asked Fallatehr. “Descended from wood elf stock?”

I think the implication is that Fallatehr doesn't consider wood elves to be "true elves".

As for Fenn's age... Juniper is 17, Amaryllis is most likely 17, my guess for Fenn's age was early twenties though 33 is not that suprising considering she's a half-elf.\\
I think I can share some of Juniper's experience in that it does affect how I think of her on some visceral level, and then I'm surprised at that because I don't think human cultural expectations of what age means really apply here.
