Have you read Mother of Learning? If not the author has side chapters that do world building and it is usually common knowledge things or drawings of creatures and stuff.

I think you could do this also, maybe have junipers notes on some of his campaigns or monsters that may or may not show up or even books that juniper has read while in the simulation. I know you explain things very well with the side characterization of the dnd group.

Anyway I absolutely love your story, it is equal to HPMoR and MoL. Keep up the good work, if you have any suggestions for other good lit RPGs i would like them to.
