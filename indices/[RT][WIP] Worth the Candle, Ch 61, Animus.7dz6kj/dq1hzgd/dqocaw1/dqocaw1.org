  Incidentally, is there absolutely no fanart of this story? I would be willing to donate some money so you can eventually commission a cover/banner or whatever, this story absolutely deserves it. If you have a donation link available, hook me up.

I was thinking about contacting an artist to make a banner for topwebfiction on a sub like [[/r/characterdrawing]] where they do pro bono work. But a commission might be way easier.

In my mind's eye I had this high quality banner of a d20 DND die on a piece of old parchment with the title 'worth the candle' imprinted into dripping wax from a nearby candle.
