  “The prison is not warded,” said Grak with a furrowed brow.

  “It is an innate feature of this place, not a ward,” said Fallatehr.

I have no idea how that is meant to work. God-related? Aerb naturally has places where teleporting is impossible, for some reason, so a prison was built there?

This is the first time I've felt like something in the worldbuilding was awkwardly and suddenly put in there just to amplify the challenge, so I hope we'll actually get an explanation. If would be bad if every single arc there was some new convenient reason they couldn't just teleport out.

That said, I loved every other part of the chapter (does Fenn even know how old Joon is, btw?), and I assume we're going to see how a soul mage fights next chapter, which should be interesting.

Incidentally, is there absolutely no fanart of this story? I would be willing to donate some money so you can eventually commission a cover/banner or whatever, this story absolutely deserves it. If you have a donation link available, hook me up.
