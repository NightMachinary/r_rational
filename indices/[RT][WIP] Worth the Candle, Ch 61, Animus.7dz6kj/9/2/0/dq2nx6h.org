Fixed the typo, thanks.

  From Arthur's seeming non sequitur, I assume there should be a "no offense" in here? Or am I missing something?

No, this is just something that my friends and I find funny. Someone says something insulting, and you say "none taken", in the same way that if you do something for someone and they don't say "thank you", you might say "you're welcome" in order to imply that the other person should have thanked you.
