Good chapter. I'm wondering if the Spirit skill on his skill sheet is soul magic, and if it isn't then how learning how soul magic will go. So far as we've seen, he hasnt tried magic that explicitly isn't on his character sheet, with the possible exception of flower magic. Would he still gain skill at an inhuman rate, but not get the bonuses from leveling it up?

I also want him to learn water and steel magic, or at least have them described a bit more fully. He doesn't currently have much in the way of combat magic, so even spending a week on those two would give him a few options. (I'm not counting blood magic currently, because it mostly just makes him briefly stronger or faster. The fire hand isn't good for much in an even fight)

  He gestured behind him, where the others were standing. Some were talking amongst themselves, which I took as a good sign; they didn't have telepathy, and didn't work with unanimity of purpose.

That's a bad assumption to make with a smart opponent.
