So, is Nonanima a species designation? Some form of undead or otherwise just fracking terrifying? Or is Nonanima a proper name, that is, someone sufficiently infamous that it still creeps them out centuries later, like meeting Vlad the Impaler in person ? Either way, Narrative says: Say hi to your new party member ;) I wonder if that is how things will go down, tough.
