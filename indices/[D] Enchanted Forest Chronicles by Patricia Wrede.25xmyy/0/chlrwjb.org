I'm a big fan of these books. I am not sure that I'd praise the [[#s][plot spoilers]] That said, the set of antagonists had fairly understandable goals they were working towards by fairly reasonable methods. It was only their preparation for others' interference I would fault.

Also, many of the characters are great and wonderful. I am a big, big fan of Morwen.
