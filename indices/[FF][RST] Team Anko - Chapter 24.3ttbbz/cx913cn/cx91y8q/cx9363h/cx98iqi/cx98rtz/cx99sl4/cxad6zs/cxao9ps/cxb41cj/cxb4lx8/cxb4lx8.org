Yeah, I know the basic structure -- tree; fruit; Rabbit chakra; oh noes! Sons have chakra!; Jyubi; Sage / world chakra / nine bijuu; Tobi/Madara eyeball Fox; fox sealed; Orochimaru stupid but resurrecting-y; Akatsuki; Black Zetsu (vaguely; I only know from wiki); eye of moon / worldwide wireheading-upload; tree. There's a few connecting bits that I'm fuzzy on, but the power levels are an utter blank for me.
