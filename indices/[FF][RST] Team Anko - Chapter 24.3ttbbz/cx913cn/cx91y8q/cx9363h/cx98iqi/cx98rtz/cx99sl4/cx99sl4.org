In my world Jiraiya is the best seal-smith alive, just as Tsunade is the best medic and Orochimaru is the best psychotic Kage. Other people know seals, though, and can make sense of Naruto's seal. Maybe they won't understand it as well as Jiraiya, much like an undergrad math major won't understand Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in the same degree as someone like Taylor. Both of them can work with it, though.
