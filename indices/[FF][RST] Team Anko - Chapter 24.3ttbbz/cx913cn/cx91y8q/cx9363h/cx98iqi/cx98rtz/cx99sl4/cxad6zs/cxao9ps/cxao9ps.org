  So in terms of raw combat potential, do you rate Orochimaru as one of the highest in your setting?
#+end_quote

I'd say so, yes. The other Kage, the other Sannin if they could choose the battlefield, an unsealed Bijuu...anything / anyone else I can think of offhand, he'd eat them for lunch. (Legendary figures like the Sage and Kaguya aren't part of this setting.)

Most of the reason he's so dangerous is because he's both skilled and versatile, so he can fight outside an opponent's envelope. When fighting Gai or Tsunade, he'd take it to range. When fighting a range specialist, he'd go melee. If he faced someone who was strong at both ranges he'd go underground and turn it into a stalking/ambush fight.

  The power creep got... pretty blatant by the end there in Canon,

I actually know very little about canon (EDIT: canon's power levels). I gather by the end they were blowing up the moon and such?
