  Big sigh of relief at the beginning of the chapter, but very uneasy feeling at the end,

  -The fox is clearly playing the role of the Devil. All smiles and correctly-worded contracts, but he'll have a lot of fun screwing you over. And how do we know that Bijuu keep their promises? We only have the Fox's word on it.

Well of course bijuu always keep their promises -- Kurama said so and bijuu always keep their promises so it must be true. Silly reader, pay attention!

  -I understand that you are spending less time on the chapters due to other constraints, but I worry that you are falling into a few 'bad fic' tropes, such as 'Kurama upgrading Naruto' and 'Kurama the Sensei'. These lead to the slippery path to a superpowered Naruto beating up everyone while being smarter and faster at the same time.

Oh, I am going to have /so much/ more fun than that. Wait for it. :>
