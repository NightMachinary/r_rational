Big sigh of relief at the beginning of the chapter, but very uneasy feeling at the end, for two separate reasons:

-The fox is clearly playing the role of the Devil. All smiles and correctly-worded contracts, but he'll have a lot of fun screwing you over. And how do we know that Bijuu keep their promises? We only have the Fox's word on it.

-I understand that you are spending less time on the chapters due to other constraints, but I worry that you are falling into a few 'bad fic' tropes, such as 'Kurama upgrading Naruto' and 'Kurama the Sensei'. These lead to the slippery path to a superpowered Naruto beating up everyone while being smarter and faster at the same time.
