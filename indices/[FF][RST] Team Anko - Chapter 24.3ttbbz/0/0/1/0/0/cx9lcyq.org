The perspective is an ensemble of Anko's team, from what I can recall, and applying a model like the Hero's Journey isn't enough to say for certain because all of them fit.

Skimming the first chapter, after the introductory scene with the Hokage you have third-person omniscient. Second chapter, similar. Perspectives are definitely an ensemble, blended even within scenes (I've heard that third-person omniscient i.e. multiple characters is hard to do well, so good job).

I can't say for certain that there even is a main protagonist. At the very least, even if Naruto is the main character (which I don't feel is supported by the text, though you may intend it to be), there are three perfectly functional understudies once the Fox melts his brain.
