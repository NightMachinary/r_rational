If Hideo could survive in the firestorm, he wouldn't need Naruto to go rescue people.

Anyway, there's no end state specified for the rescue attempt nor is it specified what it means for Hideo to guide Kurama to civilians, so the fox can just follow Hideo around for 24 hours and then head off to do whatever.

Well, the point is that making a binding contract with someone who's smarter than you and is trying to subvert it will never work, so the only thing one should be focusing on is how to ensure that whomever you're making a deal with is trustworthy and well-inclined in the first place.
