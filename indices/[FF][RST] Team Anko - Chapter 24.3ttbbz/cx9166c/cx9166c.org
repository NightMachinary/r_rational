Is the thing about bijuu senses being incompatible with Naruto's mind true? I may just be paranoid, but:

#+begin_quote
  You understand that you won't have direct access to my bijuu senses since you lack the requisite brain structures.
#+end_quote

/Understanding/ that to be the case is not the same as it being the case. I'm not entirely sure why Kurama would want to be deceptive about that, so it's probably nothing.

#+begin_quote
  'danger' shall include imprisonment, application of additional seals, and other non-physical harms, the precise list of which are at my discretion.
#+end_quote

The list being unspecified is a potential loophole, and I wonder if "imprisonment" would include Orochimaru's imprisonment of Team Anko and thus give Kurama license to kick ass.

There's also nothing that says Naruto's form after the remodelling would have to be similar to his old one, which would give Kurama a potential bargaining chip if Naruto ever wants to go back to looking like himself.
