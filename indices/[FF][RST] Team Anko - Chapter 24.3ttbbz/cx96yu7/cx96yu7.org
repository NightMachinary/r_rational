A copy of the agreement for reference (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  I will do everything in my power to rescue whatever civilians the Sound-nin named Hideo guides us to and ensure that they emerge safely from the firestorm as quickly as possible. I won't spend more than twenty-four hours on this task---I refuse to be trapped into being a permanent rescue team. During the period of this rescue effort *I will not deliberately harm any human who does not pose a clear and present danger to me or to you, with the understanding that 'danger' shall include imprisonment*, application of additional seals, and other non-physical harms, the precise list of which are at my discretion. I will also cause the minimum possible amount of property damage compliant with effecting the rescue. Once the rescue has been effected I will relinquish control of your body and return to your mindscape. In exchange for that rather paranoid list of strictures, you will grant me the following: control of your body for purpose of the rescue; *permission to permanently upgrade your body so as to improve your senses and boost your survivability*; permission to install my own bijuu senses; permanent access to your full sensorium. You understand that you won't have direct access to my bijuu senses since you lack the requisite brain structures.

Some things to note, as the fox's jailer, Naruto is in no way protected by the first emphasized clause. The second emphasized clause allows the fox to install any "upgrade" as long as it also happens to improve Naruto's survivability, giving the fox permanent at will control of Naruto's body would certainly do that, also note that the contract only states that the fox will return the body at the end of the mission, it doesn't state he isn't allowed to take it back.
