  but if it so happens that the rescue is impossible within 24 hours (for example due to the fact that even one of the civilians is killed by the firestorm before they get there)

The people to be rescued are only the people that Hideo guides Kurama to, and being hyper competent and bound to do everything within in his power I doubt that Kurama will actually fail to save anyone he is asked to save, so I doubt that this failure state can be entered.

However this made me realize that there is a possibility where Hideo asks Kurama to save someone who would beyond help from anyone else and then Kurama is forced to do something truly spectacular to honor his agreement. Another amusing (and probably stupid) exploit, if Orochimaru guesses enough of the contract he can go into the fire and try to hold one of his civilians hostage, Kurama now has to grant him a wish in order to save the civilian

  Also the fox does not have to protect Hideo in order for it to be possible for him to lead it to civilians to rescue.

True, but Kurama isn't allowed to deliberately harm him, and otherwise Hideo can probably look after himself.
