Keep in mind that it says it is going to not deliberately harm blah blah blah only /during the rescue attempt/ and that it will give back control /once the rescue has been effected/ but if it so happens that the rescue is impossible within 24 hours (for example due to the fact that even one of the civilians is killed by the firestorm before they get there) then the rescue will never be effected and therefore the fox never has to return control, plus after 24 hours it can do anything it wants.

Also the fox does not have to protect Hideo in order for it to be possible for him to lead it to civilians to rescue.
