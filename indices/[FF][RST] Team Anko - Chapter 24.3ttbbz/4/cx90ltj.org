  Alternatively, he could allow the fire to burn Naruto, again damaging and obscuring the seal. Would that actually work? A seal was a metaphysical thing as much as it was physical, an arrangement of chakra tethered to the real world by a design.

Ha! How coincidental--[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/109][the most recent chapter of /Dreaming of Sunshine/]] explicitly discussed this very topic:

  Ah yes, seal metaphysics. The question that most people who asked wished they'd never thought to ask.

  "A seal isn't /ink./ Once it's been activated, I mean. It's a pathway full of chakra that makes things happen. And chakra is... you can't just wash it away, right?"

It's certainly an interesting avenue of investigation. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/45][/Chunin Exam Day/ has three-dimensional seals created by adding microscopic impurities to gemstones]]:

#+begin_quote
  Naruto had decided that he would draw his seals in three dimensions (which required inventing a whole new branch of the sealing art to accomplish, and thus by itself virtually ensured proper security) on the INSIDE of gemstones, using tiny fracture lines and flaws as his pen and ink.

And /Time Braid/'s Sakura [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/18][even draws seals on the air itself]] (though within her mindscape):

#+begin_quote
  Seal masters normally work by drawing on paper with ink that contains their own blood and chakra, but it doesn't have to be done that way. The patterns and chakra are the important parts, and the rest is just a handy set of tools. My variation of Tsunade's secret seal was done entirely in chakra, drawn in the air with sheer chakra control. It wasn't easy, but I didn't see a good alternative.

And, of course, there are the several seals that Sakura literally sings into being, just by speaking the divine language.

So many beautiful ways to extend the same aspect of canon!
