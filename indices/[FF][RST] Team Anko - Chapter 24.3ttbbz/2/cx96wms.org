You know, /assuming/ that Kurama's being honest about his reasons for refusing to be bound by a "spirit of the oath" clause... There would appear to be a simple solution:

Naruto could have Kurama agree to be bound by Kurama's best understanding of Naruto's present understanding of the spirit of the oath.

This way one avoids the whole "accidentally broke spirit of the oath due to ambiguity/differences in understanding between the two" while still having some of the general protection of agreeing to be bound by the spirit of the oath. Further, specifying "present understanding" avoids potential loopholes like editing Naruto's mind or whatever.
