So, the bijuu has senses that Naruto does not, and he's been given the ability to remake his biological make-up /permanently/. At the very least he could, after the rescue, turn Naruto into a featureless fleshy sphere with all of his "upgraded" senses pointed internally, while maintaining his own sanity and safety through taking in the world around him with bijuu senses that he alone has access to. Then use that bargaining position to secure another deal with more favourable terms. A time-share agreement, for example.
