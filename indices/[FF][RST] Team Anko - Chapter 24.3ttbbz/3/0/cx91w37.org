  Understanding that to be the case is not the same as it being the case. I'm not entirely sure why Kurama would want to be deceptive about that, so it's probably nothing.

Well of course it's the case! Kurama wouldn't lie to Naruto, would he?

  There's also nothing that says Naruto's form after the remodelling would have to be similar to his old one, which would give Kurama a potential bargaining chip if Naruto ever wants to go back to looking like himself.

True, but that would be a terrible thing to do your friend, wouldn't it? Kurama is much too nice a Primordial demon to remodel someone into a giant mouthless blob of screaming ooze...I think.
