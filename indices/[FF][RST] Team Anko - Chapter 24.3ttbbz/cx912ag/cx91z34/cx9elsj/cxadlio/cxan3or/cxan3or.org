So based on your comment, im going to guess that you don't feel as if this is Kurama's moment right here? You feel like he's going to buff Naruto to build up his credit, in preparation for a plan further down the line?

Also, bit of a followup question. How can you possibly get one over on a mind this old? And i dont mean cheating with the Sharingan. I mean, from an intellectual standpoint, do you think its possible for you, a 70 something year old rationalist (at max) to outfox the Fox?
