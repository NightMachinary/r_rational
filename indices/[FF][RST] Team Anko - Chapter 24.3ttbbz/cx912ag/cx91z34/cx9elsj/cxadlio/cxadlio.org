The thing is, it's in his best interest to appear as a nice guy completely and truly until the one situation in which he can gain the maximum possible benefit arrives, at which point he mashes the 'defect' button.

As this is clearly a temporary measure, it is entirely correct for Kurama to act 100% on point, prove his trustworthiness, and bide his time. Next time he gets a little more freedom, then a little more, then a little more.

Kurama knows that more power means Naruto will start seeking (or being sought by) stronger foes.

This means an escalation.

He's old, he's seen it before. He can read the rhythm of the world.

So they escalate, and Naruto slips the leash just a bit more in exchange for what is conveniently jusssssst enough power to match it.

This happens over and over. 100% compliance, Kurama does exactly what he promises, he follows the spirit and the letter of every deal. Each time he gets more and more free and comfortable.

Maybe at one point he gets a shadow clone to drive around consciously. Maybe he sets some things in motion. Maybe the biggest threat shows up later, and the only way for Naruto to stop it, after he's expended all of his power, is for him to remove the seal entirely.

After all, his good friend Kurama, who has helped him and kept his word for years and years, and always done the right thing, there's surely no problem with letting him out, right?

A few decades are nothing to a billion year old mind. Plans which take into account /continental drift/ can slide through that intellect.

There is no reason to jump the gun. Patience is the ultimate virtue.

Kurama's chance will come.
