I love the world building here. The tongue isopod is obviously meant to be a mirror to the MC's situation. I wonder if the Manta Ray means anything.

Now I am really curious what the two possibilities beginning with D that Ran sees.

The start was hard to read, I just don't like living in that despairing space that the MC is in.
