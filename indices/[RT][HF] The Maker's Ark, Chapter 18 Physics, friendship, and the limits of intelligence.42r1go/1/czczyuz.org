Sweet, new chapter!

I like how the physics work felt believable, and the end is an interesting setup for the next chapter without feeling like a "tune in next week".

I was a little fuzzy on the rules of Journeyman's teleportation, but I get it enough. And I loved the part about the einherjar attitude towards being bodyguards. Great characterization.
