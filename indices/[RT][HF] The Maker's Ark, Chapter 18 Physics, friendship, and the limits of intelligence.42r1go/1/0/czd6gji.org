Journeyman is a little fuzzy on the rules of Journeyman's teleportation 8-). One of the reasons he is so paranoid is that he is acutely aware of how much he, and magicians in general, rely on heuristics (this worked before in these circumstances, so it will probably work that way again) rather than rigorous theory. He is much more of a magical engineer than a magical scientist. He is trying to change that, but experimentation is dangerous.
