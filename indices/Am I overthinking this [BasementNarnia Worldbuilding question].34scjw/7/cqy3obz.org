maybe you could make it so that the house is a really futuristic house in the distant future and the first occupant was a evolutionary xenobiologist who lived among humans for a short time and was trying to replicate sentient species that already existed and put them in the same universe/ecosystem to see how they grew, evolved and adapted over time. Maybe you can think of some trick with temperature and of substitute biochemical mechanisms to make a near-equivalent of human anatomy and neurology on a smaller scale as well as control the speed at which things move on different levels? Maybe have a portal at each level that converts things from other levels into larger or smaller equivalents of themselves down to the molecular level? It wouldn't change how fast or slow time moved, but it would look like it did when people traversed levels and contrasted how much history had happened on different levels.

Of course, the creator of such a "universe" would probably have his research license taken away because of how unethical it all is.
