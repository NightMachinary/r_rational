Sounds like Gaiman's /Neverwhere/ crossed with /City of Angles/. I've read something with a similar kind of "time running at different rates at different levels", except it was inverted and people in the deeper and slower levels watch civilizations bloom and die above them, over and over again... (and no I'm not talking about Lockstep).

Would totally read.
