Hm. That goes nicely with the idea that I had of there being Something Really Important coming from down below, so that the local cultures consider "down" to be good and "up" to be bad, and our humble protagonist is considered to be the equivalent of a demon from out of Hell because of where she's coming from.

(I'm still debating whether this is going to mean that most of the friends that she makes, at least early on, are Basement World's version of demon-worshipers and diabolists)
