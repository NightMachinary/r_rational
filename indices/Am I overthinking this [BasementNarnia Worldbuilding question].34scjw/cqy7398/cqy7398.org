There is a third option. As you go deeper, the basement also scales down (magically). Leaks in the surface world could be rivers. Molecules in the surface world become waterfalls. The breadth of the house the basement is set in becomes miles, becomes hundreds of miles. I don't know if that fits with the feel you're going for, but I think it could solve the problem you're talking about. A falling stream of water, as it goes deeper, becomes a bigger quantity, but also slower, to the receiving frame of reference. The scaling effect cancels out the "event horizon" Zeno-esque effect of the water never reaching its destination.

In synergy with the "down=good, bad=up" idea, this would equate our world's idea of resources bubbling up from the depths, and one should not dig too greedily, or too deep. Friends and relations going upstairs, possibly to seek their fortune, are never seen again, and when they return to their home level, everyone they know is dead, in the extreme case, at least. There would be a proportional effect in the reverse for going downstairs, of course, which might result in a stratifying effect. This setting is a very interesting idea. :3
