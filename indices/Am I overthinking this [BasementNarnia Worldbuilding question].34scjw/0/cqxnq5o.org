I guess if I were reading a story like that, where people got their water and electricity through conventional outlets and pipes, my preferred solution would be for this to be part of the magic of the setting - maybe an enduring mystery that someone tried to get to the bottom of, maybe a bit of magic that can be exploited, but not just something that no one makes a remark about.

I would like it to be something like ... someone digs into the side of the wall, to figure out where the pipe is coming in from, and finds only that it extends sideways through the earth. And then they try to keep going, to find the source of the water, and find that there's only more pipe, continuing on, in total defiance of conventional ideas about water pressure. Or something like that.

But I don't know whether that sort of thing fits in with the story that you're trying to tell, or the world you're trying to build.
