No, I am totally down with the characters realizing that this is weird and wondering what is going on, and just... never being able to figure it out.

My worry is always that the reader will go "Ha ha, /now stop trying to weasel out of this and give us the explanation or you'll go to the worldbuilders' prison for badly-designed worlds/."

The fact that several people are saying, "No, that's alright," (and on [[/r/rational]], nonetheless) is encouraging, however.
