I'd just make sure that this isn't one of the driving conflicts/mysteries of the setting. You don't want to make an inadvertent promise that you're going to explain it and then never deliver.

My solution would be to have the protagonists come across someone (or someones) already wrapped up in searching for the source of the water/electricity, so that it's clear that this is sort of a sideshow.
