Oh man, there's a story, A number of aspiring writers wake up in a Jim Henson's Labyrinth-like world where nothing makes sense and everything seems to operate on some sort of nightmare logic. Eventually they discover that they've been dumped into the worldbuilders' prison for badly-designed worlds and have to try to escape.
