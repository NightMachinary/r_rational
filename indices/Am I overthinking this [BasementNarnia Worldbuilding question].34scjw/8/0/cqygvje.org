  First thought: How hard is it to traverse depthness levels? Is there an elevator system?
#+end_quote

No. Just stairs and vents and small tunnels in the walls.

  Actually, depth-shifting seems like a good business opportunity -- are there already businesses that offer this service?

No. The outside world isn't aware of the Basement World at the beginning of the story. Our protagonist will quickly realize the implications of the dilation, however.

Oh. Or are you asking about cultures /within/ the Basement World? Right now I think that they're intelligent rats. They had to build from scratch after becoming intelligent* and are probably working with steam power at this point.

The stairways are going to be /very/ important, especially since I think that there are Bad Things (let's call them goblins for now) in the upper levels that they have to keep out. The goblins are much smarter than them (being originally human but experiencing the same intelligence-boost as the rats, if to a lesser degree) and the main reason that the rats haven't been utterly destroyed is that they can use the time dilation to their advantage.

With every floor that the goblins claim, however briefly, some of that edge is lost. The rats have tunnels that go through the walls, so they can afford to heavily barricade the stairways without losing their own mobility through the levels.

*This is a side effect of the environment, and rats taken out of the Basement World are just normal rats.
