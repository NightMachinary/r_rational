  There's a world down there, with cultures and beings that have adapted to the deeps here, and the deeper you go the more that you undergo some sort of time dilation so that you might spend months or even years at a sufficient depth while only minutes pass in the surface world (this has a bit of a Narnia feel, but it also gives the antagonists an incredibly unfair time advantage because they're located pretty deep).

First thought: How hard is it to traverse depthness levels? Is there an elevator system? Buy up really cheap computers and put your computers really deep, stringing network and power cables to your level, and put the people working on life-extension really deep and when they get older cycle them back shallower.

Actually, depth-shifting seems like a good business oppertunity -- are there already businesses that offer this service?

In either case, this would give rise to some truly /OP/ supercomputers, in terms of cost per power consumption -- and possiby a return to the mainframe/terminal form factor (or lean client / fat server paradigm, they're really the same thing just with a different scope of networkiness) -- just with all the mainframes at a really low level in the Basement.

Would political and / or morally-dubious paramilitary organizations regulate who has access to elevators? Because the time dilation being a factor of physical depth, coupled with the magnitude of a force multiplier the time dilation is, seems eminently munchkinable. Who controlls the Elevators controlls the world, and all that.

We'd also probably expect to see pirates / rogue vigilantes try to bypass the authority of the Elevator Police and cut through different Levels (the ratio of the groups would of course depend on the morality of the Elevator Police), and all sorts of cultural beliefs about Depth and the Elevators.

(Not to mention that the /Inception/ reference(s) virtually write themselves.)
