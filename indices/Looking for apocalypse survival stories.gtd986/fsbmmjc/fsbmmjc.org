I would very strongly recommend the Lady Astronaut books by Mary Robinette Kowal, first book /The Calculating Stars/. I think it stands head and shoulders over the rest of the genre, both in terms of the science and engineering and in terms of the writing itself.

It starts with the disaster and it doesn't hold its punches on the emotional freight of it, but it's fundamentally optimistic in that very engineer-y way: this is awful, let's build/science our way out of it.
