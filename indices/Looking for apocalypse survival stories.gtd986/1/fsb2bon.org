A former top post on here was about a rational (sane) individual during a zombie apocalypse.

As far as prepared post apocalyptic types... James Wesley, Rawles has some decent stuff, if you like his writing (I prefer his nonfiction myself, but you may enjoy).

Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is about the moon blowing up and humanity trying to survive (great read).

I'll try to think of some more stuff later though, and I'll definitely check back because I like the genre too.
