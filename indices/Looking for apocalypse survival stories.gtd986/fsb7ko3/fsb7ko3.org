I read it years ago (before I knew what rational fiction was), but I recall Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle being a pretty good post-apoc rational novel. Complete with comet strike, salvaging books from libraries for info on how to make stuff, and maintaining a nuclear power plant for long-term use.
