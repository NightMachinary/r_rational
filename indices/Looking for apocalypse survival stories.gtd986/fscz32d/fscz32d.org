A good but a little less traditional example is Last of the Lamplight. A narrative let's play of the game Frostpunk. Which itself is a strategy game about surviving a rapid ice age in a steampunk version of the mid-late 19th century.

The big good points of it is the really characterful, cynical and not entirely reliable narration, paying attention to the work, suffering it takes to survive, and the scary places society might be taken in the process. And OfficialyDevin puts in a lot of work to rationalize a lot of the wacky science and tech in the game.

Also, robots. Lots of robots.

The game is execellent too, and Id reccomend playing it first. But its narrative elements are more intertwined with gameplay and doesnt really have much story or dialogue outside of it.
