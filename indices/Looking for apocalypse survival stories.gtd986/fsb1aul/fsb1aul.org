Honestly, *Hatchet* by Gary Paulsen is fairly rational. You have an inexperienced teenager whom learns, via trial and error and pain, the rules of their survival environment, and prevails through determination and learning. The protagonist is not perfectly rational, but their thought processes and decisions are reasonable and realistic.
