The ongoing manga Dr. Stone, though while the characters are smart and real science is used, the world they live in is very convenient/inconvenient, though the convenience is used to drive the plot forward (eg. having all the people revived be the absolute pinnacle of their fields) instead of as deux ex machina. Its the story of how due to an unexplained incident, everyone on earth turns to stone, but then 3700 years later a genius is revived, and works out that he was revived due to bat guano dripping on him over the years, so he begins making nitric acid to try to revive more people, and restart civilization within his lifetime. Unfortunately, one of the first people he revives is a violent but not dumb anarcho primitivist, who wants to stop civilization from returning using his own revived society. This conflict only spans the first third of the current chapters, and I won't spoil the rest.
