Thank you. I don't understand why people love it so much. I guess the descriptive writing is nice? But that's hardly a unique trait among writers. And the science makes no sense. In the book, it is stated that ALL plants are dead. How??? What kind of apocalypse kills all plants but not all humans? They are waaaay more resilient than us.
