Check out The Bastards of the Apocalypse series. Only book 1 out for now, The Earth Died Screaming. I listened to it on Graphic Audio.

The premis is that a solar flare, or something, it's still unsure blew up the moon and made everyone who looked at the event go blind. The protagonist is ex-military and definitely makes rational decisions throughout the book.
