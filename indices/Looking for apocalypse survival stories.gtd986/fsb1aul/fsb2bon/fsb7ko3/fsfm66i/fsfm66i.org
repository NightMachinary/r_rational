/Alas, Babylon/ by Pat Frank (1959) is a classic. The main character, Randy Bragg, is not a rationalist, but he is a reasonably competent Reserve Army officer who takes charge of his small Florida town after they get cut off from the outside world by a nuclear war between America and the Soviet Union. [[https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20160905][You can read it online or download the book for free]] (although, technically, that is only legal if you live in Canada).

/1632/ by Eric Flint (2000) is not technically an apocalyptic novel; it's an alternate history novel where the point of departure is that a small mining town in West Virginia gets randomly transported from the present back to Germany during the Thirty Years' War. But I'm including it anyway because defense analyst Stuart Slade (of /The Salvation War/ fame) [[http://web.archive.org/web/20031120165443/http://homepage.mac.com/msb/163x/faqs/nuclear_warfare_103.html][realized]] that the novel's scenario was isomorphic to that of a small town surviving in the aftermath of a nuclear war, and judged the actions of the main character, Mike Stearns, approvingly. Again, [[http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/1632/index.htm][it is available for free online to read or download]].

/Dies the Fire/ by S. M. Stirling (2004) received [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160710143417/http://www.raikoth.net/ficrecommend.html][a very positive review]] from Scott Alexander, although I have not read it yet.

/World War Z/ (the book, /not/ the movie) by Max Brooks (2006) deserves a mention just for the way it handles [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/01/industry-era-action-stories.html#comment-1818568070][the scale of the conflict]]. The Zombie War is fought and won not by a small team of survivors who retrieve a miracle cure or something stupid like that, but by a global coordinated effort the likes of which has not been seen since World War II. Each chapter focuses on a different character whose story is representative of a much larger number of people in a similar situation, all of which add up to tell the tale of humanity's victory over the living dead.
