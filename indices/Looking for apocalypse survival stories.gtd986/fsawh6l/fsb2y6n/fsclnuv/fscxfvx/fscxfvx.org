There are so many internet arguments I've got into over the years that were frustrated by stuff like geoengineering to ameliorate global warming, people respond "didn't you watch Snowpiercer?" Like it's a bloody documentary.

Movies and books and whatnot need to tell a gripping story to "survive" in the market. Often they paper over plausibility to do so. One must be ever mindful that the cool and popular latest film is not meant to /educate/.
