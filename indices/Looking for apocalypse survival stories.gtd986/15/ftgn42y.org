I don't think I've seen anyone here reccomend /The Postman/. The book, not so much the Costner movie. Its earlier sections have some good stuff about individual survival after a societal collapse (wars and plague, mostly) and overall, the story pushes back against the idea of violent, belligerant survivalism and "rugged individualism" as the "logical" response to apocalyptic scernarios. I've never liked how a lot of post apocalyptic fiction treats human cooperation and mutual aid as some artifact of modern industrial comfort.
