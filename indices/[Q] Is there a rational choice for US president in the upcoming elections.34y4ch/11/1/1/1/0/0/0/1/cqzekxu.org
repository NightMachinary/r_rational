True. I'm skeptical on CC myself, as well as the ability of government intervention to reverse the course, should it be both occurring and anthropogenic in origin.

The Climate Change question is complex. In order for anthropogenic climate change to be a true propisition the propositions must be satisfied that A) humans have the technology to gradually (in human scale) alter the climate, B) that humans can do so through an unintentional process, C) that humans have done so.

To use government intervention to fix the problem requires A above, as well as D) humans can reverse climate change through some course of action E) the government can intervene to reverse climate change, F) government intervention is the best way to reverse climate change.

To select a politician on his climate change stance adds the further proposition that G) the politician in question can cause the government to enact policies that reverse climate change, and H) the politician in question can cause the government to enact the best set of policies to reverse climate change
