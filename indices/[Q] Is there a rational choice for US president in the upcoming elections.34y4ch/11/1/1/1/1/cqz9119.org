Considering I haven't actually voted for either of them and don't intend to in the future, I don't justify it.

I'm merely saying that as a person of a libertarian persuasion, Mr. Paul (either) are the "least terrible" options on the table.

I honestly don't expect I'll vote for anyone in the upcoming election. I don't expect it to effect change to the point where expending the effort to go vote is less likely to accomplish my goals than any other similar effort I could expend.
