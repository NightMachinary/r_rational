Every single time I have voted over the last twenty-five years, the person elected has disappointed me and kept few if any promises. This is no longer surprising to me.

In the last decade+, I have been voting based on what the candidates have actually done in their public careers. I'm not going to name names, but I simply will never again vote for anyone that has only academic experience. If they haven't been a CEO, a mayor of a very large city, or a state governor, I'm probably not voting for them unless they are truly remarkable and clearly a doer with a track record of both working with others and convincing people to follow their lead.

If both major parties put up dud candidates, I'll vote third party to try to increase their role in future government.
