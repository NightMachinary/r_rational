I haven't even looked at the field yet, other than Hillary, who I refuse to vote for because of what happened before and after Benghazi, and the fact that her personal email server went poof. Amazing how many email servers and hard drives went poof in the last few years of the current administration. Academic credentials aren't a problem, provided that there's something else there. The life of a college professor or researcher is NOT an indicator of an ability to lead. Having someone who understands problems but has no idea how to lead people to solutions is potentially as bad as someone with an ability to lead but no understanding of problems. At least the person with an ability to lead /might/ choose decent advisors.

A CEO can be viewed indirectly by what their company does. What policies does the company hold? How they treat their employees? Do they meet their goals?

A professor? No. Simply no. Not unless they went WAY beyond being a professor, or the opposing candidate is truly atrocious. A professor that became a university president? Perhaps. If the university is large, well-run, and I can determine that the university president actually has a significant role and isn't a figurehead.
