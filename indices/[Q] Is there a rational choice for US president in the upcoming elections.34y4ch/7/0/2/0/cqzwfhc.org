  I haven't even looked at the field yet, other than Hillary, who I refuse to vote for because of what happened before and after Benghazi, and the fact that her personal email server went poof.

May I ask how both of those issues have any weight when it comes to select the person that both seems best to handle existential threat and is more probable to facilitate societies development in the direction you hope for?

That is to say why should those two scandals prevent me from voting for Hillary if I am a non-libertarian rationalist?
