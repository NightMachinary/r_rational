If your representatives in dangerous countries where you have just helped topple a regime request additional support to their understaffed facilities, you do not ignore them.

After they are killed, you don't pretend that they never said anything. You don't concoct horrible bullshit excuses about a video with almost no hits being responsible for a 'spontaneous uprising' where people showed up with machine guns and RPG's.

And when it's all done, you don't burn your personal email server to the ground so nobody can gather evidence about what you did and didn't do.
