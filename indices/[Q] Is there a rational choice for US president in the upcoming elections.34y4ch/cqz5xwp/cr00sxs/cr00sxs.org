  Unless you're stinking rich, donate time instead of money, because your time is probably more valuable to a campaign than the equivalent amount of money you would be willing to give.

This is surprising to me -- if the average person can do more good for a campaign by giving time than money, that means the campaign would be in a better position if it used its money to buy peoples' time. Is it a regulatory issue that stops this from being the case, or something more akin to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect][overjustification effect]]?

One other possible interpretation I see is that people will consider that 3 hours of their time volunteering is equivalent to a $10 donation, but will only work for a single hour in exchange for $10. This would surprise me a little bit, but I don't know if that's just because money and time are extremely fungible in both directions to me.
