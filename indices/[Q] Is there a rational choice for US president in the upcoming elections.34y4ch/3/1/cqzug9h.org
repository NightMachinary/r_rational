In order to evaluate a presidential candidate on a rational basis, you have to look at their actual record (votes cast or laws signed or vetoed in lower offices) and behavior prior to any ambition toward the presidency.

The structure of the presidential campaign encourages a number of anti-rational behaviors:

1. Tailoring the message to the audience, saying one thing to one group, another to a different group (aka lying).
2. Vagueness (to avoid offending any potential supporters, but alienating those who care about meaning)
3. Capture by special interest groups (this is where the campaign money comes from)
4. Disenfranchisement (only a small number of states matter, the rest are certain to go one way or the other)

In order to be a rational choice for president (or any other office), a candidate must advocate and support a rational government. Essentially, a rational government protects its citizens from force and fraud, both internal and external. It interferes with the lives of its citizens to the minimum extent necessary to achieve this goal.

1. Each person has the right to their own life. WIthout this, nothing else matters.
2. Each person has the right to act freely so long as that action doesn't impinge on the rights of others.
3. Each person has the right to perform productive work and to keep the result for either current or future consumption.
