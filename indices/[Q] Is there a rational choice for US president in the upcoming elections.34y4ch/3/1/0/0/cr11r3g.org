Which of my statements is in error?

The problem with socialism (any variant) is that it denies my right to the results of my labor. This, as a necessary consequence, denies my right to life (by denying me the right to support my life by productive work).

Utilitarianism as a government policy suffers from the problem that it grants group A (the many) the right to enslave group B (the few) as a matter of principle.

Consider the statement: "Let's put Bill Gates to death, negate his trusts and estate planning, confiscate his fortune and spend it on feeding the poor." Using utilitarian principles, how can you say that such an action is wrong?

If we are to live together in a peaceful and just society, the wants of the many do not supercede the rights of the few.
