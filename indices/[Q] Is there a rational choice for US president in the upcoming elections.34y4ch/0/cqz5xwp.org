Being as apolitical as possible ...

If you care about your vote, start looking into local politics - the more local, the better. You're one of +300 million+ ~240 million eligible people / ~130 million actual people voting for President, and we use both Electoral College and plurality rule, which means that unless you're in a swing state, your time and effort are best spent elsewhere. If you're trying to maximize your values, look to your state and local legislatures.

The other really important thing is that voting is one of the least meaningful acts when it comes to politics. If you really want to engage in the process, write letters to your politicians (state and local), volunteer for campaigns, or volunteer for non-profits that are trying their best to influence politics. Talk to your friends and family about who they should vote for, go door-to-door for a campaign, call people up, etc. Just going to the polls on election day is a good way to maximize the appearance of civic engagement for minimal effort, but it's not the best way to maximize political change in whatever direction you prefer with the same minimal effort. Same with donation - unless you're stinking rich, donate time instead of money, because your time is probably more valuable to a campaign than the equivalent amount of money you would be willing to give.

*So the problem of vote maximization is what we're left with* - and again, I'm going be as apolitical as possible, because I think you can rationally hold a whole host of political beliefs depending on your terminal values. What you're left with is a game theory question.

1. We live in a society that has first-past-the-post voting, which is a terrible system. In that system, you want to find the largest collective of voters that roughly align with your beliefs and vote with them so that the other largest collective of voters doesn't get their guy.
2. One caveat to this is that some election funding depends on the percentage of votes gained, so it's sometimes in your best interests to vote with a different collective in the hopes of electing someone better in the future and/or influence how future voting collectives form. If you can find a voting collective large enough to do that (you'd have to look up state and federal guidelines and get some data) it's probably worth your while. (/edit: At a federal level, 5% is the minimum to gain access to FEC General Election Fund money./)
3. Another caveat is that our voting system sucks in a number of ways. It might be in your best interests to align with a voting collective that's for election reform, even if you disagree with their other policies. The most important aspects of voting reform are getting rid of first-past-the-post in favor of something better, reducing the impact of money on politics, reducing corruption, and reducing gerrymandering. (Good luck.)
4. Get in on the ground floor as much as possible. Attend a primary or caucus. By the time it comes down to either the Republican or Democrat, most of the election game is already over.

Or vote your conscience to make a stand, if you want. The system might actually work if everyone did that, but there's a strong incentive to defect from that collaborative strategy. (/edit: Though then you're left with the fact that first-past-the-post fails on the "independence of clones" criterion, among others, which would cause the voting system to run into failure states even if no one was engaging in strategic voting or strategic nomination./)
