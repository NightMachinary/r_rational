A lot of what you do when you volunteer for a campaign is go door-to-door or get on the phones, if you're at the lower levels. If you just walk in the doors of your local political office, you already /probably/ have a bunch of things that a prospective employee wouldn't - an honest desire to see the candidate elected, an understanding of the candidate's policies and platform, and enthusiasm for the campaign. If you're talking on the phone to someone and they ask "Are you going to vote for him?" it's important that the answer be "Yes" (and I'm sure that you can understand why asking employees to lie would be a political disaster in this case).

So it's not really a simple case of "time is money". There are also some confounding variables - there are startup costs associated with a new volunteer, so if you value your time at $20 and only want to give $5 to the campaign, cash would be preferred to those 15 minutes. But in general, yes, you need to have a pretty sizable income before your money is worth more than the equivalent time. Campaigns also don't have to pay taxes, healthcare, etc. on volunteers, so there's less overhead in many respects.

And that's all without getting into the potential ability to use personal skills that would bill at a much higher rate. I'm a software engineer who works on contract (through a company), and my time bills at some ridiculous amount. That amount factors in managers, rent on my office, utilities like a fat internet pipe, healthcare, retirement fund, taxes, etc. I haven't inquired into the numbers lately, but for every dollar spent on my time by the company I'm contracted out to, only a fraction of it comes to me after my company and the government take their cut. So if I volunteer for a campaign building them a website, I'm cutting out a huge swath of middlemen and accomplishing a whole lot more than if I had just gone to my job, worked the same number of hours, and handed over the money after getting my paycheck.

(I was trying to find a source for what the tipping point is in terms of the value political campaigns place on a volunteer-hour and failed, because people talk about money in politics too much and it was crowding out my search results with mostly irrelevant links.)
