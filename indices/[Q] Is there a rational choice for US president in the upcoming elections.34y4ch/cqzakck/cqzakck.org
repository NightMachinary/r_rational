Real-world politics is a long game, and the President/Prime Minister is usually the equivalent of either the King or, if you have a strong head of government in your system, at best the Queen in chess.

Of course, in politics, you need your man/woman to hold lower office before higher office, in most cases, so it's as if you needed to move your preferred piece from pawn to bishop to knight to queen/king throughout the game. At any given time, the opportunity to make a very good piece into the queen/king /appears/ to have a high marginal impact, but /in fact/ you needed to strategize by raising and keeping whole cohorts of strong pieces /the entire game/.

So while I will be supporting Bernie Sanders with my own money and efforts, I think that the /real/ way to win is to vote, donate, write, speak, and volunteer for whole parties or movements at once. No individual politician can swoop in and messianically save a party/movement whose organizing infrastructure, power base, and local activism have gone to rot.

I'll now enumerate my priorities for this election year:

- Minimize Republican office-holding. I know this is going to sound ever so depressingly "Blue Tribe" of me, but sorry, if your party runs and governs on a platform of religion overriding science on matters of civilization-scale risk and damage (in this case, global warming), then you are /strictly/ worse than the party whose weird pseudo-religious leanings override science on matters of personal health or purity (ie: GMOs, NIMBY, vaccines, etc).

- Other than the specific candidates I favor, I do believe the Democratic Party sucks too, and feel uncertain about the Green Party (though they are a superior alternative where you can vote for them without screwing the Democrats). Technophobia is fucking irritating to hear about on GMOs, nuclear power, and vaccines. Technophilia for the "innovation industry" is /massively/ fucking irritating /because I work in the tech industry and it's not fucking like that/.

- The rational thing to do is pick sane, forward-thinking candidates and movements at the primary level and act there. In particular, gerrymandering has decreased swing elections, but opens incumbents to "primary attacking". This can and should be used to strengthen movements outside the party establishment.

- Push hard with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to strengthen socialism and social-democracy at the national and local levels, along with the new labor movement at the "bottom-up" level. I have it from an actual sociologist that things like the "Fight for 15" and improvements to unionization laws are the maximally effective points of attack for a pro-labor voter or activist, as electoral labor movements /can't/ function and win without a tidal force of local and workplace-level labor activism beneath them.

For everyone else here, I simply strongly recommend attacking anti-science candidates and religious candidates, and supporting pro-science, secularist candidates. If you want to open the debate over socioeconomic systems and ask why I support the partisan wing I do, fine, and I can hear why you support the wing you support. But generically to "rationality", the important thing is to have secularism and science on the move, and to attack the global warming problem as fast and hard as we can.
