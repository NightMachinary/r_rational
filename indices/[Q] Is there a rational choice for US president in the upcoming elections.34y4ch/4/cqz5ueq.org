Here's the long form.

Before the candidates are decided, 55 dead men from over 200 years ago eliminate nearly 7 billion contenders, by requiring that the president have been born in the US 35 years ago.

The next narrowing is also historic, in that the only "serious" contenders must be a member of one of the two major parties, and have some degree of favor with the party leadership.

Now we're probably down to a few hundred contenders. So we select "those who want the job". Which is a terrible thing to select for.

"It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -- Douglas Adams

So now we have the dozen or so people who want the job and meet the eligibility requirements and are in favor with the party leadership. Next stop, the primary.

I believe Iowa is the first state. So in Iowa, the dozen or so are narrowed down to 3 leaders for each party, and the media adopts the narrative that those people are the only real contenders for the position. For the rest of the election, everyone acts as if this is true. By the time even the primary in your state shows up, your choice is fully constrained to a few pre-approved options, none of whom are actually going to have anything in common with you, or your interests.

After the primary system, the only real contenders are the red guy and the blue guy, and at this point it is a matter of "Are things bad enough that the people reverse direction?" If things are good, the guy of the color currently in office has the advantage. If they are not so good, the other guy has the advantage. There's some variability, based on what kind of noises come out of the mouth of the approved guy because people think the mouth noises mean things, but it's inconsequential in the big picture.

Your vote doesn't even matter, except in aggregate.
