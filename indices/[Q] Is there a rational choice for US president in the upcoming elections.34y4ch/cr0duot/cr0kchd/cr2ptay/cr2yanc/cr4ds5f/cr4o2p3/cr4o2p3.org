Understood. You have made a decision in advance and will defend that decision, despite not knowing who Hillary will be facing, and despite the fact that Hillary is an empty suit.

In other words, you might as well bring a rubber stamp 'D' into the voting booth. It appears as if you are a party line voter with no interest in listening to anything deeper than surface arguments.

I can accept your rephrasing though, because you do not attempt to say that you are being rational, and it clearly stakes out your position.
