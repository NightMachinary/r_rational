You are getting into mind-killed politics mode. Break "global warming" and "belief" or "skepticism" into distinct propositions, and let's talk about probabilities and expected utilities.

[[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-7.html][The experts give a >95%]] [[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1s1-6.html][Bayesian (probability of an event, not =1-p(event | H_0)=) probability]] to global climate change due to forcible addition/retention of energy in the Earth's climate system. I encourage you to read the applicable sections of the report yourself.

Now, given the observed damage that has /already occurred/, and which provides strong evidence that further damage will occur, you can:

- Declare you've got some very low prior on the IPCC being honest (conspiracy-theorist mode), and combine that to obtain a much lower probability of damaging global warming.
- Argue with the IPCC's data as an honest scientist, using your own data, leading to the probability again being updated downward.
- Argue that global warming exists with the probability given by the IPCC, but that the damage estimates are overblown.

Everything else is quibbling: /shut up and multiply/. If you think that UFAI/FAI issues are more important, you're not getting out of this one, because FAI is damned cheap to fund compared to dealing with global warming, so we can /easily/ do both, and dealing with global warming keeps more living creatures alive to enjoy whatever will happen when your FAI plan works. In fact, by refusing to take action to deal with the /expected negutility to life-kind/ of global warming, you are basically just dumping a load of shit on the FAI and saying, "/You/ fucking handle it."

I, personally, believe that the best I can do, epistemically, is to believe the experts here. I am not personally competent in climate science, but I understand scientific methodology well enough to say the official work seems to have been done by the normal methods, to my knowledge. So: >95% probability of significant global warming for what look to be anthropogenic reasons, with large expected damages. This is a civilization-scale challenge which, in its potential to save or damn billions of human and nonhuman lives, plainly dominates any expected-utility calculation you may want to do about upcoming elections.
