Evidence is not the same as argument though. What you're saying is "convince me that X is true or else I will believe Y". In fact my ability to argue X has little to do with whether X is true. I could be the worst arguer in the world and it would still not count as evidence of anything. That's why good rationalists make it their own responsibility to try and change their own minds: That's what I meant.

But my initial post was written while irritated, so please allow me to rephrase: The final election will most likely be between Hillary and a Republican, in which case Hillary will turn out to be the better option because the republican candidates are all nuts.
