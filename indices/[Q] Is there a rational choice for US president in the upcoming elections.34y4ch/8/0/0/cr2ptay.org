That's not how rationality works. Arguing a case and divining the truth are two completely unrelated activities. The fact that people don't understand this is why we can't have nice things.

I could argue all day that I am the perfect candidate for US president, but that wouldn't do anything to change the truth that I'm not.

You can come up with a thousand arguments to justify your dislike for Hillary after the fact, but the only information that would actually have predicted your dislike in advance is that your username is 'farmer bob'. The rest is just fluff.
