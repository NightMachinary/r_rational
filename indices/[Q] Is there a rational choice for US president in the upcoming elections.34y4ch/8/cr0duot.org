I did a quick look through the thread and it seems like hardly anybody tried to answer your question, preferring instead to wax lyrical about how neutral and objective they are. So I'll go ahead and tell you that the correct person to vote for is probably Hillary Clinton, for reasons of competence. Third party is also arguable, due to game-theoretical reasons, but I don't think this works for US politics as the country is so divided.

I would also like to note how utterly disappointed I am at the rationalist community for failing so badly at politics. I mean, if you are incapable of telling which of 2 options is preferable, based on limited information, then what the hell have you been learning all this time?

Politics is a litmus test for rationality, and it seems obvious to me that the rationalist community has failed completely.
