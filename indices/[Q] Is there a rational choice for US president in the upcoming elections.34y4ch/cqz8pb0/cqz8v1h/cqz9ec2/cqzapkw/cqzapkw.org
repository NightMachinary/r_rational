I have to ask: oh really? What about Congresscritters and Senators? I can think of a policy wonk who went from a professorship to the Senate and has been greatly effective at pushing for well-written regulation (at least, in line with said Senator's stated ideology). Don't you think more legislators should be policy wonks rather than empty suits who speak well?
