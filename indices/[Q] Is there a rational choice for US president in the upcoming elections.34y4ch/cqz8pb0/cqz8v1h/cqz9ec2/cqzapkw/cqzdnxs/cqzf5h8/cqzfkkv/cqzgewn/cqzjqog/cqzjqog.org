I would say that the way to rationally deal with an undefined conditional distribution in order to answer a real-world question is to gather data.

In this case, (IMHO) that would be waiting for candidates to announce themselves, and judge them based on the criteria we choose. In my case, I will judge candidates for the Presidency by what they have done, as opposed to what they say they will do. I can see that either directly or anecdotally when those individuals have held public office or had positions of authority over large numbers of individuals in the past.

That's not to say I'd never vote for an ivory-tower candidate. There have been quite a few CEO / major public office candidates in the last several presidential elections that I would never even consider voting for.
