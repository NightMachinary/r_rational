I hate to say it, again, but that's another straw man argument. You are NOT stuck sampling CEO's at random. You are sampling CEOs that choose to run for public office.

We can't get into any sort of preference ordering about effectiveness of CEOs here that wouldn't quickly devolve into chaos and drag this thread WAY off subject.

However...

We can, I hope, agree that it is possible to subjectively see how a CEO has guided the companies they have led, and decide if that CEO has a proven track record of doing things that we agree with, as individuals, regardless of our political leanings.
