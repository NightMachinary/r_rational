I think the point he's trying to make is that being a CEO that runs for an executive or administrative office doesn't /automatically/ make that person better than someone who has no background in management. A bad CEO is worse than a professional in a different field that requires a skill and broadcasts an ideology.

Also, I noticed that you didn't include other professions with management skills like union leaders or people who held top management positions in non-elected government branches. What's up with that?
