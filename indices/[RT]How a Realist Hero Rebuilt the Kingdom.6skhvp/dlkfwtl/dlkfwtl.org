The reviews on novelupdates are usually helpful. My own review of volume one is [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugisha-no-oukokukaizouki/comment-page-3/#comment-12371][here]]. I have not read any further.

Summary:

Positive:

- The MC tries to act rationally and makes some actual, reasonable plans which he then completes. This makes it far more enjoyable than strategists just winning for no reason at all.

Negative:

- The MC's luck has reached the counter-stop. Every plan goes off perfectly, he stumbles over all potential issues early enough to avert them.

- Everyone important / intelligent believes him immediately. And becomes a subservient follower immediately.

Has anyone here read [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/maoyuu-maou-yuusha/][Maoyuu Maou Yuusha]]? It's been on my to-read pile for ages, but I've never gotten around to it.
