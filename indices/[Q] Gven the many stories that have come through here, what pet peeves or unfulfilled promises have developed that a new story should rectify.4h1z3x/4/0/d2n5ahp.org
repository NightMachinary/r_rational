  I get that to be rational often involves learning how to decide and achieve one's goals, but many protagonists of rational fiction tend to be very 'narrow minded' where they focus overly much on their goals without too much focus on other ways to improve themselves even if it won't help overly much for their goals.

I would explain this as "protagonists of rational!fic often appear unjustifiably confident of their goals or that they know their goals", and agree it's a common failing.

Remedies it would be nice to see:

- characters who are confident of an /eventual/ goal (transhumanism FTW!), but not sure how to get there (eg political orientation)

- characters deciding that they have insufficient information to meddle in the affairs of $whatever (with positive marginal expected utility), so their time is better spent on a /less important problem/ which has a relative attention-deficit

- a character arc which is /just/ personal development; eg $minor_char decides that they need life experience they don't have and can't get yet before making $major_decision

- a general theme that wisdom must not be a dump stat. INT might be how you achieve your goals, but wisdom is how you decide what your goals /are/. Probably needs some serious anvil dropping on the fallibility of humans, who usually literally don't know what we want.

- someone acting prematurely, and realizing actually-too-late that they ruined things by doing so. Failure-through-inaction is the normal aesop, but I think rational fic as a whole goes too far the other way.
