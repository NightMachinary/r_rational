  A really strong first installment - paragraph, chapter, episode, whatever - is crucial. Most of the really good fics I've read do this by opening with the climax of someone else's story, which fits in a lot of action and demonstrates technical skill without getting anachronistic. Eg HP opens with the last stand of his parents...

Hell, if you /really/ don't know how to start, just write down, "It was a dark and stormy night", and go from there. It's kept working for everyone who tries it.
