An issue I've had with a lot of rational fics is that they have a kind of on/off relationship with narrative satisfaction. The stories often like to subvert your expectations, but it sometimes results in the story failing to deliver on what I want it to. HPMOR is on of my favorite books ever, but I can't disagree with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][the review]] [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] wrote explaining why the ending is disappointing. Not that he's innocent, I freaking hate The Metropolitan Man because it was the exact opposite of what I wanted from a Superman story. Just because you can deconstruct a cultural icon doesn't mean it's enjoyable to read, especially when compared to reconstructions like All-Star Superman or Superman vs. The Elite that respect the character and what he represents while modernizing him.

Because of this trend I'm nervous about finishing Worm or checking out Wildbow's other work. It had an amazing start and really interesting characters, but I stopped reading after I finished Prey because the story had become unpleasant to read. Character development seems to have been put on hold while everyone's busy surviving constant attacks by horrific monsters that the heroes are powerless to stop. The author said he actually rolled dice to see who'd survive Leviathan's attack on the city, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim][which I think is completely contrary to a compelling narrative and characters.]]
