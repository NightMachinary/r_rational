I'm not sure exactly how to answer. Different people seem to have different definitions of "character development." I certainly felt fulfilled by the character arcs by the end. I felt that Taylor resolved a lot of her problems by the end (and also with her dad), except for a few lingering issues which retained to feed directly into the ending. Regent never had that much character and while he gets some development it wasn't that much. Imp gets a lot of development, much of which you may not notice unless you look for it (/wink, wink/). Grue, well, I think you might be disappointed by Grue's arc, although I feel that was intentional for a certain purpose in the story. I'm not sure about Tattle. Lots of things happened, but I'm not sure if she really changed that much. Panacea very much goes through hell and then comes back out again. Bitch -- yes, she gets what you want.

Unfortunately as far as catching a break, if you stopped in Prey the worst is yet to come. The Echidna arc comes a little bit after that (although the part in between wasn't bad if I recall correctly) and I felt it was the worst part of the story. It went on too long, was fatiguing, wanted to be frightening and yet lacked a sense of danger because Echidna wasn't really an Endbringer, had way too much fighting, etc. But after that things get much, much better, both as far as writing and in catching a break and solving personal problems.
