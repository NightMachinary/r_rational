The key thing that will keep me reading Worm is if the focus returns to the character development and their arcs have satisfying conclusions. I put up with plot points I didn't like because they managed to create compelling situations for the characters that seemed to be leading up to something. Since the story has drifted away from development to survival, I find the plot problems far more irritating. I want these people to catch a break and get around to solving their personal problems.
