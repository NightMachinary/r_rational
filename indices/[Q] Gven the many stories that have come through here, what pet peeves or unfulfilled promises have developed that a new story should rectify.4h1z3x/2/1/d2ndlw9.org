Oh yeah. It has a massively outsized effect on my reading habits, even though I'm aware of the effect. If the first paragraph - or sometimes chapter if I'm feeling generous - doesn't grab me, it just makes me go /ugh/. Ugh, this guy hasn't put in the work to learn the most basic points of writing to an audience. Ugh, if this is as boring as the rest of the story is going to be I don't think I'll bother.

Ways to do this include introducing a character who is not your main character, and have them fight a dramatic conclusion to their story, fail and possibly die horribly. Otherwise there's the option of showing something climactic or interesting from the future of your character, then cutting back to the actual start of the story. There's other ways as well, of course.
