In the sense that many of us are taught from a young age that men are unreliable pigs who care only about sex and would abandon their family at the slightest provocation, and who don't care about the emotional side of things. I remember my friends in college being hugely surprised how heartbroken men can get after a breakup.

You should understand why this is wrong and biased, because while this applies to /some/ men, it doesn't apply to all of them.
