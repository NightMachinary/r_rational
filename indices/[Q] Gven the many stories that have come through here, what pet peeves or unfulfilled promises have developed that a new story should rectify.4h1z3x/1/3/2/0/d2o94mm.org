  Just took a long look at it. They make some pretty good points, but I'm not sure how much of it is actually representative of how people think and act in real life. Some of the discussion about power dynamics in relationships I've seen on it so far often seem kind of weird and even paranoid, despite some aspects of them sounding almost right.

I warmly recommend focusing on the sidebar, specifically the essay "[[http://puerarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheFuturist_TheMisandryBubble.pdf][The Misandry Bubble]]" and the "[[https://therationalmale.com/the-book/][The Rational Male]]" books instead of the subreddit itself, since it's full of people who are still in the anger phase.

  I noticed that there is a RedPill for straight men and one for gay men. Why doesn't there seem to be a RedPill for straight women and lesbian women? The intro article explained that men need more help finding partners than women do. But as far as I am aware, even if it's often not to the same extent as men, women do have relationship problems and difficulties finding partners just like men do, and would benefit from rational analysis of relationship dynamics just like men do.

There is no TRP for the benefit of women, as far as I know, and it makes perfect sense since women are socialized and taught from young age what men want and how they can achieve their own relationship goals by using that knowledge.

  Or wait, is there a RedPill equivalent for women? Because I didn't see it linked in the RedPill subreddit's sidebar.

What there is is a TRP subreddit for women, but still from the point of view of the male benefit: [[/r/RedPillWomen/]]. So it's utility is quite debatable for women not interested in the kind of relationship TRP Men look for.
