Just took a long look at it. They make some pretty good points, but I'm not sure how much of it is actually representative of how people think and act in real life. Some of the discussion about power dynamics in relationships I've seen on it so far often seem kind of weird and even paranoid, despite some aspects of them sounding almost right.

I noticed that there is a RedPill for straight men and one for gay men. Why doesn't there seem to be a RedPill for straight women and lesbian women? The intro article explained that men need more help finding partners than women do. But as far as I am aware, even if it's often not to the same extent as men, women do have relationship problems and difficulties finding partners just like men do, and would benefit from rational analysis of relationship dynamics just like men do.

Or wait, is there a RedPill equivalent for women? Because I didn't see it linked in the RedPill subreddit's sidebar.
