  Alright, to be more specific: the alpha and beta male theory is based on junk science. They followed wolves recently released from captivity with no proper socialisation to come to the conclusion they came to, instead of looking at actual wild wolves that have had time to build up a stable and functional pack structure. Despite this and its poor transference over to human relationships, it's touted as the be all and end all of understanding male and female relations.

Neh, and if you had read the "The Rational Male" book you would have understood: the meaning of the word "Alpha" in human relationships is different from its meaning in the animal world.

  The subreddit itself and the subculture that follows it appears to have no respect for women, and comes part and parcel with ideas that lead to a frankly dangerous and risky approach to consent. It's reactionary, feeding on people's feelings that the current dating game is unfair. Normally that would be fine, but it goes too far in the other direction in a way that even pickup culture never really did.

Again, amoral. It might hurt people's feelings, no doubt (why do you think the professional victims, the sjw, are so pissed off with it?), but it works, so you have to ask yourself: would you rather have a tool that allows you to reach your goals (sex, women, companionship, respect, professional success) or a tool that feels good but it doesn't (being the "Nice Guy", the eternal second, or third, or twentieth)?
