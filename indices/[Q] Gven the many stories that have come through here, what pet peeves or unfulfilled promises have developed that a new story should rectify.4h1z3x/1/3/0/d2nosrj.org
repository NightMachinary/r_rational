Saying people object to [[/r/TheRedPill]] because they aren't wired for rational analysis of relationship dynamics is like saying that people object to HPMOR!Voldemort because they aren't wired for rational analysis of magic.

[[/r/TheRedPill]] is indeed rational as generally defined by this sub: The users there use a generally effective model of human interaction to achieve their desired goals. The problem is that their goals very often conflict with the goals of others, hence the controversy. They want power and dominance over their romantic partners without having to reciprocate anything in return. They treat relationships like a Prisoner's Dillemma, and advise defecting. Many people (myself included), find this morally objectionable.

There are rational ways of dealing with relationships that involve both parties co-operating, which, as anyone familiar with the Prisoner's Dillemma can tell you, is the ideal outcome.
