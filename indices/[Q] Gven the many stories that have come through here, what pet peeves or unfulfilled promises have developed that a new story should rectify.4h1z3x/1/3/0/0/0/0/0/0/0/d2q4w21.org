I think this is a good place to remind folks that *people vary a lot*. Like, even if you think you're correcting for this, you're probably not enough. Like, some people don't have a visual imagination /at all/, and they never noticed this because the brain is so good at hacking around things.

Anyway, what I'm getting at is that just like some guys have insane libido (and hence assume that all guys do), so probably do lots of Redpillers generalize from their personal experiences with women to all women. I recommend they simply try to look in different places.
