Thing is, TRP doesn't say that all women are bad, just that their default biological programming results in them being bad, and that our current social structure makes it very easy for most women to simply follow their basic biological programming rather than rise above it. There are very few who are willing to rise above it, either by choice or by necessity, and those are called Unicorns.
