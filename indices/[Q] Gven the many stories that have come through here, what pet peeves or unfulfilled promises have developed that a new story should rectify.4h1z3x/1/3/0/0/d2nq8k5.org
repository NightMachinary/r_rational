While it is true that Sexual Strategy, both male and female, is amoral, the reality is that in our current situation there is no reason for a woman to abide by a contract or be cooperative with the partner when divorcing him is the most beneficial choice for her. Thus, as amoral as it might be, it's more rational for a male to treat the relationships as a "Prisoner's Dilemma" (though, to be fair, it's not that good of an analogy of TRP) if he wants to reach his own goals (sex, companionship, children, family) rather than strive for cooperation.
