Too many stories solve things with violence for my taste. I think it's overdone, and is usually either forced or in conflict with psychological realism. Since I recently rewatched /Log Horizon/, it stands out to me as a great example of the important stuff getting solved by a bunch of people sitting around talking, and sometimes spending lots of money, even in a context where by convention the audience expects all conflicts to lead to violence.
