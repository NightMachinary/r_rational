Well, this probably doesn't really apply to a "thermonuclear magical girl story," but what I've realized I've been missing from my rational fiction lately is enough focus on the protagonist's rage against the injustice of death and the constant wiping out of so much knowledge and human potential, a viewpoint which might lead a protag to take morally questionable or even arguably evil actions in the interests of putting an end to this far greater evil.

So many rational stories just kinda skip right past the "ending death" bit, until it seems like it sort of happens in the background or as a adjunct to the character's primary goals. I want to read a character who feels a cold hand of ice gripping his/her heart whenever they realize (which should be /all the time/) that anyone they love or even someone they only talked to once might well be gone tomorrow, all of that person's knowledge and experience wiped away as though it never existed, just nada, nothing. I want a character who feels hot rage when he notices that everyone around him is going through life accepting this horrible fact, pretending that it doesn't exist or believing in fairytales of religion in order to try to ignore it, or even, god help them, twisting their psyche into such ugly shapes that they can call it right and good that everyone dies, and call it wrong to want to live forever, and say that it is the fact that life is fleeting that makes it worth living.

It is this, this mindset, this character, that drew me to things related to rational fiction and transhumanism. Zoltan's protagonist in /The Transhumanist Wager/ might read like some kind of neo-nazi half the time, wandering around and demolishing various straw man arguments conveniently served up to him by cardboard cutout antagonists, but I can forgive that because the major point of the character's motivations is rage against the dying of the light, rage and horror that anyone would devote their time and resources to something other than holding on to life tooth and claw, to turning every resource humanity has towards combating this greatest of all injustices.

And yet, in rational fiction really only HPMOR had much of this in it, and even there it's just one of several goals. This is what I want to see more of, this is what makes my heart pound in excitement more even that that period of unbounded possibility that comes just after the protagonist has acquired superpowers or the equivalent, more than seeing someone munchkin something seemingly useless into great power.

I notice that pretty much all the stories I really like have this element in them, even though sometimes it doesn't come through in its full form as rage against death. Vernor Vinge's stuff has this in it in great measure, sometimes only hinted at but always present in some form, mixed with deft portrayals of enhanced intelligence as something that you can't look directly at and comprehend, but instead only see through its effects and implications. /Worm/ is about someone who just won't give up, no matter how horrible things get, and while the parallel is never quite explicit, by the end the protagonist might as well be facing the anthropomorphic personification of senseless and unstoppable death, and doing everything possible to bring it to an end and to compel everyone else to also devote all their energies to this end, whether by ethical means or not. And similar parallels can be made for almost all fiction I consider moving.
