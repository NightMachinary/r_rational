SPOILERS AHEAD

The problem is the final arc. Superman publicly murders a crime boss because "I was standing there, hating him, and thinking how much better the world would be if he were dead." It wasn't in defense of anyone nor did he attempt to hide it. He even confesses to Lois that he'd spend relative days thinking it over before deciding to commit murder. He ended up regreting it, but this is where the story spirals downward. Lois joins Luthor and decides to pretend to be in love with Superman to trick him, a plot point that is creepy on many levels and was such a stupid plan Superman sees through it easily. Then he has the final confrontation with Luthor and dies through a plot contrivance that barely makes sense. That's it, story's over.

I can accept Superman killing villains. I actually like Zod's death in Man of Steel. He killed Zod in defense of innocent people after Zod had announced he'd never stop trying to kill others to spite Superman. Here, THE SUPERHERO unambiguously committs murder. I hate this fic.
