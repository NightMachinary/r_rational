  The author said he actually rolled dice to see who'd survive Leviathan's attack on the city, which I think is completely contrary to a compelling narrative and characters.

Personally I think the author was exaggerating or lying about that to at least some extent. Maybe he did it for some of the secondary characters, but the primaries? I've read Worm twice, and the story doesn't exhibit that kind of randomized structure. The main characters have strong plot armor until it makes sense that it should fade, and Wildbow even provides an in universe explanation for the plot armor.

I /strongly/ recommend finishing Worm. IMO the climax and ending is by far the best part. Yes, there are a few missteps like the time skip and the strong conservation of danger/mook effect that eventually afflicts the S9, and also the part with Echidna which is too long and drags, but aside from those Worm gets better and better as it goes along and the ending is (again IMO) sublime. And as a comparison baseline I also hated the ending of The Metropolitan Man with a fiery passion. Worm's ending delivers on all its promises and then some.

As for the rest of Wildbow's work, I didn't really like Pact. Many elements seem like the worst parts of Worm. Wildbow said he had personal problems while writing it that interfered, and it does read like that. Also, the terrific epic scale ending of Worm set up certain expectations in me for Pact's ending, expectations that were not fulfilled.

I'm waiting on Twig to be completed before reading it.
