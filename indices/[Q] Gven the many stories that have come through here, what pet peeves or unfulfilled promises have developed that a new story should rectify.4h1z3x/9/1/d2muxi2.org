  This is going to sound dumb, but... Radioactive. Radio - active. So if something radioactive, like a reactor, is nearby and unshielded your radio won't work.

No, this is /not/ how it works. RF emissions only interfere with similar wavelengths, and the effect is only really noticeable at radio or microwave frequencies.

Alpha- and beta-radiation are electrons and helium nuclei, and gamma radiation isn't going to interfere with anything else, it just ionises and destroys things.
