This is going to sound dumb, but...

Radioactive. Radio - active. So if something radioactive, like a reactor, is nearby and unshielded your radio won't work.

In one story I read, the bad guys were just about to use a nearby wireless device to call for help, when the good guy breached a nuclear reactor and drowned out all radio signals. And despite being a full-grown adult, it was only at that moment that I saw the word "radio" in radioactive and understood what it meant.
