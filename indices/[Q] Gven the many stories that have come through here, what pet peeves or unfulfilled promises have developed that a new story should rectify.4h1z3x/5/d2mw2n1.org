As much magically-weaponised high-energy physics as possible. /Saga of Soul/ and the /Doc Future/ trilogy are great examples (thanks, commenters), and I'd like to see more.

[[/u/eaturbrainz]] and I demand that the spell to squeeze-and-release fusion magnetic bottles (great way to ruin a nuclear power's day) by known as /Callahan's Unfriendly Instigation/. Bonus points if characters or concepts from [[/r/errantry]] appear in cameos.

A really strong first installment - paragraph, chapter, episode, whatever - is crucial. Most of the really good fics I've read do this by opening with the climax of /someone else's/ story, which fits in a lot of action and demonstrates technical skill without getting anachronistic. Eg HP opens with the last stand of his parents...

There's plenty of interesting material on nuclear weapons you can find online; no specific reccomendations. I do suggest pulling in magical references though, such as the Dresden Accords (Stross / /A Colder War/) or the Unseelie Accords (/Dresden Files/) - confusing names, eh...

Also look into civilian application of nuclear explosions, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)][Project Orion]], Operation Plowshare, and other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_nuclear_explosion][Peaceful Nuclear Explosions]]. This would be a nice goal for the protagonist anyway, to affirm that being a one-girl nuclear superpower (heh) doesn't have to make you a monster. Bonus points for minor angst over UN sanctions.
