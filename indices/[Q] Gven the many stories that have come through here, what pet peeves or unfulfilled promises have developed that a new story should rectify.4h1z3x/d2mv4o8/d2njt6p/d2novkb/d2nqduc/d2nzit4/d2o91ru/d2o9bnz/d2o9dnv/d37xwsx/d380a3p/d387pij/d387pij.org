  What if you cannot find truly rational women?
#+end_quote

Increase your sample size or re-examine your biases? What would you tell someone who asks "What if you can't find truly honest men?"

#+begin_quote
  What if you cannot find rational women who'd rise above their basic biology?
#+end_quote

Blaming behavior on "basic biology" is something only actual psychologists should do, not people who read an article or blog that confirmed their biases with pseudo-science. The idea that TRP's dogma is supported by science is one of the most common refrains that remain unsubstantiated.

  What if an entire community of millions of men has barely ever encountered one?
#+end_quote

Millions? The subreddit currently says about 150k, and that number is inflated by their ban against anyone commenting without subscribing.

Anyway, statistically speaking, this could happen to individuals out of sheer bad luck. Due to the incredible number of people in existence, there are undoubtedly some guys who grow up with shitty mothers, shitty sisters and aunts and cousins, shitty female classmates and teachers, etc, until the vast majority of their understanding of women is informed by their experiences with the worst kind of women.

Thanks to the internet, these guys can now find each other and create an echo chamber with true misogynists and abusive men who reinforce each other into a victim mentality to make it seem like they're the only ones who see The Truth and everyone else are just politically correct, blind sheep.

But "millions" of men who can only count such women on one hand do not outweigh the hundreds of millions who are surrounded by smart and caring women who defy the strawwoman that TRP has built to represent the vast majority of them, let alone our own experiences.

  Regarding the "abusive relationship dynamics", they are not truly so
#+end_quote

Yes, they are. I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist. I see the kind of shit Red Pillers do on a weekly basis, even if the men and women who do them don't call themselves that or know what it is.

  they are based on basic evolutionary biology

See above: you're on [[/r/rational]], remember, not an echo chamber where you can say things like this without providing evidence.

  most important of all, they work. Consistently. For millions of men. For ONS, short term relationships, long term relationships and marriages.

And here's the rub. Here's why there are ~150k men who continue to fall prey to confirmation bias and the availability heuristic: because all it takes is finding one woman out of dozens for which it works to convince them that it's The One True Path. And if that means being abusive, well, they can shut their ears and assure each other that everyone else are just blind haters, because treating people like equals is hard, and getting sex when and how you want it is immensely biologically rewarding.
