Hilarious: I spend 20 minutes rebutting each and every one of your arguments in this and the other post, and unknowingly throw you a lifeline that you can latch onto to ignore it all and eject.

The reason there's no point in continuing this discussion is that you're clearly incapable of defending your belief system :P If it makes you feel better to use my profession, which you know nothing about, as your excuse to not address any of my arguments, well, I've seen that behavior before.

"Global warming isn't real, and you can't trust climate scientists... Their job depends on saying it is!"

"Vaccinations cause autism, and you can't trust doctors... Their job depends on saying it doesn't!"

We're talking about science here, observations, empirical evidence. I hope someday that penetrates the echo chamber you've housed your ego in, but like Scientologists who have been brainwashed into rejecting anything psychiatrists say as evil, you've clearly got a lot of programming to undo first.

Ah well. Good luck to you.
