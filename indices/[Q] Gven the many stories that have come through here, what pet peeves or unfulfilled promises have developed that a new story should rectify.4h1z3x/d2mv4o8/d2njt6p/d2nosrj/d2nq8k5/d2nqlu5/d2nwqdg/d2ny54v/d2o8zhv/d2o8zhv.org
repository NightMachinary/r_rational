  How is it 'unfeasible' for women to have values other than material gain?
#+end_quote

It's not unfeasible for women to have values other than material gain, but nowadays there are so few women with the values men value that finding one and being a valuable enough male to interest her it's very difficult.

  Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the rationalist community usually take people's values as given?
#+end_quote

People's values, not people's STATED values. In fiction it's fairly easy to know the character's values, either by the writer telling us through internal thinking or by simply watching the characters' behaviors. In real life it's much more difficult, and people's stated values are often very different from their real values.

And our (men) chance to understand the real values of a given woman is limited by our own biases, emotional investment and our insane sexual desire.
