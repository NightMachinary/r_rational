The sad part is you would probably vehemently renounce some misandrist who said that men aren't "all bad," but that they're biologically programmed to be so, and that culture reinforces their abusive behaviors. Or maybe you wouldn't: it would be refreshing to meet an actual egalitarian Red Piller, even if they'd be just as wrong.

Yeah, I've read that. It's so full of irrational and downright falsifiable assertions that it's fairly repugnant to those not steeped in the ideology, like many posts that Red Pillers hold up as enlightening.

What those inside of echo chambers don't really understand is that the reason outsiders don't care about their justifications for their beliefs is that they're operating on a basis of knowledge and axioms that are already refuted. Like debating with a Creationist, further argument past a certain point is simply irrelevant: if I really wanted to drill into your beliefs and get you to put a mathematical number on what EXACT portion of the female population you feel fits your beliefs, and then walk you through an experiment that would help you lower your estimate again and again to realistic numbers until TRP's whole philosophy falls apart, I'm much better served by simply pointing the poor epistemology out and hoping that I've planted a seed: I don't have the time or energy for anything else.

I've been to that site too. It attempts to do something noble and worthwhile, and at times approaches it with some genuinely good advice, but overall it still reinforces the same poor epistemology and false dichotomies.
