  It's not unfeasible for women to have values other than material gain, but nowadays there are so few women with the values men value that finding one and being a valuable enough male to interest her it's very difficult.

Wow, talk about throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Mate, while I would agree with the statement that SOME women only search for mates based on material gain (as do SOME men), but to state unequivically that MOST women are naught but money-grubbing gold diggers (which is basically what you're saying here) is about as accurate as saying all black people are thugs, or all white people are rednecks, or other, similar generalization.

It's incorrect.
