The biggest problem I had with [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s Team Anko was that Anko was in a poly-amorous relationship that was brought up in a very shoehorned way. I felt that he was delivering an HPMoR-style lecture rather than developing her character.

[[/u/velorien]], on the other hand, has done a great job with Naruto and Hinata in Lighting Up the Dark, especially Hinata's reasonable approach to romantic problems and misunderstandings.
