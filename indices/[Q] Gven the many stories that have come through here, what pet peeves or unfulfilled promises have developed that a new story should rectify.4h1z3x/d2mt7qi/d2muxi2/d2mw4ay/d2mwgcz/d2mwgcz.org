"Nuclear radiation" varies, but typically people mean "ionising radiation" -- usually photons with enough energy to knock electrons off atoms. This is more likely to wreck your radio by destroying any delicate circuits than interfere with low-energy, low-frequency, long-wave radio waves.

On the other end, a microwave oven is basically a radio with enough power to cook meat, but it doesn't need lead shielding and doesn't give you cancer - but might interfere with your wifi.
