Focus on increasing one's Wisdom over one's Intelligence Score. A lot of rational fiction often involve the protagonist trying to improve their intelligence or taking the time to learn skills relevant to the plot. I want to see a character who is deliberately striving to become more mature and to grow as a person rather going all mad-scientist.

I get that to be rational often involves learning how to decide and achieve one's goals, but many protagonists of rational fiction tend to be very 'narrow minded' where they focus overly much on their goals without too much focus on other ways to improve themselves even if it won't help overly much for their goals.

Sorry if it's a bit ramblely. It's a subtle thing I've been noticing a lack of in rational fiction and I'm not quite sure of the best way to explain it. It's just that I often see 'rational' characters coming up with intelligent solutions of clever munckins, but I rarely see long-term planning and most protagonists are /reactive/ towards some outside problem rather than being proactive in self-development and making use of more mundane solutions in tandem with the fantastic.
