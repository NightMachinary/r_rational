I think I may be the opposite, at least insofar as I understand the distinction between /rational/ and /rationalist/ fiction. I usually read or skim stories from this sub and others for quick, mindless entertainment, and find myself annoyed more often than not when the plot or worldbuilding take a backseat to goofy edutaitional lecturing, which I almost always end up skipping. It's ok if it's done with a light touch, a subtle reference or fun fact here and there, but not when the narrative flow is broken by a paragraph or two lifted from wikipedia or some pop-sci book or wherever.

Agreed about proactive v.s. reactive protagonists, though.

  its okay to have protag be very powerful and solving/munchkin problems very fast even in beginning, so long as the opposing force is of equal or greater strength

Having believable, edge-of-your-seat conflicts is good, but I do like my badass power fantasy stomps (e.g. certain parts of One Punch Man).
