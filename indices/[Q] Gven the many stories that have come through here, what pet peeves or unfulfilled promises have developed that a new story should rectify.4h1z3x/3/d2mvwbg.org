Rationalist techniques and mindset. While a rational and consistent world is great thing, I prefer more of the original hpmor thing with different modes of though, problem solving, deductions and rule manipulation and discovery by logic.

So more of that please. And it would be great if the protag was someone who actively goes out to do something, rather than getting into problems by circumstances, destiny, luck or for plot reasons. That is to say an actor rather than a reactor type of guy (girl/gorrila/gramma/godzira or whatever your protag is)

EDIT: Also speed is important too, its okay to have protag be very powerful and solving/munchkin problems very fast even in beginning, so long as the opposing force is of equal or greater strength
