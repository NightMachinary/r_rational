The lack of munchinism of the main character is making me uncomfortable , he didn't even won the lottery yet. Even if he really can't think about all the things that he could be asking( how I can cure cancer, what dangers I will probably face today,,how to prove Riemann hypothesis, is p =np, how to win money , how to improve his skills........)he could ask "What should I ask you?". It's like if you gave someone cheat codes for a game and they used the give whatever it in you want code to get weapons slightly better than their current level.(edited)
