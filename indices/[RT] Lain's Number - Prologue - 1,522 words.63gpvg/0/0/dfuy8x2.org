There's a reason why he hasn't asked "What should I ask you?", but I can't really say much more without spoiling stuff. Of course he hasn't won the lottery. He doesn't need a lot of money yet (the blog makes enough for him to have decent spending money), he doesn't want to even risk drawing attention to himself, and there's way more efficient methods of abusing the number to make money. I'm sure someone out there can give me a compelling reason for why this is a retarded decision on my part, but that's my reasoning.

As far as all the things Emmett could be doing right now, he's pretty much focused on ruling the world before distributing any cancer cures. I don't know if this classifies as a spoiler, but one of his plans is to create friendly AI that can take care of that. It's just that he lacks the technical knowledge to do it at the moment.
