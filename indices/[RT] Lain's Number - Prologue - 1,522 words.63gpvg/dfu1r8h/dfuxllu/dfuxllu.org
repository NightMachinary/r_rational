Thanks for the feedback! I hope you don't mind if I explain my choices here. Emmett's first character arc /is/ realizing that he isn't taking everything as seriously as he could. He's cocky. He thinks he's just bound to win because of his protagonist status. Of course, he's not actively thinking this. I wanted to start with a smaller scale conflict in part because I'm still learning to write and because I want a big contrast between the early parts of the story and the later ones. I don't want to sit here and defend my writing, though. I realize I'm still an amateur. Pretty much everything about this story could be better, but I can only fix that with experience.

Oh and thanks for the book recommendation! I'm definitely checking it out.
