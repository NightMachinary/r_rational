Hmm. I like the premise, and I /really/ like the "twist", but I don't like where you go from there. It doesn't feel like he's taking both the ability and and twist seriously. The parts you show seem to be more about, well, college drama - relatively unimportant given his "super power" - and the parts that you imply ("going into medicine, going to help a lot of people" implies asking the super power science questions) are where I'd consider him taking this seriously.

I do want to reiterate how much I love the twist. That's pretty excellent, actually. The more I think about it, the more amazing it becomes; the more level is works on. It's pretty genius.

You should check out a book called "Sophie's World". That book may be why I don't think your MC is taking his situation seriously.

I have a lot more I can say, if you want it.
