Yeah, I'm making an effort to stop the references. It's just that sometimes, when I'm outlining, I realize that I came up with something I had already seen in an anime before and I feel an urge to acknowledge it. Otherwise, I feel like I'm taking credit for something that isn't mine. I'm obviously going to indulge on them here and there in the future, but spamming them too much ruins the enjoyment. I think I did a good job of keeping them to a minimum later on, but I need to come back and edit the early parts with them.

I'm probably gonna post it on Fictionpress eventually. I'm also releasing the entire arc in a PDF when I finish it! The problem is that the people following it are only on Reddit. One of my priorities right now is finding a bot that can message people on Reddit whenever a chapter is posted. If I can make it so that:

1) Whenever a chapter is posted on Fictionpress, it's posted on my subreddit.

2) Whenever a chapter is posted on my subreddit, people who registered with the bot are notified of the new chapter.

I'd have the best of both worlds. I'm trying to figure out how to do this by the time I finish the first arc, but for now I'm just focusing on writing.

I just realized this reply got kinda long and I apologize for it. Thanks for enjoying the story!
