I enjoyed reading so far but although I'm an anime fan myself I think there are way too many explicit references.

Although it's not unrealistic for people to be referring to Anime since I do that with my friends all the time, it just feels weird when people dress and act like Anime even though everyone clearly lives in America and mostly acts as such.

Also please put it somewhere other than reddit threads because getting to the last chapter every time is a pain, I'd love to be able to follow it more easily
