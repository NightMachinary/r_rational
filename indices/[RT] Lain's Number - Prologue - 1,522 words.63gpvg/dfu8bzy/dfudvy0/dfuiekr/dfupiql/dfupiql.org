Exactly, I don't mind if he corrects me , even if I wasn't learning English it wouldn't matter anyway because reddit has an edit button so it's not like changing it it's a tremendous effort.If he was nitpicking everything it could be annoying , but this error was significant enough to let kodix deduce I 'm learning english , and it's not the kind of error the autocorrector can solve ,so I would have kept repeating it.
