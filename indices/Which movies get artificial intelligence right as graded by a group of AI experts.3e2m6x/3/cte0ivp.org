I'm somewhat surprised that the article so readily dismisses uploading. If nothing else, it seems like something that shouldn't be too difficult (think Manhattan Project, not undergrad in their mom's basement) to brute-force a biophyisical/-chemical simulation given sufficient computing power (which I'm relatively sure we don't have: wikipedia says supercomputers get up to a few petaflops, and [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=computers-have-a-lot-to-learn-from-2009-03-10][this]] says a human brain's power is on the order of 40 petaflops)

[[http://www.openworm.org/][They]]'re doing just that to /C. elegans/ *right now*, and there's no reason to believe there is a difference between nematode and human neurons that makes the latter impossible /in principle/ to simulate the same way.
