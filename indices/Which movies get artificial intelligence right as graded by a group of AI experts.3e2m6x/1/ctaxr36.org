The author seems to be jumping between what "robots" (thinking apparently about actual industrial robots) can do, and what artificial intelligences (potentially conscious ones) can do. I kind of get the impression that the author doesn't actually understand the issues here, he asked a bunch of different AI researchers about their opinions of different movies following different scripts, and just glued it together.
