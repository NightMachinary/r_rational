That particular quote is from Marcus Hutter. He also seems like someone who knows what he's talking about; I suspect his opinion has been oversimplified for the purpose of reviewing a Hollywood movie. Without a rigorous definition of what an agent's "goal" is, it's meaningless to say "agents can never change goals", or "agents should never change goals" or "agents will never change goals in real-world situations".

Also his book is now on my wishlist.
