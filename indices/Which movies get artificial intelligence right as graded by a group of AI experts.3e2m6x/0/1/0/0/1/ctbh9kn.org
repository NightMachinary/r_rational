Possibly! As I said in another comment, we won't be able to have rigorous arguments without a solid definition of what a "goal" even is.

If you can change goals because you realise that your old goal was bad, then perhaps your real goal was "be good" all along. And you've just come to a different understanding of what that means.

Or perhaps you've met people and travelled the world and broadened your perspective and the experience has changed you in some ineffable way. You can't pinpoint the moment when your alignment shifted, but you know that your old ambitions seem repugnant now.

I don't know. Stuff is complicated.
