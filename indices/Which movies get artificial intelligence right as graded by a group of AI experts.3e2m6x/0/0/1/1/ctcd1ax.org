One would hope that "do not roll down unhealthy incentive gradients" would be induced as a normal part of causal learning rather than having to be built into special-case social reasoning or decision-making code, but that presupposes a powerful causal induction capability operating over hierarchies of feature- and role-governed concepts. Or, in other words, intelligence.
