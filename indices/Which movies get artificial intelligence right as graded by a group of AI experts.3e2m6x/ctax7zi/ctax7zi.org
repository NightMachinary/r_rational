  All the experts are quick to point out that robots do not change their programming, and the notion that they could spontaneously develop new agendas is pure fiction. Hutter says the underlying goals programmed into the machine are “static.” “There are mathematical theories that prove a perfectly rational goal-achieving agent has no motivation to change its own goals.”

I doubt I have the background to understand the math, but I'd be curious to at least have a peek at it (and I would assume that someone here knows what he's referring to).

I also think that somewhat undersells the "new agenda" angle. The worry isn't that they'd develop a new agenda, but rather that an old agenda would get re-contextualized. For example, if my agenda were to sell as much lemonade as possible, I might change my grand strategy such that I'm doing things which seem totally unrelated to actually selling lemonade (like starting a junta).
