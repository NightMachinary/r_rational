It's outright impossible to achieve "perfect" rationality in the sense of having a completed infinity of empirical data and computing power. Rationality, for a software agent, is necessarily resource-bounded, and "about" how well the agent behaves in the limits of increasing or decreasing resources.

Otherwise you end up with weird paradox theorems, like in mathematical logic :-P.
