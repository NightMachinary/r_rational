1. You're welcome!

2. Yeah, I hear you. I don't like it when characters don't understand the basic fundamentals about how their society works. It's a fine line. The way I was seeing it is sort of comparable to how an average teenager would have heard for years that "drugs and alchohol are bad for you", and maybe the teenager knows something specific like "my dad took this specific drug and this happened", but the kid wouldn't necessarily know the details about how all the substances work and their specific problems.

3. You pretty much answered this one for yourself. Jin and Marissa are not particularly popular students, exactly for the reasons you just suggested. I was also picturing that there's probably some sort of automatic assignment process for anyone who doesn't get manually selected for a team by a certain deadline; a lot of students would just lean on that.

4. Thanks for the call out! Will fix for the next revision.

5. I'm glad this all made sense in the end. I knew it would be easy for the reader to [[#s][spoiler on the same subject]]

*Neutral stuff:*

1. Fascinating, that's the first time I've heard a review that didn't like the dungeon crawling. Do you have any specific ideas on what you didn't like about it? Most people actually tend to tell me the opposite (they liked the dungeon crawling more than the school parts).

2. Derek is considerably older than most of the cast (he's in his 20s). He's not a student, he's just a Climber who lives near the campus. Hitting Emerald in his 20s is highly unusual. There are other examples of people doing the same thing, but he's a prodigy. A part of that is the fact that the Hartigan family is a famous house with a lot of resources, so they presumably could afford things like the permanent enhancement elixirs that were mentioned earlier in the story.

3. So, the problem with selling Corin's upgraded sigils is that they'd be too expensive for most of the poor students/Climbers/etc., and not high enough quality for the wealthy ones. There would be a market, but it wouldn't be particularly large. He's in that awkward place where he can make something that's better than the free ones, but not good enough to compete with mass-produced sigils that are considerably more powerful. There are patented, brand-name shield sigils that would have all the same features and a much higher capacity.

He could absolutely make a profit on selling upgraded sigils, but the majority of people who are in the market for a better life-saving device would go with a brand name one with a higher capacity over something of dubious quality made by a first year student.

As for loans, that's absolutely something that he could have looked into, it just didn't occur to him. The teachers could have recommended it, but they had other things they wanted to push him toward. Vellum in particular is trying to get him to cultivate an unusual skill set, and having a bunch of money to spend would have discouraged that.

*Positive Feedback:*

Won't go through this line-by-line, just glad you enjoyed it. =D

Thanks for all the feedback! Glad you liked this more than my other series.
