Hiya,

Thanks for reading the book.

Some replies to your comments.

  I'm glad I pushed on, because things got much more enjoyable once he leaves and interacts with normal people, and the straightforward snark is very refreshing to me. The engineering approach to magic is also highly interesting, and felt very relatable.

Glad you liked these elements.

  I got the Kindle edition, and you used "discrete" instead of "discreet" every single time. There were other spelling mistakes elsewhere too. I feel like the book could have used another technical editing pass.
#+end_quote

I fixed some of those recently, but I'm not sure when you got it. I did have a professional editor, but it's very possible I missed some of his notes. I may do a second edition at some point with another editing pass.

  The gulf in power between characters made certain matchups and outcomes feel improbable.
#+end_quote

Which ones in specific, out of curiosity?

I know it's common in xianxia and many isekai or LitRPG books for a couple tiers of power to be an insurmountable difference between characters. That's never been the intent in this series; a high powered human is still supposed to be in danger from low level ones under specific circumstances (e.g. if someone can work around their shroud).

High powered attuned are much more powerful /offensively/ than low powered attuned, and have a lot more mana to work with. They are not, however, much more /defensively/ powerful - their shroud gets stronger, but there are (as we've seen) a lot of ways around a shroud. That means that even the strongest humans are still relatively vulnerable to close range attacks, unless they also have a secondary form of defense (which some attuned do have, but we haven't seen a lot of it yet).

Some monsters are also harder power checks; creatures like Mizuchi or Seiryu are just too tough for a low powered character to be able to reliably deal them damage. There may still be ways to work around this, however (e.g. specific weak points).

I realize this is probably jarring because it's not standard for the genre. Most of my readers are probably expecting it to work more like an anime where a low level character would break their fist trying to punch someone of a higher power level; that's definitely not the intent here.

  I'm not sure how you intend to patch the differences in power between the protagonists and his companions after the end of the first book.

  The book ended very awkwardly.
#+end_quote

[[#s][Replies to spoilers]]

In regards to the loose ends, you're right - that's just a consequence of not covering the whole year in one book. The vast majority of that will be covered in the second book.

  Curtis the dorm RA never shows up again after his introduction.
#+end_quote

Corin did talk to Curtis about that incident, but it's just summarized, rather than shown as a full scene. [[#s][Relevant quote]]

You're right that Corin could have made more use of Curtis, but Corin has serious trust issues in general. He doesn't like to rely on others in general, and certainly not relative strangers. This is a flaw that he needs to learn to work through.

  Who was Sera's date for the winter dance supposed to be?
#+end_quote

The winter ball stuff, as well as Cecily, will be addressed in the second book. I also have a tendency to drop hints about things that could take a while to come up as major plot points (the Tyrant in Gold, the Seventh Spire, Selys-Lyann's origins, etc.)

It's just an element of my writing style; I tend to write more like a web serial, rather than each book being fully self-contained and plot driven. This is also why there's so much slice-of-life stuff that isn't directly plot relevant. This doesn't work for everyone, and I understand that.

Thanks for the comments, and I'm glad you enjoyed the book, even if the unresolved hooks left you frustrated. Rest assured that you'll get to see most of that addressed in the sequel (or later).
