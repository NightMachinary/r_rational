  I loved this book tremendously Probably one of my favorite books of all time. Behind a select few Clancy, Sanderson, and Card Books. I do want to say something about your writing style though.

Thanks so much for the kind words! I appreciate even being mentioned in the same breath as such fantastic writers.

  It's these small details that make me enjoy your book, they give your characters depth that I love.

Good!

  I just want to request however that you Don't pull a Hollywood, and drop an extremely tempting plot hook early on, then in editing and rewriting later books drop that story line for various reasons leaving us forever hanging for more information. I understand that not everything can make it into a final product, just please be considerate and try and tie up these loose ends.

Oh, sure! A lot of that stuff is definitely getting clear follow up. The winter ball and Cecily, for example, are outlined to both be big things in the second book. I haven't written those scenes yet, but they're planned.

And there's no way I'd drop some of the things like artificial attunements or the Tyrant in Gold - those are both part of the main plot of the series.

  Is it correct to assume that you are limited to Amazon.com Companies?

Yes, that's correct. I'm a part of Kindle Select for my book publishing, which means I can only publish on Amazon.
