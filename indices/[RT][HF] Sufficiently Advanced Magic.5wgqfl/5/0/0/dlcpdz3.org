re: Gulf in power

I see. I was mostly concerned when [[#s][spoilers]], but you've explained that sufficiently. Corin's obsessive focus on his own defense (which is part of his character) may have affected that perception.

My perceived problem (which I think I overstated, apologies) is actually the opposite - [[#s][spoiler]]

Ah, I see. It's reassuring to have you clarify. I was mostly thrown off by the end of the book because [[#s][spoilers]]

  Corin did talk to Curtis about that incident, but it's just summarized, rather than shown as a full scene. [[#s][Relevant quote]]

I forgot about the Curtis mention. Sorry about that! And yes, I do get the sense that Corin has trust issues and wouldn't have approached Curtis willingly.

  It's just an element of my writing style; I tend to write more like a web serial, rather than each book being fully self-contained and plot driven. This is also why there's so much slice-of-life stuff that isn't directly plot relevant. This doesn't work for everyone, and I understand that.

Ah, is this a common writing style? I'm may simply not be used to it. Are there any authors you'd recommend that also do this?
