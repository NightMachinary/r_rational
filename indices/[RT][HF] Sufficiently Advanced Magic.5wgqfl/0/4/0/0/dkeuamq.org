Thanks for the response!

The tower setting is what somehow triggered some visceral memories and thus the purchase. And, in case nobody played FF Legend/SaGa, the part about the tower that is making me extremely curious is that at the end of FF Legend, [[#s][spoilers]] I still haven't finished your book, but I can feel it going in a similar direction.

In my own worldbuilding over the years, magical technology has also always fascinated me, so it's interesting to see your rendition of it.

Plus, I'm listening to the audiobook version. Having Nick Podehl doing the reading puts your book in some very good company.
