  Started reading your book. It somehow triggered a deep need to play a game version of this, collect monster crystals and craft items.

Glad it triggered that instinct. =D I'd love to get a game made in this setting eventually.

  What JRPGs in particular were you inspired by?

Tons of them.

The tower itself was inspired by Azure Dreams, as well as the Ancient Cave in Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals. There are plenty of other games with similar elements, but those were my initial inspiration. There's a little nod in there to Tower of Druaga, too, which was one of the earliest "giant tower dungeon crawl" games.

The idea of a setting where everyone is aware of character classes existing and that they can be earned was inspired by Bravely Default.

Many of the specific attunements are heavily inspired by Final Fantasy. Sera is basically a Final Fantasy style Summoner, for example. (Although you could argue she's got a lot in common with Sheena from Tales of Symphonia, too.)

Much of the magical technology style is inspired by Final Fantasy 6. There's a lot of similarity to The Legend of Heroes as well - that's less intentional, even if they actually ended up coming across as more similar in some respects. (I haven't actually played Trails of Cold Steel yet, for example, but there's a ton of similarity from what I've seen from watching someone else play recently.)

The society placing a lot of value on retainers is pretty heavily inspired by Fire Emblem.

Four of the God Beasts are based on Japanese mythological beings (that are based, in turn, on Chinese ones). Using them as tower bosses was inspired by the very first SaGa game (Final Fantasy Legend in the US), which also happens to have a tower climbing plot.

There are other smaller influences as well, but those are some of the big ones.
