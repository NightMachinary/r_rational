Glad you enjoyed the book!

  At times the main character did seem to lack knowledge that I really feel should be common knowledge - the kind of thing you pick up through cultural osmosis. Why is fairly clear - it's always easier and more natural to explain things to the reader if the main character is learning them too - but Corin isn't Harry Potter entering a world for the first time.

Completely agree, I think this was my biggest flaw in writing the book. I should have made it clearer that some of the classroom stuff would have been simply review for Corin, and would have been in the classes simply for the benefit of people like Marissa who may not have had a solid educational foundation, or maybe foreigners who were only aware of their own culture's attunements, etc.

Corin definitely should have basic understanding of his society and culture. I think I handled that okay in some places (like his knowledge about the Six Year War and his great grandfather's role in it), but I definitely should have had him rolling his eyes in some of the basic magic instructions.

Glad you enjoyed the book overall, and I'll try to make sure that in the future, I don't make anything seem foreign to Corin that should be common knowledge from someone who grew up in the setting.

Thanks for the review!
