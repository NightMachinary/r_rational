Hey all,

I just released a new novel, [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBFD7CB/][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]], that I think would appeal to some of the people around here.

It takes place in a JRPGish setting, with the action split between a magical university setting and a ever-changing uber dungeon. There's a lot of emphasis on learning the rules of magic and applying them - both in research and in combat.

In addition to JRPGs, I drew a lot of inspiration from Mother of Learning and Tower of God. If you like the idea of something like Mother of Learning with more of a JRPGish bent, I think you might enjoy this. (No time loop here, though, so don't expect that.)

In terms of the writing style, I'm most frequently compared to Sanderson, but I tend to lean toward more anime-style tropes.

Feel free to post if you've got any questions or anything. Hope you all enjoy it if you check it out!
