  How'd you come up with the title ?

I debated the title for a long time. Right before release, I was still debating just calling it "Attuned", which was my working title that I'd used for the beta readers. I realized that "Attuned" doesn't really tell a prospective reader anything about the nature of the story, however, and I decided that I needed something that would set an appropriate tone.

Ultimately, the book was mostly about magic being researched to the point of being integrated into virtually every element of society. I thought about Arthur C. Clarke's quote about "sufficiently advanced technology" and inverted it. I'm not the first person who came up with that inverted quote - TVTropes refers to it as "Sufficiently Analyzed Magic", for example - but it still felt like a good book title.
