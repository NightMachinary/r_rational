  I don't think asexuality doesn't exist. You misunderstand.
#+end_quote

Ah, I misunderstood what you meant by "Asexual is not a believable person."

Let me address your more recent point, then.

#+begin_quote
  I think that it is so far outside the norm that you will never have a wide audience identify with your character, and, as you said, you wanted him to be believable.
#+end_quote

A few points to make here.

First off, readers can identify with Corin about other characteristics, even if they don't identify with his sexuality. I've had readers identify with Corin because of his touch aversion (see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6ntcb5/sufficiently_advanced_magic_rfantasy_delivered/dkdalbx/][here]], because of the way he thinks (see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6ntcb5/sufficiently_advanced_magic_rfantasy_delivered/dkc45q1/][here]], or his general behavioral traits (see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6irmm9/is_corin_from_sufficiently_advanced_magic_autistic/dj9j5ge/][here]].

Second, being asexual is not something everyone is comfortable talking about, and thus there may be more people out there than we're aware of. This is doubly true when you consider people who aren't quite traditionally asexual (grey asexual or demisexual), and they may still identify with the character for that reason.

Third, the number of people who are asexual might be small, but they're so rare in fiction that they may appreciate finding someone they can identify with in terms of that trait.

This both means that I can do something more positive for those people than if I was just writing another straight white guy, and if we're talking purely in terms of strategy (which seems to be your focus), those fans are more likely to be loyal because they have so few other things to read with characters they identify with on that particular subject.

  The 3 main characters so far are arguably Corin, Sarah, and Jin and one of the guys is gay and one is asexual.
#+end_quote

If the sexualities of the characters are the only factors that are important for their reading experience, and the reader is also heterosexual, I could see why they might be disappointed by a lack of heterosexual content - but romance has never been the focus of the story in general.

I would also argue that Patrick is as much of a main character as Jin, and his heterosexual interest in Sera is as much of a plot point as Jin's interests. There are other major characters that have been implied to be heterosexual (or possibly bisexual) as well, such as Marissa and Derek, so there are still people for readers to identify with if they're heterosexual and that's really all that important.

  Who is your target audience with that? Not straight men which make up the largest demographic for fantasy/sci-fi books.
#+end_quote

My target audience is people who enjoy JRPGs and anime, especially those who enjoy detailed magic systems (e.g. Sanderson's systems or Hunter x Hunter).

The fact that the main character is asexual is a minor component, and it isn't something that I market the book based on. If the main character was straight, I still wouldn't be targeting the book based on that unless the romance was a major part of the story (which is isn't).

Moreover, I don't think it's important to worry about targeting the largest possible audience. I write about what I'm interested in. It's been working out great so far, because it turns out a whole lot of people seem to share my interests. The book has been doing great.
