As someone close to where Corin seems to be on the sexual/romantic spectrum, basically:

You can go through the same phases of romantic attraction without sexual attraction. I still go through periods of infatuation followed by long-term bonding with romantic partners. I mean, it's kind of a stereotype that old married couples have little or no sex, but that doesn't make them less married, right?

In my case, I can enjoy the activity of sex without feeling attraction. Since Corin is touch-averse, I'd guess he wouldn't enjoy sex at all.
