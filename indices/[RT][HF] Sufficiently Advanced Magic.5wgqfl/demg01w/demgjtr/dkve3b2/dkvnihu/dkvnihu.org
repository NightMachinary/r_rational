The books will never be focused on romance, not by any stretch of the imagination. Learning magic and solving problems will always be the central focus of the story.

But this is about Corin's life as a whole, and there will be portions that deal with his relationships with his family members, his friendships, and potential romantic interests.

Romance is definitely the least emphasized of the various types of relationships, but there are scenes were it may be at least somewhat relevant to the plot (like whether or not he brings someone with him to the winter ball, which is a major story event).
