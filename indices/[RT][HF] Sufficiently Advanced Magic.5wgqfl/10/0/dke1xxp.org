Thank you for the kind words! I'm so glad you enjoyed it, and that the JRPG inspiration came through.

Nick did a fantastic job. I asked my publisher for him because they hired him for my other books previously, and I was very impressed by the work he did with my other series. Also, because there will eventually be more crossover between the two series, so he will be familiar with the voices for both. =)

I'll try to get the sequel ready soon!
