So, just finished this on audio book. Loved it.

Wasn't aware of the direction the story was planning to take since I went in blind (I don't even read the summaries on audible. I was super intrigued when it started to feel like a JRPG with the tower. Then I was convinced it was going for a JRPG theme after the introduction of certain elements.

Really like the story being told from the perspective of one person only, really lets you get into it. Also, not sure who chose to have Nick Podehl narrate it, but that was the right move. I'm convinced that man is some sort of god due to the vast variety of voices he has at his command and his ability to really put life into the characters.

I actually came by this book because I was searching for things narrated by him and now I see was NOT let down.

Can't wait to see where future installations in the series lead to. I think you have done an excellent job of building a foundation for a world that has multiple layers waiting to be peeled back and exposed.

Eagerly awaiting the next book!
