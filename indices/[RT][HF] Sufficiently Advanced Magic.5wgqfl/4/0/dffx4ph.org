Thanks so much, I'm glad you enjoyed the books!

I'm especially glad you enjoyed both parts in Sufficiently Advanced Magic. I knew that mixing the two styles was unusual and that would rub some people the wrong way, so I'm happy it worked for you.

Your question is pretty heavily related to the main plot of both series, so I wouldn't want to say too much and spoil things. The reasons for their distinct tech levels, cultures, and magic are absolutely something that is going to be explored in the story.

They're in the same universe, but I don't think I've said that they're on the same planet or in the same time frame. It's more complicated than that; I won't get into details because of heavy spoilers.
