Just finished this. I binged the audible in 6 days. Really enjoyed your book. I'd love to be on the in for your second book. (Send me an advanced copy haha)

Your book had everything except a bard. Literally had everything. I loved it. Thank you for making my week.

How'd you come up with the title ?
