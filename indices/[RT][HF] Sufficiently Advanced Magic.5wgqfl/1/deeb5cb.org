I gave it a read on a whim. A few impressions follow.

First, the title is crap. The usual inversion of Clarke's Law is "Sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology." Which makes me think the protagonist would be an inventor, or in today's parlance, an engineer. I like those kinds of stories. Generally speaking, only engineers (of some stripe) can pull it off. Unfortunately, this author is clearly not one of those. The title could still be forgivable, but now I'm asking "Sufficient for what?"

The writing style makes the sin of being /tedious/. Conservation of detail would be welcome. The dungeon crawling is simply boring. I really don't want to read a blow-by-blow of a D&D campaign. On the positive side, people turned off by this will be turned off within the first few pages, so there's really no complaining when it happens again. Unfortunately, the school scenes are just as tedious. Every time the narrator goes "Wow, that could be really useful!" is grating. Most of the classroom lectures are pointlessly dull. Characters taking time out from important matters to lecture about magic is off-putting. The story really could have been told in a third of the space it currently uses, and would be a more exciting read for it.

The character motivations don't really work. The main character fails to be motivated by anything but to "Get Power". Ostensibly, the reason is to get his brother back, but I'm not sold. The only other motivation I see is to protect his sister, which is actually convincingly demonstrated, but only comes up a few times. I also wish I'd seen the main character trying to have fun. Instead, it's a 24/7 grind to gain power (which he's not even very effective at).

I'm rather put off by the main character's stated values. He demonstrates values more closely aligned to modern enlightenment ideals, which are markedly different from those present in the most of the characters. It starts feeling a bit like an author tract.

Finally, what is with that one character suddenly coming out two thirds of the way through? And nobody reacting at all. I get that romance isn't a significant part of the story. Fine. And I get that maybe this is a very normal thing in the setting. Fine. But it has not been demonstrated in the least bit up to this point. No reference to any couples to give the reader any expectation of social norms, just a general sense of heteronormative behaviors. This scene could have been removed entirely without changing anything.

As for whether this work is a rat!fic... I don't know. Conflicts motivated by beliefs and values? Check. Consistent rules? Close enough. Intelligent characters? Sometimes. Not often enough. And plot-wise, the only characters making significant decisions are doing so in the background, off-screen; the plot essentially moves without the main characters.

All in all, this novel is not a polished work. There are a number of minor inconsistencies that should be resolved; quite a few scenes that should be removed/combined/shortened. And the main character needs to be reworked a bit to make him relatable and believable.
