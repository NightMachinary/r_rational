Hi,

I finished Sufficiently Advanced Magic yesterday and I enjoyed it. I think you succeeded in what you set out to achieve. The towers give a strong 'gaming' feel - both in 'like a jrpg' and in the 'here's a game, now figure out how to beat it' sense. That's was good and I really enjoyed it. The magic was also quite nice, clearly rule based but also with enough breath to feel magical. You mention Sanderson in your post and a problem I sometimes have with Sanderson's magic systems is that they are too limited, more a limited set of superpowers than magic.

At times the main character did seem to lack knowledge that I really feel should be common knowledge - the kind of thing you pick up through cultural osmosis. Why is fairly clear - it's always easier and more natural to explain things to the reader if the main character is learning them too - but Corin isn't Harry Potter entering a world for the first time. This is his world that he grew up in and I don't think it all could be blamed on cutting himself off from everyone to train.

That said, the Mother of Learning inspiration was clearly evidence and here as in there, it is very nice to see a character slowly learn the rules and exploit them.

In short, I enjoyed reading Sufficiently Advanced Magic and will pick up the squeal if and when it arrives.
