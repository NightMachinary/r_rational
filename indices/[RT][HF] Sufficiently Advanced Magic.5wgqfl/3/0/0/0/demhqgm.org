Essentially, someone who is asexual but not aromantic enjoys forms of romantic bonding that are not of a sexual nature.

For example, they might enjoy going out on dates, dancing, cuddling, going to sleep together... it completely depends on the person, since different people define romantic activities differently.

For someone who is asexual, sex is generally not the end-goal of romantic activities. They can still have increasing degrees of closeness with another person over time; again, the specific nature is going to vary based on the couple.

As for how it differs from a close friendship, that's going to be up to the people involved. Some people might define having a candlelit dinner or holding hands at a movie as exclusively romantic activities; for others, they might be platonic.

I'm not any sort of authority on this subject. If you're interested in learning more, here's an [[https://lgbtq.unc.edu/asexuality-attraction-and-romantic-orientation][article]] on the subject, and you can easily find more on google if you want to learn more.

If you don't like seeing male/male relationships, I suspect my book probably wouldn't interest you.
