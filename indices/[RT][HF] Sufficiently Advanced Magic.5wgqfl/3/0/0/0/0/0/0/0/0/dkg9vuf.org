I don't think asexuality doesn't exist. You misunderstand. I think that it is so far outside the norm that you will never have a wide audience identify with your character, and, as you said, you wanted him to be believable. The 3 main characters so far are arguably Corin, Sarah, and Jin and one of the guys is gay and one is asexual. Who is your target audience with that? Not straight men which make up the largest demographic for fantasy/sci-fi books.
