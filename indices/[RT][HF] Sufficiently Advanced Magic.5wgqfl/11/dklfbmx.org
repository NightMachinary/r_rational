I enjoyed the book overall. I personally really like the well-defined and explained magic systems and enjoyed seeing Corin strive for more power with what little resources he had, even if it was a little slow going at times. If I had been in this "world" I could see myself doing the same. I also liked the slight plot twist and unclear "bad guy". Too many novels make "good" and "bad" guys too black and white when it's usually shades of gray. I won't mention any criticism as the few I had have already been mentioned but I definitely am looking forward to the sequel.
