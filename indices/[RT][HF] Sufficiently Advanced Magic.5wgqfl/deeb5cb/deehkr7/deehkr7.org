Thank you for the review.

I felt that the process of enchanting was sufficiently detailed to constitute the use of the title. The main character explicitly invents at least one item in the story [[#s][minor spoilers]], and there's clearly a lot of research going on in the setting as a whole, such as [[#s][late book spoilers]]. I'm sorry if this wasn't what you were looking for.

If you're looking for faster pacing, that's just not my style. I write in a style more similar to Sanderson or Mother of Learning, with a lot of time put into people just learning about how magic works and doing their daily stuff. This sort of thing clearly isn't for everyone, but I like reading the more slice-of-life stuff, so I enjoy writing it as well.

The main character is definitely driven by his ambition (as a means to save his brother), but he's hindered by [[#s][motivation spoilers]]. His struggles to achieve his goals in spite of internal conflicts are part of the design of the story. I'm sorry you didn't like that component to it.

As for his values system feeling too modern, it's a multi-cultural setting with a 1900s-era tech level. He's something of an outlier, but he's not that extreme of a case. If it was a medieval fantasy setting, I'd find his behavior too extreme, but I don't think it's that jarring at this tech/culture level.

As for one character coming out and no one reacting, the only character that hears about it is the person who gets propositioned. They think about it and give an answer.

They didn't have to think about a ton of cultural consequences because there aren't any in this particular culture. The local religion has a goddess figure with six aspects of varying apparent sexes and genders, which has significantly helped to normalize the idea of different sexes/genders in this particular society. Individuals will have different views, of course, but their religion has made them more progressive about that issue than they are about some others. (For example, racism is still fairly common.)

I would argue that the plot moves both in response to main character actions /and/ in response to other actors, which is more realistic than a plot that is only driven by the main cast, in my opinion. Corin definitely triggers multiple plot events on-screen personally, but other people being involved in something that affects things on a national scale? That just makes sense.

If you have specific scenes that you feel are inconsistent, I would be happy to hear about those examples so I can address any problems that exist in future works.

Thank you for the detailed commentary.
