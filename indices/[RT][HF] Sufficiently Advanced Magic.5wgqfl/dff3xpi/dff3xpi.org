So, I've read Forging Divinity and Sufficiently Advanced Magic and I absolutely love them both.

In Sufficiently Advanced Magic, I really enjoyed both settings of the school AND the dungeon crawl through the tower. I just wanted you to know so that you don't think some of the negative reviews/responses are indicative of all your readers.

I have one question though. Both of these series occur on the same planet, and the same time frame but have radically different magic systems. I had thought maybe the "Dominion Marks" might have been the equivalent of attunement runes, but they don't really seem to behave the same way or have the same power or magnitude. Then I thought perhaps the towers in both stories might be related, but they seem to be drastically different, both in the manner of entrance/exit and puzzles vs overt kill rooms.

So, how does magic exist in the same time/planet in such different forms? Or is this puzzle meant for the reader to decipher?
