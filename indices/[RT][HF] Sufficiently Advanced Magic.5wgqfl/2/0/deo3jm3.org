There was actually a whole section of restrictions on the Jaden Box that got cut because it was so long that my beta readers complained. I kind of allude to it with the "see research notes" section in the description, but there are /some/ reasonable limits on it.

That said, it's still hilariously broken, and yes, it could still be used for both of those things. The target can resist the summoning attempt, so assassination would be trickier, but it would definitely be amazing for rescuing missing persons. The main limitation is the recharge time being so long.

It's also built from a different type of magic than the current attuned use, so it wouldn't be trivial to duplicate it. (That's one of the things the researchers have already been trying to do.) Mass producing Jaden Boxes would completely change how society functions.
