Read it after a friend recommended it to me.

I was actually going to abandon the book about 10% of the way in because, having read a lot of really bad Japanese isekai web novels, I was convinced that this whole book will be about Corin flailing around in the tower until he gets some broken power. I'm glad I pushed on, because things got much more enjoyable once he leaves and interacts with normal people, and the straightforward snark is very refreshing to me. The engineering approach to magic is also highly interesting, and felt very relatable.

I'm pleasantly surprised that this book became the first fantasy book I've read to feature a queer protagonist.

I have some problems though:

I got the Kindle edition, and you used "discrete" instead of "discreet" every single time. There were other spelling mistakes elsewhere too. I feel like the book could have used another technical editing pass.

The gulf in power between characters made certain matchups and outcomes feel improbable. I'm not sure how you intend to patch the differences in power between the protagonists and his companions after the end of the first book.

The book ended very awkwardly. [[#s][spoilers]]

As a consequence, there are a lot of plot-irrelevant loose ends:

- Nobody publicly names or seriously attempts to catch a Spider beyond Corin speculating on Jin. I was so excited for it.
- A Hogwarts-style points system was introduced and the points were never totaled.
- Curtis the dorm RA never shows up again after his introduction. Surely there were occasions in the book where he'd be useful, such as [[#s][mid book spoilers]]?
- There was this girl, Cecily, that Corin made a point not to talk to a couple times. When you do this it's implied that I will eventually know why within the book, and it /never happens/. The book doesn't even begin to explain why, and I get to the appendix and it just says "for unknown reasons". I feel like you could have left her out entirely and mention at a later book that Corin had been avoiding her for a while.
- Who was Sera's date for the winter dance supposed to be? That was dangled but I believe never answered? Things were supposed to be super awkward because of Corin's social screwup, and... that was basically thrown out.
