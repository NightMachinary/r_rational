  Corin's obsessive focus on his own defense (which is part of his character) may have affected that perception.

  Regarding resuming school.

I see where you're coming from. This is discussed very early in the second book. I can see why you had concerns.

  Ah, is this a common writing style? I'm may simply not be used to it. Are there any authors you'd recommend that also do this?

It's not common in published novels, but I would consider the plotting style similar to something like The Wandering Inn (which has a /ton/ of slice-of-life stuff) or Mother of Learning (which is another magical academy style and more similar to my book overall).
