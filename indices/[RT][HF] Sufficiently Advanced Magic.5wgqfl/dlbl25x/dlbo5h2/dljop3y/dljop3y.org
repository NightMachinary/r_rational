**/SPOILERS/**** - I CAN'T GET SPOILER TAGS TO WORK

I loved this book tremendously Probably one of my favorite books of all time. Behind a select few Clancy, Sanderson, and Card Books. I do want to say something about your writing style though.

  This is also why there's so much slice-of-life stuff that isn't directly plot relevant. This doesn't work for everyone, and I understand that.

It's these small details that make me enjoy your book, they give your characters depth that I love. I just want to request however that you Don't pull a Hollywood, and drop an extremely tempting plot hook early on, then in editing and rewriting later books drop that story line for various reasons leaving us forever hanging for more information. I understand that not everything can make it into a final product, just please be considerate and try and tie up these loose ends.

Lastly I have a few questions that I'm sure many other people have asked, but feel obligated anyway. I understand if the answer you give is, "read book 2," sorry in advance.

1. Sera - [[/spoiler][Is she still able to Cast magic or has her mana scarring made that impossible? Is her mark now just Summoner+Enchanter? If both of the previous questions are true, would she be able to cast spells through the exclusive use of mana crystals?]]

2. Corin - [[/spoiler][Is Corin's second attunement an attack oriented one, or at least on that would please his father, or is he to be relegated to Perma Supportive Roles combat wise?]]

Last thing, I loved listening to your audiobook version of this, it's how I found it actually. But when I tried to find a version for my Nook, I couldn't find it. Is it correct to assume that you are limited to Amazon.com Companies?
