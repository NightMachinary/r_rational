Just finished the book. I like it quite a bit. The story moves along at a good pace and it has just the sort of intricate magic system I enjoy.

I have one recommendation for you: try not to overuse the word /winced./ He winced, she winced, it's all over the place and it started to bug me. One time Vera winces twice in two pages. Try to find more varied ways to express that a someone is uncomfortable with what has been said. Otherwise, well-written!
