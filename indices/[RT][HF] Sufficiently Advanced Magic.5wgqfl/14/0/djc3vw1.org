  Just finished the book. I like it quite a bit. The story moves along at a good pace and it has just the sort of intricate magic system I enjoy.

Awesome, glad you enjoyed it!

  I have one recommendation for you: try not to overuse the word winced. He winced, she winced, it's all over the place and it started to bug me. One time Vera winces twice in two pages. Try to find more varied ways to express that a someone is uncomfortable with what has been said. Otherwise, well-written!

Makes sense. I'll try to keep an eye out for that in the next book. I know I overused some other expressions, too ("he scratched his chin"), and I'll try to make sure I cut down on repetition in general next time.

Thanks for the feedback and reading the book!
