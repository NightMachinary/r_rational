Thanks for the feedback.

1) Here's the relevant passage where he checks the sigils:

#+begin_quote
  Lord Teft opened a compartment on the side of the stage, retrieving a large wooden box. After a few moments, he opened the top, reaching inside and raising a small metal disc. “Before we begin, I will need to check everyone's shield sigils. If you're still standing, you can sit down.” He walked to Marissa and Kent, briefly putting a hand on their sigils and closing his eyes. “This shield sigil will be your best friend at the school. Currently, both of yours are fully charged, but I will recharge them between classes. Do not lose it. You will not like what happens if you lose it.” As the combatants took positions on the stage, Teft walked among the rows of the class, checking every single student's sigil to ensure it was on and fully charged. His jaw was set hard as he watched the students. His playful demeanor had temporarily vanished. It made perfect sense. Even though there were presumably healers close by, it was tremendously dangerous to have inexperienced students trying to duel without any sort of protective gear. Our uniforms weren't built like dueling tunics. They would offer minimal protection, if any, from magical attacks. Lord Teft watched carefully as some of us adjusted the locations of our pins to his satisfaction, speaking as he returned to the stage.

2) The intent was that he was aware that overusing mana causes problems, but that he didn't know specifically about how scarring develops in mana systems. I could have been clearer about this, thank you.

3) The idea was that since his father pulled him out of school three years before the start of the story, he's supposed to be missing things that would be considered basic to people who had a more complete education. He would also already be aware of /some/ of the things that the teachers discuss in the class - but the teachers start with very general information because there will be a portion of the students (mostly people like Marissa who come from less affluent backgrounds) that know very little about magic in general.

In my War of Broken Mirrors books, I had everyone come in with basic knowledge of how the magic system work, and that actually made it harder for most of my readers to catch up. There's probably a good middle ground somewhere, but it's tough to get things just right.

4) Good catch, will fix that, thank you.
