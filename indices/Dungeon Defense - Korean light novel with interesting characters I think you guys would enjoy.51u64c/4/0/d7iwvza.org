Possibly. I would have definitely gone for that save feature just so that I could shout "LOAD GAME" after every mistake--even if you have to repeate 9.9 years of flawless play to undo a last mistake, it'd be worth it to have a perfect life. But I wouldn't ever try to rely on being allowed to continue if I fully died. What if the game resets, but this time you're not posessing the demon? What if when you die, you're just dead and it's someone elses turn? Too risky.
