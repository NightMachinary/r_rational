I have finished reading the prologue and first chapter.

This appears to be the story of a man, born from the unholy union of a Harem Protagonist and a Yandere, with a correspondingly traumatic childhood.

He is Transported to Another World shortly after becoming a NEET.

I have not seen this particular mix of tropes before and am mildly interested.

I will continue reading for the time being.
