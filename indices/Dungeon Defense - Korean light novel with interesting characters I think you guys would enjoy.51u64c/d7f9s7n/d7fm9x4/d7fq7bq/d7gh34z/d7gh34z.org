This is exactly it. I'm reading shalvation's translation and it looks pretty accurate so far. However, that accuracy is the reason it doesn't flow well or sound good in English, a common problem for light novels. Rewriting (or localizing) Japanese text is the only way to solve the issue, but fan translators often either prefer a direct, accurate translation or just won't take the tame to do it, which is understandable since they're not getting paid. Still, so far this story is much more readable to me than some of the other LN translations I've seen like Mushoku Tensei.

Another problem is that light novels by nature are, well, light. They don't use enough description to give you a clear picture of what's going on a lot of the time, and you're more likely to get a narrator telling you what happened instead of showing you. It's the nature of the genre, unfortunately.
