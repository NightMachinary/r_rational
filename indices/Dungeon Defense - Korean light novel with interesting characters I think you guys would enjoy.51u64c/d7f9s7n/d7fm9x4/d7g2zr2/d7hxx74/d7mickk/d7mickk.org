I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I couldn't help it!

But, more seriously, I think your work is fairly solid, especially for a fan work done as a hobby rather then a professional effort with an actual staff being sold for money. There were what looked like a few homophone confusions (there/their type of stuff) and a wee bit 'o th' old "Thous and Thees" when transcribing some more esoteric or formal stuff, which isn't the best approach (though I will say that most people who don't attend technical writing classes aren't actually taught why not), but it was, outside those issues, a very solid effort.
