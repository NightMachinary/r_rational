(Not OP)

I think it's probably a matter of expectations. By light novel standards the translation is pretty good. I enjoyed the small amount I've read so far. But not everyone reads light novels, and so they go in with expectations set by the fluid prose of English-native novels. Even professionally-edited LN translations can't do that without essentially rewriting the story, since what works in Japanese/Korean just /doesn't/ when it's ported into English. The languages emphasise different things.

To anyone unfamiliar with the writing style and the quirks of translation, stuff like awkward pronouns ("That person surely did..."), stilted dialogue ("I treated you like an accomplice of equal standing, and yet, did you not look at me as if you were looking at trash?"), lack of environmental or personal descriptions, etc. are all very common features of the format. Anyone used to reading light novel translations wouldn't blink at them; they're not a sign one way or another of how accurate the translation is. But if you haven't read one before, they make the text seem amateurish.
