That's nice how people comment about my grammar, when most of the time, anything that seems like a blatant grammar mistake is actually the author's style of writing. It's done in order to emphasize points or is literally just a line said in one's head that wasn't meant to be grammatically correct in the first place.\\
I translate in order to keep it as the same feel as the author intended. There are lines that require certain parts to remain in the back for an atmospheric effect, which is what makes certain lines seem awkward.\\
If you're going to complain about my grammar, then I'd love to see you guys go read other fan translated LN/WNs and see how that fairs you.
