This doesn't seem like a proper place to be commenting this. Either leave a comment on the chapter it's on directly or message it to me in Discord.\\
And why the hell will you point out a grammar mistake in an ending TL note where I just write without any restraint while not minding my grammar at all?\\
Also, some sudden changes in perspective happens often in the novel, the author did do that. He does it often.\\
Furthermore, the first volume I literally did with absolutely no editors. I wrote that by myself without anyone going through to point out the errors until later on when people would comment them. But of course, people skip over minimal things that don't hinder the story whatsoever.\\
And you're being rather serious about a FANS TRANSLATION. Where it's not official. I may be doing my best, but that doesn't mean I'm perfect and can at all times have perfect grammar in some cases.
