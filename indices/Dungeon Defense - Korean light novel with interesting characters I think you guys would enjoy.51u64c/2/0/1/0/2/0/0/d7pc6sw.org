Using the wrong preposition for a verb isn't a style and doesn't have anything to do with foreshadowing or subtle descriptions. I'm not talking about awkward phrasing (although there's plenty of that too, I acknowledge that it can't be helped).

If you're willing to wait a little, I can go look through it again and give some examples. It's not widespread, but it's still noticeable.
