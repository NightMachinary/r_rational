Just went through the tutorial chapter, here's a list of examples (while I did find quite a few mistakes, there weren't as many preposition mistakes as I remembered, if there's anything I misjudged in this list please tell me):

#+begin_quote
  "Just now, other adventurer parties has invaded the castle.”
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  "There was a lot of complications for me in this chapter. "
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  "here was a thick cavern wall between each routes. "
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  "They trusted the Demon Lord Dantalian when they should have been hostile against him. "
#+end_quote

Preposition

#+begin_quote
  "Only one of the two future existed. "
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  " I had bit down strongly"
#+end_quote

participle

#+begin_quote
  "However, your enemy wasn't only the golem that had suddenly appeared."
#+end_quote

(I concede that this one might be style choice, but the narrator is was speaking of them in third person before, so it doesn't really make sense to suddenly switch to you)

#+begin_quote
  O-Okay. I understand.”
#+end_quote

This one is just missing a quotation mark at the beginning. Just thought I should let you know.

#+begin_quote
  The instincts, that was implanted into me since I was a child, whispered to me.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  The man fell to the floor. I wonder if the blade had sliced his lungs. His last breath just now was wheezy.
#+end_quote

Again one of those things that seem weird because he's suddenly using present tense.

#+begin_quote
  Now everything will be over once I got rid of Riff's group.
#+end_quote

Should probably be get.

#+begin_quote
  I wonder if they had noticed that the atmosphere was grim. Wonder is in present tense again, though at this point that particular one seems more like a style choice, as if he's wondering it while telling the story.

  But, unfortunately, the aim was slightly off so after scratching a bit of my forehead it had flown passed me.
#+end_quote

past, not passed

#+begin_quote
  Where'd the man who kept lowering his head like a small fry disappear to?
#+end_quote

Small fry is uncountable (no singular): [[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/small-fry]]

#+begin_quote
  The words the Demon Lord had said while he was being cynical was right.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  1 second, 2 second had passed before my mind started catching up to what had happened.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  For an animal that was unable to recognize a predator, the only fate that laid in wait for them was death.
#+end_quote

lay vs lie

#+begin_quote
  It was the aftereffect for running my brain on full throttle for 3 hours straight.
#+end_quote

preposition

#+begin_quote
  All saintesses in every shrine worships you.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  Hade's Eye(S)
#+end_quote

Should probably be Hades' or Hades's

#+begin_quote
  I plan to lay around and sleep all day.
#+end_quote

lie vs lay

#+begin_quote
  According to my other friends who had read this book, they all said that the first two chapters weren't even the best chapters.
#+end_quote

Might want to rephrase that a little.

In additon:

Using past perfect when it's not appropriate also occurs a number of other times throughout the novel. It didn't really seem like a style choice to me.

You should expect around the same amount of mistakes for all the other chapters, from what I remember it didn't suddenly stop.
