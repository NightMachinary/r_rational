I'm sorry if I offended you, I wasn't trying to be mean but I guess looking back at my post I kind of was, so sorry for that. I'm very grateful that people like you exist, otherwise it wouldn't be possible for me to enjoy all of the great media that is made in Japan.

Nevertheless, I still can't enjoy your particular translation of Dungeon Defense. Maybe the author writes weird, maybe you just write in a different style than I prefer, ultimately it doesn't matter whose fault it is. I'll go read a different series and enjoy it, and all of the people who like your style will read your stuff and enjoy it too, and that's okay.
