Not quite. All of the explanations are still there, the only thing that has changed is the numbers and the names. (So as to remove copyright elements.) In addition, the writing has been tightened up -- some scenes and one chapter were removed because they didn't work well and weren't important, other scenes were clarified or extended, some minor plot coupons that had been left dangling were paid off, etc.

EDIT: The program with the exclusivity clause is called Kindle Unlimited. Members pay $10 / month to read as much as they want and the author gets paid for each thing that is read. Until July, this program was a no-brainer for authors -- about 90% of my income came from KU. On July 1, Amazon made a change in their payment terms which absolutely gutted that income; things are a little up in the air, but most authors are reporting 70-80% loss of income. Unless things change somehow, I will be yanking 2YE out of KU when its current period runs out in a few months. At that point I'll need to decide what to do, and one option that I'm considering is putting it out for free and also leaving it for sale (just not in KU), so that people can enjoy it for free and, if they enjoy it enough, they can choose to throw a few bucks at it as a thank you. I haven't absolutely decided on this, but it's probably what I'll do.

In short, if you want to read it and don't want to pay, wait a couple months until Amazon unclenches their fingers.
