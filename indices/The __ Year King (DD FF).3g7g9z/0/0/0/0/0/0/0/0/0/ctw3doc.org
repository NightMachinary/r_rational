I own a copy. The issue isn't that things have been removed, it's that it's no longer D&D. Spells have been renamed and changed, the rules have been altered, etc. This has the effect of making a lot of the clever exploits of the D&D ruleset seem like they're just coming from nowhere, since the setup just isn't there. That in turn makes it a lot less rational.

I would recommend the unaltered version for that reason.
