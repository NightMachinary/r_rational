2YE is a trilogy. I originally published it in one long story because it was easier than managing three separate stories under FFN's crappy interface. The linked book is a complete novel and this is all of it. For people who want to pay less to evaluate it, I also released it in four parts, each one being a certain number of chapters.

What would you suggest as a clearer way to say it?
