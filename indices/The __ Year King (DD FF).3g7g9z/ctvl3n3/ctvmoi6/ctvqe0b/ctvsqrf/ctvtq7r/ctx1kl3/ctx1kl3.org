Just so there's no surprises: the linked book is one novel worth.

2YE is 350,000 words, which is about four novels. The first 300,000 are about Jake, the last 50,000 are about Suze. The part about Jake breaks down into three arcs: the fight against the Deorsi, against Afi, and against Neklos. The linked book is the first arc -- it's about 110,000 words, which is a long novel by standard count. Under normal count that would be about 360 pages, but Amazon uses a high word count so they mark it as 300-ish.
