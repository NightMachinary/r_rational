For an exploit to be satisfying, it needs to have setup. Take these two short stories:

#+begin_quote
  A wizard gets lost in the woods. All he has on him is his thaumometer, his wand, and a half loaf of lennan bread. He thinks he's going to have trouble finding his way home, until he realizes that lennan bread has a small quantity of lia particles. He takes apart his thaumometer to find the mana crystal inside, uses his wand to energize the crystal, then places the crystal on top of the lennan bread. The energized crystal interacts with the lia particles, illuminating the way to the nearest leyline. Knowing where the leyline is allows the wizard to get his bearings and travel home.

  A man gets lost in the woods. All he has on him is his receiver radio, a bottle of wine, and a small sewing kit he forgot to take out of his pocket. He thinks he's in trouble, until he realizes that the radio has a speaker in it, and all electronic speakers have a magnet. He smashes the radio open, rubs a needle from the sewing kit over the radio's magnet in order to magnetize it, then pushes the needle through the cork of the wine bottle. When he floats the cork on a small puddle of water, the needle is pulled in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, showing the man where true north is. This allows him to get his bearings and travel home.

This is pretty much the exact same story. I would argue that one is rational and works from a narrative standpoint, while the other does not. The second story gets its background from the real world; the setup that we need is contained within our reality. It doesn't matter whether someone knows anything about speakers, magnets, or compasses when they read it, because they can go look those things up for themselves. If they're not already steeped in scientific lore, they can at least be assured that they're not being fed bullshit.

Whereas in the equivalent wizard story, there's no such grounding. Even if I give you more details of how mana crystals are energized, or how they interact with lia particles, it doesn't matter, because I'm using that in the course of explaining the resolution. To make this work in a story, I would have to innocuously drop details beforehand; the setup would have to be embedded in the story, and all those details would come together at the right moment in order for the payoff (getting out of the woods) to actually satisfy anyone.

So my problem with the switch from 2YE-Original to 2YE-Refactored is that the grounding gets removed. If you see an exploit in 2YE-O, you can think, "Oh, cool, does that work?" and then you can go look it up if you want to; even if you don't look it up, you can have the confidence that yes, the author did his research and he's not feeding a line of bullshit, because he would have been called out on it. But in 2YE-R, there's no grounding. And because the rewrite didn't go add in a whole bunch of innocuous foreshadowing, things seem like they're coming from nowhere. The breaks /are/ explained, but many of them are explained at the same time that the rules that allow those breaks are explained. The setup and payoff get merged together, which makes the payoff unsatisfying. And since it's an author-invented system, there's no way to check your work. There's no feeling of "oh, cool exploit" because for all I know you could be manufacturing the rules to suit your needs (especially since the universe of 2YE is relatively unexploited, so new exploits aren't contradicted by the "why didn't anyone think of that" factor).

So the first thing I come across is the Wall of Iron / Teleport / homonculous trick. All those three things are introduced and explained /immediately/ prior to their use. The setup is too close to the payoff, unless you have the /background/ setup of being in the D&D world. Which is why I prefer the original over the refactor, even with the other improvements.

Hopefully that makes sense?
