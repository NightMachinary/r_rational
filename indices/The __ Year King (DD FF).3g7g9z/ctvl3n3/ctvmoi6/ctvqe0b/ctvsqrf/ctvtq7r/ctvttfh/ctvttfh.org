  For that you're getting about 3 paperbacks of quite good content that'll last you around 12 hours.

I can get that much "quite good content" for basically free. The average price I pay for sight-unseen fan-originated work is maybe a dollar, between web fiction, free at Amazon, and cheap at Amazon. $9.00 is quite a lot for an unknown author when I don't know if I'll finish even one book.

Why is /this one/ worth $9.00?
