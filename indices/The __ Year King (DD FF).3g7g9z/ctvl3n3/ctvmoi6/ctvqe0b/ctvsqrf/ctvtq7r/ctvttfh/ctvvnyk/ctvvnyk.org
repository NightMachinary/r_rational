I personally am not a fan of this particular author. I stopped reading the Two Year Emperor stuff partway through /when it was free/, and so I am unlikely to ever pay money for it myself.

That said, enough people seem to be that it is not impossible you would enjoy the author's work as well. There's a bunch of stuff that you /can/ still view by checking out [[https://www.reddit.com/user/eaglejarl/submitted/][submission history]] for Eaglejarl to get sense of his style (e.g. the Team Anko story, Squiring the Phoenix). I didn't like any of his other works, either, so I am perhaps not the best guide as to what you should read by him.

From my perspective (as someone who didn't like his work), the weaknesses of the Two Year Emperor story that made me sad:

- The characterization was weak and uninteresting. I am pretty sure that the main character was named Jake? He was a guy. That was the extent of my memory of his character. There was also some sort of fire elemental hanging around. Other than that... I remember no other characters' names. Or roles. There was a big invading enemy army, and I am sure that it had a name or something in the story... but I can't recall it. The kingdom (empire, probably) he got put in charge of almost certainly had a name as well, but I likewise don't recall it. It was pretty much generic medieval fantasy kingdom #245252-51b. If I don't care about a story's characters, then I am unlikely to care about or remember the story.

- Munchkining RPGs by abusing the exact rules is sort of stupid / boring / uninteresting. I have a really good knowledge of D&D's breaking points already, and discussing some of them in a story wasn't super enthralling. If you know and care about D&D3 already, you likely won't learn anything new or cool, if you don't, you will lack context for a bunch of the story. Also, it raises questions, like "How is it that the main character is the first one to actually do these simple abuses? Why doesn't the world already look totally different than it does?"

9.00 is the price you might pay for a /new/ paperback - at a used book store you're looking at like 3-6 books, or quite possibly more, and at a yard sale you are looking at like an entire box of books or more. I personally only buy new books when they're by authors who I have previously greatly enjoyed and who I am going to greatly enjoy the new book of - I basically never throw $9.00 out on a book that I don't know I'll actually read and enjoy.
