  That in turn makes it a lot less rational.

Huh. This surprises me, but maybe I'm misunderstanding your intent. It seems to be saying that 2YE was rational /because/ you, the reader, knew the D&D rule set going in and were therefore able to appreciate the rule breaks without needing them explained. If so, the first corollary is that for someone who is /not/ a D&D expert, the breaks come out of nowhere and therefore the story is not rational. The second corollary is that they were not explained, which I felt they were. Is that actually what you mean and, if so, do you think the explanations were absent or merely lacking?
