Neat.

Just a reminder to be the change that you want to see in the subreddit; the internet runs on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29][1% rule]], and you can heavily influence the direction of this sub by being part of that 1% of content creators or 10% of commentators. The average submission to this sub gets around 15 upvotes; that's not uncommon for a sub this size, but it means that a single person can have a huge impact.
