I actually made Aliyah upon finishing highschool, almost two years before I started my service. Regardless, I absolutely should have waited until I would get all the benefits personally, as opposed to contributing as a minor to the family benefits.

I was unaware they existed. The only meetups I've been going to in Tel Aviv are Smash Bros. meetups.
