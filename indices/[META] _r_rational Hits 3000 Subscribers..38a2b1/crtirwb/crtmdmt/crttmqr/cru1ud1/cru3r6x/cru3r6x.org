I was thinking more along the lines of Target/Walmart. Convenience stores here are about as convenient as a root canal before your solo on Broadway. Not to mention the incredible lack of quality for the prices.

In a similar vein, if I want to buy a book, I have to go to the צומת ספרים at the mall and pay 45₪. I miss Amazon Prime.

Also, I'm not בנימין, sorry. But hi anyway. טוב לפגוש אותך.
