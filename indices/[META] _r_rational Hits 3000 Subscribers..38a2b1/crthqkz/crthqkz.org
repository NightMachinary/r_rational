Woot!

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryed3/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/][This]] was one of the subreddit's first ever submissions, posted by [[/u/seraphnb]] on December 3rd, 2013. I don't actually have the statistics on when we hit 1000 subscribers, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2rcbbz/meta_rrational_hits_2000_subscribers/][we hit 2000 on January 4th of this year]], which the reddit dating algorithm is still calling "4 months ago" (per OP) but is really much closer to 5.

So, we went from 0 to 2000 in thirteen months, and we've gone from 2000 to 3000 in five months. I'm guessing this increase was definitely attributable to the Grand Finale of /Methods of Rationality/, considering that's the subreddit that spawned this one, so of course there would be a trickle-down effect.

The next 1000 will undoubtedly come much more slowly, but, if we manage to keep up the steady rate of submissions and quality discussion we've enjoyed over the last year and a half, I'm sure it will be all in good time. Not that it matters or anything ...

Here's to another happy 18 months!
