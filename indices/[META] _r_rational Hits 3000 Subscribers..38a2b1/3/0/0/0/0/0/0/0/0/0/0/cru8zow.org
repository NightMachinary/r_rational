I'd /like/ to go into linguistics, but then my only options regarding jobs will be 1) Teaching, 2) Research, 3) Computational Linguistics. I'm extremely interested in neurolinguistics, but that's probably better approached from the neurology side. If I could have my dream job, I'd write fiction for a living, and maybe teach creative writing in a college setting - but going for a degree in Creative Writing, while technically possible, is not really the best use of my time or money.
