Hm, it I guess it's true that there's some fanfic recommendations floating around that I wouldn't classify as rational. Then again, tastes differ. For example, I don't think Time Braid should be considered as such, but I know many others here do, so meh.

For me it's not a problem unless a couple of stories are updated with such frequency that they drown out other, more high-quality stories. Right now each post stays on the front page for about a week though, so I don't think that's the case.

The one time I did hear someone complaining about fics recommended on this subreddit, it was about that one Deathnote fic. Not that it was badly written or anything, but just that the rational concept still hadn't been moved along after ~7 chapters. That sort of thing probably does turn people off from following recommendations here.
