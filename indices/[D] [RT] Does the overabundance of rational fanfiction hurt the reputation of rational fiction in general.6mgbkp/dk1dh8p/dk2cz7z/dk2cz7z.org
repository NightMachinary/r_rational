Thanks for the shout out!

While I do draw some of my inspiration from rational fiction personally, I think there have been some other lines of genre development that are producing similar results. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_fantasy][*Hard fantasy*]] as a genre predates the more recent concept of rational fiction, and shares many of the same characteristics.

Sanderson isn't stealing/reusing rational fiction ideas - his works predate them. (Elantris was published in 2005, and the Mistborn trilogy from 2006 to 2008. HPMOR started in 2010.) And Sanderson wasn't the first to write in this style - his "Laws of Magic" just popularized the idea.

I actually see this as a good thing - Sanderson's works predating/paralleling the development of rational fic just helps put more content out there that's going to be inspired by similar ideals.

I've drawn some influences from both Sandersonish traditional fiction and rational fic; I'd say that Forging Divinity was primarily Sanderson-inspired, whereas Sufficiently Advanced Magic was highly influenced by things like HPMOR and Mother of Learning.

All my books also draw from my background as a Systems Designer. My books are set in a universe I've been using for tabletops and LARPs for the last two decades. The cosmology iand some of the magic systems are drawn from those games, although the more recent one in Sufficiently Advanced Magic is more JRPG inspired. I'm also a professional game designer, and gaming is a big part of what has influenced the clear forms of progression and challenges in my writing.

You can see other people with gaming inspiration that write similar works - Maoyuu, Rokka no Yuusha, and Log Horizon, for example, all have similar elements to rational fiction, but they seem to draw primarily from gaming as their inspiration for this kind of rational/internally consistent style.

I'm digressing a bit here, but my core point is actually that I think there have been parallel developments that have led to similar styles of fiction.

Sanderson embracing the idea of hard magic systems and internal consistency has done a lot for popularizing these concepts in the fantasy community - which is a good thing for rational fiction, because rational fiction is extremely similar to what Sanderson is writing and popularizing.
