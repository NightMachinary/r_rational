I agree that a confluence of genres have been coming together towards the same sort of alignment. I mentioned Sanderson because [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31176804-snapshot][his most recent works]] feels very much ripped from the pages of Mother of Learning or similar time-loopy stories. That's why I referenced Sanderson - not because I think his older works are the slightest bit rational, but because his latest works feel like a departure from his style, maybe into rationalism.

There's also a rising bubble of /consistent/ literature, namely the genres you mentioned: JRPG, LitRPG, Hard Fantasy, etc, where the universes are designed to have internally consistent rules. Sanderson is famous for this and his laws of magic. In these genres, authors agree to give up rule-breaking in exchange for credibility; the magical universe JK Rowling designed is silly and falls apart under scrutiny, the story only survives on the strength of the cast, the magical universe of Sanderson's cosmere is interesting, even devoid of a cast. However consistent literature isn't rationalist literature, but it often can feel like rational-lite.
