There might be some confusion here over 'regarded' --- are we talking culture zeitgeist (in which case I'm somewhat* with [[/u/vallar57]]) or that those drawn to the genre now have a lot more/wider range of /good/ material to enjoy and can get to it quicker because the genre is established?

*Man Booker leans literary/historical, the Pulitzer is for works 'preferably dealing with American life' and therefore wouldn't include much fantasy, and I'm sure I'm not an outlier for not checking the Nobel list for pleasure fiction reading. On the other hand, loads of great fantasy has been exposed through the Newberry, Hugo, Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy Award, etc., which are varying degrees of mainstream but admittedly not as well known as the three mentioned.
