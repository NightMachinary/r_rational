I think that the high volume of rationalist fanfiction is a natural growth of a new genre. There are a lot of existing fantasy/scifi works that are viable targets for fanfics, and so these are the low-hanging fruit. That someone is doing the labour and picking these low-hanging fruits is a good sign, it means there's pent-up demand for the material.

I think the next stage of the growth of the genre will happen when the fanfic readers/authors age a bit, and start writing /for real/ (TM). There are early signs this is already happening - I like to think [[/u/salaris]] (Andrew Rowe), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][ShaperV]] (E William Brown), [[/u/FekketCantenel]] (Fiona van Dahl), [[/u/Raelifin]] (Max Harms) are the leading edge of rationalist authors. Other authors ([[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12130438.Dennis_E_Taylor][Dennis Taylor]], Brandon Sanderson?) are +stealing+ reusing the best ideas from rationalism and incorporating it in their works. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll see the genre grow, change, and be incorporated in more works.
