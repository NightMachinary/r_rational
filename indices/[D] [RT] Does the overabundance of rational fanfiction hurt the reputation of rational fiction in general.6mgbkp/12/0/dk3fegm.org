Well, from what I can tell the author of MoL [[http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Word_of_Domagoj][only cites D&D as one in a list of influences, albeit a major one]]. So I don't think that falls under the category of fanfiction - it's an original story with original characters, in an original setting, that happens to use some spells/items/etc from D&D (or more realistically, from the broader fantasy genre in general; D&D isn't the first or only world to have a Fireball spell, for instance).

This can be contrasted with Two Year Emperor, which revolves around a rational character in an explicitly D&D world, completely beholden to the literal D&D rules.

And I'd be interested in hearing your arguments why Worm doesn't qualify as RF. While it wasn't explicitly written as such, it very clearly hits all the RF criteria.
