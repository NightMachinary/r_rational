  That just shows that Fireball first appeared in a D&D predecessor rather than in D&D, which doesn't count unless you're being overly literal.
#+end_quote

Why does that not count? It wasn't from D&D, it was from an earlier and completely separate war game - a game that was itself based in the LotR setting. You posited that MoL is a D&D fanfic, but if that's based on connections like the Fireball spell, I think the fact that the spell existed before D&D, and is commonplace in non-D&D media, is fairly strong evidence to the contrary.

  If Cauldron did the opposite of most of the things they did in the story, or if they acted/didn't act when they didn't act/acted in canon, it could still be "explained" as "necessary" to create lots of parahumans and defeat Scion.

I'm looking at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] 's generally agreed upon four criteria of rational fiction here. Cauldron's actions had plausible reasons behind them, they were driven into conflict by their beliefs, and they attempted to solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. This isn't just a matter of the story saying “Cauldron's actions were necessary”, and the reader taking this as fact. From an outside reader perspective, their actions make plausible, logical sense, even if they're not the exact actions you yourself would make.

  You're confusing Doylist and Watsonian perspectives here.
#+end_quote

I'm not. I agreed that the Simurgh /as presented/ is not logical. However, (a) the story is not complete (Worm2 is slated to start around the end of this year), and as the characters actions haven't yet been shown as /irrational/, there may yet be motives revealed which clarify things on the reader's end, and show that her previous actions had plausible reasoning and logic behind them; and (b) the character is very minor, and contrasts with 99% of the other characters, whose actions /do/ have plausible reasons behind them.

  That alone includes things like Alexandria getting herself killed, outing Skitter without asking Contessa "path to telling me whether this works or not", etc.
#+end_quote

You seem to be confusing “rational characters” with “characters acting like 100% logic-driven robots.” Characters acting emotionally (such as Alexandria deciding to out Skitter in the heat of the moment) means they're written as human. It doesn't mean the story's not rational. HPMOR had plenty of side characters responding in emotional or irrational ways, and Harry himself didn't always make the best decisions - the point is, those actions had clear, plausible reasons behind them, and were consistent with the character's personality/beliefs/etc. Not every character needs to always make 100% optimized logical decisions, in order for a story to be rational.
