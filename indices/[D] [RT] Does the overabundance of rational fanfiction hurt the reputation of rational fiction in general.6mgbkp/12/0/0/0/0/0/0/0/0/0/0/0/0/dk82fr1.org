  Most elements of MoL are not present in or related to D&D.
#+end_quote

That's true in a trivial sense. The character wears shoes, shoes are not original to D&D. However, a lot of the fantasy elements are from D&D. (Whether it's "most" depends on how you count, of course.)

  It's also a question of degrees. Do 100% of the characters in Worm solve problems in the 100% most optimal way, 100% of the time? No, but then neither do characters in HPMoR or Metropolitan Man.
#+end_quote

Any fandom has fans who say "the characters in this fandom are solving problems in intelligent, although suboptimal, ways", and can give a plausible-sounding argument for that. Allowing very suboptimal solutions makes the criterion very subjective.

Also, the Patronus was established as depending on thoughts, so using happy thoughts still counts as rational. It's not as if he was told to make it work by reading a formula and he made it work using happy thoughts instead.

  force powers and spells vary wildly (in both ability and power) across the series' spans
#+end_quote

I could say the same thing about Worm powers. (You could argue any specific example, but a Star Wars or Harry Potter fan could argue any specific example from those fandoms too.)

  But considering the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community widely considers Worm as ratfic,
#+end_quote

I suspect that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] considers Worm to be ratfic mostly because 1) Taylor munchkins her power (a rational element, but not the whole of Worm), and 2) Worm appeals to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers in other ways, and because of the halo effect they then see it as rational.
