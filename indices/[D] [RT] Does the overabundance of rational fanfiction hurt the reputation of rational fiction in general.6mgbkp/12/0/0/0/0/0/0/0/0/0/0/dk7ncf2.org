  Ok, but you've failed to provide any arguments to the effect that just because MoL contains spells that also exist within D&D, that makes it a D&D fanfic. By that logic, should we consider any story that uses Tolkienesque elves/dwarves/orcs, to be LotR fanfic
#+end_quote

Mother of Learning uses lots of things that are de-facto specific to D&D. At some point, using lots of Tolkinesque things would make something a LOTR fanfic, although there may be less kind terms used than "fanfic". Also, LOTR is a story and D&D is not, so one would normally expect a LOTR fanfic to include story elements from LOTR, while this is not required for a D&D fanfic.

  , I think we're in agreement that Worm hits criteria 1 (characters do things for plausible reasons), 2 (factions are driven into conflict based on their beliefs and values), and 4 (the world has consistent rules).
#+end_quote

But if you also allow suboptimal use of resources, that's an extraordinarily weak definition. Even Star Wars and Harry Potter satisfy it. (Spells and Force abilities are arbitrary, but once they have been shown to exist they work consistently, at least as much as Worm superpowers. And yeah, you could break the system with a Time Turner, but people are just making suboptimal decisions.)

  There's nothing to suggest that she would know where to, or be able to, find a blowtorch in the short amount of time she had.
#+end_quote

She can travel halfway around the world in six minutes. She had time to find a blowtorch or a gas station.

  There were already live bugs making webs in Alexandria's lungs; traveling out of Skitter's range wouldn't make a difference.
#+end_quote

It would mean she could flush them out. It would also mean they could not make webs at more than normal bug speed.
