  D&D is a rules system

And unlike 2YE, MoL doesn't use D&D rules. Thus, as it lacks what you consider D&D's defining feature, MoL simply can't be a D&D fanfic.

  I'm pretty sure you can find Star Wars fans who can go on in detail about how 90% of those really are very plausible.
#+end_quote

Based purely on information from the original work? Not likely. And "I'm /pretty sure/ you can find fans to explain how /some/ of those are plausible" is not exactly a compelling counterargument in general.

  Despite terms such as "dark lord", Vader and Voldemort have motivations for doing things other than "I'm evil and I like to do evil".
#+end_quote

Not the characters I'm thinking of. As presented in the films, the Emperor has no real motivations other than to grow the power of Evil (aka the dark side). And even if you accept Voldemort as nuanced, plenty of his Death Eaters, like Bellatrix, are clearly just straightforwardly Evil.
