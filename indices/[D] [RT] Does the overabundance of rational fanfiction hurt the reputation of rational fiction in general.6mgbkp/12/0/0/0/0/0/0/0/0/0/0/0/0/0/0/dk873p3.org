  I count major/foundational story elements - of which there are almost none.

D&D is a rules system. It doesn't have story elements (although some D&D-based settings do), so a D&D based fic inherently uses non-D&D story elements. That doesn't disqualify it from being a D&D fic.

  In SW, Jedi fight in classic knight style with minimal force power usage in the orig trig, yet in the prequels

Worm doesn't have prequels, so it doesn't have this problem.

If a fandom contains many separate works written years apart, some by different people, there will be more inconsistencies. A reasonable definition of a rational work should consider this when determining what level of inconsistency disqualifies a work from being rational.

I'm pretty sure you can find Star Wars fans who can go on in detail about how 90% of those really are very plausible. And the remaining ones just disqualify it from being 100% rational, which nothing is anyway.

Despite terms such as "dark lord", Vader and Voldemort have motivations for doing things other than "I'm evil and I like to do evil".
