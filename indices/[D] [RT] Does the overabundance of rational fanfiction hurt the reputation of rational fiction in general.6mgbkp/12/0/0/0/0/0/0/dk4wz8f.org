  Why does that not count? It wasn't from D&D, it was from an earlier and completely separate war game - a game that was itself based in the LotR setting.

It doesn't count because that old game is only noteworthy because it led to D&D, and its ideas only got adopted by a significant number of people through being used in and copied from D&D. Nobody writing a fantasy novel was directly inspired to put Fireball in it by a 1970 wargame ruleset.

  they attempted to solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

I disagree that they intelligently applied their knowledge and resources. Many of their applications seem, on their face, stupid, and we only know they are intelligent because we are told that (or because we are told that the Path says that).

  Characters acting emotionally... means they're written as human
#+end_quote

Outing Skitter was planned in advance; it wasn't an emotional reaction. Alexandria threatening Skitter's friends was meant to get Skitter to react emotionally, but it was (mis)calculated planning /on the part of Alexandria/. And Alexandria actually dying from Skitter's attack doesn't make sense even as an emotional reaction.
