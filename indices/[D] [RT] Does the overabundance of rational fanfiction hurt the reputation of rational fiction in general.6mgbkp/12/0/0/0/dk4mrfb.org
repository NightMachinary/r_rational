  If D&D wasn't the first, what is?

Apparently the fireball spell [[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271708/A_brief_history_of_the_fireball_in_fantasy_games.php][predates even D&D]]. But my broader point is, presently the fireball spell has expanded well beyond D&D, and is used in all sorts of other media (books, movies, games, etc). Same with many of the other spells in MoL. So while I agree that D&D is an influence on the work, it's certainly not D&D fanfiction.

  Cauldron, the Simurgh, and the conflict drive are, from a Doylist view, completely arbitrary

...

Are they? Cauldron's drive seems completely logical to me.

Their founders discovered early on that Scion was actually an extra-terrestrial being with the power to easily demolish all of humanity on a whim. So their motive is the destruction of this entity, and the protection of the human race - very similar to the clearly RF premise of Metropolitan Man. They attempt to accomplish this by artificially creating more powerful parahumans, to either find a specific power that can destroy Scion, or create a fighting force strong enough to take him on. That isn't a fan rationalization, that's all explained in-story.

The Simurgh admittedly may or may not be rational - we just know very little about her motives and end goals, because we know very little about her in general. But just because something is /unexplained/, doesn't /necessarily/ make it irrational. Her actions have been mysterious, but not inconsistent (something along the lines of Dumbledore in HPMOR, at least until we find out more near the end of the story). I'm holding out judgement until Worm2 on this one, but even if we regard her as irrational, she's an extremely minor part of a very rational story.

I'm not sure we'll be able to change each other's minds here, but I do think that if you discount even Worm as not rational enough for the RF genre, then you're restricting RF to an /incredibly small/ selection of works.

I do generally agree with your last statement though - the rationality of the story should be decided solely on what's presented in said story, not on the invented explanations of the readers.
