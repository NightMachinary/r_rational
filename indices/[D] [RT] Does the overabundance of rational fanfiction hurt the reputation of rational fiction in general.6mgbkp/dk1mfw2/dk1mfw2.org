Well, I think for some budding rationalist authors early in their writing attempts, a pre-established world to play in to work on the rationalist aspect of writing is a great starting place. A perfect example is Alexander Wales who wrote Metropolitan Man and Branches on the Tree of Time as rational fanfiction, but has moved into world-building fiction like Glimwarden, Shadows of the Limelight, and a few good original world short stories.

One of the major flaws in your theory is simply that you are primarily looking at free online works of fiction which obviously is going to bring in a fair number of budding authors with little editing. If you do the same with almost any other genre, the free online material is going to have a notable quality drop and probably have more examples of fanfiction. That's not a disservice to any particular genre it is just the nature of online writing.
