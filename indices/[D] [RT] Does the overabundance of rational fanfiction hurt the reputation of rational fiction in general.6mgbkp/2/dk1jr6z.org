Regarding your second bullet point, I think we have a phrase for this- /If you make Frodo a Jedi, you must give Sauron the Death Star/. Powering up the protagonist is one thing, powering up everything else to match is another.

A second problem is the /sustainability/ of conflict. Two people with clubs, and two people with guns, are equally balanced conflicts, but the latter will still be over much faster. The best example, I think, is /Rules of Wishing/. Alladin, Jasmine and Jafar are all savvy enough to roughly match each other, but since the powers quickly escalate to WMD levels, it's all over in a couple of "moves" anyway.
