TL;DR: I think the more the merrier, and we have to live with consequences if we want to read more good works.

Think of it as a lure. When genre becomes popular, more people who like to write and create just wonder about, and then may try their luck and ultimately, whether their fruits of labour of (writing) love are good or not, they will learn, and possibly spread the word further.

Problems is, when genre has famous independent works that you can count on fingers of one hand, it shows its infancy. When the volume of written stories is high, probability of writers with good potential popping out is higher - and *we want that*.

You seem to criticize /bad/ fanfiction stories. But it doesn't have to have anything to do with worldbuilding or lack of it. You can take a EU and play with it - and your protagnist may as well bulldoze trought obstacle, or hit a wall devised by great antagonist, that will end up in high quality confrontation. Setting place for such events also takes certain skill, if you want your alterations to the universe to stay within predefined limits, especially if the changes are subtle. It's just different type of skill than playing a god and starting from scratch.

But is it something bad, that authors skip the 'design from zero' phase? I think not - this is not a defining characteristic of a good story - even badly written one, with lot of mistakes from lack of experience can be entertaining, no need to thwart further efforts. Quite the contrary, I think - because writers need to practice on something. *Constructive criticism needs source material*.

If anything, more threads akin to worldbuilding should appear here, like 'applied rational villainy 101: guide to creating conflicts and escalation', or 'how not to OP'.

But statistic is a bitch: It is unavoidable, that at some point there will be flood of low-effort stories, and *you can't do anything about it*, because where there is no will (hence low-effort, no low-quality, that's the effect, not the cause), there will be no learning.

In the end we will point out and promote good works - so writers coming across new challenge will instantly see the better material - and I think this is exactly what this subreddit is about.
