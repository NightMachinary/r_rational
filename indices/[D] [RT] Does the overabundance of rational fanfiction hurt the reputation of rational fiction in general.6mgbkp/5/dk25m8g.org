I think part of the reason that there are so many rational fanfictions as opposed to original ratfic is that it's easier in many ways to make a rational fanfiction than it is to make an original fiction. It takes much less work overall and I think we can all agree that writing rational fiction at /all/ takes more work than the average story.

It's easier for me to look at Naruto and say "well, of course chakra gundams make no goddamn sense based on the rules established!" than to create an entirely new world with a consistent set of rules and lore that manages to still be entertaining. Fanfiction makes writing overall easier (not that writing good fanfiction is easy but, outside of hardcore AU's, the canon provides a framework for you to "lean" your work against.)
