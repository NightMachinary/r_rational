That's fair. For the genre of RF, it seems like most if not all /explicitly rational/ works are in the “free online” category - but this is likely tied in with [[/u/Afforess]] 's point that rational fiction is a very new genre, and currently we're witnessing the growing pains of its development.

As a separate, but related point: in my mind, Metropolitan Man stands somewhere close to the border between rational fanfiction and original rational fiction. Wales didn't take an existing /story/ and add in rational characters/elements; he took a few well-known characters, added more rational thought processes and motivations to said characters, and then wrote an entirely original story around them.

Maybe that's simply the difference between /good/ and /bad/ fanfiction (which seems supported by Yudkowsky's Rules of Fanfiction), but when so much fanfiction falls into the latter group, perhaps more categorical distinctions (or, as [[/u/FekketCantenel]] suggests, some specific RF awards) are needed.
