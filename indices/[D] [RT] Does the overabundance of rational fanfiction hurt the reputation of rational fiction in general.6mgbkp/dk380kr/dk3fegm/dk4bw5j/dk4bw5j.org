  D&D isn't the first or only world to have a Fireball spell
#+end_quote

If D&D wasn't the first, what is? I was under the exact opposite impression: The fireball spell did not exist in fantasy literature until introduced by D&D. There were spells that created balls of fire, but the kind of spell which resembles a grenade and covers a big area whether you want it to or not basically never existed.

  And I'd be interested in hearing your arguments why Worm doesn't qualify as RF.

Worm has some rational moments, like when Skitter tries to use her powers efficiently, but much of Worm is only rational in the trivial sense that any character who says "I'm doing this for a plan" is rational. Cauldron, the Simurgh, and the conflict drive are, from a Doylist view, completely arbitrary, even though Cauldron claims to have a plan and people acting because of a conflict drive are technically acting for a reason.

This is made worse by the propensity of both the author and fans to explain away random inconsistencies and random arbitrary character actions in Worm by invoking one of those.

Fan explanations in general are also a problem, even when they don't cover one of those. It's easy to invent a reason why some character does something, which is consistent with the story, but is not stated in the story. That doesn't make the story rational.
