  Fireball
#+end_quote

The point here is that Fireball is not a clear indicator of MoL as a D&D fanfic. I don't think you've provided any evidence to show that MoL /is/ a fanfic, so let's just move on from this, unless you want to get back that point.

  Many of their applications seem, on their face, stupid, and we only know they are intelligent because we are told that
#+end_quote

Specific examples? Without knowing exactly what you're referring to, it seems we just generally disagree on this based on subjective perceptions, in which case there's not much more to say. Note that they made their decisions based on the information they as characters had available, not on the information you as a reader have available.

  Alexandria threatening Skitter's friends was meant to get Skitter to react emotionally, but it was (mis)calculated planning on the part of Alexandria.
#+end_quote

Again, just because a plan is miscalculated, doesn't mean it's not within the realms of RF. Characters are allowed to make mistakes or decisions that are not completely optimized. HPMOR's Harry makes multiple mistakes or miscalculated decisions (I only keep using HPMOR as an example because its a work widely agreed upon by the community to be RF). The important distinguishing factor is that the decisions had plausible reasons behind them and were consistent with the character's thought processes.

They can also apply their knowledge/resources intelligently without necessarily applying them in a 100% optimized fashion. Just because Alexandria didn't take every possible precaution when constructing her Skitter-threatening plan, doesn't mean she was holding the idiotball.

  And Alexandria actually dying from Skitter's attack doesn't make sense
#+end_quote

Why not? Alexandria being vulnerable to choking to death is consistent with the rules of the Worm-verse. What specifically about her dying breaks one of the RF criteria?
