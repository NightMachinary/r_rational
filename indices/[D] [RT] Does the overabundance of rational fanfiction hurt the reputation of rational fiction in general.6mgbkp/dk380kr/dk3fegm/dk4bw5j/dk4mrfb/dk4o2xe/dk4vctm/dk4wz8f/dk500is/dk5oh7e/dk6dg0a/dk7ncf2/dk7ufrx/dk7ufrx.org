  Also, LOTR is a story and D&D is not, so one would normally expect a LOTR fanfic to include story elements from LOTR, while this is not required for a D&D fanfic

2YE is a clear D&D fanfic. It specifically takes place in a D&D world - it uses and relies on not just the spells and items, but also the underlying rules and systems of D&D.

MoL does not have an underlying D&D system. Most elements of MoL are /not/ present in or related to D&D. And most of the MoL spells that are in D&D, are not /specific/ to D&D.

  But if you also allow suboptimal use of resources, that's an extraordinarily weak definition.

If you require a work to have /the most optimal/ use of resources /by all characters, major or minor/ in order to be consider rational fiction, then I can't think of any story that actually fits in the genre.

  Even Star Wars and Harry Potter satisfy it.

No, they don't. Both works are rife with character choices based on implausible or nonexistent reasons (for example, about 100% of the character choices in SW ep1). Both works have some characters driven primarily by the fact that they're “good” or “evil”. And the world rules are not at all consistent - force powers and spells vary wildly (in both ability and power) across the series' spans. Note that this doesn't make them /bad/ stories, it just excludes them as ratfiction.

But most relevant to this conversation, characters in HP and SW don't often solve problems through intelligent application of resources; they mostly solve problems by stumbling into the right place at the right time, or by believing in themselves or thinking happy thoughts (ex: Harry's patronus in book 3).

It's also a question of degrees. Do 100% of the characters in Worm solve problems in the 100% most optimal way, 100% of the time? No, but then neither do characters in HPMoR or Metropolitan Man. Do /most/ of the characters in Worm solve problems in intelligent ways, /most/ of the time? Definitely.

I don't know that there's much more to discuss here - you clearly are holding firm on your opinions, I don't think any arguments I could provide will change your mind. But considering the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community widely considers Worm as ratfic, I feel justified referring to it as such in my original post.
