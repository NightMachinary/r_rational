  The point here is that Fireball is not a clear indicator of MoL as a D&D fanfic.
#+end_quote

Fireball was an example, and I replied to it as an example. Mother of Learning contains /lots/ of things from D&D, not just fireballs.

  Specific examples?

Letting Shatterbird and Siberian go? The reasoning given was that it would drive people to the Protectorate, which seems very weak.

According to word of god, Alexandria was trying to force Skitter into Cauldron. Apparently, people in Cauldron get to force others into Cauldron as side projects without consulting other Cauldron members or asking Contessa (since nobody continued the plan after Alexandria died, and Alexandria never asked Contessa if the plan would succeed). That's far beyond "not completely optimized".

Furthermore, the whole thing is Bond villain levels of evil on Alexandria's part.

  Alexandria being vulnerable to choking to death is consistent with the rules of the Worm-verse.

The fact that Alexandria didn't go find a blowtorch and inhale (or just some gas fumes and an open fire) is not consistent with much of anything. Alexandria could also have easily travelled out of Skitter's range (bugs work autonomously after Skitter is knocked out != bugs work autonomously anywhere in the world).

Also, Alexandria's mental processes are offloaded to her shard, which prevents mental influences from affecting her, and should also allow her to remain clearheaded right until she actually goes unconscious.
