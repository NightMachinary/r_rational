  Fireball was an example, and I replied to it as an example.

Ok, but you've failed to provide any arguments to the effect that just because MoL contains spells that also exist within D&D, that makes it a D&D fanfic. By that logic, should we consider any story that uses Tolkienesque elves/dwarves/orcs, to be LotR fanfic?

  The reasoning given was that it would drive people to the Protectorate, which seems very weak.

Why does that “seem very weak”? The more the public perceives they are in danger, the more likely they are to run into the protective arms of the government (or other powerful “protective” forces) - that's some classic /1984/ logic. And what better way to create the perception of danger, than to release a few criminals that are dangerous, but nowhere near on the scale of some of the bigger threats?

It would be like the US government secretly releasing some dangerous criminals from a specific foreign nation into the streets of the US, in order to increase public support for a war with that nation. Is it the best approach? Maybe, maybe not. Is the reasoning at least /plausible/, is it consistent with the organization's beliefs/values, and is it an intelligent application of resources (even if it's not, in your mind, the /most/ intelligent application)? Yes.

I think that last point is really where our entire disagreement boils down to. Based on what you've posited, I think we're in agreement that Worm hits criteria 1 (characters do things for /plausible/ reasons), 2 (factions are driven into conflict based on their beliefs and values), and 4 (the world has consistent rules).

It seems like your argument with why Worm isn't RF, boils down to your opinion that the work doesn't hit criteria #3 - more specifically, that the characters' application of knowledge/resources isn't /intelligent/.

On that point, I'm not sure I can convince you. IMO, RF characters (particularly non-protagonists) can solve problems through intelligent application of resources/knowledge, without being /the most intelligent/ characters. Not every character in HPMOR is Harry or Quirrell, and even /they/ make suboptimal decisions.

As for Alexandria:

- Her mental processes might have been offloaded to her shard, but just because those thought processes were unaffected by /outside/ suggestion, there's nothing in the text to say they weren't affected by her own emotions. Alexandria had almost never been in a situation where she was in /actual mortal danger/, so it seems perfectly plausible to me that she would panic when choking to death. And that's not a fan theory, it's simple human nature. The fan theory would be assuming she's /not/ subject to normal human emotional distress, because there's no textual support for that.

- “Just suck on a blowtorch” doesn't seem like a great solution. Alexandria was inside a secure and high-tech government facility, surrounded by a fairly ruined city (this is post-Leviathan, post-S9, and post-Echidna). There's nothing to suggest that she would know where to, or be able to, find a blowtorch in the short amount of time she had.

- There were already live bugs making webs in Alexandria's lungs; traveling out of Skitter's range wouldn't make a difference. The fact that Skitter's power continues to work while she's unconscious, was only brought up in the text in relation to Tagg (who didn't have bugs in his lungs, but couldn't escape Skitter's range in time), not Alexandria.
