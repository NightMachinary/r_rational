  (Whether it's "most" depends on how you count, of course.)

I count major/foundational story elements - of which there are almost none. The magic academy setting is unrelated to D&D. The idea of a looping copy of reality is unrelated to D&D. The magic system is not the D&D magic system, even if it uses some spells that are also in D&D. The characters, locations, and overall story are not from D&D. Some of the creatures are in D&D, but others (like the spiders, probably the most important nonhuman species) are original. You would need an incredibly broad and vague definition of fanfic to apply that label to MoL.

  Allowing very suboptimal solutions makes the criterion very subjective.
#+end_quote

First, that criteria is already somewhat subjective, as it depends on the interpreter's idea of "intelligent application." Second, I'm not allowing for /very/ suboptimal solutions, I'm allowing for /slight and occasional/ suboptimal solutions. Again, I would challenge you to find /any/ work (particularly a long-form one) in which no characters make suboptimal decisions.

  You could argue any specific example, but a Star Wars or Harry Potter fan could argue any specific example from those fandoms too.)

Well, you didn't address two of my main points (multiple decisions that clearly didn't have plausible reasons behind them, and the existence of "good" and "evil" factions), so those series already wouldn't be considered rational regardless. As for the power systems, Worm powers are very specifically described and quantified (Taylor can control bugs at this specific range in these specific ways, with clearly defined limitations). In SW, Jedi fight in classic knight style with minimal force power usage in the orig trig, yet in the prequels fly around like acrobats and throw around the force like it's going out of style. R2D2 somehow loses his memories and his many tech tricks (like flying) between 3&4. And there's no in-universe explanation given for any of these inconsistencies. I'm not sure how you can seriously categorize consistencies of the power systems of HP or SW (soft-magic systems) with that of Worm (a hard-magic system).
