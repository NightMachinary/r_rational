#+begin_quote
  MoL
#+end_quote

I don't think there's much point continuing on this one. We clearly have two different definitions of fanfiction: I posit that a fanfic includes /key elements/ from a specific source material, whereas you seem to be arguing that fiction becomes fanfiction when it includes an unspecified amount of any elements (major or minor) from another work. Since we can't find common ground on the definition of the label, there's no point in debating whether that label applies to MoL.

#+begin_quote
  SW and HP
#+end_quote

At this point, you seem to be arguing that SW and HP /do/ fit [[/r/rational][r/rational]] 's criteria for RF, so I'm not sure what your actual point is. Are you suggesting the criteria are wrong and/or subjective and/or meaningless? If that's the case, again, no point in continuing to debate whether Worm is RF, if we don't agree on a fundamental level what RF is.
