  And unlike 2YE, MoL doesn't use D&D rules.

"Is a rules system" doesn't literally mean "contains only rules". It doesn't contain story elements, but it does contain other things than rules, and those are common in MoL.

  And "I'm pretty sure you can find fans to explain how some of those are plausible" is not exactly a compelling counterargument in general.

It points out how "is plausible" is pretty subjective once you make allowances for things like "isn't optimal".

  the Emperor has no real motivations other than to grow the power of Evil
#+end_quote

The enemies in Star Wars and Harry Potter are not /in general/ motivated by a desire to do evil. Finding specific characters who are doesn't change this for the same reason that finding specific characters who are insane doesn't.

I'm also skeptical of equating "liking power" and "evil for evil's sake", unless you want to disqualify Worm because of, say, Heartbreaker, or even Scion (who could be considered either insane or evil by human standards).
