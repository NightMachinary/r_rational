  Apparently the fireball spell predates even D&D.
#+end_quote

That just shows that Fireball first appeared in a D&D predecessor rather than in D&D, which doesn't count unless you're being overly literal. Fireball was not something that existed in fantasy literature and was picked up in D&D later like elves.

  Cauldron's drive seems completely logical to me.
#+end_quote

Cauldron's goal makes sense, but the list of subgoals Cauldron does to achieve that goal is mostly arbitrary.

If Cauldron did the opposite of most of the things they did in the story, or if they acted/didn't act when they didn't act/acted in canon, it could still be "explained" as "necessary" to create lots of parahumans and defeat Scion.

Also, Cauldron and the conflict drive are two separate things.

  But just because something is unexplained, doesn't necessarily make it irrational.
#+end_quote

If something like that is unexplained, it might not be /irrational/, but it's certainly /non-rational/. You're confusing Doylist and Watsonian perspectives here. You can always make a character "rational" from a Watsonian perspective simply by having the character say "I am doing this for a reason". But if it's arbitrary to the reader, it doesn't count towards being rational fiction.

#+begin_quote
  I do generally agree with your last statement though - the rationality of the story should be decided solely on what's presented in said story, not on the invented explanations of the readers.
#+end_quote

That alone includes things like Alexandria getting herself killed, outing Skitter without asking Contessa "path to telling me whether this works or not", etc.
