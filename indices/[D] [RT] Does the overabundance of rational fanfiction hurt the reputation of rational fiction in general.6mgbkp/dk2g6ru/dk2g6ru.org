  Fanfic authors use the fact that they're building off of well-known canons to completely skip any significant world-building or character detail. Not only does this naturally exclude readers who aren't as familiar with the original canon, but it seems like a bit of a writing copout - the fanfic author is essentially piggy-backing off of the “heavy lifting” of the original canon.

Point, but this is essentially the same thing that new writers in established IPs (comics, movies, any other collaborative work on a single canon) do all the time. Any author writing in a genre using tropes is doing this too, to a greater or lesser extent, and I've seen fanfictions with better character development than published novels. To be derivative is to be human, fanfiction just embraces it as a contraint and jumping-off point.

  Related to the above, because these rational fanfics often don't have the same “meat” (character development, fully fleshed out rational worlds, etc) behind them as their original counterparts, they usually end up abandoned. I've found very few rational fanfic stories that are actually finished.

Counterpoint: Stories go unfinished all the time, both in and out of the set of rational fanfics. When something's released serially online as it's being written, of course you see more examples of abandoned work, and it just happens that "released serially online" is the usual medium for ratfic.

What you're talking about is nothing new. It's the logical result of the principle that 90-99% of everything written is bad. It's part of the growing pains of a new genre. When very few people write in the style, someone who likes the genre quickly runs out of their 1-10% slice of goodness into the morass of poorly-conceived, abandoned, and badly-written work out there. I know this, because I've written a few poorly-conceived, badly-written, and ultimately abandonned bits of ratfic. Writing is /hard/.

Fanfic itself is smack-dab in the middle of this. The sheer accessibility (to writers) and availability (to readers) of the genre means that people tend to see the 99% of awful fanfic much more clearly than the 1% of good stuff. Ratfic, insofar as it overlaps with fanfic, is tarred by this as well. This isn't a judgement, just an observation. Fantasy and sci-fi went through the same crisis over the last half-century. You've got Heinlein, and then you have the pulp magazine featuring an alien robot kidnapping a naked woman. You've got Ursula K. LeGuin, and then you have muscly orcs kidnapping a naked woman.

So, yeah. I'd argue that you're essentially right. The high volume of bad things tarnishes the good things by association. The bad things are mostly fanfic, because that has the lowest barrier to entry, just like bad fantasy tended to center around a few archetypes, or student films fall into the same traps of bad cinema over and over.

However, I'd argue that it's a bit silly to try and do anything drastic about it. Any step we take to "curate" the volume of rational fiction means raising the barrier to entry, which is unfeasible and contrary to the point. Writers get better by writing, so let them write. We could start petitioning writers to start removing records of abandoned work from the internet, I guess, but that's a lot of work that fixes the symptoms, not the issue.

I think the trick here is basically: wait, and write. Sometimes someone new will write something really cool, even if it's abandoned. Someone else might be inspired by that, and write something they actually finish. That has new ideas that get disseminated. And so on. Eventually, the cream floats to the top. Removing milk doesn't get you /more cream/. The only way to do that is to keep adding, and keep churning. (I don't actually know how cream is made)

So, ways to improve: provide mentorship and community to people who want to write ratfic. Allow discussion of new ideas, and embrace both originality and iterative improvement on that which has come before. Make writing /good/ ratfic more accessible rather than trying to make writing /bad/ ratfic less accessible.

It looks like the rest of the community has weighed in with basically similar points, but this is my take on it.
