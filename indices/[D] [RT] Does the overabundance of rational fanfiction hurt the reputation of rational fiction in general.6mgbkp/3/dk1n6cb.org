The claim that it's a writing cop out to use someone else's world for a rational fic is ridiculous--in fact, it's the opposite. In an original work, if it's found that such-and-such a plot point is irrational or dumb, then the author can shrug their shoulders and unilaterally change the rules of the world to avoid the issue. When using someone else's world, rather than ducking around the issue, the writer is more often than not forced to explain why it's consistent. This may result in minor alterations or reinterpretations, but it's vastly more intellectually honest than being able to define the world from the start. It invokes the imagery of a physicist struggling to explain the phonomenon around them, and not painters slapping paint wherever they damn well feel like putting it, even if it clashes.

Consider Metropolitan Man. If this were an original rational work, with a freakish alien coming to earth with the powers of a demigod, is there any guarantee that it has a weakness, let alone a magic rock? Does it follow from that simple premise that Superman must have an easily applied Achille's heel? I don't think so, and discovering that he was weak to copper would be considered incredibly narratively lazy and convenient. But Alexander Wales wasn't working with just his own world, he was reconstructing someone else's, and so he was forced to explain why Kryptonite was a thing.

Given the premise of "Superman exists, and his greatest ally is a reporter and his greatest enemy is a businessman and his greatest weakness is a green rock", Wales was forced to constrain his work within those sharply defined boundaries. There can be no cop-outs, no asspulls, no deus ex machina where it would come in conflict with the basic premise. An original work can redefine the premise at will. A rational fanfiction has no such flexibility and is thus anchored by its original canon, lest it cease to be Superman.
