Well, I disagree that it is easier to handwave something and alter the rules of the world around problems that crop up. The internal conflicts within an existing world propel the writing forward in a way that is much more difficult in your own world. Having too many choices about what to write about is a far tougher problem for an author than working inside constraints. Which is why it is much easier for new authors to approach existing worlds.
