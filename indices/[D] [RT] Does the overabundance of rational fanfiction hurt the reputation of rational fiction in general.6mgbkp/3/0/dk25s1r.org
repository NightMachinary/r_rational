  The claim that it's a writing cop out to use someone else's world for a rational fic is ridiculous--in fact, it's the opposite.

I disagree. While I wouldn't reach so far as to call it a cop out (though we've all run across some works that cop out /hard/), I think it's much easier to write something in a world that's already been made for you. Like.../orders of magnitude/ easier. This doesn't mean writing a good story is easy. But it's definitely less work, both from a creative and actuary standpoint.
