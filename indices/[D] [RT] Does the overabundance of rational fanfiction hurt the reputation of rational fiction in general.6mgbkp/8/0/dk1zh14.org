  Those 4 rules are basically rules of ANY good book

I have to disagree here - rational-ising /Star Wars/ would make it a /different/ movie, and probably not a better (more enjoyable, culturally impactful) one. "Rational" works of Lovecraft... wouldn't work. /Discworld/ is, for want of a better word, antirational and all the better for it.

Sure, those four rules are key for realistic fiction aiming to evoke particular responses in the reader - but it's certainly possible to write excellent fiction without them.
