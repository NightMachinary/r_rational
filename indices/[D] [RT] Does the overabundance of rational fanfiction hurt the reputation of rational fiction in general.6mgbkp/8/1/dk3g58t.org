Well, if you agree with [[/r/rational][r/rational]] 's 4 rules as being the criteria by which we judge fiction as rational or not, then Worm, MoL and PGtE are pretty clearly rational fiction, regardless of whether their authors explicitly intended them as such. I think this is fairly true of any genre - if we came up with some explicit criteria for Romance books, for instance, and someone wrote a Fantasy book that hit all those criteria, then we could certainly also consider it a Romance as well.

If you DON'T agree with the 4 rules, then what criteria would you use? If rational fiction just consists of works whose authors have decided to self-label them as RF, then the genre is more or less completely subjective, and the rational fiction label has no meaning.

And I fully agree with [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] 's point - you may tend to enjoy novels that follow those 4 rules, but those rules are clearly not the “basic rules of any good book”. /Lord of the Rings/ hits maaaaybe two of those rules, yet it still seems pretty well regarded...
