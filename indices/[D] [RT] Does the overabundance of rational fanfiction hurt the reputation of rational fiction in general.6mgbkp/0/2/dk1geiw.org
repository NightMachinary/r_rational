Whoo, I got a mention!

At least in my case, you've got it pegged. I started with fanfic as a teen and used it both for therapy purposes and learning from beginner mistakes. On that foundation, I've written ten novels (published two). Across everything I've written, the thread has been rationalism, because it all has to make /sense,/ as OP laid out. I see lots of my generation's writers going through this same growth process, and it's a lot of fun to participate in.

  when those same friends *attempt to search for* more rational stories, they're suddenly waist-deep in countless HP/Naruto/FiM fanfics, most of which are incomplete or abandoned.

(Bolds mine.) I'm seeing this as the central issue, really. Anytime you get into a new genre/medium/fandom/whatever, there's a lot of crap to sort through. What help are reviews, recommendations, and favorites/awards lists. (Oh, hell, I just realized that there's no rationalist fiction award. That would be a start. (edit: [[/u/vakusdrake]] has the right idea.)) Those things will come up in Google once they're established; until then, when getting someone into the genre, you might tell them, 'Don't bother with Google; check [[/r/rational]] for more.'

(semi off-topic) As for the point about overpowered rationalist characters and 'giving Sauron the Death Star' --- am I the only one recently getting a hankering to just write straight-up wish fulfillment and competence porn? I haven't gotten around to brainstorming any yet (I still need to write a trilogy-closing novel in which someone is going to be slowly and +un-+half-willingly turned into an alien needle spider), but I think about it every time everyone talks about how all fiction needs conflict and suffering. Why can't things just be beautifully nice?

(P.S. my favorite 'giving Sauron the Death Star' example has to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][rationalist!Animorphs]], because I'm starting to think their Visser Three is unstoppable)
