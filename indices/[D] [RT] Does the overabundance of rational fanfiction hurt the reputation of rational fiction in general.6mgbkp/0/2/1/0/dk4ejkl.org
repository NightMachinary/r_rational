The One Punch Man analogy is actually very good. I think you capture it well.

If challenge isn't going to be the main point of the story, there has to be some non-violent conflict that the plot turns on.

This is like playing a tabletop roleplaying game with a group who has optimized for combat. If you want something they can't just steamroll, make them do some things subtly or with intrigue.
