The first thing that comes to mind when I think of overpowered protagonists and wish fulfillment is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9912044/1/Hope-Through-Overwhelming-Firepower][Hope Through Overwhelming Firepower]]. It's a worm fic that imports Taylor's different power from a universe where the power scales are so much larger than Worm's that Taylor really faces little threat. Admittedly, the power is crippled when she gets it and needs to repair itself, so at first Taylor's 'just' a very powerful Blaster, but she quickly gets stronger and just as quickly tries to figure out how she can use her powers to help. When I look back on it, though, despite the fact that Taylor never /really/ feels like she's in true danger, I generally think of it as a fun romp that didn't overstay its welcome.

Another thing that comes to mind is One Punch Man. As a premise, by all rights it should be boring. "Invincible guy who kills everything he fights in one punch". What can you do with that? Do you throw enemies at him who are too fast to hit, or something? But the setting only affirms Saitama as invincible, instead focusing on his inability to get proper recognition for his heroic works or the struggle of the side characters who, while strong, can face true danger so long as Saitama's not there to insta-win the fight.

If I may get analytical, I would guess that when people say conflict is needed for good stories, it's referring to how conflict draws outcomes into doubt in meaningful ways. When whether your protagonist will live or die depends on whether he can win the fight against Evil Monster Man, your immersed self isn't confident that the protagonist will survive, and the future is cast into doubt. For something like One Punch Man, once you're invested in Saitama getting the recognition he deserves, and Saitama then goes and does another amazing thing, the immersed you wants to know but can't be sure whether Saitama will get recognition. For a peaceful story, then, what you first need is to immerse people in the story, and then you need to find a way to draw the future into doubt. An easy option for this is research and experimental results, if the protagonists' plans depend on the experiment working out one way, you can build up tension and anticipation for the result just the same as if there was actual conflict and struggle.
