I don't think it is a free signal, though.

First, there're a number of people with a bias against the rationalist movement, so labeling a fic rational will hurt your readership there.

Second, the ratfic community is quite willing to criticize ratfics for being irrational. Keeping a fic rational is hard, labeling your fic rational means you've opened yourself up to criticism there too.
