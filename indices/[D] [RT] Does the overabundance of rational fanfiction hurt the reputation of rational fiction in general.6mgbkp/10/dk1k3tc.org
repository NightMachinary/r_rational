I disagree with your premise that there's an overabundance of rational fiction.

Rational fiction is about /one/ common problem that fiction writers often fail to solve--characters making really stupidly unrealistic decisions . But there are /lots/ of other problems, like the ones you list, that it says nothing about. The problem is that there aren't enough extremely skilled writers who solve /all/ of these problems, not that there is too much rational fiction.
