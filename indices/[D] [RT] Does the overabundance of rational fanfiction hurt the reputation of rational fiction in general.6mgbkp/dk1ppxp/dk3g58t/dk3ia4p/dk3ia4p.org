So, for me 2nd and 3rd rule can be summarized by "Have good characters". A good character in a novel/book shouldnt be treated like a plot point but like a real human being in the story with his own worries, desires etc. and 1st and 4th rule is basically dont do "deus ex machina" although the 1st ones goes for consistent characterization too.

Ofcourse some books may follow it to some larger or smaller extent in which case for example a soft magic system wouldnt be exactly "rational" but usually it still avoids deus ex machina to not undermine narrative tensions and still follows certain even if irrational and not logical rules so the reader knows what to expect to some extent.

And maybe not all or even most books follow those 4 rules to every letter but i guarantee you that it would still be quite a lot of fiction and suddenly the genre of rational is incredibly big.

On the other hand the definition of rational is very broad also so i guess it encompasses a lot.
