So i know its kinda offtopic but i dont think Worm, Mother of learning or Practical Guide to Evil ever were specifically meant to be written as "rational" fiction described in the side bar.

Those 4 rules are basically rules of ANY good book and adding an additional label to them as rational fiction irks me because then most of well made fiction would be rational. In most good books things dont happen from nowhere. In most books characters act on their beliefs and values as it humanizes them and consistent rules are almost a must, really. Ofcourse it varies from book to book but they are the general things you could find in any decent one.

I am glad the authors get the recognition they deserve as i have enjoyed their works and i wish them luck. Sorry for the offtopic but it always annoyed me and i wanted to get it out and the thread seemed somehow aproporiate.

On to the subject of your question its the same with everything. Majority of fiction is crap, you just dont see it because it filtered by publishers, reviewers and popularity. its just especially evident on internet because everybody and their mother, aunt, uncle, daughter and nephew can make an account of fictonpress, royalroad, wordpress, wattpad and start writing from the get go if they have anything of an artistic bone in their body or just enough of willingness to put these hours in. Its not always good and is mostly atrocious because they have never attempted writing before or learned anything worth noting from school.
