I agree that it's easier to write fanfiction than original fiction, and even that it's easier to write rational fanfiction than original rational fiction, but I would say that a lot of the unique value of rational fiction can only really manifest in fanfiction, and that it takes a particular skill to do it that is not found in any other kind of fiction.

So I do think there are aspects to it that make rational fanfics harder in many ways than non-rational original works, even accounting for the ways fanfics are easier to write in general.
