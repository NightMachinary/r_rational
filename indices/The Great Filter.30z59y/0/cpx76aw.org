This unnamed story by Scott Siskind proposes a possibility: [[http://www.raikoth.net/Stuff/story1.html]]

I recall reading somewhere that properly-constructed Dyson Spheres could be detected only by the gravitational effects. In fact, with only the instruments currently at our disposal there would be no way for us to distinguish a galaxy with a lot of Dyson Spheres from a galaxy with a lot of dark matter.

(In which case there's really not so much of a Filter as we think)

I can't remember where I read this, though, and don't know enough to say whether it's total BS (I would be happy to hear one way or another).

I'm also not yet sure if, once you get to the point of crossing interstellar distances, it isn't easier to just /create/ your own habitats rather than terraform big hunks of rock. In which case there may be any number of civilizations out there but they're leaving the star systems clear for potential future life.

(I can't remember where, but there's a scifi story where the alien civilizations have developed a sort of Prime Directive that doesn't allow any kind of interference in a system that has the potential to bear life on its own).
