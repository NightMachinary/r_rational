To me the only thing that makes sense is the physical limits to computation across distance. It is not that life does not exist, but that it has no reason to expand.

Efficiency of communication at computronium speeds falls off rapidly with distance. For example, if you can live at a subjective million times faster than current human experience, then even conversing over a distance of a few metres is going to feel like a delay of seconds in dialogue (kinda the Her problem, but for distance rather than substrate).

As such, even with hypothetical advances in distributed computing, there is an optimal size for a civilisation before it will begin to operate as two civilisations.

And two civilisations in proximity are competing for the same resources, with the same technological level. Growing larger would generate existential risk.

It is also possible that acausal trade could torpedo this solution to the great filter, if there was a significant enough problem to work on that one civilisation was unlikely to solve on its own but having more varied civilisations increased the likelihood of a solution.

Solving heat death/the big rip is the most obvious candidate.

Then it might be worth seeding the entire universe with other civilisations and just trusting them to operate in their own interests, therefore not create competition.

Still the only really plausible answer I can see for the filter though. Without a hard limit like this, life should be varied, and therefore not all of it should be in stealth mode.
