Universal kill-filter: Physics is booby-trapped. Some experiment which a technological civilization inevitably conducts has an outcome involving entirely unreasonable energy output, and that is that. Boom. Doesn't matter what your species psychology is like, because the result is not deducible in advance.

More hopeful:

Expansionism into interstellar space makes no sense at the tech level where it is possible to do it - The inevitable time delays in interstellar travel mean that economic activity around other stars completely decouple from the launching star system.

There is no, and can be no return on investment from settler colonies. Any civilization rich and prosperous enough to send one can - and does - write up the economic / mathematical / moral proof why they shouldn't do it, because that level of understanding is a necessary precondition for being that rich in the first place, so instead all surviving civilizations are single-star system affairs with vast infrastructure in a compact space to minimize time delays and maximize the number of available trading and cultural exchange partners within their social/economic/cultural network.
