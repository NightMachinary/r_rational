A solar system's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment][Late Heavy Bombardment-equivilent]] event(s) go wrong -- too late, too long, or too severe.

Also, there's the issue of not getting enough large gas giants in the correct orbits to both use up material (ours are about 99% of planetary material between them) and sweep the growing star system (relatively) clean of early rogue debris.

Ironically, our gas giants are also thought to have caused those bombardment events I mentioned earlier. And just after they stopped, life started on Earth.

But not having large gas giants at all could result in many, many more ongoing life-ending global disasters from huge loose rocks nuking potential life bearing "Goldilocks zone" rocky planets -- potentially even blowing off their developing atmospheres. Complex life never even stands a chance between extinction events before the star goes "foom".

These relate mostly to "delicate, rare" life origin scenarios, but agree with observed facts.
