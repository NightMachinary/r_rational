I was rather referring to the sharp spike in progress ("revolution") following automated industry, and later, computing. No contention that there was steady progress before that point, except perhaps that it almost certainly was not a monotonic increase. It is a question of when and how often a civilization makes that jump to automated labor, and what follows from that.
