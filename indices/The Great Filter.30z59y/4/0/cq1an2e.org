I think your premise is a bit off. "A few centuries of technological progress" ignores the fact that modern education was invented in the 800s and algebra not long after. The first time higher math was really applied to reality was when the Muslims started using algebra to figure out how to build their larger mosques, and the concept of zero, without which there is no computer programming, existed at least 1300 years ago. Really, progress has been happening at an increasing pace since about 8000 years ago when settled agrarian societies started to show up.
