If AGI is possible within a few centuries of technological revolution, this together with fairly conservative estimates via the Drake equation would suggest there should have been a plethora of civilizations out there (at least billions) who would have done it by now. Which we don't see.

So either AGI is extremely unlikely, we are in some sort of nature preserve, there are harder limits on intelligence than we currently believe, civilizations always go extinct before then, (intelligent) life is far rarer than we thought in the first place, or my favorite: we're just seeing a very strong anthropic selection effect; we're the only ones here because you just don't expect to find yourself in a universe with most flavors of recursively self-improving superintelligence. Not that I actually give this strong credence, but it's pretty interesting at least.
