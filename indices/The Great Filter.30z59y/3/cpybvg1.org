I think it's probably behind us: The evolution of "intelligent" life.

The kind of sapience you need to start poking at the laws of physics is something that you either have or you don't. Evolution is all about incremental improvements. So there's really not much reason for intelligence to evolve. It was a series of coincidences that our ancestors got into circumstances where their brains could grow unimpeded.

I mean, take insects. They've been around for hundreds of millions of years, and they currently outmass mammals by an order of magnitude. Yet individually they're dumber than a sack of hammers. Even actions that seem clever in-context are driven by instinct have no real thought behind them - insects can't adapt to new situations.

I think if we ever discover life in other star systems, we'll see a lot of things as dumb as insects.
