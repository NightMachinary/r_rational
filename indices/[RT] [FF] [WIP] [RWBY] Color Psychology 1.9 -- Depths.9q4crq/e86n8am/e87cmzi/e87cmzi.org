One of the stories I most look forward to updates from! Best RWBY fic I've read by far.

Your treatment of the Grimm, and the effect their attraction to negative emotions has on both the central characters and the world at large, is top-notch.

It reminds me of the way Alexander Wales thinks and writes in his Worth the Candle serial.
