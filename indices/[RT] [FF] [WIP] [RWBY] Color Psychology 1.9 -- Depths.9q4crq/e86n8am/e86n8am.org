Your characterizations continue to impress!

Pyrrha was apparently trained to repress things until they go away. Kinda like the "turn it off" song from Book of Mormon. I guess it works since Mistral hasn't been overrun, but it seems a little unhealthy from my perspective.

Weiss freaks the fuck out as soon as a giant Grimm shows up and loses her ability to stay calm and dispassionate because she's faced with something her training hasn't covered. Does a good job portraying how she's extremely inexperienced when it comes to live-fire situations. Also does well showing how you can read and memorize all the social interaction books you want, but putting them into practice while under stress is a lot harder.

Also, Pyrrha's semblance is really really unfair.
