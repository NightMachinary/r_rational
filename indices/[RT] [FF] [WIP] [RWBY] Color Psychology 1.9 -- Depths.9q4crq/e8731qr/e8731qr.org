Oh Jaune. You are having the /most awkward/ harem right now.\\
Though you are good for them, mostly. The soft and compassionate boy, with a fair bit of insight. That youngest sister really did remind me of Ruby, with her happy dedication to the craft, contrasted to unease with social gatherings.

Here's hoping Jaune will (eventually) either resolve this teenage drama of build an even bigger web of connections.
