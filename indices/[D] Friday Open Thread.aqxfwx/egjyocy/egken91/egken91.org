First of all, it seems you are doing great! Very impressive!

In my experience, both learning mathematics and trying to help others learn, the most important part is practice, and you already do a lot of that.

Another thing that really helps is explaining things to others. I think the biggest danger is having the feeling of understanding something, while not actually having grasped all of it. While certain kinds of knowledge, like how to calculate the area of a polygon, can be tested easily by doing exercises, others, such as “why do the angle bisectors of a regular polygon meet at a single point” are more difficult. The further you go in mathematics, the more the latter is going to matter. Being able to explain things seems to be a pretty good indicator of understanding.

Obviously, finding people to explain things to might be difficult. However, talking to yourself can be a fine alternative, depending on your skill to be self-critical. Another possibility is writing things down as though someone else might read it. Just having the mindset is important.

Looking at your textbooks, it seems to me you are currently focussing on fundamental techniques and less on proofs. Exercises containing the word "prove" are really quite different from ones that do not. So, I would recommend trying to figure out what interests you and then try to move into that direction in the long run. While proofs and logic are certainly at the heart of mathematics, they might be less important if you are looking for certain applications.

Personally, I really like logical thinking, proving things and programming things, and these are basically the same activity for me. When I am trying to understand something, I always try to poke holes in the arguments (“Why do we need this line?”, “Does it still work if X is not Y? Where does it fail?”) and start by attempting to do it on my own. Also, I am not afraid of forgetting, because logic is something I apply all the time when thinking about whether things are true or whether an argument makes sense.

I would not worry about forgetting facts. Things that are useful will be used and thus not be forgotten and the things you had understood at some point still helped you to get better at understanding things.

Final point: Take care to be challenged. Solving difficult problems is a much more efficient way to improve then easy ones.

In that sense, I leave you (and anyone else reading this) with a “simple” puzzle I have just been working on: [[https://imgur.com/KPptBZM][Image]] Can you fill the squares of the number pyramid with whole numbers, so that each square is the sum of the two below it? (No negative numbers.)
