To be more detailed about my guessing, I stuck the equations into a matrix as well but I didn't quite know how to algorithmically solve it like you did. I did however end up with this form:

#+begin_example
  x1 x2 x3 x4
  -4  0  14  17 |  21
#+end_example

Since I then knew that the sum of x3 and x4 is 3 or less, and that 14x3 + 17x4 = 21 + 4x1, I simply wrote a table of 21 + 4x1, like

21

25

29

...

45

and all I had to do was test 14x3 + 17x4 against my newly made table for a maximum of 5 times to find the answer.

I do think that these kinds of solutions are pretty unclean though. The elegancy of math is lost when you start guessing your way forward. It's like solving an algebraic exercise with a graphing calculator. You might get the answer, but your dignity takes some damage.
