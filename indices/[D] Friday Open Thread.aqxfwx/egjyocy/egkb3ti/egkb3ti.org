Good on you man! I've really wanted to do something similar since I don't have a real grasp on calculus, applied or even understanding equations.

Your method seems pretty solid as long as you can stick to it, if you can't keep with that I'd look at online lessons that offer problems online. Aside from that I enjoy Khan academy lessons for previews and reviews, but they move too fast for me to learn math from.

I would also suggest throwing in a statistics book when you want a break, I found algebra based statistics very interesting and not mathematically challenging in the same way. That being said it's still foundational for understanding a huge amount of applied everyday math like QC, gambling, insurances, and warranties.
