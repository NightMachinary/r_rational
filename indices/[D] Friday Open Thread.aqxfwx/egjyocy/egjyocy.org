Due to overflowing disappointment in my own ineptitude and my burning envy towards all the math-savvy people in the rationalsphere, I've been self-studying mathematics from scratch.

My daily routine looks like this:

- I go through a chapter in a textbook, carefully reading all the definitions and trying to connect them to what I remember from school

- I try doing all the examples myself, before seeing the explanation

- at the end of the chapter, I solve at least 5--10 exercises

- in my spare time, I look up the same material on youtube/math stack exchange/reddit, seeking intuition and understanding

- every ~10 chapters (usually taking advantage of general sections in a textbook, e.g. ‘Quadratics' or ‘Right Angle Trigonometry'), I enter a card into Anki with a ‘Do x exercises from every chapter within section y' instruction towards my future self.

- I look up Anki every day, and do whatever it instructs me to do. After doing all the ‘review exercises', I click on ‘Good'.

- similarly, I enter hard-to-memorize formulas and theorems into it.

The textbooks I'm currently using:

- Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace (100% done)

- Elementary College Geometry by Henry Africk (~80% done)

- Trigonometry by Michael Corral

- Precalculus by Carl Stitz and Jeff Zeager

(...and I'm still lazily researching textbooks for calculus, linear algebra, and further maths.)

Are there any large flaws in my methods? Similarly, are there any things I could be doing that would boost the effectiveness of my learning? I'm mostly focused on maintaining my knowledge over large periods of time---this is my primary intention with using Spaced Repetition, but Anki is clearly not designed for subjects like math and I can do only so much with it. One of my biggest fears is spending time and effort learning something only to forget it, so if you have any suggestions in this area, I would be grateful.
