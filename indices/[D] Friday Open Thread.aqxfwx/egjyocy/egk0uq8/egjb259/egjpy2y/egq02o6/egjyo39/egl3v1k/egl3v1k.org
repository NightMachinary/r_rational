All on RRL:

I enjoy [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind][The Daily Grind]] and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21334/the-draw-of-the-unknown][The Draw of the Unknown]], both by argusthecat. TDG has been linked to on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] a fair bit.

I've enjoyed the first 10 chapters of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21353/esper-search-for-power][Esper: Search for Power]], but can't wholly recommend it. It's a rational-adjacent take on litrpg, played very straight / cliche. Hopefully the writer continues writing and improves. The pacing is not great, it gets too caught up in the details of the character's thoughts and, so far, everything has felt too easy for the protagonist. I fear the story has left itself too little room to move forward in terms of escalating challenges. There's some acknowledgement of most of that --- both in-story and in the Author's comments --- but it's on Hiatus after 25 chapters, and within a couple months of starting.

I enjoyed reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10286/the-good-student][The Good Student]], but it switched to another site which was too bloated with tracking and ads for me to load it on my old phone. I have a better phone and a better adblocker and plan to return to reading it eventually.

I have 3 or 4 stories on RRL next up on my read list I think will be good too. I might post about them in one of the weekly recommendation threads if they're worthwhile, but probably not for a month or so.
