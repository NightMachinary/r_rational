Superoptimizers bruteforce assembly in order to find the most optimal snippet. There's also hyperparameter optimization in machine learning, which bruteforces hyperparameters from a phase space.

In general, it's bruteforcing Turing machines. You're not going to get anything efficient, although it'll be stupidly parallel.
