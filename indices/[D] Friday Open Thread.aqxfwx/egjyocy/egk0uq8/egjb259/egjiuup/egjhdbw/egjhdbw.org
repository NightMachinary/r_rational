"Science Fantasy" is indeed the term you're looking for. The genre mixes the aesthetic trappings of both scifi and fantasy. There's no reason to exclude star wars from the genre, because the setting does indeed focus on technology and the advancement of science. There's no particular reason space needs to imply technology, but most works that include space travel have some sort of technological focus. I think the only exception is the /Larklight/ series, where the british empire expands through the solar system because they have an effectively magical formula.
