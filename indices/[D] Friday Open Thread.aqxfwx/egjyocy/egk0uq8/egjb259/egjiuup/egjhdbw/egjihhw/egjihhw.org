  There's no reason to exclude star wars from the genre, because the setting does indeed focus on technology and the advancement of science.

Star Wars focuses /far/ more on Jedi and Sith than on Sienar and Incom. Thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, X-wings and (basic) TIE fighters are still being used with only minor modifications (both in the EU and in Disney's canon, IIRC). One-off superweapons and spy tricks that are forgotten immediately after their introduction and whose innovations aren't exploited for other purposes hardly count as technological advancements, either.
