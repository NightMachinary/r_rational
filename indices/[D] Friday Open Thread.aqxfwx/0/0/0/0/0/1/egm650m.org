It is so interesting to see your solutions :) I am kind of surprised how well educated guessing work. My own also gets to these equations

#+begin_quote
  45 = 1 * 6 + 4 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 4 * x3 + 1 * x4

  17 = 1 * x2 + 3 * x3 + 3 * x4 + 7
#+end_quote

Which we can simplify to

4 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 4 * x3 + 1 * x4 = 39

0 * x1 + 1 * x2 + 3 * x3 + 3 * x4 = 10

Dropping the variables gives

#+begin_example
  x1 x2 x3 x4
   4  6  4  1 | 39
   0  1  3  3 | 10
#+end_example

4 and 6 are even while 39 is not, so we have to use x4 at least once. So lets subtract that.

#+begin_example
       x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  1 | 38
        0  1  3  3 |  7
       ------------+
  used  0  0  0  1
#+end_example

7 cannot be divided by 3, so we have to take x2 at least once as well.

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  1 | 32
        0  1  3  3 |  6
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  1
#+end_example

If we were to use x4 once more, then 32-1 = 31 is odd again, so we would have to use x4 at least twice. It would look like this:

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  1 | 30
        0  1  3  3 |  0
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  3
#+end_example

Now the second row is zero, so we cannot use x2, x3 and x4 anymore. 30 is not divisible by 4, so this does not work, and we cannot use x4. Going back:

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  - | 32
        0  1  3  - |  6
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  1
#+end_example

We have to use x2 an even number of times, else the first row is not divisible by 4. It also has to be divisible by 3, else the second row does not work. But if we use it 6 times (the smallest even number divisible by 3), then the first row becomes negative. So no x2 as well.

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  -  4  - | 32
        0  -  3  - |  6
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  1
#+end_example

Finally, we use x3 two and x1 six times.

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  -  4  - |  0
        0  -  3  - |  0
       ------------+
  used  6  1  2  1
#+end_example

I will admit that educated guessing is much easier. But this instance was computer-generated, so it is nice that I can tell a story at all. (Incidentally, the puzzle was created by applying this basically in reverse.)
