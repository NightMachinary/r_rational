Ah, I'm actually dumbfounded I completely forgot about statistics and probability theory. Thanks for the remainder -- I'll make sure to include them in my future studies.

Considering Khan Academy, I've heard a lot of good things about it, however... It might seem like a petty thing, but I absolutely can't stand their website. It just feels so bloated and opaque to me, you know? And their lectures are pretty computational in nature, from what I've seen. When it comes to this kind of educational material, I found [[https://www.youtube.com/user/misterwootube][Eddie Woo's channel]] somewhat more useful.

Other than that, I think I'll stick to traditional textbooks -- I really like how they allow me to pace myself however I want.
