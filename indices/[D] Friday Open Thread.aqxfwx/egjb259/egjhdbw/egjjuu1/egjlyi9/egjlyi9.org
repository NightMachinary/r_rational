If you want the main characters to specifically be doing science as [[/r/rational]] readers understand it, then the term you're looking for is "rationalist." If you want the main character to be doinh science as a layman audience would understand it, you're not looking for a genre, you're looking for a character archetype. You can have the MC do science in the context of a murder mystery, a space opera, an epic fantasy work, or what have you.
