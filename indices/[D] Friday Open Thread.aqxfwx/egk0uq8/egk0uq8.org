So I've been playing Destiny 2 recently. Quite a lot, in fact - I basically played it for like a week straight at first, and have now settled down into only occasional 5+ hour stints now that I've hit endgame.

Something that I've noticed is that the lore is very, very bad. I don't know why so many people like it. It's almost entirely dependent on rule-of-cool handwavium, poorly explained in very badly written lore snippets you have to hunt down from secrets. It has neat /ideas/, but basically doesn't do anything with it.

The main characters are Guardians, who are given space magic and lichdom from a giant world-travelling acasual entity called the Traveller; they can do weird effects and are raised from the dead as long as their Ghost (small machine thing) exists. They basically just do fuck all for the past several thousand years out of kinda-religious feelings of not wanting to be proactive, allowing humanity to backslide out of a "Golden Age" until the entire solar system is overrun by aliens and humans only have a single city left. The Fallen are galaxy-wide scavaging pirates who are commonly portrayed as dumb as bricks, and mysteriously have left any machine you'd need working just fine despite their scavanging. The Hive as death worshipping omnicidal wizard aliens trying to summon elder gods, and are actually pretty cool except for all their out-of-context magic never actually do anything. The Vex managed to convert an entire planetoid to Computanium to simulate timelines and have a portal nexus spanning an infinite web of parallel realities but don't do anything and basically fall over to a breeze. The Awoken were members on a colonyship expedition, ran into a fight between the Light and Dark acasual entities and were trapped in a timewarped singularity universe where they were postscarcity and immortal, and then the queen reincarnated everyone to a mortal body because they needed to "evolve and live meaningful lives" and because we didn't have enough pro-death JRPG tropes in video games, I guess.

The entire thing just feels terrible. Even the actual storylines are bad - the entire first arc is diaspora analog that basically amounts to Deus ex machina trust your god bullshit, the first expansion is fighting against post-singularity infinite computation power timeline simulating Vex and winning because the Vex can't simulate Handwavium, the second is waffling AI security that could have been interesting if it felt like there were any stakes and you didn't already activate a Golden Age AI in the first arc, or the AI actually had any character, and the third is a drawn out revenge story after one of your friends is perma-killed that fails to actually hit any of the "are we the baddies" note it was trying to hit, and then switches into a completely unexplained arc with the Awoken that ends with a "ah, I wanted you to kill me! All according to kaikaku" and conscious-of-but-cant-change-events timeloop.

I'm not even upset about the story. It's just so /disappointing/. If I played Destiny 1 maybe it would make more sense, or if I spent the time reading into the scarce worldbuilding they drip to people so they feel invested like Overwatch and other properties do.

I'm, uh, not entirely sure where I'm going with this. I'm still gonna play it. Just wanted to rant.
