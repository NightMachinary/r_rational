I was just watching Umbella Academy, im just halfway through, and i found it really interesting. The rationalist billionaire training the mutant kids really reminded me of this sub and how I imagine X-men should have been in the first place. I wanted to recommend it here cause i thoght we could have some interesting discussions about it here and how to munchkin the powers.
