Take the O*Net interest profiler and answer it honestly. I've been in a room with 20 people all taking it at the same time, get wildly divergent results, and seen each person say "Well obviously I got recommended a dream job, sucks for the rest of the room though."

The questions seem dumb, but they also show a lot of low preparation (e.g. low/no college alternatives) versions of jobs you want.
