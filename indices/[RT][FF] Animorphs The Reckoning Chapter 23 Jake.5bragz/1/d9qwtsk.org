The Tom scene is great. I usually hate the "evil guys make an innocent suffer to show they're evil" scenes, but in this scene it's just so well done, so natural, it really brings out the stakes of the situation, the suffering there was, and why "Kill all these fuckers" is an option everyone is going to consider.

Often in stories, people who have been through horrible pain acknowledge it in a dispassionate way: "Yes, it was really painful and unpleasant and horrible! I hope it won't happen again!". It's great that this story shows the /consequences/ of pain, with people flinching, crying, cracking up, being afraid, being angry, etc. Canon Animorphs made a big deal of Tom being a controller, but it never had a scene like that where we /felt/ how much he went through.

Otherwise, it's great that everyone is cooperating, and no longer keeping secrets from each other. Join the Light Side! We have cooperation and hugs! Although I'm a bit surprised Erek cooperated too. More fuel for my "Erek is somehow different from interacting with humans" theory.

  Can't go around leaving loopholes like â€˜let me infest you or I'll kill all the hostages,' after all.

Sounds like bitter experience. Someone read Book #53. Also, on one hand, "Erek disabled the implants" makes more sense that "The Andalites can shut off the technology but only if they want to deep in their heart(s)". One the other hand, I'm not sure relying more and more on Erek to solve narrative problems is a good idea from a literary perspective.
