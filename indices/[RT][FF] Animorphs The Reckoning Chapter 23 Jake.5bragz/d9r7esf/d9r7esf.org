This chapter reminded me for the first time that they're all /thirteen/. Like, pardon my French, but what the fuck? I've been picturing them as later-teens this whole time just because of their thought process. I know they were all groomed to represent the human race by the gods or whatever, but this is all some serious prodigy stuff.

Also, the whole thought-speak thing was funny and exciting. Adds a whole new dynamic when people can talk behind someone's back right in front of them, and when you know everyone is probably doing it to you at the same time.

Can't wait for the next one, as usual.
