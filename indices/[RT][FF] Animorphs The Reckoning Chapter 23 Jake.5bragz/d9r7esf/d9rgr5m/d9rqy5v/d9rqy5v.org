I think that children of that age certainly experience the world as if they're fully-formed, mature actors. But the fact is that their behavior (and this goes all the way up to mid-20s) indicates someone who doesn't really understand the world or have the decision-making skills of an adult. These kids have been through the minds of multiple highly experienced adults, multiple different intellectually (and possibly supernaturally) gifted peers, and hyperinteligent aliens. They've been afforded (and availed themselves of) the advantages of the yeerks, including a more limited form of their hive mind in the form of the backups. So they've probably gained a significant amount of experience and intelligence through osmosis. Tobias in particular has probably become an expert in national security without totally realizing. In fact, it would be pretty weird if they didn't start to rapidly become more intelligent and capable increasing exponentially as they enter the minds of different individuals and one another. Probably have them realize it when one of them begins speaking a foreign language known by a morph they've used, with a further insight when another who accessed that one's backup displays the same ability.

As far as your preserved memories and observations, two things. 1. Nobody's saying kids don't think they've got it together. Dunning-Krueger is quite real. Your memories "deliberately preserved" means that you've remembered them over and over? Because as I understand it, memories tend to get telephone-gamed and lose their accuracy each time you remember them. 2. For your interactions with students, you probably have a bit of confirmation bias happening because it's a deeply held belief. And because of the intellectual strengths of children, it can be easy to be convinced that their maturity, intelligence and wisdom is an order of magnitude greater than the actual value.

I'm not saying kids are stupid. They learn faster than adults and are much more adaptable (why I think your kids here prob disproportionately benefit from the insights afforded by the morphing tech). But they're inexperienced, immature, impulsive and oblivious to those facts.
