  I'm now wiser with more perspective, and therefore I invalidate my previous assessment!

That's so lame. The /most/ you could do is say, "I shouldn't have been upset", "I should have been happy", or even, "I wish I knew how good it could have been so instead of having a terrible time being bullied I could use my adult interpresonal skills to put myself in a different clique and have a good time". How can you say, "oh no, I was actually happy the whole time"? Who the hell lies to themselves like that?

Like I can see a 6 year old kid being given a blanket that grandma spent months crocheting and being like "this is dumb I wanted a transformer", and the 24 year old version of that kid being like "that blanket my grandma crocheted me when I was a kid is one of the best things I ever own". Because you appreciate different things (work, family, etc) when you're an adult.

But this is /personal experience/ and /how much you actually enjoyed yourself/. Not, "oh I wish when I was ten I appreciated my parents taking me to the MoMA".
