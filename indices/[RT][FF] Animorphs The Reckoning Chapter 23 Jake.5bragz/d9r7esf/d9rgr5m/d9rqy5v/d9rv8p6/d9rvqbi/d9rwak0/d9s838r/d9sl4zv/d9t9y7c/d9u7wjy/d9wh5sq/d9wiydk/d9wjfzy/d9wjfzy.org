I think you're in the minority. I see enough people making massive, retroactive updates that I suspect there are large incentives at work in the general population (this is part of what I alluded to above, when I said I had a different essay-length rant). I'd gently nudge you to preserve your impressions in some way that's likely to be robust, just on the off chance that it hasn't hit you yet.

(The worst offender here seems to be something like "I'm now wiser with more perspective, and therefore I invalidate my previous assessment!" which Scott and I are able to overcome through some sort of self-consistency assumption-of-good-faith, and many other people just ... don't.)
