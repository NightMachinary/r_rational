No intention of playing into the win-or-be-crushed dynamic---just a general push toward "if someone clearly smart and experienced (who's writing a story that demonstrates at least SOME level of insight and attention to detail) makes a claim that goes counter to your models, don't immediately leap to the assumption that they're badwrongdumbcrazy."

i.e. I recognize that my earlier statement was pattern-matchable (hence, "Which is certainly a fair position to take, on priors"), but in the ideal world I would expect people to take a breath and push back against their /own/ pattern-matching, in a context like "on a subreddit about rationality." /Oh, the author of r!Animorphs is saying this? Huh. I'm curious/ (rather than dismissive).

Ultimately, no harm, no foul, but I think I'll save my lengthy justifications of my positions for another day and another post. In the meantime, feel free to interpret that as incremental evidence against me actually having a valid point, but hold that skepticism itself lightly.
