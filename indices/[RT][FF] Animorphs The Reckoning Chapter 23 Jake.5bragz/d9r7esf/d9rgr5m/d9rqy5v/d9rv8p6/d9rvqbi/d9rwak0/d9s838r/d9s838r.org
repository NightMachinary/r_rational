Turns out I'm /not/ saving my lengthy justifications for another day. Huh. The things we'll do to distract ourselves from distracting current events.

HAHA I EXCEEDED THE MAX LENGTH AND HAD TO BREAK IT OUT INTO MULTIPLE REPLIES TO MYSELF.

Content warning: long, braggy, navel-gazing, possibly insufferable (by all means, hold me responsible for it, but don't act /surprised/ by it)

I'm going to go through your reply point by point, not because that's necessarily the best layout but because it's easiest on my brain, which is tired.

  don't really understand the world or have the decision-making skills of an adult
#+end_quote

The main crux here, I think, isn't actually whether kids are bad at making decisions and understanding the world around them, it's whether adults are any /better./ My answer is emphatically no (I'm tempted to point at the American elections going on right now as definitive, and stop there).

The key mistake I claim "the system" is making is confusing the /mean/ of the normal-ish curve with the /range/ of the normal-ish curve. Here's a [[https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-5RbgXTBMXfsvQZ_YQhumw.png][sinfully unitless graph]] that I made as part of a long post laying this out in more detail one time. Thirteen-year-olds (and sixteen, and eighteen, and twenty-one, etc.) have still-developing frontal lobes, yes, and this is a real handicap. But the vast majority of people /with/ fully developed frontal lobes exhibit a commonplace mixture of having poorly trained them and refusing to use them.

Ultimately, I have /never/ seen a kid make a mistake that I haven't also seen adults make, and I've seen a number of children who I trust as much as the most trustworthy adults I know. It's like betting on marbles coming out of a bag---sure, if you're betting on a person and all you know is "tween," your safe bet is "immature/irresponsible/dumb." But that's almost-as-true if all you know is "adult," too, and it's also /not at all the same thing/ as saying that a /given/ kid is incapable of outperforming adults in perception and judgment. When you factor out the smugness of self-congratulatory adults who downplay all of their bad decisions and highlight all of their luck and prowess, I think you end up with /kids = D-/ and /adults = D+/, which is a heck of a lot less of a difference than most adults are comfortable even /considering,/ let alone admitting.

(As I type this, I'm thinking of six different people, all currently under the age of eighteen, who I'd rather lend my car to than half of my coworkers, in part because they /haven't yet convinced themselves that they're hot shit./ I'm also thinking of the sum total of /all/ the people I've met while they were under eighteen, and I'm only /slightly/ more comfortable lending my car to any randomly selected person from /all/ the people I've met while they were over eighteen.)

  Your memories "deliberately preserved" means that you've remembered them over and over? Because as I understand it, memories tend to get telephone-gamed and lose their accuracy each time you remember them.
#+end_quote

Not to keep beating a dead horse, but here's where a little bit of good faith could have gone a long way. Of all of the possible disambiguations of the phrase "deliberately preserved," you chose possibly the /least/ flattering and defensible one, as a sort of strawman, and then proceeded to (correctly) point out its straw nature.

I did /not/ know about the (as far as I know, uncontroversially true) telephone nature of memories, when I was little. But I lucked out, in that I have something like a one-in-three-hundred (made up number) aptitude for quotes. I remember exact quotes unusually well, think in quotes a lot, and tend to rehearse strings (and preserve them unchanged as confirmed by checks of objective records such as old letters and emails and going back to source material). e.g. if you read me any ~10 consecutive words of the book Ender's Game out loud, I have something like an 85% hit rate on telling you where in the book we are, who's present, and what's going on.

All of that is background for the statement that my confidence in my deliberately preserved memories is significantly more objective than the easily-available strawman: true, I rederive and reinvent my memories just as much as anybody, but they come along with a background (and MUCH more stable/lower-rate-of-mutation) library of remembered-quotations-in-context. I can refer to specific thoughts I had as far back as first grade, and note their complexity, the degree to which they do or do not synch up with my adult perspective on the situation, etc. etc. I can evaluate them against present-my reactions to the same sort of stimuli, and compare the degree to which I do or don't endorse my earlier framing and responses.

And what I've found is---yeah, I missed things, and yeah, I was dumb. But the /reasoning processes/ that I was using were sound, and overwhelmingly resemble my current processes---my current processes are, in essence, those nascent processes + more nuanced information and improved heuristics. Furthermore, I have "messages from the past" that lead me to be confident that my close friends (at least) were operating on basically the same level, at basically the same quality-of-thought.

Now. I was pretty strongly right-tail (valedictorian, perfect SAT, shipped off to a nerd boarding school, etc.), but that brings us to the other half of the anecdotal evidence, which is my experience as a teacher.

  For your interactions with students, you probably have a bit of confirmation bias happening because it's a deeply held belief.
#+end_quote

I've been teaching since I was 14, including something like ten years of Tae Kwon Do, three years of public school sixth grade, six years of parkour, and a year of adult rationality education (overlapping). In that time, I got to have significant interactions with somewhere a little lower than a thousand kids between the ages of eight and fifteen (which is my revealed "main character" age preference).

I'm going to go ahead and /completely agree/ with the statement "a bit of confirmation bias." I'd expect my responses to be skewed something like 5-10 percentage points off from reality, which seems to me to fit with the word "bit." But my claim is that everyone else is /more/ skewed, on the other side.
