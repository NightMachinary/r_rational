I've noticed that same thing, but I think just like SA says, it's because the memories are getting hijacked by rose-tinted glasses. I remember the good grades, the fun I had in class, etc, but when I try and remember how at lunch I used to sit in the toilets the whole time and that I was so angsty that I was using the fact that highschool wasn't going to last much longer as /reasons not to seriously contemplate suicide/, I can sort of reality check my way back out of it.

I never had the inclination to attempt to "calibrate" my memories or impressions.

I find it weird that someone who had a terrible time in high school might somehow forget it. Like, I /know/ I had a terrible time, I know it was hard for me, and I don't see how much fond memories of having no responsibility so I could roleplay on MSN every single night can make me forget that. Or maybe I'm too young (28) to forget that. Or maybe "terrible time in high school" is too much a part of my identity for me to allow myself to forget it.
