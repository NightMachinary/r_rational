I think everything you've said here is true, but I /also/ think that upper-quartile kids can be brought to near-adult levels of emotional maturity pretty quickly and easily, except that people often don't bother to /try/.

Like, there's usually a lot of generally-agreed-to-be-more-important stuff that needs to be covered, and the assumption is that they'll just ... get the emotional maturity stuff as they grow older, but if you actually have the luxury of making it a /part/ of your curriculum, it does indeed work for a large minority.

I also envy the adults around you, where you can just say "do the thing" and they'll get it done. I've found I have to put 70% as much scaffolding for grownups as for eleven-year-olds, and basically identical amounts for fourteen-year-olds and adults. Maybe I need a new social circle, or less death-by-lowered-expectations on my peers.
