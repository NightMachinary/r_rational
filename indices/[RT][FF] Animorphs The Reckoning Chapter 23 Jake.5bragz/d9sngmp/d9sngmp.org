Another excellent chapter.

Loved to see the characters reactions to Ax, managed to both surprise me while remaining fully in character. Big theme of cooperation vs. defection going on in the last few chapters. But I like that 100% cooperation is not being depicted as super good, and hyper viglant paranoia isnt the position either.

Thoughts:

- Why not give Tom morph capability now? They need every pair of hands they can get and hes 100% on their side.

- Chee are going further and further into blue/orange morality territory, not just hyper pacifist. I wonder if a blackmail situation like in the last book of canon is feasible, probably not given they are so smart. The "censor" discussed in the interlude reminds me a lot of the way the minds worked in Max Harm's excellent Crystal Society. Especially their limiting of information makes a big difference. We cannot be sure of anything they have been saying to the protagonists that has not been explicitly confirmed in their internal monologue. Its very possible they know far more than they are letting on. [Given their tech it would be easy for them to have people on the yeerk ships. And I wouldn't be surprised given the canon connection with ellimist if they know more about the war in heaven than any of the characters. Elfanger and V3 were able to notice it in only one lifetime, they've been active for thousands of years and seem to be exponentially more intelligent. ]

- "Whoever is in charge of china now" Has [[/r/tk17studios]] ever confirmed is this takes place at the present time or the same time as the original. Or a fuzzy 20 minutes in the future?

- Animorphs are still reacting to situations not being proactive.
