I'm a few chapters back, but I'' wondering if the yeerk morph limitation has been addressed? My pet theory is that the false yeerk tissue that allows the morphed to control the morph immediately induces a reproductive response in the yeerk. Since they reproduce via fusion and grub splitting, it's the only explanation I can think of.
