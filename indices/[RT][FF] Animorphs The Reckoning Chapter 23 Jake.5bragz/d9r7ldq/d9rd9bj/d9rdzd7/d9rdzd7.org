Thanks! I'm just past the big mission, and looking forward to seeing more. I actually tweeted out a screenshot of the "AK-47s don't weigh much." Section to KAA. She liked my suggestion for mods to the story in a hypothetical new TV adaptation a few weeks ago. Maybe she'll get a kick. I'm seriously impressed by this story. Like I said, I was thinking about how the whole series is low on making sense, and stumbled upon this work that rights all of its errors. And explores interesting alternatives/what would happen if there was no act of plot to make people be stupid for no reason.

Seems like you're the author, and I'd love to read your original work if you have any. And, if you're ever interested, I'd love to collaborate on a story in a world I've been building on my own for a long time. Your approach to the material makes me think you'd be super valuable in helping tighten the concept and create a compelling motivation, which has eluded me. I like world-building but have trouble when I start pulling at threads.
