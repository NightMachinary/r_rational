I feel this is out of character for a highschooler to know about.

I'm seeing the Vanarx in this chapter as well. It's just that how Jake sees it is different from Esplin, and his solution is also different.

  “Order and chaos,” said the creature. “Unity and harmony. Silence and noise. A fundamental conflict of values.”

I think Jake is going for harmony and noise - everyone voicing their own ideas to have a result that forms a harmony, like a choir. Esplin, unity (under himself, of course) and silence, with his voice being the only one speaking. The ironic thing is that they're facing the same enemy. But anyway - Jake's chosen a side now, and it remains to be seen whether that's C or E's. Canon would say E, but who knows...

  Beyond that, the Chee didn't know where they'd ended up, since Rictic had stayed on the scene to take care of Tobias. The blue centaur pseudolite had also gone off radar, presumably to some government black site where it was being interviewed around the clock while waiting for the President, Putin, and whoever was in charge of China these days.

Well, the Chee are /definitely/ lying about this then.
