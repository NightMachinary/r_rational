I'm just very, very verbal, and I read and write sentences in a flowy, rhythmic, syllables-matter sort of way. Like, often I'll be writing a sentence, and I'll know that the next word is "anger" or whatever, but it needs to be four syllables, not two, so I'll dig through my thesaurus and brainstorm phrases until I find something that fits the bill. That kind of thing. It's all very read-aloud-y, and when I'm getting back into the flow of writing, I have to rewrite the previous couple of paragraphs to pick up on the rhythm.

I even think in terms of things like changes-in-tone-of-voice when breaking one person's thought up with an interruption, or whatever. I use the em dash (---) so much because it's easy to see and anticipate as you're reading ... you see it coming, so your brain prepares itself for a shift in pace and tone.
