  Okay, so they strike at the factory, take it out, and then what? I mean, what would Visser 3 even want with the factory?

Specifically, what's different about this factory in particular that makes it viable Yeerk food?

1. Does literally any oatmeal work? Does any maple and ginger oatmeal work? Does it have to be treated with a particular coloring or preservative that Ralph's uses?
2. Does replicating the Ralph's oatmeal work? They might not get the right proportions for good-tasting oatmeal, but the ingredients lists are on store shelves across the country, and the production methods are in the minds of the factory workers for the Yeerks to extract.

I'm going with either the factory is a secret Silat/Yeerk research facility, where they did a chemical analysis of Kandrona and decided to add it to factory outputs, or they're not going to succeed in their larger mission to stop the production.
