Okay, so they strike at the factory, take it out, and then what? I mean, what would Visser 3 even want with the factory? It'd be simpler to just have the agents the Yeerks have on Earth buy the stuff off the shelf, and if they only have a few sleeper agents worldwide they could supplement the Ralph's Oatmeal with discreet supply drops of synthetic oatmeal from the poolship.

The unanswered question here is....what the hell was Silat (the pool mentioned that was split off) for? I suspect the sleeper agents on Earth are from that separate pool, it'd make sense that if the Visser was doing memetic contamination protocols he'd also compartmentalize Earth-side operations. Maybe the Animorphs will end up meeting Silat when they assault the oatmeal factory?

Would also like a POV from President Tyaagi if possible soon, or with our intrepid Secret Service agent pretending to be the President. The thought-speak possiblities are endless.
