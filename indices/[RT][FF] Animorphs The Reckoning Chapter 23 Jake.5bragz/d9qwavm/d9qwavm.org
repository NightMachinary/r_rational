Slow-paced, zero-action, deeply intense chapter. I love it. I love all the "they know that we know that they know" psychology. I'm impressed with Jake, the whole no-more-cowboying thing can only be a good thing. And of course it helps that we've been inside Ax' head and seen how much the isolation was fucking with him, but I believe in Axrash. I did not think Jake might come around to that point of view for a long time, never mind dragging Marco with him, and still being smart about it.

That being said, can't wait to smash up an oatmeal factory next time.
