Ender's Game (9.8/10): the gold standard

Ender's Shadow (9/10): the ... silver standard? Very good, in an only-somewhat-different way

Speaker for the Dead (7/10): entirely different genre; read if you like philosophical musings on personhood and an interestingly realistic (in some ways) take on First Contact.

Xenocide (sequel to Speaker)(7/10): read if you liked Speaker AND if you like metaphysical musings and power plays by individuals influencing large civilizations.

Children of the Mind (sequel to Xenocide)(6/10): read if you want to resolve cliffhangers from Xenocide (they were originally one book that got split) and for completeness if you want to link back up for the final, as-yet-unwritten book.

--------------

Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Giant (sequel to Shadow)(5/10 on their own, 7/10 taken as a single "book"): read if you always wanted a Tom Clancy knockoff of how Peter Wiggin took over the world, or if you liked Bean being a smartass and wanted MORE.

Shadows in Flight (sequel to Shadow of the Giant)(8/10): read if you want an interesting take on the consequences of previous books and for completeness if you want to link back up for the final, as-yet-unwritten book.

--------------

Formic war books (2/10): read if you like badly plotted and remarkably poorly characterized Earth-centric invasion stories that shoehorn in characters the same way the Phantom Menace did.

--------------

Ender in Exile (takes place DURING the end of Ender's Game)(bimodal distribution 2/10 and 10/10): read this last, if at all, and IFF you feel, at this point, like Ender is an old friend you haven't heard from in a while, and you'd like to shed some tears at your reunion. Contains a rapid rollercoaster/whiplash back-and-forth between the crushingly sublime and WTF, Orson Scott Card, don't you even know who your characters are??? Moderately requires Bean's books as a prequel, but only for the parts that kind of suck anyway.

You're not going to get ENDER'S GAME out of any of these books; it's like Chuck Palahniuk and Fight Club. I'd say that if you like the first third of Speaker, it's worth following that through to the end, and if you like Shadow of the Hegemon, it's /mostly/ worth following that through to the end. I'd choose which to start with based on whether you liked Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow more.
