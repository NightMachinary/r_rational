My evidence here is essentially just "results." By treating kids as if they were autonomous, responsible, intelligent agents, I was able to /elicit/ said behavior, from a plurality of my students. I was able to get them to do things like stay focused and diligent with no adults in the room, tackle complex interpersonal problems without becoming defensive or writing off their opponent, give and receive feedback and successfully use it to iterate, think through and solve complex design problems when given woefully insufficient input, etc. etc. I was able to get them to do these things at a higher (though not ridiculously higher) rate than my fellow teachers, and (perhaps most tellingly) I was able to witness the /same kids/ underperform when led by an adult who thought they were stupid or irresponsible.

(No double blind, unfortunately, but we did kid swaps, lesson plan swaps, and room swaps, and ruled out room, subject, and subset of kids as possible explanations for the ~30% differential in results of a day's lesson between my class and the class across the hall).

I'd expect that my confirmation bias is creeping in /here./ Like, I'd expect that even after doing a solemn, careful, mature confirmation bias correction, I'm /still/ overplaying the highlights and underplaying disconfirming counterexamples. I'd say that I've ratcheted down my claims and confidence by ten percent, and that a savvy outside observer should probably do that again. But simply by /approaching eleven-year-olds as if they were Jakes and Marcos,/ I got consistently, noticeably, dramatically more Jakeish and Marcoish behavior out of them. Ditto in parkour, where I had kids younger than the Animorphs performing skills that were literally do-or-die, and performing them sanely, responsibly, and with a zero-percent failure rate (when it mattered; not talking about bumps and bruises). With maybe 30 hours of training, I got a batch of 12-15 year old coach candidates to step up and plan and run classes of ~10 adults, completely on their own, with quality that exceeded the average adult coach's quality (though it didn't come close to the /best/ adult coach's quality). In my work as the curriculum director at the Center for Applied Rationality, I have yet to come across a /single concept or technique/ that can be taught to thirty-year-old adults and /not/ to a 90th-percentile tween (and with basically the same amount of investment in time, words, etc.).

(and I've only just now remembered that I've made, not one, not two, but /three/ thirteen-year-olds swap seats with me in a car, first on empty country roads, then through the suburbs, then eventually out onto highways and through city streets.)

Note that I'm not making claims about *all kids* so much as I'm making claims about *the existence of* kids like Jake and Marco, and on the second level, about just how rare they are. The two (most extreme, sort of straw) versions of the null hypothesis that I'm fighting against are:

- No kids manage competence at the level of adults (because of e.g. frontal lobe development).
- Kids who manage competence at the level of adults are somewhere between one in a thousand and one in a million.

The former is straight-up false; counterexamples findable anywhere for people who are looking for them in good faith, /especially/ once you factor in just how horribly adults are doing overall---

(checks election progress)

---and the latter I definitely thought might be true when I had only myself to look at (though given the existence and popularity of a book like Ender's Game, I was still pretty confident it was false), but in the intervening years, I've sought out sufficient proof that unless there's some crazy coincidence going on or I'm fooling myself by an order of magnitude AND ALSO all of my colleagues in four separate disciplines have failed to call me on it, people like Jake and Marco come along two or three times out of every /hundred/, not once every thousand or million.

It all boils down to whether you're comparing the hump or the tails. Stuff like children being prone to poor decisionmaking, or higher death rates among young males, gives clear data on the humps, but through availability bias and question substitution, it causes a good many well-meaning adults to be /extremely infuriating toward/ (and to permanently curtail the potential growth of) a good many highly-promising kids.

(I have a second essay-length rant about /why/ adults insist on forgetting what it was like to be their younger selves---why there are strong social and emotional incentives for adults to pooh-pooh their childhood thought processes and distance themselves from their early embarrassing failures---but I'll save that for another day (or maybe never).)

  they're inexperienced, immature, impulsive and oblivious to those facts.

Yeah, but the "they" in that sentence is /humans,/ not children specifically. My tagline, as a teacher and as a person-who-wants-to-force-multiply-good-people: I treat everyone like children, because I treat children like humans.

(oh God, these kids are going to get us all killed)

*edit: forgot to include relevant data from my cogsci reading. Simple shorthand: somewhere between 11 and 13, most people make a final shift into "ability to grok these memes." An easy example is that if you try to get fourth graders, seventh graders, and college students to answer symbolic logic questions, the fourth graders will suck, the college students will be kinda decent, and the seventh graders will be all over the place. But if you precede the test with a straightforward explanation on how symbolic logic works, the fourth graders and the college students are unchanged, but the seventh graders become basically indistinguishable from the college students.

(obviously some hit this transition early, and some never hit it)

I posit that there's a similar thing going on with a lot of relevant decisionmaking ability, frontal lobes be damned---that the right environment and education dominates over brain chemistry. I can think of easy confounds (like maybe all my examples were in the upper quartile genetically to begin with), but it's a principle I've seen borne out. Kids under ten gotta be /conscripted/ into rationality; for them, it's a religion. But by the time you hit Jake/Marco age, you can actually /get/ it---you can be /recruited/ into sanity, make the choice for yourself.
