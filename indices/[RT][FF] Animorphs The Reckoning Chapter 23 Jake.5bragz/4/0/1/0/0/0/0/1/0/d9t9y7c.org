#+begin_quote
  let him go home. Bonzo had been assigned to Cartagena.
#+end_quote

Ender, in Command School, sort-of-fantasizing about throwing the game, doing badly enough that they'd wash him out and finally leave him alone. Not /super/ confident on this one; I could see it swinging between one of his moments of sullen introspection or I could see it being right before the key decision in the last battle.

#+begin_quote
  "It'll be over before I grow up,"
#+end_quote

On the shuttle (just about to get off it, actually, or maybe in the hallway just outside), when Ender's trying to figure out what the hell Graff was up to by turning all the other kids against him. Graff said something about priorities or not telling the truth and stuff being able to wait until after the war was over.

#+begin_quote
  among the rest, all became somber.
#+end_quote

Bernard is blowing up, in the launch group, and he just crossed the line somewhat with Dap, yelling over the messages Ender's been sending under pseudonyms. Dap said something along the lines of "Are you shouting at me, soldier?" and the "No" in your quote is the start of Bernard backpedaling.

#+begin_quote
  that was completely out of her control.
#+end_quote

Valentine, obvs, when she's talking to Graff. Graff's sounding her out about her relationships with Peter and Ender, and getting a handle on what Peter's been up to, and is about to say something like, "is helping Peter really all that bad/is Peter the worst person there is" and she sort of petulantly says "yes." I believe this is the conversation that ends with Val choosing to write the letter to Ender, to get him out of his funk.

#+begin_quote
  but the race as a whole can never decide
#+end_quote

"Individuals can be bred to sacrifice themselves, but the race as a whole can never decided to cease to exist." Graff, talking with Ender about the moral axis of the us-or-them decision to send a fleet after the buggers' home world and colony systems. Ender says something along the lines of "I'd rather survive," which is evidence that the months on the lake and the talk with Valentine put him on the path to recovery.

#+begin_quote
  Either the teachers had been kind to him after all, or he
#+end_quote

Ender, musing on the prowess of his soldiers. Either the teachers had been kind to him after all, or he was a better teacher than he'd thought. He goes on to think about how his veterans, "utterly without honor" in their previous armies, had "blossomed into capable leaders," so much so that instead of the usual four toons, he'd created five.

#+begin_quote
  under him, straight toward the opposite wall, flashing between his legs
#+end_quote

Don't think I'm going to get this one; unusually generic. I can narrow it down to a few places---it could be his very first experience with his launch group, or it could be one of the Bean perspective moments, or it could be the time that Ender was forced to kamikaze by Rose de Nose. I'll look this one up afterward, because I feel like I'll kick myself once I know.

#+begin_quote
  the officers' quarters; finally they came to where Graff
#+end_quote

I'm thinking this is when Anderson brought Ender to see Graff, after like a week of battles? Ender eventually says something about not really getting a fair fight, and Graff says "you're getting one now," and this is the battle where Bonzo's army got advance warning and is arranged around the door. I think this is the same conversation where Graff asks Ender why he's watching the Bugger vids.

#+begin_quote
  "What's the worst that could happen? You lose /one/ game."
#+end_quote

Bean, to Ender, as Ender's recruiting him to run the secret, sixth toon. They're in Ender's quarters. Ender says yeah, that /is/ the worst thing that could happen, he can't lose /any/ games, because if he loses one---and then he trails off, and Bean is left wondering, what? What would happen? That the legend would die? That the adults would lose faith? There's a long pause, and then Ender says that he needs Bean to be clever.

#+begin_quote
  and everyone settled into the new pattern.
#+end_quote

"Bernard sulked for a few days, and then he was fine, and everyone settled into the new pattern." The new pattern being the whole "Alai was the bridge" thing ... Ender solved the Bernard problem by making neither of them the alpha, and Alai almost unanimously got voted as the head of their launch group, then <quote>. This is just after the battle in the practice room where Ender and Alai came together, and then invited Bernard and Shen and together they slaughtered everybody else.

So, ordering your ten quotes temporally, I've got ...

2, 3, 10, 4, 6, 8, 9, 5, 1, with number 7 being a big question mark.

How'd I do? I note that in my previous tests, I overlooked the fact that humans don't actually choose a random string of ten consecutive words ... most people have read me complete lines, and this was harder (but a fun challenge).

**Edit: AW, I'M SUCH AN IDIOT. THAT WAS BEAN ANSWERING HIS QUESTION ABOUT "AND HOW DO WE ATTACK?" AND THEN BEAN'S LIKE, FUCK IT, I CAN'T ANSWER THIS IN WORDS, AND THEN ENDER'S ALL, "IS BEAN THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW?" SO ICONIC. SO OBVIOUS.
