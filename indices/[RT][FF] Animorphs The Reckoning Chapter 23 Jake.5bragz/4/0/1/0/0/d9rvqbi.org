I apologize for failing to provide benefit of the doubt. I'm usually very "force the point and see if their response contains valuable data". It's part of my aspergeryness. Allow me to rephrase: Memory alteration and confirmation bias are logical explanations for what you've described, thus far. And they have the benefit of being consistent with all observations pointing to children/young adults being prone to unwise choices that their elders are rarely subject to. (The young, young men in particular, are prone to death by misadventure of all types at high rates. Unplanned pregnancies spike among teenagers. Etc. Etc. Etc.) Since you've provided vague anecdotes and that can be dismissed by appeal to easily-overlooked and very common cognitive biases, your argument either requires sinificant clarification to coalesce around a valid contention, or can be dismissed as false out of hand.

I admit that I initially defaulted to the latter, but again, this is borne out of a habit of debating on the Internet with the thought of /winning/ or being /crushed/ and using the rubble as aggregate to form a more stable idea later. Crush away.
