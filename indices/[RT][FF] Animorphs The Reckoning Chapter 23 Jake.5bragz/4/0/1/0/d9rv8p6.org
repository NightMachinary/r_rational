Ah, so---I note that I replied with anecdotal evidence, and your reply is "your evidence isn't evidence." Which is certainly a fair position to take, on priors, but also doesn't exactly make me feel like taking the time to clarify and convince. You don't seem to be starting from a place that lends me the benefit of the doubt and assumes that I've maybe, y'know, read some child development psychology books and done explicit, objective checks of my assumptions, etc. etc.

I do like your point about them learning from osmosis, though. That's outstanding.
