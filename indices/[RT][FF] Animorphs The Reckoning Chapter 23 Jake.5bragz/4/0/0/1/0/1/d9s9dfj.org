I think the major weakness is that your writing style (while absolutely amazing!) lends itself to completely mature characters, and doesn't really communicate their immaturity as much, giving your characters a /perceived/ higher maturity and intelligence than they actually have.

That said, I still stand with my initial thought that those qualities which set them apart are probably why Esplin chose them as his chess pieces.
