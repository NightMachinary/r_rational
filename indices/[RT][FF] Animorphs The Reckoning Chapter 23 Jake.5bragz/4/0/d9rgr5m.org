I have a pretty strong conviction re: the intelligence and personhood of younger teens, that comes from my own deliberately-preserved memories of that period of my life and has been borne out and supported in my personal experiences as a teacher. Essentially, my readers /always/ rate my characters as being 2-6 years older than their stated age, and I /always/ respond with "I think you have forgotten what it was to be thirteen." It's similar to the complaints OSC talks about in the foreward to Ender's Game.

Caveats, of course---not all kids are particularly sophisticated, and not all kids who /are/ sophisticated express it all the time (I have some typical mind fallacy from being way right-tail as a kid). But I think the r!Animorphs, as written, are only two standard deviations above the mean, not three or four or five. I think I'm representing a side of thirteen-year-olds that adults don't often /see,/ because kids conform to adult expectations and adults usually pretty clearly telegraph "I don't trust you because you're not mature/smart/capable."

This crops up in my original work, too, where the two main characters are twelve and accused of being sixteen. But---THIS IS MY HILL, I SHALL DIE ON IT.
