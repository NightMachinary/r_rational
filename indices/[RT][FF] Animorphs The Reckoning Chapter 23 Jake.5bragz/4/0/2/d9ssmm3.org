I work with really smart kids a lot at the moment [won't say any more to keep identities seperate, but feel free to PM me specific questions]

I tihnk you are right in some respect that kids are smarter than people take them for on average (at least in the 12-18 range) but I have come to think they people underestimate teh extent to which adult emotional maturity and ability to cope with situations makes a difference.

For example I recently had a student who I had come to quite like personally absolutely freak out at what, to me, would seem like a very small setback, making angry social media posts. Blaming everyone, saying they were quitting forever, etc etc. This lasted for several days and then they calmed down. Whether this is due to teenagers being innately more emotional, or not having as much experience fo setbacks, is hard to tell. But it makes a massive difference in their ability to get shit done. Ender isn't realistic because he's smart, he's unrealistic because he doesn't break down crying every few pages.

More generally I think children benefit from structure and organisation much more than adults. With an adult I can say "do the thing" with a student I have to build scaffolding around it.
