Since my first guess was wrong, my second guess is that Silat is currently growing in North Korea. It makes sense, it's an isolated country, and while it's not actually 1984 levels of crazy (contrary to popular opinion), the highly secretive nature of the upper eschelons of the country make easy to take over the entire country by infecting just a few tens of thousands of elite, most of whom happen to be concentrated in just one city (Pyongyang).

It'd also be easy to hide manufacturing facilities in the already existing secret missile component factories scattered around the country.
