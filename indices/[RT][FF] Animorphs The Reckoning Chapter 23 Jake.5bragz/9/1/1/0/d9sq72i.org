I think your last point is probably the right one, on further thought. It makes sense. What's the opposite of curiosity and cooperation? Indifference. If harnessed right by Esplin, that means that he has a pool that will listen to him and mostly not care about anything else. Done right he now has a personal supply of Kandrona separate from what the Yeerk Empire originally granted him, along with a loyal minion with which he can flee if the war starts going poorly or he finds himself alienated from the wider Yeerk command structure.

The only issue is where Silat is located? On Mars running the hidden factory Esplin was visiting in his interlude? It can't be on the poolship itself because Telor resides there.
