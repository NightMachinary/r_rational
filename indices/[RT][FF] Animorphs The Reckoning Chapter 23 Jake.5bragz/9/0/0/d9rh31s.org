Probably this is going to be left at least a little bit "magic." It's a port from canon, in which there was a single flavor from a single brand that did the thing (with serious side effects). The Yeerks certainly would've been doing work to try to isolate the "active" ingredients, but I'm imagining it wasn't their highest priority and it's plausible they didn't get very far. Note also that it's not a /good/ Kandrona substitute---it's low-efficacy and requires a high dosage, so it's possible that replicants wouldn't even be worth how much you'd have to eat or whatever.

As for buying the stuff off the shelf, if only they had, like, a hundred thousand allies they could use to clean out the existing supply all at once ...
