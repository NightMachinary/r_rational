I've recently read [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5170/Project%3A-Sunflower][Project: Sunflower]]. It's an MLP "human in Equestria" story, and I think it fits "rational" criteria reasonably well. It's not rationalist, though. The protagonist is nominally a scientist, but the scientific exploration doesn't come up too much (almost not at all). Transhumanistic implications of nanotechnology are acqnowledged, but not dwelled upon. There's no universe-breaking munchkining. There is greater conflict, but the focus of the story, really, is more on the "slice of life", interactions between humans and ponies. But anyway, if you're interested in a reasonably sane "human in Equestria" story, I think you may like this one. Also there's an incomplete sequel which I haven't read (for the reason that it's incomplete, I'll wait until it's done), and which may or may not explore transhumanism and scientific exploration of Equestria more.

There's also another sane "human in Equestria" story I found in the comments here some time ago, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in][Celestia Sleeps In]]. This one has a distinction that the author seems to take research seriously almost to a ridiculous degree, and described the first contact in detail (in /Project: Sunflower/ Aliens Speak English).
