I haven't read "The March North" yet, but they are both self-contained stories and you could start either one without too much confusion (well the stories ARE confusing, but that's a byproduct of writing about a setting where eldritch abominations are common). I recommend just starting with the one where the summary is more interesting to you.

If it helps, the themes in March is about magical military and Succession is about learning magic and growing up into something hopefully vaguely human.
