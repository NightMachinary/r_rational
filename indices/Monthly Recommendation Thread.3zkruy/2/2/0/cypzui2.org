Out of Karkadinn's works, I loved /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307536][Rewind]]/ (read twice) and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3987276][Parentheses]]/ (read twice), greatly enjoyed /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3326179][Doppelganger Non Grata]]/ (read twice), and liked /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4659584][Robin Has a Heart Attack]]/ (read once). I don't think I've glanced at the other stories in quite a while, but I may take a second look at them at some point in the future.
