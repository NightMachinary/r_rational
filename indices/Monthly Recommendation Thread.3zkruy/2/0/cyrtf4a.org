I don't mean to demean your efforts but recommendation wikis tend to not work well. All recs are given equal space / weight and none ever get deleted even if only one person thinks the recommendation makes sense. If there's a system for people to click an Agree or Disagree button for the rec it would work better. Obviously that's vulnerable to manipulation but it's an improvement.
