I'm currently reading (for the second time) /[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898][Look to the West]]/, an alternate-history book being written as a compilation of excerpts from various history books. (See also /[[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966][The Shape of Things to Come]]/.)

[[/r/NarutoFanfiction][r/NarutoFanfiction]] recently gained [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/wiki/index][a recommendation wiki]] in the style of TV Tropes. So far, no one other than me (aside from the moderators) has bothered to edit it (it's a very small subreddit...), so two-thirds of the current entries were added by me.

My most-played video game (according to Steam), at over one thousand hours, is /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/236850][Europa Universalis IV]]/ (see also [[/r/EU4][r/EU4]]), a "grand-strategy" game that allows the player to control any country in the world (not just in Europe, despite the name) between about 1400 and 1800. Like the other games developed by [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/720][the same company]] (see also [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]]), EU4 is /extremely/ mod-friendly--most files are in plain text--and there are many complex modifications that improve the historical accuracy of the somewhat-simplistic base game, from [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180557557][Dei Gratia]] (/inter alia/, adds simulation of religious minorities in every province and drastically overhauls the Protestant Reformation) to [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434940442][Lex Talionis II]] (primarily, adds simulation of dynastic politics in every country) to [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234109254][MEIOU & Taxes]] (a massive compilation that includes Dei Gratia and many other items). The game is somewhat expensive when [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions][the full list of more-or-less-indispensable expansions]] is considered, but all except the most recent one go on sale with reasonable regularity.

I have no objection to self-promotion. If it's annoying, it'll be downvoted and ignored.

I have no strong opinions on the recurrence interval of this thread.
