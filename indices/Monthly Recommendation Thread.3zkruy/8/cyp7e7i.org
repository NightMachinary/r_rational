I already made a thread but Let me ask here again.

I'm in search of some fiction when they take a setting with extremely silly elements (Doom, DUngeon Keeper) and change to make il logical / consistent.

In meantime will recommend fimbulwinter by the author of Time Braid. A guy in the falls in fantasy setting and get powerful very fast. Have Harem elements.
