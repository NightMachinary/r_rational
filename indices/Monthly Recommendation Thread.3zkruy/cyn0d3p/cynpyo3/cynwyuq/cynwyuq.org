I find EU4 + [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/839][M&T]] just as fun as CK2 + [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/845][HIP]], myself. (I haven't played either of the vanilla games in years!) Just be sure to revert EU4 to the previous major version with Steam's "beta" functionality and play EU4 1.13.2 (/Common Sense/ expansion) + M&T 1.21.12, rather than trying to deal with the still-very-buggy EU4 1.14.4 (/The Cossacks/ expansion) + M&T 1.22.02.

Recently, though, I've just been using the =observe= console command to watch games unfold, rather than playing as a country myself. (I'm quite a n00b, so I only ever play as Castile or the Mamluks in EU4...)
