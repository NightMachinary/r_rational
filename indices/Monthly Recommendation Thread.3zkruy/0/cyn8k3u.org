I think self-promotion should be allowed as long as it's admitted, and monthly recommendation threads seem sufficient.

--------------

I'd be remiss if I didn't first recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][To the Stars]]. It's an intelligent sci-fi fanfiction of Madoka Magica, which was already a serious (slightly) sci-fi take on the "Magical Girl" genre of shows. (You don't have to know anything about Madoka Magica to read it.) If you've been on this subreddit you've probably seen a chapter update posted or perhaps a link to [[/r/TotheStars]], which I help run, and which has a summary and a host of relevant links in the sidebar. If you're wondering whether or not to take the plunge, I'll say this: To the Stars has one of the best fictional universes out there. It takes a creative blend of magic and technology and builds a deep world out of their interplay. The details are thought through and there's a wealth of forces and powerful actors working hard to reshape the world anew. The only downside is that when you come out the other end deeply invested in the characters and story you'll have to wait patiently for updates as To the Stars is still ongoing. That said... just do it!

The second thing I'd like to recommend is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4121383/chapters/9290023]["The Trial of Darth Vader"]], which follows an alternate universe where Darth Vader survives his apparent redemption and is brought back as a prisoner to the Rebel Alliance by Luke. It's a pretty thoughtful take on both the ethical questions surrounding a man like Darth Vader and the difficulty the remains of the Empire and the Rebels would have in attempting to answer them. It's technically incomplete, but there's only one more chapter to go and it updates fairly frequently.

Edit: Last chapter was just posted.
