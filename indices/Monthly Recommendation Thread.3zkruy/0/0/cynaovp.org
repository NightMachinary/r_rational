I'm about to dive into The Trail of Darth Vader now. A theme I see far to often in redemption of evil characters is that after they are saved they die. The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath][Redemption Equals Death]] trope always felt like an easy way out from a story telling perspective. Not having to address the what to do with someone who has committed atrocities but is truly and fully redeemed, or whether someone like that can ever be truly and fully redeemed.
