There should be an index of previous recommendation threads as well as a master recommendation thread for like, the opening, as this subreddit is comprised of a lot of consistent users they won't recommend the same thing again and again, and so the first time they comment summarises everything they've ever read prior to the monthly recommendation threads whereas each next thread is only what they read in that month.
