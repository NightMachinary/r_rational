  Are you guys against the stance of disallowing self-promotion in this thread?
#+end_quote

No I don't see a problem with that. If there's no self-promotion, how else we can first hear about the books?

#+begin_quote
  Should this thread be biweekly instead of monthly?
#+end_quote

Maybe initially as people has a lot more ideas to recommend, then as participation trails off switch to a monthly thread just like we did with challenges.

I don't have anything new that I didn't mention at some other point before now, but has anyone else here read books by Tom Holt? He's a new author that I'm interested in who's often compared to Terry Pratchett, but I'm worried that his books are full of "because PLOT!" which seems to be slightly implied from the summaries and reviews I read.

So has anyone else read them and is there any railroading?

EDIt: I almost forgot, I did have a new book to suggest. [[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_A_Succession_of_Bad_Days?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ][A Succession of Bad Days]] by Graydon Saunders. It's a really interesting book about how a world could look with a lot of horrific magical abominations, eldritch creatures from the beyond, and power mad wizards wandering around. It's a very grim setting but the book is focused on a group of late-blooming wizard-students are attempting to figure out a better way to do things and to help everyone without wizardly protection, rather than merely focusing on protesting only people in their in-group. [[http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1327901980?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1][Here's]] a review which better explains why the book is so interesting better than I can.

It's a rather obscure book, since I literally cannot find it anywhere other then on Google Play which also has a $2 off sale right now. I should also warn that it's a rather dense book and he covers a lot very quickly.

It's actually the second in a series, but they are both self-contained stories set in the same setting and I haven't read the first one yet. [[https://play.google.com/store/books/author?id=Graydon+Saunders][Here's]] a list of books by Graydon Saunders.
