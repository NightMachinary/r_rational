  /Branches on the Tree of Time/ (I have no interest in Terminator stuff and only saw the first two movies; still worth it?)
#+end_quote

Absolutely. It's a much better treatment of the franchise compared to everything that came after the first two movies.

#+begin_quote
  /Shadows of the Limelight/ (Looks interesting, but I haven't seen it pitched here much)
#+end_quote

It's an excellently crafted story with a very interesting setting. Lots of action scenes revolving around characters using their powers in creative ways. I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel or other stories set in the same setting.

  /Ra/ (Started reading this long before I found this sub, lost my place after the first couple of chapters and never went back)
#+end_quote

It's pretty good, although the author admits that he sort of wrote himself into a hole along the way. The story goes through a lot of surprising twists and turns, and I don't want to reveal anything further for the sake of spoilers.

#+begin_quote
  /Weaver Nine/ (Read Worm a year or two ago, don't recall all the details; do I need to reread it before tackling this?)
#+end_quote

Haven't read this (or Worm) yet.
