  It's an excellently crafted story with a very interesting setting. Lots of action scenes revolving around characters using their powers in creative ways. I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel or other stories set in the same setting.

/Shadows/ is almost certainly going to get a sequel centered around one of the first illustrati of gunpowder, with characters from the first book mostly in the background, but I'm going to be writing something new and different (and a little lighter and less draining) before then.

Thanks for the kind words.
