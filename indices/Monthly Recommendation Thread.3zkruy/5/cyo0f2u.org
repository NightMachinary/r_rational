I'm sort of a rationalist fiction newbie and feel like I'm running out of things to read, so I'd love some recommendations! I've read most of the recommendations on the community wiki, with *Mother of Learning*, *Pokemon: The Origin of Species*, and *HPMOR* being my favorites. I was hoping to get some insight on what to read next of the few I haven't read:

- *Branches on the Tree of Time* (I have no interest in Terminator stuff and only saw the first two movies; still worth it?)

- *Shadows of the Limelight* (Looks interesting, but I haven't seen it pitched here much)

- *Ra* (Started reading this long before I found this sub, lost my place after the first couple of chapters and never went back)

- *Weaver Nine* (Read *Worm* a year or two ago, don't recall all the details; do I need to reread it before tackling this?)

For recommendations, I really enjoyed a manga called *Tales of Demons and Gods*. You can find it on [[http://www.mangahere.co/manga/tales_of_demons_and_gods/][mangahere.co]]. I believe it's Chinese manhua, not actually manga; anyway, only 52 chapters are translated but it's based off a light novel series so there's plenty more to draw from. It reminds me of Mother of Learning or Mushoku Tensei in that it involves a young kid being wise beyond his years due to inheriting memories of his past life.

Basic synopsis: a demon spiritualist is sent back in time to his 13-year old self and vows to right all sorts of wrongs - especially the destruction of his city and the death of his lover.

I don't think it's necessarily rationalist fiction, but the MC is more rational than most - to the point where he borders on being OP, which some may not like.

And I started reading *Set in Stone*, which you can find [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][here]]. It's very good, but I set it down a few weeks ago and haven't gone back (I think I'm on chapter 9). It's best described as "stonepunk," I believe; it's set in the future but on a world where there's hardly any metal and human development is overseen by an AI that keeps humanity from being violent or advancing too far technologically.

/Edit:/ For the questions, I'm fine with self-promotion as long as the promoters are fine with criticism. Not from me, but I'm sure some folks will pick at them. And I think monthly is better than bi-weekly; most stories don't seem to update all that often, so once a month seems plenty.
