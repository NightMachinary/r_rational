I tend to like stories that make me laugh and make me think. Here are a couple recs that met that criteria.

1. I think I stumbled upon this on SV somewhere; also it is mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2u0xw4/open_fanfiction_thread/][Open Fanfiction Thread]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]]. Great character arc for Hermione as she learns social skills in Slytherin, which makes you think about how social dominance can be a force for good or bad. Also liked that it makes Neville a main character. (Currently on chapter 8, as I just started it yesterday.)

2. [[http://www.amazon.com/Fimbulwinter-Daniel-Black-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00KZ41LHM][Daniel Black Book 1: Fumbulwinter]]. This one costs money, but you can read the first six chapters [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3198066/1/Fimbulwinter][here]]. YMMV/TW/etc, has some author tract elements with a neoreactionary flavor and contains a certain amount of BDSM as well as other sex scenes (all consensual). It is by the same author as Time Braid, and the character becomes similarly overpowered compared to those around him. My biggest complaint with this one is that the main character seems really slow on the uptake about how to exploit his powers, and the magic system comes across a little too exploitable. But he does do some smart things, the worldbuilding is interesting (if a tad exploitable), and it's entertaining enough that I ended up buying all three of the books.
