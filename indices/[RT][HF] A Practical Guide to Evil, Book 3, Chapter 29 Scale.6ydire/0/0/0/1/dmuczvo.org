Also, the strength of an aspect seems to depend a lot on how favorable the circumstances were. When Taking Rise, it was after a well earned victory against the heavens and meant stealing a ressurection she was owed. That gave her months worth of an OP healing ability.

Here, though, it was Taken from a force that opposed her winter connection, while having no circumstantial or thematic connection asside from the old trope about turning someone's power against them. That didn't even get her one full use of the ability, though the portion she got was enough for the moment. Had she tried to Take preemptively, rather than wait until the climactic moment where the power was already in play, I doubt she would have gotten anything.
