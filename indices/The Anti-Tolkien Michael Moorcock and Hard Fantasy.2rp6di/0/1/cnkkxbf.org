I'd agree but they are making a case for how Moocook was a counter revolutionary to the romance of Tolkien (romance= a good destiny draws events towards their positive outcome) and how Moorcook was different with Tragic Elric.

Bleh, these are works of two very different levels of quality if you ask me, this should be best demonstrated by the comparative time spent on them, but to quote another of my favored authors that was lambasted, that is left as an exercise for the student.
