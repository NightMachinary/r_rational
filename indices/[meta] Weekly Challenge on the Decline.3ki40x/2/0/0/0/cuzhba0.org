  I feel pretty ok about work when I'm doing it, but then I reflect on what happened to my whole fucking week and feel dismal.

I know what you mean, though I've found it useful to try and step back from the inanity and try to look at the overall utility, so I can collect my hedons.

It also helps to take a bureaucrat view, I've been a bureaucrat, so I have a very realistic (read dismally pessimistic) of how long it takes to change things for the better, but slow improvement is still improvement.

I didn't realize you worked in academia, it's one of those things I think about doing as a retirement.
