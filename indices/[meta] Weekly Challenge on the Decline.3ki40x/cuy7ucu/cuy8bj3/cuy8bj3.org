I am curious why that's a bad prompt, if it was a bad prompt, mostly so that I can avoid giving a prompt like that again. Two of what I'd consider the most influential science fiction stories of all time featured dinosaurs: /Jurassic Park/ and /A Sound of Thunder/. But I suppose I can see where it wouldn't capture the attention of a rationalist, since while they're cool or flashy, there's nothing particularly "thinky" about them.
