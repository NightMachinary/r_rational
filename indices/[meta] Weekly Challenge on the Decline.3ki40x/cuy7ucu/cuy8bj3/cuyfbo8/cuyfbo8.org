Nothing "thinky" about Dinosaurs? That depends. I have a race in one of my stories that is an offshoot of the Troodon dinosaurs, who very aggressively self-selected for intelligence and magical ability for about seventy million years before the story. They are rather "thinky." I'm looking forward to writing in that universe again soon.
