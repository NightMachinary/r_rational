The only thing I could contribute is that at least personally the reason I am commenting and reading less is a combination of reading some of the previous winners\top few stories and while feeling they were OK didnt feel most were good enough. Meaning if I happened to see a book\story starting like them I probably wouldnt have continued too far. And this was combined with story prompts I didnt find particularly interesting caused Me to, not too intentionally, indefinitely postpone reading each prompt till the point that the next one came out.
