No, that's not quite it. Or at least, that's not all of it.

Like, yeah, I liked academia more on a daily basis, but that was at least partially due to having (mostly) my own office then, as opposed to working in an open space now. I like people, but I also find exposure to people stressful. Industry is at least managing to involve working on the kinds of stuff I always wanted to as a kid, which provides me somewhat productive and certainly interesting challenges, and it also pays me real-person money and gives me some of the evenings, almost all of the weekends, and eventually vacations off.

Those latter advantages (money and time) are /biiiig/ advantages over academia, which /theoretically/ has a lot of freedom, but /actually/ involves being constantly judged for your ability to produce top-n-percent work on unrealistically short deadlines when you could be knocked out at any stage and often end up working weekends, evenings, and holidays /anyway/ for dismally low pay.

So overall, I find the actual act of working to be, well, not exactly /fun/, but at least fairly interesting and doable. It helps that my coworkers are fairly nice people, too, and I get paid well and given time off (not a lot, but about average for people who work one professional job in this workaholic country).

What actually depresses me is just how little time and energy I end up having for /anything else/ after I'm done with working 40-45 hours/week. Exactly /because/ the work is interestingly challenging, I spend much of my mornings and evenings /exhausted/. My hobbies have slowed to a crawl, but on the other hand, a crawl is faster than they went in graduate school!

And overall, I'm just sort of existentially horrified by the seeming "eternity" of working life in the same way that most people are of dying. I mean, how much actual fun, enjoyment, and meaning can I squeeze into life when /this/ is most of it? I feel pretty ok about work when I'm /doing it/, but then I reflect on /what happened to my whole fucking week/ and feel dismal.
