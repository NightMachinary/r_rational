I agree. I'm a grad student at the moment getting my masters, and I'm basically doing software engineering prototyping for my masters, I have little to no interest at this point of getting a PhD, despite many mentors encouraging me to, and one good soul I admire explaining why I should not. If I teach it most likely will be as an associate professor.

I'm doing my thesis in industrially appplied OCR, how about you?
