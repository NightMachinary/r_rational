  I didn't realize you worked in academia, it's one of those things I think about doing as a retirement.

I did up until six months ago, as a graduate student. Academia is definitely what I would consider my "passion career", in the sense that if I didn't actually have to worry about money, hours, travel, and job-security, I would do it. I like research, I actually enjoy teaching. It's the profession whose "core values" I actually feel and endorse to a great degree, in the sense of not feeling like a fucking hypocrite or tourist when referring to that profession in the first-person plural and talking about "our" important role in society.

It's certainly "that one job", where I couldn't really get why people were so weirdly eager to /leave/ academia and go spend their lives in cubicle farms.

It's also /hideously, soul-crushingly/ [[http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1144][exploitative, stressful, demeaning, and abusive]]. I have sat in the home of one of my stepfather's colleagues (so: stepfather is a tenured prof in EE and the colleague is one in CS), and /he fucking told me/ to never get a PhD and go get a "real job", because the academic system these days is just never going to hire people for permanent, full-time positions or treat people reasonably again. Basically all the statistics agree: /after/ filtering out the stupids, the lazies, and the incompetents in the process of undergrad /and/ graduate school, there will only ever be enough tenure-track jobs for something like [[http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/02/27/388443923/a-glut-of-ph-d-s-means-long-odds-of-getting-jobs][10%-20%]] of PhD graduates, and only some fraction of those will actually obtain tenure (ie: turn their research aspirations into a permanent career). [[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2015/02/university_hiring_if_you_didn_t_get_your_ph_d_at_an_elite_university_good.html][And the whole thing is really classist and elitist.]]

Meanwhile, you're working long hours and accepting a low salary /the whole time/, starting right when you enter graduate school, or even in undergrad. And being demeaned and insulted by having to prove, over and over again, at every fucking stage, that you're brilliant enough to /keep the job you already have for a few more years./ Oh, and subjected to [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/reviewer2/][Reviewer 2]].

And yes, I just wrote that long rant instead of getting on with my life /because I fucking care/.
