Weekly is way too often, there are no good rewards, and the clinical, self-contained and frequent nature of the contest robs it of even the glory that would be the prime one. What if the contests were monthly, and preceded by a discussion thread where people were encouraged to bat around ideas? That would also give people who didn't care enough to execute a story an avenue to contribute and engage. Just the act of making a new thread to discuss the winning story, and a flair, would go a long way. You could also hand out, idk, discussion time with alexanderwales or something.

Again though, weekly is way too frequent for something like this, especially in such a small community and without a material reward.

Also worth pointing out that the sub has sort of stultified, with more focus on consumption than original discussion.

All this comes with the caveat that I haven't been following these contests. And indeed (edit) it looks like you already had a reward flair.
