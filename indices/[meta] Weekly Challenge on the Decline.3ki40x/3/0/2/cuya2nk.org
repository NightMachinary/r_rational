That's a good question! I'd have expected some dinosaur action too. I think a lot of the prompts actively suggested something rational(ist) like Dueling Time Travelers or Rational Horror, whereas Dinos seemed a little open-ended and not focused? That being said Disney Movies didn't suggest anything besides Disney Movies and that went well.

Since I don't write often I can't say what caused the decline, as I made the same decision I usually do.
