I think it's because most of the other prompts were rather easy to generate "thinky" problems for and Dinosaurs are simply about dealing dinosaurs and everything I came up with sounded like an action scene from Jurassic Park.

I personally think that writing rational fiction can sometimes be harder than being a rationalist if only because you not only have to come up with rational behaviors and actions, you also have to come up with a problem with a solution that involves thinking instead of just having a simple answer of being dependent brave, charismatic, or some non-mental quality.

Also, Dinosaurs just coincided with the first week of September which is when a lot of us start the school year. This probably is the bigger reason than everything I said above.

EDIT: If the weekly challenge does start dropping off, I suggest making it into a monthly challenge and several associated threads devoted to giving each other ideas polishing entering contestant's stories. Like a Rational version of NaNoRiMo, except without the length requirement.
