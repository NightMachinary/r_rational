The problem I had with the Dinosaurs prompt was that it was a little limiting.

You can either do Jurassic Park (which has been done), time travel (which was the prior week's prompt), or something really weird (which either ends up being hand-wavy, or ends up taking a lot of text to close plot holes), like alien dinosaurs.

I'm not saying it can't be done with the dinosaurs prompt, it would just take a ton of work to think of something creative that is both effectively communicated, and rational, in the span of a short story.

As a side note: I wrote a Wolly Mammoth story, but wasn't completely happy with it, and decided not to post it.
