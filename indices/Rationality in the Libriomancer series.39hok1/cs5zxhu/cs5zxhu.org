How did Gutenberg get the Holy Grail out of the Bible? It wasn't in the Bible.

It stretches credibility to imagine that the porters could keep track of ALL powerful objects in books. Here are a few that seem useful:

His Dark Materials -> The Subtle Knife

Marvel comics -> Cosmic Cube

1001 Nights -> Aladdin's lamp. Or failing that his ring.

Sylvester and the Magic Pebble -> ...the pebble. I barely remember this book, but many many children read it.

D&D manuals -> Ring of Three Wishes

DC Comics -> Helm of Nabu

The Dark Is Rising -> The Book of Gramarye

The Once and Future King -> Excalibur is probably locked down, but its scabbard probably isn't, and the scabbard is what actually conveyed invulnerability.

Failing all that, I'll take the syringe of venom from Twilight.

HP is presumably a bust, it'll be locked down tighter than a [REDACTED].
