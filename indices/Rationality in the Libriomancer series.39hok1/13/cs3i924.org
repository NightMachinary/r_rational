First of all, I would probably pay a writer to do something with mind uploading devices, AIs, incredible supercomputers, and souls. And also tell them to put in fabricators that can fit through pages too. In fact, why not all in one!?! I'll have to keep the book obscure, but that shouldn't be /too/ hard.

I would probably do some SCIENCE on the subject of the whole 'living beings' rule first though, because of the stuff that happened in the book involving that rule(Explaining this would be a First Episode Spoiler, so yeah), because of the fact that my main plan would probably qualify me as a 'magical being' or get stomped on /hard/ if someone found it.
