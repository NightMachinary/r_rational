No, my 'obscurity' method was a reference to something that happened in one of the books. As in, someone actually pulled it off, so I would try and imitate their methods. Without certain problems that occurred, of course, but I've already outlined what I hope would be a solution. Saying anything more about this would be spoilers for one of the books, I don't remember which.
