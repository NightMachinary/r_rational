I'd check to see if White Wolf's RPG books are locked. If not, then you can replicate damn near anything converting Libriomancy to Mage. If that didn't work, I'd try an Iron Man comic for an arc reactor and Extremis armor.

Otherwise, I'd probably become a Twilight vampire. Sanguinarius Meyerii seems to have the best bang for your buck in the entire series, plus immortality without a whole lot of side effects.
