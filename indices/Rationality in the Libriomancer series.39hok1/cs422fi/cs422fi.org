Idea 1: Find a book about a world with a larger literate population than Earth's, then pull books out of that book to pull better things out of.

Idea 2: Write a book that the porters don't mind, and whose contents the worlds population at large would like to exist. One might, for example, write a story about a utopian society producing artifacts like "a book with cures to all known diseases", "an object that allows the user to permanently emigrate to their own alternate reality in which they are omnipotent" (yay for escapism!), etc.. Advertise it to everyone as a means to get Libromancers to bring the utopia to Earth so they'll read it to power it.
