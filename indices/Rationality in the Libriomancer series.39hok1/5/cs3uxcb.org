Step one: Try to pull Nell's Primer from Neal Stephenson's Diamond Age. Given that it sounds like objects would work how readers expect them to, I think it might continue to operate even without the dedicated ractor behind it, and the rod logic ai should be able to teach me how to build my own nanoassemblers.

Step two (if step one fails): Try to acquire any magical items from any major non-cthulhu based rpg books/systems, starting with those most able to prevent death and/or defy physics.

Step three: Experiment to determine what relative power level of objects is restricted by the Tyranny of Guttenberg, as well as the consistency of that system.

Does it rely on the guardians being aware of it?

Do they have some sort of magic power sensor? Something else entirely?

Exploit this if possible/necessary. If it's possible to gain root access to my book magic to bypass the magical censors, then attempt that with either of #1/2.

Step four: Do fame-based experiments with custom written books, involving objects from power levels such as "a ball of lint" up to "cheap, safe, easily duplicated immortality serum" and everything in between. Pay people to read the book, and then attempt to take out various objects. Pay Scalzi to write the same story in their own literary style (by offering free use of my powers to him as well), then find the worst possible author I can online, and similarly commission them for the same work. Run the tests again to determine if writing ability or the enjoyment of the story increases the power any.
