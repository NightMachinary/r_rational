I think he meant 'bro - y', that is to say having qualities consistent with 'bro' culture or beliefs (probably sexist?).

I /think/ this might be referencing the sort of somewhat fucked up stuff with the one female character and the fairly fucked up relationship and attitudes the main character expressed towards her, but I read the book sufficiently long ago that I don't recall details and am unsure - frankly I never cared much about the book series.
