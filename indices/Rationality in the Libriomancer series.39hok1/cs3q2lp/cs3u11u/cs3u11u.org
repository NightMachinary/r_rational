That was actually addressed in the first book. You can't just make a giant version of the book to pull out larger objects. Your book has to be the same size as the the one the readers use.

For your second point no one really knows. The more complex and advanced the mind is the more damage it suffers. There is a dryad character in the series who came from the book, but transfered over as a seed instead of as a fully formed being.
