I think that a standout objects is the watch from "The Girl, The Gold Watch, and Everything" from John D. Macdonald. He was well known enough that the book could be quite powerful, but not known for his scifi enough to attract attention to seal it away. The watch itself is essentially portable, unlimited /time stop/ with the only real limitation being you keep aging - basically, the watch accelerates you / slows the rest of the universe down enough that you are effectively unstoppable and untouchable. It would probably at the very least be pretty good to keep you alive and functional while you experimented with other stuff. Colonel Kassad in Hyperion used a weird arbitrary quicksilver blob that spread across his entire skin to make armor that had a similar temporal effect, but I wouldn't be as confident in drawing it through even the hardcover edition of Hyperion.

There is a probably dead Worm/Libriomancer crossover fic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bookworm-worm-libriomancer.287867/][here]]
