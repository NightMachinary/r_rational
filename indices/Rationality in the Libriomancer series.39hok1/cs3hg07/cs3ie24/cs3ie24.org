Libriomancy is, in-setting, a cheatsy style of magic wizards who can't summon enough power to cast 'Wingardium Leviosa' do. It relies on the power of belief and the human collective to do all the actual 'magic' stuff, and 99.99% of Libriomancers don't have the magical strength or mindset for trying something like that(Most can't conceive how a 'computer' or 'ebook' is like a 'real' book at all, much less how they could possibly work the same way).
