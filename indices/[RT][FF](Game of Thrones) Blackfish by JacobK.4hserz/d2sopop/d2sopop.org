In general I dislike self insert fics, although I can't recall ever reading one like this (were they take over the body of an existing character). So far it has been a great read! I'm enjoying the main character's thoughts/blackfish's instincts interaction and wondering if any conflict will arise from that. The knowing of technology but not being able to build it has also felt very realistic. I look forward to future chapters!
