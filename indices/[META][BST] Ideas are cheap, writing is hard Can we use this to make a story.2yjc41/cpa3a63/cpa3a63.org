That sounds like free-form (no dice, no stats, etc) roleplaying.

Rational roleplaying is very hard on the dungeon master. I once mastered a session, where I had a dedicated evil overlord player against the rest of the players. This means I did not have to plan all the evil plots and could concentrate on the consistency and atmosphere. The evil player literally had a list of "Avoid if evil overlord" things.

It accidentally was one of the best sessions I had, but that was probably not due to the format. There was a very cool twist at the end:

The plan was to assassinate the evil overlord with slow contact poison on a suitcase. Most of the players were killed before they reached him. Two players before the overlord, who wants to question them about more attackers and their plan.

"How many are you?"

"F**k yourself!" the more heroic player answers.

Overlord shoots the answering player in the head.

"Minion, open the suitcase!", then to the last player, "You can answer me ad die swiftly or be tortured for a long time."

Minion opens the suitcase and examines the McGuffin documents inside. Since the suitcase did not explode or anything, Overlord takes the documents.

"Time is up. No talking? Then take her to the torture chamber and kill her slowly."

The End. Players lost.

In the post-mortem discussion of the game, one player had an idea. There was contact poison on the suitcase, so the minion surely got it on his hands. From there it surely got on the documents and the overlord took them.

Ok, epilog changes. After a heroic suicide mission the good guys are all dead, but the overlord was successfully assassinated.
