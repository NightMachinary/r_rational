The main difference I envision between this idea and direct roleplaying is that the scale would be larger - not limited to one scene at a time. Sort of like the tale of the guy who wrote all the interesting parts of the story first, then reread before adding the boring bits, then realised he had a complete story already.

Getting bored of picking apart each of Dumbledore's discoveries of the properties of dragon blood? Skip back and ask about his first use of accidental magic. Told all there is to tell there? Skip forward to Albus vs Gellert vs someone else in the Triwizard Tournament!
