That particular session was more than 10 years ago. Long before rationality was an important topic for me.

I think the biggest thing is that you cannot plan from the end. In HPMoR, Yudkowsky knew the end from the beginning. It was foreshadowed at the beginning of chapter 1. In an RPG you just provide an interesting setup and see where the players go with it. It is more about sandbox/simulation than story telling. The tricky part is to have interesting stories emerge. It often works in RPG and also games like Minecraft, but imho it depends on player more than on the GM.

If you want a rational/ist/ RPG, you could setup a rationality mentor NPC, but by construction it is only as intelligent as the GM.
