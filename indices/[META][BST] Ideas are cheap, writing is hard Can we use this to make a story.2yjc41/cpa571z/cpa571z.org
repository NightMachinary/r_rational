The most important question: why is /this/ story interesting enough for the reader to spend their time reading it?

Answering that question and executing on it to completion is what separates good writers from bad, not grammar, spelling, plotting, idea quality, or the ever-nebulus "style". A good hook, a strong idea to draw people in, played to completion means more than almost anything else.

Now what might work with your idea for community story building is if someone posted the first chapter to a risky, out there, experimental story and then people were invited to wildly speculate about what came next, or what /caused/ this weird setup in the first place. Bait that hook and see what people come up with. Then use the responses to continue into the next chapter, while taking notes for an ultimate overarching plot.
