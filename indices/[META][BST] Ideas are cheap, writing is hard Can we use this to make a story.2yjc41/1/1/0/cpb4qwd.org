I'm guessing that you lose the narrative privileges that make Level 2 Intelligent characters possible. You can't predict your players, you can't predict the dice, and you can't write the story out-of-order to make sure all the foreshadowing is in place - the GM's plans have to unfold in chronological order, the same as his characters'. You can no longer use authorial fiat to build the world around a character and show them solving a difficult puzzle, at least not outside backstory. In short, you lose the ability to write a character who is /cleverer than you are/.

And since there's (usually) one GM and several players, the players combined should be more intelligent than the GM. This makes it very hard for the GM to impress the players with his rationality.

A rational PC, on the other hand, is fairly common - they're usually munchkins too.
