It sounds interesting. Some stream of consciousness thoughts:

- The first and most obvious is of course to start testing every possible substance for its effect on manaweaves, and record them.
- Direct proof of divine intervention is interesting. Figure out a way to 'fake' an incredibly complicated manaweave to intimidate opposing mages into thinking you have divine providence.
- In fact, the existence of ascended beings basically makes understanding what the fuck they made a top priority. Figure out a way to make a spell or object capable of seeing the fine details of those.
- On that note, recursion is a thing. Can you make a weave that creates an object or other effect that will modify future weaves in a specific pattern? A 'spell engine' that creates fully formed spells with raw mana input? That could create an army of spellcasters right fast.
- On the note of recursion, can you use that to refine a spell weave? Intelligence explosion style: Make a spell weave that creates a perfect magnifying lens, and then use that lens to make a spell weave that makes a better lens, and so on.
- If you can create a spell 'printer' from existing forms, why not a spell 'computer'?
- Wait. The history of the gods indicates that pure mana can hold sentience. That's budget immortality and a road to ascension if you can figure that one out.
- Back to the printer example, what if you create a weave that stores your current or an idea human body state? can you 'restore to backup' in the event of injury or death?
- Souls? Any evidence for or against? Insubstantial life based on mana is proven by the pre-ascended gods.
