I was imagining it as a non-sentient swarm, a sort of mana plankton. Like basically all energy, mana is solar. So a lot of that swarm tried to get as high as it could. Maybe at the same time physical evolution started happening.

Eventually the mana swarm started competing, and finally figured out that dyson sphere's were better for its purposes, returning mana to the earth.
