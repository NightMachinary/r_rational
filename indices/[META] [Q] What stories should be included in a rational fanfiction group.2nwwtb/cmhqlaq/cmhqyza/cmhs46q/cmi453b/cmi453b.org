I added the first four. I skimmed them and they seemed fine, took your recommendation.

I look at the fifth. It may be nice, but in the first chapter the main character notes that they are a cheetah and are out of energy, then lifts up a ship. And gets super rich. And gains a new Hermes like power as the plot demands.

As such, I am not sure if the rules are consistent or if the character solves problems through intelligent application of knowledge rather than new powers as the plot demands. You also don't mention if it's rational.

I'll check out the other three.
