I think so.

- /To the Stars/ is a far-future /Puella Magi/ fic featuring the hardest possible transhumanist science fiction... with magical girls.

- /Forging the Sword/ is, in my opinion, the most-rational Harry Potter fic in a close-to-canon setting.

- /Saurman of Many Devices/: when an author disagrees with Tolkien's view of industrialisation==evil, this is what might happen (with excellent treatment of the setting)

- /Depart Azkaban/ - HPMOR!fic, diverges at the Trial.

- /Son of the Western Sea/ - I actually just posted this one here. It's a very nice post-series Percy Jackson character/world mythology piece.

- /Game Theory/ and /Power Games/ are a rational take on /Nanoha/, where the first-season antagonist is (much) less crazy...

- /Myoushuu no Fuuin/ is a fairly ratioal take on /Naruto/, though not explicitly rationalist.
