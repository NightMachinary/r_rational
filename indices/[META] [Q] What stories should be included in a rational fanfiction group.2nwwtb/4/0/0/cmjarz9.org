Yes, you can filter the ones marked as complete, but other than that, it's not too easy to distinguish between "completed long ago, but not marked as such" and "abandoned", or "recently completed, not marked as such" and "work in progress". I was thinking about having the categorization in the community description text. I'm not sure if you want to have this information in the description, and/or are willing to invest effort into maintaining it.
