It feels like we need separate collections for the "fic that is explicitly rationalfic" and "fic that felt rational to a lot of people on [[/r/rational]]". I wouldn't mind seeing Time Braid in the latter.

I do anticipate that a lot of authors may not /like/ having their work be called 'rationalfic' without being asked about that, which is why I feel like the first collection, "Rationalfic", should be mostly authors who've expressed approval of or inspiration by HPMOR, Luminosity, and the other seminal works. Calling the second collection "[[/r/rational]] upvoted" is unambiguous, and kind to authors who may not approve of us (you can't control who upvotes you).
