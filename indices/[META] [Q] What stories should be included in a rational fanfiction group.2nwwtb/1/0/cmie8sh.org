I did note in the description. "These are stories that have been posted on [[/r/rational]] and which the community sees as rational and intelligent fanfictions." so I think the community which I started more fits your second category than your first.

I made it more explicit.

#+begin_quote
  These are stories that have been posted on [[/r/rational]] and which the community upvoted.
#+end_quote

And I changed the title to reddit [[/r/rational]]

Do you think that would be ok?

I see you gave a new name later on. I combined our names.
