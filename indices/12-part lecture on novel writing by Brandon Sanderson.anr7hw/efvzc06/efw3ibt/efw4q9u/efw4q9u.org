Nowadays, when I want to go back to a specific old episode, I just use the embedded web player on the Writing Excuses website (which works just as well if you're listening from your phone); each episode has a separate post with the embedded web player and a direct link to the MP3.

If you want to download an entire season for offline listening, probably the best way to do that would be to go to the [[https://writingexcuses.com/season001/][season archives page]] that lists all of the episodes for that season (including direct MP3 links), and then use a download manager to download all of the files linked on that page that have a .mp3 file extension. From there you can transfer the MP3s to a device and media player of your choice. For Firefox, I use the [[https://www.downthemall.net/][DownThemAll]] extension, and a quick Google search turned up Chrome plugins like [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/batch-link-downloader/aiahkbnnpafepcgnhhecilboebmmolnn?hl=en-US][Batch Link Downloader]] among many other download managers that appear to accomplish the same thing.
