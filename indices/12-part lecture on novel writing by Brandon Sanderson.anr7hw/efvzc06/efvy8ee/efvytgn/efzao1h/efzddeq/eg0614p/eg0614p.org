That's more a flaw of the notes than of the lecture itself, or at least not of the lectures I've been watching (the 2016 ones linked in this post). He doesn't really outline 2/3 as a rule, and goes into quite a bit of detail about what he means by the three traits, and how he recommends they should be used. I'm not sure myself where the 2/3 thing came from, so it's either something he said in an earlier version of the class that he later went back on, or an incorrect interpretation by the person taking notes.

Korra was probably something /he/ didn't mention, and instead something a student mentioned, because he tends to ask the class for examples of things he's talking about. It's quite possible he hasn't seen the show and just went along with it.

Also important to mention, because the notes don't make it clear enough, that he's very emphatic about his recommendations not being hard-and-fast rules. He says in pretty much every video that people should just try stuff and then drop it if it doesn't work well for their particular writing style.
