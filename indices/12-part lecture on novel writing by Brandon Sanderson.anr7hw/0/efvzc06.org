For related viewing, the [[https://www.youtube.com/user/WriteAboutDragons/featured][Write About Dragons Youtube channel has Brandon Sanderson's 2013 lectures]] , and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRO9W1Nmh6clZP-IAhMeMpMru7vJaW7KJ][the 2014 lectures are available courtesy of the BYU English department channel]]. And [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHlanlzaIY&list=PLSTzdBlo5WBCsSpT-dN56bwbo5ig03cgR][here's an unofficial mirror of the 2012 lectures]].

He tends to cover the same topics from year to year, and while the lectures do improve in many ways as he refines the lesson plans and addresses more details, I also find that the younger versions of Brandon tend to be a bit more sensitive to the mindset of beginner writers, in the same way that if you're trying to pass freshman calculus, a sophomore TA can sometimes be a better teacher than a tenured professor. If you consider yourself a complete neophyte, I think there's a case to be made for going back to his older material.

In particular, the one lecture that I constantly find myself coming back to is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjAuKOAGx0][Brandon Sanderson's lecture on description and viewpoint recorded from his 2010 Jordancon panel]], and if you only have 1 hour to spend learning how to become a better writer, I can't think of a better way to spend it than watching this video. (The video is 2 hours long, but the latter half is mostly Q&A, which is still worth watching but less essential.) Watching this lecture as a wee undergrad is the reason I'm a professional author today, and I watch the video once every couple years just because it's such a great way to review the fundamentals of writing.

His [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZsDyyMS8G0][2010 Jordancon lecture on plotting]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZQwkBFAm14][2011 Jordancon lecture on Sanderson's Second Law]] are also very good.

Brandon Sanderson also has a weekly podcast, Writing Excuses, which he co-hosts with several other authors, including Dan Wells, Mary Robinette Kowal, and Howard Taylor, with many guest authors featuring prominently in recent seasons. As Writing Excuses has gone on, it feels like in an effort to cover more territory they spend less time on fundamentals from a new author perspective, and more time on increasingly specific topics, and I think most of the best lessons I got from Writing Excuses came in the first 6 seasons. (In particular, I've listened to seasons 3-5 of Writing Excuses at least three times each.) That being said, some of the more recent episodes cover lots of interesting topics, like interviewing NASA astronauts to ask questions about things that authors get wrong about space, and other similar topics that are highly specific but nonetheless very cool (and probably very helpful to a specific audience of people).
