My goal was to make it so that you don't have to be familiar with My Little Pony to enjoy this. I'm not sure whether I achieved that or not.

If we pretended that all the MLP characters were just original characters, the premise would be more or less that a group of Animagus witches investigating the "Stars in the Heavens" prophecy come to Hogwarts and Harry learns that the power scale of Magic goes much, much higher than he initially assumed and as such, Quirrell's strategy towards handling Harry changes significantly. Namely, he decides to be nice. Really, really nice. Which is awkward because he's still the same, evil Voldemort.

It's primary rationalist themes involve reconciling the inherent absurdity of "Magic" with reality, and all the implications that carries with it. Tonally, it's reminiscent of the more self-aware, humorous chapters of HPMOR.
