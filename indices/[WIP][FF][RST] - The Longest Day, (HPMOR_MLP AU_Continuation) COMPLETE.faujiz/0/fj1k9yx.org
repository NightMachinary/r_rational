Nice read. My prior for all thing MLP is.. negative, but this was alright.

Highlight for me, and probably for most "rational fiction" fans, would be the exposition chapter about the Stone's 360 use limitation. Close second to all the other Dumbledore POV chapters that really scratch a HPMOR itch I didn't know I had.

Recommended.
