  I can't think of a good word for this kind of writing. "In-group" writing? "Judgmental" writing?

Bad writing. I think all authors do this to some extent, or start by doing this, but a good writer does it well enough that their strawmen bad guys appear to develop believable ideologies, points of view, and reasons, and so it stops setting the reader's teeth on edge.
