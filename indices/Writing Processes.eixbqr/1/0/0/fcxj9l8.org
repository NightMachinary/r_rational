Let me try to again from a different angle.

What I can't stand is when the author wrote the book thinking "THIS'll show 'em!" People who disagree with the author are portrayed as stupid, evil, or insane. People in the author's group aren't wrong about anything important, they have no vulnerability, everything about them is attractive. It's clear who the good people and bad people are, and the message is strong that you, the reader, should be more like the good people.

I can't think of a good word for this kind of writing. "In-group" writing? "Judgmental" writing?
