(edited down to a less obnoxious length)

Thank you for the question. I may well be using the wrong words, and maybe you'll help me find the right ones.

The thing I can't stand is a quality in fiction where the author makes decisions so as to convert the reader to an ideology.

In the Greg Egan interview with the "microscope" quote, he talked about his decision to make the "female" aliens in his Orthogonal series fall into four pieces and die during reproduction. If he was the sort of author I can't stand, Egan would have made this decision in aid of a social thesis. The story would actually be a message in a symbolic code (I think this is called "subversion"). The reader, then, would be expected to slot "human woman" into the "female alien" symbol in the book to decrypt the author's message (I think this is called "deconstruction"). Or it may be that the reader is expected to subconsciously absorb the author's message, and find themselves converted to a new ideology without knowing it.

Please tell me whether I got the vocabulary right :)

In that "microscope" interview, he made the decision about alien reproductive biology because it would give his characters a problem they could solve with science. You might say that Egan was just substituting one ideology for another (feminism for posthumanism, I suppose?), but he wasn't. Egan writes honestly. He doesn't delude me about the solutions his characters come up with. He gives me a place I can safely visit, people I can be, whose problems I can learn from. That's what I want to read and write.
