  This helped me clarify my reaction to subversion in fiction and literary deconstruction. I can't stand them.

Would you care to elaborate on how the quote helped you achieve the insights above? I'm not familiar with these terms so I had to Google them first, but it seems subversion could be present in sci-fi that's exploring /unfamiliar/ concepts. My searches for literary deconstruction kept leading to Derrida's philosophy so I'm still struggling to relate literary deconstruction to sci-fi used only to crank out metaphors for familiar things.
