I think that's a scaled-up version of the problem with any fanfic of an ongoing work. The only way around it is probably to pick an episode as a point-of-departure for the AU, and then ignore canon developments after that point. We'd probably want to start writing in the gap between seasons to give the fic time to develop its own story before it starts coming out in parallel with new episodes.

For example, [[#s][Major Season 1 Spoilers]]
