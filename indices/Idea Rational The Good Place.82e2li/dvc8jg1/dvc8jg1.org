I'd like to believe that a rationalist in the [real] Good Place would tear the whole thing to pieces with his inquisitions.

I'll bet everyone here suspected from the beginning that they were not in the Good Place because that would generally be a boring story.

But there's also a hard problem because Good Places should be full of people trying to fix the system. Any story teller in this universe is probably painted into a corner so that they cannot actually depict the Good Place. Or else The Good Place isn't actually that good because it somehow restricts people from being able to fix the system.

Maybe the only one who can fix it is a person from the Bad Place.

Hmm...
