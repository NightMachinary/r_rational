  I'll bet everyone here suspected from the beginning that they were not in the Good Place because that would generally be a boring story.

I did not straight up suspect /that/. I did think the whole affair was fishy, but thought it was headed more towards a "Heaven ain't that Heaven-ly after all" direction. With subversion of the whole system (that was obviously unfair, with people getting sent to the Bad Place for trivial reasons) being the end game.

I also had my suspicions re: Tahani because come on, how is she Heaven material, but then I thought maybe this was supposed to be a subversion, and to invite thought about how one could be a good person even regardless of personal flaws as long as their actions did good. Turns out, no, they buy into the virtue ethics argument, moral desserts invalidate the whole thing.

Frankly it's a pretty crap world. I don't think they'll have the guts to end it this way, because even without explicit references to Christianity it'd still be a bit too much, but the only really good thing to do would be burning the entire system down however possible.
