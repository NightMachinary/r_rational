  I'll bet everyone here suspected from the beginning that they were not in the Good Place because that would generally be a boring story.

I actually thought this was handled pretty nicely by depicting the Architects et all as having basically human motivations and flaws. Things like Michael talking about his bosses, how it was his first time designing a neighborhood, plus the fact that they made a mistake with Eleanor did a good job of setting up potential conflict even if they had been in the real Good Place. I think it's possible to do a r! AU fic where they actually are in the Good Place, but unlike most rationalist visions of immortality they don't have any way to modify the residents' minds, so they can't use transhumanist hand-waving to make them immune to boredom and ennui.
