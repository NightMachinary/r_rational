Eleanor is already fairly rational (or at least becomes so over the course of the series). The main difference would be making her more curious so she actually investigates the history of the system, what exactly Janets are, the arbitrary bureaucracy, metaphysics and control systems (stuff like Janet's button). At some point she may well suspect she is in a nested simulation and then you could make it a crossover with the matrix or something.
