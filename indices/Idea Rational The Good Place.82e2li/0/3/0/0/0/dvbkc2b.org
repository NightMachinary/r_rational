  You don't. Put a spoiler warning in the title.

You can't do that if you are just replying to a post though.

#+begin_quote
  You can't realistically have a discussion like this without spoilers. Enforcing spoiler tags on each post just means endless amounts of spoiler tags with no unspoiled content in between.

That's a fair point. I do agree that this is a topic that could have benefited from a general spoiler warning in the title, but as someone replying to a topic your options are: not mentioning spoilers, using spoiler tags or potentially spoiling people.
