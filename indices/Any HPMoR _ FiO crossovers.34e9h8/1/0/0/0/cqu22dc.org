  Magic considers cryonically frozen people dead
#+end_quote

Do you mean Hermione, or is this Word of Yudkowski somewhere else? I think she was "dead as far as magic was concerned" before Harry chilled her, and she wasn't actually frozen.

If your soul/magic/whatever followed the pattern of your mind, then you might not be dead when uploaded. If so, could you perform wandless magic inside Equestria's computronium substrate? It probably wouldn't effect your simulated environment, more likely it would effect the physical environment you were running in. In that case wizards who could do wandless magic could upload and then use wandless magic as a back channel or even attack Equestria directly.

  Do some preparation that would constitute enough magic to wreck electronics?

If Voldemort could put a Horcrux on the Pioneer Plaque, probably not.
