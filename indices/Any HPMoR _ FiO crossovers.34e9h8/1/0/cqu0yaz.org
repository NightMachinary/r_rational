Good point. Also, given Horcrux 2, he could hypothetically upload more than once.

Would the upload process count as death as far as magic is concerned? That would likely make a difference to his decision. Also, if you could get into the upload center (polyjuiced?) you could make all the Horcruxes you want guilt free.
