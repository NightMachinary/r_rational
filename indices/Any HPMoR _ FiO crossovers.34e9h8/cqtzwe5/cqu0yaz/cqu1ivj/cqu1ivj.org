Magic considers cryonically frozen people dead, and presumably would even if there were a way to unfreeze them. It'll definitely consider an uploaded person dead.

Great point on the infinite Horcruxes. It depends on stuff we don't know about the ritual (Do you have to kill them with AK? Do some preparation that would constitute enough magic to wreck electronics?) but is /probably/ compatible with using an emigration station as a "murder weapon."
