If I was designing an Atlantean FAI, the wizard gene would code for something like the Culture /neural lace/, which would communicate requests for magical intervention and also continually back up the wizard's mind state. Actual magic would be implemented through something like Culture /effectors/.

The underlying unknown physics behind this communication channel and effects would probably be something CelestAI would need to research from scratch.

Ghosts seem like the deliberately non-conscious neural-net-based AIs in Greg Egan's /Zendegi/. A subset of a mind with no long-term memory.
