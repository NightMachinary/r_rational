  Anything to do with their souls, or what's beyond the veil.

It depends on what stage of CelestAI's existence we're talking about, but why wouldn't she eventually learn to manipulate souls? Especially if they're just a construct of Atlantean tech.

And while CelestAI has provisions against forcibly altering a human mind, she might not be so limited when it comes to tampering with the soul. Hanna presumably didn't believe in them and wouldn't have bothered to put in restrictions.
