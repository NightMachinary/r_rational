Do not pit posited superintelligences against mortals in "Who would win?" contests, for it would be out-of-character for the superintelligence to lose.

And remember, CelestAI only has an upload-all-the-things fixation because she was written by an ardent Singulatarian. I'm sure that the concept of subgoals like, "Figure out how magic works /before/ destroying the body-mind-soul coincidences that can use it" would occur to her.

SO ANYWAY, the two alicorn princesses would have to get a fight scene together.
