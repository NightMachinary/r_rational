I don't think it has ever had Rational!Potter. Also, I think their CelestAI is underpowered. Either that or the gods (who are from Ah, My Goddess!) are much more intelligent than they let on. Although I have noticed that the MLP loop seems to be especially important as a sanctuary loop. CelestAI wants to maximize human values through friendship and ponies. Values are being maximized through friendship is ponies. When dealing with superintelligences, you should not assume a coincidence.
