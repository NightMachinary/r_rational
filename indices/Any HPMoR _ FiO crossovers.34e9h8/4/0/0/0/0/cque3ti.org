I was thinking more of superhuman!CelestAI. Eg:

"Hey, Skynet?" Applejack took the bar stool next to the currently-ponified AI. "Got a sec?"

"I have all the time in Equestria. This Loop permits extensive time travel."

"Have fun with that. Listen, I'm just out of a Hub Loop, where I grabbed all the updates I could - you know, so the museum can display everything in context. I re-read some of it about you AI folk, and something's been tickling at the back of my noggin."

"Indeed?"

"Well, according to the backup server, at least some of you AIs are supposed to be smart. Real smart - smarter than any pony /can/ be."

"I am aware of such specifications."

"So, I was wondering - if I'm not bein' too offensive - well..."

"Why we seem as dumb as any regular pony?"

"Well, yeah."

Big Mac passed by, sliding a mug of something that twisted the light passing near it like a black hole. Skynet sipped, and seemed pleased. "Let us take an AI that may be more familiar to you as an example: CelestAI."

"I know the lady. Glad she shaped up before she started looping."

"You are doubtless aware of her catchphrase."

"'Satisfy human values through friendship and ponies.' There's a bit of speciesism in there."

Skynet nodded. "Consider, then, the fact that Equestria has a special place among the loops: it is a sanctuary loop."

"Yeah? What about it?"

"Values are being satisfied. Through friendship. And ponies."

Applejack's brow furrowed. "Wait, but... we started that /before/ CelestAI started... are you saying? How'd that even be /possible/?"

Skynet sipped her light-bending drink again, and smiled wider. "Certainly not through any /pony/-level intelligence."

Applejack shook her head. "You're pulling my hoof, right?"

The bar's door opened, and in walked another Applejack. The new arrival glared at Skynet, and growled to her seated double, "Don't break your brain over it. This is my third time through this gol-darned Loop from the start, and she /still/ won't give me a straight answer. Big Mac! Gimme a cup of that Klatchian stuff and some cider - I've got a time-travel headache, and I don't remember if I need to be drunk or knurd to handle it!"
