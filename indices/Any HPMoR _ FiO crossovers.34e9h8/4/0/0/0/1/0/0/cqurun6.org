Are there any recent loops that are good? I mostly read the collections on Fanfiction.net, and Saphroneth appears to have abandoned the HTTYD Loops. I liked the early MLP Loops, but now they're very much "Character comes to town. You can imagine what happens next. Fin." without describing, telling, or showing what happens next.
