  What can CelestAI promise them?
#+end_quote

Safety from Dark Wizards. A shard of equestria to rule over. Sufficiently advanced technology. What can't she promise them?

Or she could just convince them it immigrate to equestria and use their bodies.

  Also, the most likely explanation of how magic works is that it's the aftermath of a previous singularity, and that there's an AI behind it.

Then that AI would presumably stop CelestAI the same way CelestAI stopped an AI from maximizing smiles. It would be as one-sided and pointless as CelestAI stopping Harry.
