Options (1) and (2) basically lead to "disaster averted". This is one of those cases where you just go ahead and use the Imperius Curse to /shut that shit down/.

(3) is going to be the most /fun/, as we watch what weird shit his Unbreakable Vow interprets as "destroying the world" and see him try to cope with attempting to program a superintelligent AI /without half-assing it/. And then the two AIs fight. I wouldn't call that "Manichean", as this would be a battle of White vs So Light Gray You Have to Invent White to Make It Look Dark, but hey, that's exactly the kind of battle I want to watch!
