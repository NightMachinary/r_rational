  Do not pit posited superintelligences against mortals in "Who would win?" contests, for it would be out-of-character for the superintelligence to lose.

This isn't a "who would win" contest, this is a "can you create an interesting story that isn't just a retelling of HPMoR or FiO" contest.

You can tune when the story happens, and who the real characters are. And don't forget, Harry starts with powers CelestAI knows not.

1. Harry can interfere Hanna before she uploads. He doesn't have to /convince/ her, he has mind charms, and she's just a muggle. Now he has root on CelestAI.
2. Harry can Transfigure Hanna back to life, using a plot device to extract a copy of her mind state from Equestria. Again he has root on CelestAI.
3. Harry can apply Hanna's algorithms to magical constructs, transfiguring his own superintelligence (but applying his Unbreakable Vow to it). And his uses magic.

Options 1 & 2 let you write a story about Yudkowsky's AI in a box experiment.

Option 2 gives you a courtroom drama as resurrected!Hanna fights to keep her job despite being legally dead.

Option 3 gives you a story about a Manichaean battle between two AIs who are each restrained by their programming from just killing everyone and sorting it out later.
