Awesome as ever.

About portraits (it's a detail, I know, but details is what reddit threads are for), Hermione thinks of them as "sentient if not sapient". Depending on the difference you make between the two words, of course, but it seems to me it is sapient that is 'basic' and sentient that is 'higher', not the other way around.

Also, why didn't Older Hermione try to stop Hermione from speaking with Quirrell's?
