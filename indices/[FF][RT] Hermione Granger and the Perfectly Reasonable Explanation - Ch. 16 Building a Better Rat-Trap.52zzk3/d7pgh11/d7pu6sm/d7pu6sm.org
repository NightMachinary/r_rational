  "sentient if not sapient"
#+end_quote

It actually is that way. Sentient means "feeling", sapient means "reasoning". Here's a good brief discussion of it with source links - [[http://www.rebekkahniles.com/2012/03/word-box-sapience-vs-sentience.html]] An easy way to remember is that it's Homo Sapiens, not Homo Sentiens, and humanity is #1 at thinking (at least until 2029, if you lean that way).

Of course, the way portraits /behave/ in canon strongly suggests they /are/ sapient - they'd pass true Turing tests with flying colors (if you got modern ones, anyway) - but that's such an enormous ethical black hole we're forced to hand-wave it away and just say "but they're not" - everyone else certainly doesn't behave as if they have more ethical weight than (non-food) animals.

  Also, why didn't Older Hermione try to stop Hermione from speaking with Quirrell?

Good question! ;)
