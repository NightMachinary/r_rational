I'm not saying we /can/, as of now, already make a computer that reasons as well as a human. But extrapolating from the current state of science, we can safely say (and it's not EY who'll disagree) that we /will/ be able to make a reasoning AI in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, giving your AI emotion is not something I believe we have clues as to how to do, so far.
