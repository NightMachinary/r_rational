Emulating (or simulating, depending on where you draw the line for "real") emotions in MI research goes back to the mid-late 80's, check out Google Scholar. Basic emotions can be mapped as fairly simple analog networks, but then you get into philosophical debates about whether the programs "really" "feel" them. I'm guessing that when you say "emotion" you're mostly talking about more complex sensation-action patterns that are harder to infer from behavior without complex outputs (natural language), or that require more complex inputs (recognizing the /implications/ of a complex situation in order to feed them into the emotional network and see how that should influence behavior, or future cognition). In that specific case, I suspect you're right that "advanced" cognition is probably a prerequisite for "advanced" emotion.

But sentience in general has a /very/ low bar - in ethical terms, as long as something can be said to "suffer", we tend to grant it certain limited rights (though more limited if we find it delicious), and pain/fear are among the easiest "feelings" to model. While in contrast, sapience has a very high bar - in terms of evolution, an enormous number of species have sentience, but extremely few (or one, again, depending on where you draw the line) have sapience.

When we're talking about portraits (and to a lesser extent, magical photographs), it raises the question of whether they (or the spells that produce them) are "designed" in a way that actually makes modern MI research a good metaphor, or whether magical shortcuts may be making things seem backwards? If a spell lets you give form to an "idea" that you feel you understand sufficiently ("I know it when I see it") but without needing to understand how it /works/, then what would otherwise be prerequisites may become entirely optional.

So perhaps it's possible to deliberately withhold sentience from something you've provided explicitly with sapience, but I think if you /do/ have the methods to produce the latter, you're very likely to be also able to produce the former, whether you choose to or not.

All that said, even if Portraits /were/ sapient, magical society has a deliberately regressive view of sapience in general - there are multiple races (not even species, since many of them can interbreed with humans) that have /obvious natural language/, and even demonstrably human-equivalent (or superior) intelligence and /still/ have restricted rights.

But at least in canon, portraits do not teach classes (even if they might seem better at it than Binns, who is the /worst/ canon case for sapience, ghost-wise) or even give guest lectures, they do not design new spells (even if they might need someone living to test them), they don't write new books, and these are things I'd expect to see if they were sapient. While they do exhibit anger, fear, self-preservation, loneliness/friendship, loyalty, superiority/disgust, most of which are sufficient for a label of sentience even taken individually, let alone collectively. That seems to say, at least in canon, that sapience is demonstrably not required for sentience, though it does not necessarily imply the converse, as we have no canon examples or counter-examples.

And now I've used up all my writing time for the day, but occasional deep-dives in relevant contexts are often helpful for later writing, so I still consider it time well-spent. :)
