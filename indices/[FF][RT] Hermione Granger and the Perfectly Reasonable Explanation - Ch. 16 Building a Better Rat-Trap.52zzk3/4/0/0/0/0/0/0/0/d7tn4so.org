I noticed this, and though I respect EY as a writer, I breezed right past it at the time on the presumption that he'd made the common SF mistake of confusing sentience and sapience.

Though that /would/ be odd, given his background. I suppose it's possible that he considers "sapience" too fuzzy of a term and prefers "intelligent" or "self-aware" for the same purposes, but that still wouldn't explain why he didn't use one of those in that context?

I did a quick search, and there was a thread where someone asked specifically what Harry/EY meant by "sentient", and EY never chimed in. But he did mention "sapience" once wrt. learning the word from [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137][Little Fuzzy]], which is the same place I learned it. He even equates it to "personhood", which if applied to the snakes thing would make Harry's /surprise/ actually make sense, where no widely-used definition of sentient does that I can see.

So, yeah, I've got nothing. But then, HGPRE is and has always been a Canon-fic, not an HPMOR-fic, so I'm ok with that. :)
