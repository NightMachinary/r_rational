I see. Well I knew "sentient" meant "feeling" and "sapient" meant "reasoning", but I'd still argue it's in that way. You can make a reasonably well-reasoning computer, but never has a feeling one been made so far. So "sentience" still seems harder to reach than "sapience".

As for OH-non-intervention theories... the most obvious guess at this point is that she's already almost entirely "slipped". There is also the possibility that it was never an older Hermione, but an older whoever-else, who has been /pretending/ to be Hermione, but is actually not all that unhappy to help past!Voldemort's plans.
