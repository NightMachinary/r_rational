Well, the thread is asking for really bad utility functions, not interesting ones :) If you have ever played online games, one of the biggest complaints, warranted or otherwise, is a poor 'RNG' in the game. An outgrowth of MMO gaming devoted to the perfect RNG could, perhaps, be made interesting. (Not Me. Not Doing It.)

Also, a true RNG could be of use in cryptography, if I remember correctly.
