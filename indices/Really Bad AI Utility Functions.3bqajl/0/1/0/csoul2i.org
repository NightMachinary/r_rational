  Forced breakups and a universe conspiring to get people to have relationships you don't want follow.

One of the romcom tropes is people discovering that what they thought they didn't want was really what was right for them all along. It's the uptight guy who gets shown how to loosen up by a free spirit. So if you were happily in a monogamous relationship, you would find someone new and start to realize that you didn't actually love your wife. Or if you were asexual, you would discover that all you really needed was the right woman to show you what love is. (The AI would find a way to make this happen.)

Romcoms are inherently about that change; it's not just about people falling in love with each other despite the odds, because that leaves you without a second act.

So in a hypothetical world where romcoms were "forced", people would find themselves in this endless cycle of change, happenstance, meet cutes, and internal discovery, without any real stable relationships to speak of. But I don't think that they would necessarily be unhappy, save for those times that all hope seemed lost (right before everything gets made right again in the end).
