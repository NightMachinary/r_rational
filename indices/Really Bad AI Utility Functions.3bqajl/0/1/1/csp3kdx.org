In theory you would either be comic relief to another person who the machine chooses to focus its efforts upon.

Or if you're asexual, you'll find someone, but since the nasty is never done on screen, you'll just fall into bed while in a makeout session, lose consciousness, and come back the next morning, room trashed and mixture of fulfillment, confusion, and deep deep shame. I foresee nothing problematic here.
