*Design a maximally human-satisfying utility function*: The AI consumes the solar system to create a matrioshka brain that's perfectly wonderfully capable of satisfying a species that no longer exists.

*Maximize irony*: Probably the same result, with solar-sized hipster glasses.

*Satisfy Human Values through passive-aggressiveness and sarcasm*: The AI makes everyone ultimately happy, but is /really/ a dick about it.

*Match behavior patterns of (insert god here)*: Probably gonna be /pretty bad/ for anybody not of said religion. Probably for everyone /of/ the religion too come to think of it, considering the differences between what the holy books say and what religions generally do.... At least telling it to match Zeus or the Discordian version of Eris might be kinda funny.

*Maximize Humanity*: Consumes all available resources to make a bunch of perfectly generic people, leaving a big airless ball of dead nekkid people where Earth used to be.
