I am a little suspicious of the argument that goes: "you should not want to be changed in an X way, because then it would no longer be you", partially because I don't have a good way to tell which possible minds can still be called "me". Would "me + knows Lisp" still be me? Would "me + happier and has traveled around the world"? "me + perfect memory"? "me + 50 extra iq points and more pleasant personality - 5 years of memories"? "me + infinite mental clarity and omniscience"? I'm pretty sure I want all of those, but in a sense those people wouldn't be me. "me" seems like a fuzzy set of minds, and I'm not even sure I would want to stick to its center, if you see what I mean.

I become uncomfortable when I start thinking about instantly changing into one of those people, because it feels too much like being destroyed and replaced by some other person. At the same time I feel very good about being continuously transformed into one of them. But is that a relevant distinction? Why would the speed of the change make a difference? I don't have a non-stupid solution.
