  "Your pleasure center and your pure consciousness" is not you. That's akin to saying that all the years of your life have no worth whatsoever.

Part of my argument was that I wouldn't mind getting transformed into some entities that would definitely not be me. (Like some sort of an amazing, godlike-being vaguely based on me.) "My pleasure center and my pure consciousness" would also not have much in common with me but I guess I'm not too concerned by that, as long as I (or whatever we want to call /that/) get(s?) to experience that infinite pleasure. To be clear, I don't think this is anywhere near close to the best possible state of being, but I think I'd prefer it to many others.
