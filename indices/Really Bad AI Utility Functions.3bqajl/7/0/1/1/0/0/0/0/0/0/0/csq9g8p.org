  To transform into an entity that is not you in any way is indistinguishable from dying.

I kinda agree. But also I also feel like it this point of view runs into problems, maybe, or at least some weird consequences.

Imagine that the transformation is gradual and consists of a series of tiny, infinitesimal changes applied over time. None of the changes by itself feels like dying at all, but their total sum represents a complete change. Is this still a bad, scary thing?

I remember that 4 year old me was a very different person from the current me. He had a radically different set of memories, habits, skills, etc. Over the years it gradually turned into my current self and now my mind has less in common with the mind of me_4yo than with the minds of some of the adults I've met. You can imagine the process going even further, to the point where all similarity to my past self is completely erased. Would it make sense then to say that me_4yo is dead? Kinda. You don't see him running around anymore. For all intensive tortoises he no longer exists anywhere. But it's hard to argue that this process was a bad thing. Would it be a bad thing if the same process somehow magically happened in a fraction of a second? It would sure feel more disturbing that way, analogy with death would become more convincing. But why should the speed of the process be relevant? I'm not sure.

Of course I can't prove it, but I suspect that any transformation of one mind into another, completely different one can be imagined as a continuous, gradual process, like maturation. If the lengthy process doesn't feel like a bad, scary thing, should then an instant change that has the same effect feel like a bad thing?
