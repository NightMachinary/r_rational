  If you have an objection to it, better say it explicitly!

    Part of my argument was that I wouldn't mind getting transformed into some entities *that would definitely not be me.*

They would not be you - that's my entire point, that's what I literally said at the start.

To transform into an entity that is not you *in any way* is indistinguishable from dying.

I think my problem is that your position almost seems to require a belief in a "continuity of consciousness" that is completely forbidden by the laws of physics.

Also, what should tip you off to the fact that this nerve bundle is not your "I" is the fact that it is biologically indistinguishable from any other human's "pure consciousness and pleasure center".
