  Of course I can't prove it, but I suspect that any transformation of one mind into another, completely different one can be imagined as a continuous, gradual process, like maturation.
#+end_quote

I concur.

#+begin_quote
  Imagine that the transformation is gradual and consists of a series of tiny, infinitesimal changes applied over time. None of the changes by itself feels like dying at all, but their total sum represents a complete change. Is this still a bad, scary thing?
#+end_quote

/Yes/.

By tiny gradual changes I can literally turn you into a /rock/.

We usually license some kind of changes as permissible, based on personal choice, which is why it unsettles me to hear people license changes as permissible that'll converge into a wireheading deathcluster.

#+begin_quote
  Kinda.
#+end_quote

Yeah, it depends on the model of personhood you use. Personally I usually prefer a view that is "tuneable" - where you can, sorta, turn up the gain and recognize that "me one second ago" is really /me/ but "me ten weeks ago" is less me, then tune it back down and recognize the last five years as the same person, then tune it way further down and recognize my entire life as one personhood.

Like a relief map in mindspace.

#+begin_quote
  But why should the speed of the process be relevant?
#+end_quote

Depends whether you care about the intermediate steps. Ultimately, all life is a path to death. The only question is how long we can/should/want to make the path.

#+begin_quote
  If the lengthy process doesn't feel like a bad, scary thing, should then an instant change that has the same effect feel like a bad thing?
#+end_quote

Ignoring the intermediate steps, this seems like a bug in the feelings. I bet this could be exploited somehow, at best by selling you expensive gradual uploading at a premium.
