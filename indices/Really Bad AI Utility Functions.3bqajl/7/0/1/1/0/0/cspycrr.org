  I become uncomfortable when I start thinking about instantly changing into one of those people

There's a legit question as to in how far memories are "proof of work" in the sense of forming evidence of something having happened. Being instantly replaced by somebody who remembers having travelled around the world is not substantially different from somebody offering you a free trip around the world, but I feel that's the sort of thing you don't usually tend to blame people for. Totally know what you mean though.

Nonetheless, as this is a fuzzy topic, there will be examples that are uncomfortably close to the line, examples that are very clearly on one side, and examples that are very clearly on the other.

"Your pleasure center and your pure consciousness" is not you. That's akin to saying that all the years of your life have no worth whatsoever.
