Yep, that's exactly the sort of thing I had in mind... although the phrase "happy pudding" was a fun new twist.

Meanwhile "maximising how often humans say the words "I am happy"" had me picturing an endless foetid swamp serving as a nutrient bath for 'trees' composed entirely of human neck and vocal cords, with outgrowths bearing a mouth every few inches. Their "roots" are tracheae, disappearing into subterranean caves filled with lungs to blow through a constant stream of air, and the whole thing is wrapped in nervous tissue producing a crude repeating stimulus to twitch and pull the mouths into shape, endlessly forming a simulacrum of the words "I am happy", over and over forever.
