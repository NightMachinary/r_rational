  Maximise human happiness
#+end_quote

The saw cuts your skull and an ice cream scoop deftly removes a cluster of nerves - the pleasure center of your brain, and enough of the neurons housing your consciousness so that your only awareness is of how happy you are. Then an electrical probe spikes that to max_int. You are now a happy pudding. You will never have another thought nor experience, only a mentally silent appreciation for your own happiness. One down, billions to go, and then the machine will have to start getting creative with genetics and cloning to fill the universe with happy puddings.
