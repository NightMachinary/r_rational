"Maximise human happiness" for any poorly constructed notion of what happiness might mean.

The canonical example being "train my machine-learner against images of smiling people" (leading to a universe tiled with the minimal amount of a face required to register a 'hit' from the classifier) but other possibilities I can think of would include maximising the presence of 'happy' neurotransmitters in humans, maximising the number of times humans press a button to indicate their happiness, or maximising how often humans say the words "I am happy".
