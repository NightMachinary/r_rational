  If a story has to have a rogue AI, wouldn't it be more interesting for the war against Skynet to be about preventing it from maximizing human happiness by turning us into "happy puddings"?

Yes, but only provided the human side of the war actually has a better idea. You would think that's easy ("Have you tried /not/ turning people into puddings, but still making them happy in non-pudding ways?"), but in fact, basically nobody ever writes that story. Nontrivially evil hegemonizing swarms actually tend to wind up looking /better/ in comparison to a human side of the war whose only goal is to reestablish what the reader would recognize as the present-day status quo (remember Jasmine from /Angel/? I still do).

Or worse, the author tends to write the human side of the war as something like the Imperium of Man from WH40k, /glorying/ in blood and death as a /proud show/ of how not-pudding they are, or worse, speechifying on how It Is Our Misery That Makes Us Human (see: /Three Worlds Collide/ and the Superhappies).

"Wireheading UFAI versus the Postapocalyptic Freedom Fighters" is a fairly trivial story. /Three Worlds Collide/, with its Superhappies opposed to semi-eutopian but still /really weird and different/ humans, is more interesting. Jasmine vs Angel Investigations was more interestingly ambiguous from a moral perspective, but suffered from the "Status Quo is God" and "Joss never lets anything good happen" issues.

The problem here is that the only way to make the Hegemonizing Swarm an interesting enemy is to perturb its goal towards goodness, which then requires perturbing its enemies' goals towards goodness, more so than your normal survivalist freedom fighters or real-world moral idealists actually achieve, and then before you know it you've got everyone around you throwing up because your story is too wretchedly idealistic ;-).

  Or even, rather than just Kill All Humans Because Kill All Humans, to be killing all humans as Stage One in a plan to extend the lifespan of the universe and push back heat death for as long as possible?

That's just Kyubee and the Anti-Spirals (which should probably be the name of a band that plays anime music). Actually, no: Kyubee had a multitude of real civilizations - highly-developed, space-going civilizations - who depended on his inflicting eldritch horror on adolescent human girls. His cause had some kind of moral weight, even by human standards. /Just/ extending the lifespan of the universe /without any living things anywhere/ is just old-fashioned Anti-Spiral evil.
