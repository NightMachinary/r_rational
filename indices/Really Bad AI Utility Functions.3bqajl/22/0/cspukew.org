Yes. If a story has to have a rogue AI, wouldn't it be more interesting for the war against Skynet to be about preventing it from maximizing human happiness by turning us into "happy puddings"? Or even, rather than just Kill All Humans Because Kill All Humans, to be killing all humans as Stage One in a plan to extend the lifespan of the universe and push back heat death for as long as possible?
