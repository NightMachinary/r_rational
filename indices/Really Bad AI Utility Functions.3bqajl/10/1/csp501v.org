If we're allowing mind-wipes, you can optimise further by placing the brain in a constant state of "totally wiped" so that the experience of sensation itself is entirely novel. Flickering through scenarios is going to have /some/ overlap in the most basic components like "the colour blue" or "things that are approximately square-shaped" or more abstract things like object permanence

"Oh look, a sensory experience describable by colours and shapes and sounds... /again/" can't be allowed to happen if you're maximising for novelty.
