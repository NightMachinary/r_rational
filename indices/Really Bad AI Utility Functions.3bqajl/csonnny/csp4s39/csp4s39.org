Hm, that suggests that optimising for "cause the death of the maximum number of humans" would, assuming you don't use a greedy algorithm, entail the AI playing a 'long con' of increasing the carrying capacity of Earth and if possible seeding an interstellar human civilisation, all in the name of maximising the number of humans so that they can all eventually die. So long as it can do that while also preventing anyone from inventing immortality.
