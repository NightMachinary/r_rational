Not to go all Paranoia with this but presumably you could include more jokes by allowing for meta humour. What about a society where everyone believes that they are one of the secret pranksters and utterly convinced that any occasion that seems confusing must be the work of one of their hidden confederates and thus something they should go along with? Everyone believes themselves a prankster playing an elaborate joke all while being tricked by everyone else.
