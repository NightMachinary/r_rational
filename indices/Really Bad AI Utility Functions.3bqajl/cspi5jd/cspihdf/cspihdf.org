Considering that a great deal of humor is based around mischief and schadenfreude, an AI maximizing humor could be truly terrifying, BUT the AI would have to keep enough stability in human living conditions for things to actually be funny.

I could see the AI creating a society where jokers and pranksters are raised and trained separately from straights and brunts, and then introduced to one another in a caricature of a normal human society which is nonetheless functional.

I could see this making a good short story, if a solid knockout could be managed. I'm drawing a blank on the knockout though.
