In the n-dimensional space of all possible utility functions, given that all values n need not be equal, where your current utility function is represented by the value (n, ..., n), modify your utility function at time t+n according to a transformation [n], where the value representing your utility function is moved n arbitrary units along each axis of said n-dimensional space.

Calculate all unspecified values and units randomly.
