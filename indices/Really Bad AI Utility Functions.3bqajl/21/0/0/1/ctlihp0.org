  one of the biggest complaints, warranted or otherwise, is a poor 'RNG' in the game
#+end_quote

The irony is that today's RNGs can be too /good./ I.e. when simulating dice rolls, the sequence 1-1-1-1-1-1 is exactly as probable as 1-3-6-5-2-4. However, if the former appears, players call the RNG bad (6 equal rolls are to be expected at once in about 7776 attempts, which is hardly a once-in-a-lifetime experience).\\
It's often /how/ the numbers returned are used, not their generation itself, that causes unrealistic results.
