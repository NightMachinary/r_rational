/That/ thing can be caused by two factors: -

1) The RNG is crappy (some of those are still around) and produces too many values near the end(s).\\
13 /tails/ in a row are 1 in 8192, but failing 13 95% chances is 1 in 81 920 000 000 000 000.\\
Even 8 failures at 90% are 1:100 000 000.

2) The game doesn't tell you the real chances. For example, if you rolled a failure, the actual chances are lowered for the next roll. (In many cases, the opposite is tried; after a failure, the cances are improved, and lowered after a success.) Another possibility, the RNG is "pre-rolled" and you tend to get the same result in a row. Some are actually saved somewhere; reloading after a failure will always reproduce the failure unless you try something different. Anti-save-scumming.

I remember /Fallout/, where a "95%" chance was below 90%; in that case, the RNG was crappy; a 5% chance returned way too many /successes/, either.
