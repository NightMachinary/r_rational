True. I occasionally play a game with a truly horrible implementation of a RNG. Almost every time I play, I have a one in 10,000 series of events. I've failed 13 times in a row on a 95% success rate chance before, and failing 6-8 times in a row on 90% success rates happens a couple times a week. I can't see the code, but I can see the end result. As you say, it might be that the RNG is fine, but the implementation is poor.
