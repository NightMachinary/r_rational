If you have an objection to it, better say it explicitly! I can't construct your objection for you. But maybe I should change it for clarity's sake to: "/I wouldn't mind getting transformed into some entities that would have extremely little resemblance to my current self to the point of being completely unrecognizable/".

  If your definition of "I" can't tell you whether to rather be a more experienced version of yourself or a bundle of feelings and a naked consciousness, you need a better "I".
