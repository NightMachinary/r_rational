I tried to write a story about this once, but it was godawful and I deleted it.

The premise was that we're all in a simulation that simulates free will by calculating as many possible futures as it can, and somehow chooses between them semirandomly. This was a major issue with my story since I have no idea how that would work.

Processing resources per individual increase quadratically by how influential that person is - the more people they could affect, and the more possible ways these people could be affected, the higher the required resources are.

It turns out that there's a relatively small number of resource hoggers, who end up affecting far more people in more ways than anyone else. This small group of people take up the majority of processing power.

To save some processing power, the simulation limits possible futures these people could take. Since the creators of the simulation were big on free will, the simulation is limited in the ways it can pick futures.

A lot of the time, these resource hogs are be nipped in the bud - the simulation can see that they might grow up to be resource hogs, so it tries to subtly change their environments to discourage resource hogging without impugning too much on free will.

Sometimes, however, it blocks futures in interesting ways that happen to end up as cool stories. I did have a character planned that had a sort of plot armor, because many futures that ended in his death or incapacitation would have led to more processor use. I also had someone who was an absolute genius, but things would always go wrong at the last minute.

There's probably lots of issues with my premise but I had fun thinking through the possibilities a situation like this could have.
