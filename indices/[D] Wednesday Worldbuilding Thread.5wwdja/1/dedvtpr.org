If a villainous agent who found themselves in the early 1970's with the ability to give out powers ala Cauldron from /Worm/ had genocidal motivations (minus mutations and space whales), what would be the most effective way to destabilize human society and cause humanities extinction?

Constraints on the agents abilities: They cannot gain powers, and are in most ways baseline human.

They don't know all that much about earth and humanity, nor that much about the technical details of the powers. As far as they know the powers are magic. Safe to use, but they are effectively black boxes. The powers come in the form of small colorful potions. They have effectively infinite potions, but must administer them personally.

The powers are exceptionally varied, but spider man's powerset (Web, Climbing, Increased Strength/Durability, Minor Precognition) would not be considered especially strong nor week in this setting.

Possibilities could include:

1) Cold War Stuff. (Igniting the cold war by giving powers solely suited for combat to both sides, ect)

2) Brainwashing children into believing that humanity must be eradicated, then making them super soldiers.

3) Arming existing radicals with powers.

Unfortunately, 1 and 3 both require human political knowledge, and 2 requires human psychological knowledge. So I imagine their first steps would be to learn all they can about humanity and to remain out of the spotlight until he has a plan of action.

I'm trying to think of methods that the villain in a story I am writing may consider, and the way the world would react to their actions.
