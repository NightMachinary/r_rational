Power choice seems the key here, so that's probably where education ought to start. It made a world of difference for Cauldron.

If the powers don't work on other ill-tempered large animals (domestic bulls seem a pretty good choice, and we keep them in massive feed lots for ease of access) then I recommend the least mentally capable humans the villain can find. Scared and confused is almost as good as malicious, if they're powerful enough and unable to communicate effectively.

Watching humanity react to these wandering disasters will provide both the psychological education your villain requires and a state of panic required to simplify human government interactions and hone in on other more devious plans.

Seriously though, the world's domestic cattle gaining superpowers is one of the most terrifying things I've ever imagined.
