So, based on a post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5vqlm9/rules_for_the_effective_hero/de49zx1/][last week]] I was thinking about how one might rationally justify plot armor as an actual superpower.

Stories are human constructs, fit together after the fact and kept purposefully incomplete. Sense of purpose- imputed cause and effect -are what makes them memorable, but such things are creations of human minds rather than inherent to human events. /Good/ stories, the ones worth telling, carry an implicit promise: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFI9UuC_fc][I am telling you this for a reason.]]

That promise is the plot armor. In order for heroes to be protected somebody has to know in advance that their stories are worth telling. So it isn't heros as individuals who have the superpower, it is their contribution to a satisfying story which keeps them secure.

In order for this to be the case within a rational fiction, some intelligence with the ability to manipulate reality has to:

- care about stories
- have a satisfying ending in mind
- align events to meet that ending

The obvious example of such an intelligence is an author. Characters becoming aware they live in fictional universes is already a trope.

What I haven't seen much of is minor characters gaming their actions to take on prominence in such stories, using the author's preferences to tailor their actions and personalities such that they're more attractive to the author's needs.

Worse, such stories aren't even self-aware since poking fun at our own story preferences is cloyingly meta. So interventionalist gods or simulationist AIs might be better targets.

So: You know you're living in a world of stories. You've met main characters from time to time, you may even have felt the favored fortune of assisting them in their needs, but recently a close friend of yours died in order to provide the motivation a hero needed to leave their rut and cross the threshold of adventure.

How do you become the last hero? How do you use its own story preferences to turn the tables on the intelligence in charge and tear the whole thing down?
