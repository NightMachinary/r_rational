I have an idea for how this might work. It would take place in some world where godlike entities are attempting to construct a mythology rather than allow humans to develop their own. It could be a fantasy world where gods/spirits actively interfere or a sci-fi future with superintelligences manipulating memes and ideologies by creating inspirational anecdotes.

However, because Deus Ex Machinas are boring, the "authors" need to make their actions seem like luck on the part of the characters. They usually can't take direct action so they just make sure people are in the right place and time to make the decisions the authors' want them to. Some authors could have different methods of accomplishing their goals and there may even be some sort of "audience" judging their success.

If the story is going to be about fighting against this narrative causality, then you need to include some fatal flaw in the system that can be exploited. Maybe stories are "published" before reaching a conclusion so they frequently go off the rails, or the story has to end before being published so no one knows for sure how they'll be received.

As for how this story would actually work, I'm not sure. There'd either have to be some way for the protagonist to "peek behind the curtain" or everyone would know about this and not really care. I find neither an especially attractive option since they're very difficult to get right without hurting the story's actual narrative, so I'm hoping there's another option I haven't thought of.

[[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] did something /a little/ like this with Shadows of the Limelight, but the problem I had with that story was that all the characters came across as reality tv stars. I don't find it interesting to entertaining to see characters create the story they're telling to a in-universe audience when I want to have a story told /to me/. The magic system forced them all to be narcissists putting on a show, but I want characters to have depth.

Nearest I can think of is to write this story as if it were about actors putting on a show. They're performers who do their job either because they want to or have to, but the story is about the people behind the masks rather than the masks they put on. I don't know how to reconcile that with the fact that the plot is about the show they're putting on, but it's the best I've got. Thanks for letting me explore this interesting idea.
