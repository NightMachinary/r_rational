A charm exists (HP universe, my own AU) which can enchant an object to have a frictionless surface or to increase its friction.

This, when applied to clothing can reduce drag when flying at high speeds, and also make cool skates, sleds, etc. Wheels would become obsolete unless you're wanting to use them around muggles (in which case frictionless bearings and axles are awesome). Faster projectiles would be a thing as well.

On the other side, gripping gloves for climbing like a gecko might work, or really effective velcro.

What other daily life improvements can be implemented with this charm? Or what combat applications could be used (other than the obvious use of charming random bits of the ground in front of your opponent with random degrees of friction to impede motion)?
