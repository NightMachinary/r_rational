Yep, kinda like the kung fu thing. :)

My original idea was that you could learn multiple skills as long as you trained them, but having a cap on the number might be interesting. I've been debating whether or not you could hypertrain other skills too like running, dodging, reflexes, etc. They're necessary for combat, so theoretically they should improve to an extent. But I'm not sure if you could use this ability to, like, be a fast runner or juggle flaming swords or something.

If the ability could be given to other people, it would be interesting to see what comes out of that. We could potentially end up with some "Into the Badlands" level of martial arts battles.
