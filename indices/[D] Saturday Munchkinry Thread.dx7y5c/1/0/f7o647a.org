Sorta like a toned down version of The Matrix's /I know kung fu/ brain upload?

If you can only choose and master one (up to the degree that your body's current physical limitations allow), then the ability sounds relatively limited by itself because it doesn't allow you to exceed human limitations. Thus, mastering something like shooting, where the gun is a force multiplier that other humans can't react to, is much better than CQC or other melee limb-waving. But if this magic ability were accessible to a lot of people, then some forms of combat might fill a niche in non-lethal scenarios.
