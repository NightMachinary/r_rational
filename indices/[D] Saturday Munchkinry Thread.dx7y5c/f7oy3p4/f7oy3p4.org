Time travel is something that is extremely munchkinable, but what about a [One Minute Time Machine]([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY][www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY]])? Basically, whenever you press a button on a box, you mentally travel to an alternate timeline one minute in the past and your self in the previous timeline dies.

All I've thought of so far is just your generic "undo/redo a thing" (e.g. gambling to make money) and executing people if you get them to press the button. What other uses are there?
