One thing to wonder is whether increasing the friction of an object would also make it better at stopping things that aren't sliding on it. For example, if I have a shield, and I increase its friction, would it now be better at defending against attacks? I would think so, especially if the attacks penetrate the shield, because now they would be rubbing up against the shield and so slowing down.

Unfortunately, since this is the HP universe, most combat uses non-physical spells, so your friction wouldn't do anything.
