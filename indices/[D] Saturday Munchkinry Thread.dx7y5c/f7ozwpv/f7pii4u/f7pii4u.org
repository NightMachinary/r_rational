Oddly enough, outside of industrial processes, I don't think frictionless surfaces are all that useful. I guess they'd also be useful for physics 101 demonstrations, maybe you could also procure some massless rope.

Frictionless surfaces have all sorts of interesting possibilities for sports and games though. Frictionless billiards might be dull (the balls take ages to stop and always stop touching each other or walls), but if you could combine it with perfectly elastic collisions and impose a time limit to take your shots, that becomes a very different game. If you have some sort of repelling charm to get around a frictionless surface (ice skates need friction to turn you), but as soon as you've added that you've got wizard hockey.
