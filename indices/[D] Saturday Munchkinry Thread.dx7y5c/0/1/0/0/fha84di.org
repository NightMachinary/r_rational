Depending how fast he is, he has basically either local or global omniscience. He would be amazing at information gathering. He can tell you exactly where your targets are, how many there are, are they carrying obvious weapons or items of note.

He could sell his services to government who wants to know how many bears there are in the forest. Or police, who would like to know if the criminal has hostages, weapons, other criminals to help him...

He could learn to use a sling as a weapon. Knit one from his hair, use rocks that are laying around. He should find someone mad scientist who could grow his hair in a lab so he could have rope made of it and bag criminals with it.

He can stop instantly, so he could just stop in front of a running enemy and have his leg in a convenient position to trip them. Or just kick them, it is a free hit even if the damage is just what a normal human can do!
