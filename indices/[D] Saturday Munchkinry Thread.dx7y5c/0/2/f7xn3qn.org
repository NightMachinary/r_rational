Hegadi moves from place A to place B at pretty immense speeds. Importantly, there is air between A and B.

Hegadi must either displace or phase through the intervening air. If he displaces it, then his running is followed by a boom as the air rushes back into the suddenly-displaced area. At the same time, loose objects in the area get blown around by the motion of the air, and the atmosphere gets stirred up in all sorts of interesting ways.

Can he disarm tornados or hurricanes by running through them in certain patterns? (I think he's faster than their winds already, so the wind speed shouldn't bother him. Maybe the pressure differential is an issue?)

Alternatively, he might phase through air. In which case, can he also phase through other things? Can he enter a locked room if he moves at enough speed? If someone locks their keys in a car, can he run into the car and unlock it from the inside with the keys that are already there? (Does he need to breathe while he runs?)
