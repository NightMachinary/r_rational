That's something I've been wondering about. Would the skill cap with your current physical limits, so building muscle/endurance would allow you to increase your skill? Or can it go beyond your physical limits to a certain extent? As for superhuman abilities, I think the power would be completely broken if you could train yourself into a one punch man. So there probably is some power cap related to your general physical capabilities, but it might still be beyond what a normal human could accomplish with training alone.
