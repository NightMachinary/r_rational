Okay so I had an idea I'm playing around with. Suppose you have a magic ability that allows you to become more easily skilled in combat manouvers (shooting accuracy, hand to hand, swordfighting). You have to specifically practice the skill you want to improve in for a designated amount of time, and then you'd be accomplished in only that skill. However, it would take much less time than normal to completely master it. You also would not increase your muscle mass proportionally, so you're not going to get ripped. But if you want to become a professional sniper? Might take 2-4 weeks of practice.

Any suggestions for how to use this power? What about for adding conditions or limitations to its use?
