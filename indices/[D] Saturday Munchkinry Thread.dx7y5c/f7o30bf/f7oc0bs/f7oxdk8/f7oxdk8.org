Interesting, I didn't think of that! It would make sense for skills to get rusty quickly, and could lead to awkward situations if you need a skill but haven't practiced in a while. So you'd have to be strategic about how often you train each one, and disciplined in sticking with that plan. If not, you turn back into a novice again.
