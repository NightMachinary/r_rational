Not really an answer, but my immediate reaction here is that I would enjoy this superpower. It's disappointing seeming in terms of making you rich or doing good for the world, but you get to travel on the weekends, or maybe even in your evenings after work (the acceleration sounds like it takes a few minutes, not hours). Assuming you can find an understanding hotel chain or the like.

No such thing as long-distance relationships when you have this super power. And the military might not bother trying to recruit you, kidnappers won't bother you, etc.
