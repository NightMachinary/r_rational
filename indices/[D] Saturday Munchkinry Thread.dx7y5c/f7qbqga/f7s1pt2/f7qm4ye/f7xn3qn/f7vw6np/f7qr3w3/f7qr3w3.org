He's still awesome for carrying information around when emails aren't an option. Delivering info to an interdimensional historian is only one example. Other examples:

- If the information that needs to be transferred needs to also be highly secure. It is probably easier to hack emails over the internet than to hack Hegadi's mind, even or especially in a world with superpowers. So Hegadi could totally find employment as a fast secure message carrier in many intelligence agencies/security companies/etc.
- If the information needs to be transferred to/from a location where electronic equipment is being deliberately hampered. War zones for example. Jammers, EMP, targeted destruction of power plants, communication satellites other facilities may make electronic communication unreliable. In which case Hegadi is now a highly valuable information channel between the war zone and headquarters, or other places it may need to go. So various militaries and other combat groups would be interested in Hegadi as a countermeasure for information jamming.
- If the information that needs to be transferred is difficult to convert into electronic formats (maybe only at the sender's location). Examples: tastes, smells, beauty, other "human experiences". If, for whatever reason, such a property of two objects needs to be compared, and one object is a great distance away from the other, then Hegadi is the best and possibly only option. So Hegadi may be of interest to some scientific research groups.
