Another big thing: He speeds up but his momentum does not increase.

This means that his mass must decrease proportionally to his speed.

Assuming that Baibhav's speed is capped only by the distance of a running start, and that portals exist (to give him an infinite-distance running start), Baibhav could survive entering the event horizon of a black hole (and come back out). He couldn't pull anything back out from the black hole, but if there are wormhole teleportation/time travel shenanigans in this world, Baibhav can abuse them endlessly.
