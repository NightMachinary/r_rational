Oh nice! I didn't think about exploiting the fact that he leaves stuff behind when he moves! I wonder what exactly gets carried and what doesn't. Does he leave behind all germs and thus can enter sterile environments without contaminating them? (But how would that work without killing the beneficial bacteria that his body needs?) Do any implants in his body get left behind? Could you embed a computer chip and so have him carry it? What about a pacemaker?

Could you somehow store a large amount of information into his body but not his mind (if the information needs to be kept secret from him too)? Maybe an intricate tattoo that would be scanned, or injecting him with artificially designed proteins/DNA/etc. (maybe stored in dead bacteria or hair) that encode a complex message?

EDIT: More thoughts: he would be useful in various diplomatic situations where you need to prove you have peaceful intentions, because it would be incredibly easy for Hegadi to prove that he is unarmed and not carrying a wire: just move at high speed for a moment and he loses any such things.

Also, since Hegadi isn't starving to death after moving at super speeds, I'm assuming that the nutrients in his body don't get left behind. Stuff him full of nutrients at one end, and extract them at the other end of the journey. That would be fast transport for anything that can be put in his body without killing him or passing some "unnaturalness" threshold. Hegadi could be a great paramedic: inject himself with extra blood at the hospital, run to the emergency patient, transfer his blood to the patient. Especially if Hegadi has blood type O.
