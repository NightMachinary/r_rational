Mundane answer: search. Missing people, criminals, rare species, surface signs of ore deposits - many people who hire whole expeditions or search parties for months can instead hire Baibhav Hegadi for a day.

If we are allowed to bring in metas and portals and such - his potential is limitless. Maybe there is a meta who can teleport, but only to familiar people - with Hegadi she can teleport to anywhere within a continent. Maybe his hair retain meta-properties even when not in contact with him and can be used by Tinkers to create hyper-efficient batteries and scalable quantum computers. Maybe there is a powerful but slow ghost-like meta who can consensually possess Hegadi. Maybe meta-gangs would really like a reliable and nonthreatening messenger because guys who regularly turn into flaming dragons and pools of radioactive acid can't be expected to have a phone on them at all times.
