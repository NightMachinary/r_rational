The fact that Baibhav always leaves everything behind may be the greatest strength of the power: traveling through areas that would injure anyone else with acid or disease.

The fact that he's already going through interdimensional portals is a pretty big deal. Presumably, interdimensional portals have a /disease contamination/ problem that is relatively unfeasible to solve if the portal is not in a fixed location.

Baibhav can pass messages between dimensions without worrying about cross contamination, because he leaves the diseases behind when he goes.
