It depends on how flashy and noticeable he is when he is traversing, and how much area he can search when running at high speeds.

The restrictions make it so that he is the best man for the specific situation where someone wants information to travel to a place where electronic communication isn't possible or avoided AND they want to lower the chance that accurate coordinates would be found. If he isn't noticeable and his ability to search is decent, he could deliver information to hidden criminal or governmental bases. Since he can't bring anything other than himself with him, that means tracking devices would never be found on him, which may be an issue for other speedsters.
