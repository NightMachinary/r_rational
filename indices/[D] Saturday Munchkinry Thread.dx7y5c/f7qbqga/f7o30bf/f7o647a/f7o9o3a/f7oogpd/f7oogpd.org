Oh, I misunderstood, thought it was one ability only. So the ability doesn't grant any physical gainz, but does give theoretical/technical know-how. Yeah, you'll need to draw a fine line between combat-related ability and general motor coordination/performance, as well as associated skills and knowledge (like exploiting human anatomy or the environment).

I think there are a few Worm fics where the power is similar - like Victor's skill thievery (e.g. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/claim-the-spoils-victor-taylor.708364/][Claim the Spoils]]) or even [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/%C3%9Cber][canon Uber's power]]:

  Ãœber's power grants him a high level of skill at anything he tries his hand at, with better skill the more he focuses.[3] Wildbow has commented that people tend to overestimate his power - "it would perhaps be better to say that he's able to learn techniques."[4]

  He can for example do a martial arts recovery but does not have the broader skill, proper balance and poise a real martial artist would have.[5] He could probably focus in order to become an expert at escaping handcuffs or ropes if he was restrained.[6]
