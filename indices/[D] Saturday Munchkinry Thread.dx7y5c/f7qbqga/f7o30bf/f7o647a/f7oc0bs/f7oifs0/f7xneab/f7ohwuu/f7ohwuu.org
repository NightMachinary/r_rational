One thing that could be done to maybe abuse this ability is to add a 'while' to any skill you train. For example: is the skill 'shooting while reading' a combat skill? What about 'reading while shooting'? Because if either of those can be trained, then you can effectively train speedreading, because taking in information quicker will allow you to glance at your book less, and thus get better at the skill. At the same time, you're indirectly training a non-combat skill. Sure, maybe you're only able to speed-read while at the shooting range, but that's better than not being able to do that. Replace 'reading' with any number of time-sensitive skills, like typing entries into spreadsheets, or even more complex tasks like writing, and even if your talent doesn't directly translate to doing the skill on its own, you'll still learn something indirectly which you can attempt to fit into the non-combat version of that skill as a side thing.
