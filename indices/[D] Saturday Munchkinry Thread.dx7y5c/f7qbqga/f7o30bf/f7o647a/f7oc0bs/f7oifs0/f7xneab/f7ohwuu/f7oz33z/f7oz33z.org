Hmm, I think I get what you're saying, using combat situations to train non-combat skills. I think success would probably be determined by how necessary the skill is for survival. Like, being able to understand Morse code might be important in combat situations, so you might gain a skill boost in that. Piloting a ship while manning the gun, also possible. But reading a crime novel while firing a revolver probably wouldn't make you a speed reader, since you don't need that skill to survive or be better at shooting accurately.
