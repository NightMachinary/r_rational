One limitation that would be interesting and I haven't seen done before is if you also forgot skills just as fast. Which only makes sense if you think about it: if your ability means weeks of training are years of training for other people, then weeks of not training should be years of not training for other people. If you don't use a combat maneuver for a few weeks, you should become really really rusty.

Then, since there are only so many hours in a week, and you probably won't want to spend every waking moment training, that puts a soft cap on the number of skills you can be a master in at any time.

One good way to use it is to then rotate training among a large number of different skills, and regularly show off any skills you currently have mastered. That way it looks like you are a master of all kinds of skills (when in reality you only have a few mastered at any time).
