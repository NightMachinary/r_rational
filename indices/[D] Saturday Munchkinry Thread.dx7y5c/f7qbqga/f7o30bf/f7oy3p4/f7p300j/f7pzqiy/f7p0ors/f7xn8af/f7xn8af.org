Can I computerise it - i.e. carry out one minute of computation and then send the results a minute into the past? If so, can I exploit this to locate any undiscovered prime that can be /confirmed/ in under a minute?

There's a whole lot of other potential problems in which it's easier to confirm a solution than to search for one...
