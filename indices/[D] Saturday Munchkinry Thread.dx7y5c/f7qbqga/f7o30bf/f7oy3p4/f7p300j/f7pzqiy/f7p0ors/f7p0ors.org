At the very least, keeping your hand ready to press the button as soon as you wake up would let you essentially time travel an entire day by repeatedly pressing the button. You could avoid excessive scrutiny from gambling by just winning a single lottery by confirming the numbers and shifting back hours before the deadline to buy tickets.

If mental fatigue doesn't carry over between shifts, then you essentially have the power to create perfect days so long as you aren't unexpectedly incapacitated, which would be pretty broken as far as superpowers go.
