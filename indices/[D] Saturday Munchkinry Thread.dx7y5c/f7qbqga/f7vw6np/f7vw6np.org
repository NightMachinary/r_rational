There's an oddly-defined boundary between things that are and are not Baibhav Hegadi, and that might be exploitable.

  He couldn't even run out for lunch, except to a restaurant that would serve him without credit cards while he was wearing only a posing pouch.

It looks like food sitting in his digestive tract counts as Baibhav, because otherwise he'd have to fast to go fast, and he /definitely/ wouldn't be able to go out for lunch at far-away eccentric restaurants.

Are there any superheroes in this setting who can shrink? Specifically, are there any who can shrink small enough to ride in Baibhav's stomach? If so, he could be the world's first vore-based means of ultra-high-speed travel.

(More prosaically, he could probably transport digestible medicines quickly to anywhere they're urgently needed, as long as they're wrapped in a protective container that'll take more than a minute to digest.)
