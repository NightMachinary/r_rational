From a possible upcoming Bruce Kent story:

#+begin_quote
  Baibhav Hegadi is sometimes cited as a case study of why even the most useless-seeming superpower may be marketable to someone.

  At his top official speed, Baibhav Hegadi can run fast enough to cross continents in under a minute. Wikipedia lists him as the 35th fastest meta on Earth when traversing all intervening space.

  Known limitations of Hegadi's power include:

  Hegadi doesn't have momentum proportional to how fast he's moving. He can't hit harder than normal.

  It takes time for Hegadi to accelerate. In the first second he starts moving his fist, it doesn't go faster than an ordinary mortal's fist. He can slow down almost instantly, but afterwards it takes time for him to speed up again.

  Hegadi can't carry anything that isn't himself. When he's using his power, he can only wear briefs knitted out of his own hair.

  To sum up: Hegadi couldn't deliver packages across the seas. He couldn't punch harder than an ordinary mortal, or fight with faster reflexes. He couldn't race through a building too quickly for cameras to catch him. He could memorize and carry messages, but there's a cheaper way to send those across continents, and it's called email. He couldn't even run out for lunch, except to a restaurant that would serve him without credit cards while he was wearing only a posing pouch.

  [[/r/masks]] voted Baibhav Hegadi as #4 on the list of "world's most disappointing superpowers", as measured by the contrast between apparent power and actual usability. He was the 35th fastest person on Earth, and he ran an electric-scooter dealership in Amalapuram.

  Shortly after that vote, the Masculine Mongoose ran into an interdimensional historian, who offered him benefits in exchange for being notified of the time and place if the Mongoose was doing something of interest. This interdimensional being could only be reached by going through an alternate-world portal in an undisclosed location, and crossing a long stretch of desert where radios didn't work.

  So the Mongoose hired Baibhav Hegadi to act as his personal messenger, racing over to tell the Hilbert-Space Historian whenever the Mongoose was about to go into action. It went to show, said the Mongoose, that few superpowers were truly useless.

Am I missing anything about other people who'd be bidding big bucks on Hegadi's services? Or rather, does his power need to be nerfed further to prevent that?
