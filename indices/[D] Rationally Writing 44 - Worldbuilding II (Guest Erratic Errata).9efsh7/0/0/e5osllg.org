MM is fantastic subversion. If you haven't already checked out Psycho-Pass or Fate: Zero, I'd recommend them: they're not the same genre, but they're by the same writer, and are both fantastic :) So is Thunderbolt Fantasy, though some people are turned off by the fact that it's not /technically/ an anime...

Hunter x Hunter is also pretty fantastic if you like anime that subverts genre expectations, but it has a pretty slow start. It's a basic shonen anime for like 20ish episodes before it started to really show what made it special, for me.
