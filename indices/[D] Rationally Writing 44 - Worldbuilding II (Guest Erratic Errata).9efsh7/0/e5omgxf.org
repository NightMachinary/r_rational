the conversation about anime reconstructions reminds me of how I got into anime, which was through /Madoka Magica/, a deconstruction of magical girl anime. It was my gateway drug into anime and I've been trying to find something as good ever since which has caused me to go through a lot of trash (EDIT: I see that you end up mentioning this one later :) )
