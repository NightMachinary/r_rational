Guest writer Erratic Errata joins us this time to discuss more aspects of world building, particularly in his serial [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]], which I'm assuming most of you are reading, but if you're not... seriously, get on that.
