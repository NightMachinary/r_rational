I wouldn't really say that evangelion is like Madoka. Even leaving aside quality (Eva isn't bad, but not nearly on the same level), Gen Urobuchi wasn't lying when he said he was writing a story with a happy ending; a combination deconstruction / reconstruction like Madoka is just fundamentally different from a dark deconstruction like evangelion.
