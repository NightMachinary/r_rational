Have you watched Evangelion? I think that the reception to Madoka is pretty similar to Eva, in the sense that Madoka was a reaction to magical girl shows that nonetheless managed to appeal to a lot of people who don't have a deep and intimate familiarity with the magical girl genre, in much the same way that Evangelion was a reaction to the super robot shows of the 80's that still seems to resonate a lot with audiences that aren't really familiar with the super robot genre.

Evangelion and Madoka have a lot of thematic similarities, both playing with the idea of taking the underlying genre premise of "hey kids, wouldn't it be cool if you had powers that allowed you to fight monsters and be a hero who saves the day" and flipping it on its head to arrive with the conclusion that "actually, battling monsters can be a really traumatizing experience, and emotionally volatile teenagers are ill-equipped to deal with the stresses of being a soldier; being a hero actually really sucks."
