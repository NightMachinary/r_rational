Doesn't matter. It fits. Look at the fight between Black and White. Black used several corpses to attack White with and Black is just a regular Named.

Powerful, but compared to Cat he is average in terms of powers as far as Fully realized Names go. He's not even the last Royal of the Fae.

Cat raised an entire contingent of Immortals sworn to Summer. They were literally the STRONGEST rank and file Warriors of an OPPOSING element. A couple thousand normal mooks should be paltry in comparison. More so if she has Hierophant to guide/boost her powers.

And the reason why I am fixated on her new Name being Death Knight is because she's a Squire and in the absence of outside intervention (like an Angel giving an upgrade by doing some story relevant thing like pulling a sword out of a stone), she HAS to become a Knight. Because It's said somewhere in Book 1 or 2 that 'a Squire MUST become a Knight'.

Also, Death Knight fits with her aspects. A living thing Rises and she Takes their life away causing them to Fall (die). Her Necromancy is also a dead giveaway.
