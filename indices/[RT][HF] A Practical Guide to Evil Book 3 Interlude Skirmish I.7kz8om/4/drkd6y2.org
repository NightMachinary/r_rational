I think the entire or vast majority of the 15th will be turned into Undead in this fight. Then Cat will say something awesome like 'Not even Death will excuse you from my service' then promptly use her Winter Powers and Necromancy Powers to raise the entire 15th, heralding the coming of the Dead Legion.

At their head will be Catherine Foundling, once the Squire now the Death Knight.
