It was interesting how they saw the gallowborne. In the end Cat really did end up executing all those deserters, she just took a while to do it. All of the orginals are pretty much dead, right?

Outsiders don't see how much she actually does care for them, and how she's earned they're loyalty, how they march willingly into hell and beyond on her behalf. They just see a death sentence.
