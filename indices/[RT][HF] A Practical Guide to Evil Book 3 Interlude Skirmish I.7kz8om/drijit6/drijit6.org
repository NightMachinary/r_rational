It's interesting how many titles Cat is given. The Black Queen, Warlord, Duchess of Moonless Nights... It seems like Cat has done more as a Squire than most people do with a full Name in terms of building her own legend. Will this mean she will grow into a more unique, stronger Name?

As for the chapter, it was good to see the battle from other perspectives. It adds a lot of tension (does Cat know what's happening?) and it grounds the world somewhat.
