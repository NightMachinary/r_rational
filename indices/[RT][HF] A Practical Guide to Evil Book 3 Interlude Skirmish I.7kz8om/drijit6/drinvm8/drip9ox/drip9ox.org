Yes, it was mentioned that the less common names are weaker in terms of raw power, but I expect that they can make up for it in terms of having powers people are less likely to be able to deal with or predict.

I am still expecting some sort of narrative cliff where everything just goes completely off the rails, like what happened a few chapters back in The Good Student. Possibly this will happen the next time we see Black.
