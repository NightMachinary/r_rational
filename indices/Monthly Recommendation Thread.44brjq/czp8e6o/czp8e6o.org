I recommend the science fiction/mystery comic Private Eye by Brian K. Vaughan, Marcos Martin and Muntsa Vicente.

It's set in 2076, in a world where everything on the cloud was leaked, and as a result there is no more internet, and people are extremely private with their lives and even their identities. They even wear masks at all times in public.

Professions that are liable to infringe on people's privacy, such as journalists or private detectives, are either extremely regulated or outlawed, and the story follows one of these, an unlicensed journalist.

It's also an experiment (thus far successful) into online, self-published, DRM-free, pay-what-you-want distribution, [[http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/tpeye][here]].
