I'm three-quarters of the way through my second reading of (the four completed volumes of) /[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898][Look to the West]]/, an alternate-history book based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales][a British prince]]'s being exiled to North America and subsequently usurping the British throne.\\

[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=354968][The in-progress thread for Volume Five]]

/[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps][GURPS]]/ is, in my opinion, a very cool roleplaying game. It's generally intended to be more realistic than the abstractions of, say, /Dungeons & Dragons/ or /D20 Modern/ (though the GM can always allow "cinematic" optional rules), and has [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books][many dozens of comprehensively-researched sourcebooks]] (with [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html][bibliographies]]!). Probably the most impressive /GURPS/ sourcebook is /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/vehicles][Vehicles]]/, which provides ludicrously-detailed instructions on writing up game statistics for just about any conceivable vehicle. /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Space][GURPS Space]]/ includes a method for randomly generating an alien species (both physical and mental characteristics) /and/ a process for randomly generating /an entire star system/ (not just the presence or absence of planets and moons, but their temperatures, atmospheres, available resources, populations, government types, constructed facilities...). /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/thaumatology][GURPS Thaumatology]]/ includes guidelines for making magic systems of many different kinds, or just modifying the existing one in minor or major ways. The list goes on...
