For those who saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3zkruy/monthly_recommendation_thread/cyn8k3u][my earlier recommendation]] of "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4121383/chapters/9290023][The Trial of Darth Vader]]", I'd just like to say that the final chapter was posted recently. If you were waiting for it to be finished, you need wait no longer.
