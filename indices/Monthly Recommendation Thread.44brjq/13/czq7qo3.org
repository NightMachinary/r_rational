/The Dagger and the Coin/ by Daniel Abraham. The final book releases March eighth. Jacket inside and back of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41j9xk/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/cz4t6s6][first book]].

Characters consistently behave as one would expect given their characterizations. I think it's rational, with minor elements of the first two bullet points in the side bar's description of rationalist fiction.
