If anyone wants to watch an incredibly fun TV show that's like the fusion of The Princess Bride and Monty Python, then you totally need to check out [[http://www.hulu.com/galavant][Galavant.]]

It's not rational, per se. In fact, it's actually quite silly. But it's also very witty, incredibly genre-savvy, and as you go along you find yourself rooting for the heroes and the villains alike because you can't bring yourself to truly hate any of them.

Oh yeah, and it's also a musical. But with legends like Alan Menken and Glenn Slater behind the music, the quality of it is superb. I can't recommend the show enough.
