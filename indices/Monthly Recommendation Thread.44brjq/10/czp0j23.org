Manga/Anime:\\
/Berserk/

Dark fantasy. Torture, gore and sex. The holy trifecta of my (probably immature) tastes. Berserk delivers all in spades.

Berserk is one of my favorite things ever. It has compelling characters, a great world and what I find to be a feature rather than a norm, rather clear and well drawn action scenes.

I recommend the manga over the anime as the anime was probably low budget and 30% of it just stills of the characters with no animation. The manga is ongoing since 10+ years and the volume is quite dense. The manga also starts off much more slowly than the anime.
