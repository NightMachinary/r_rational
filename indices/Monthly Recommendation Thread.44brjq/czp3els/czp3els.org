I have been reading the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit][Power of habit]] by Charles Duhigg lately. I liked how habits are described as automated executable programs. From the first few chapters..

  "This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future."

  "Over time, this loop---cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward---becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges. Eventually, whether in a chilly MIT laboratory or your driveway, a habit is born."

  "Habits aren't destiny. Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced. But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit---unless you find new routines---the pattern will unfold automatically."

  "Habits never really disappear. They're encoded into the structures of our brain, and that's a huge advantage for us, because it would be awful if we had to relearn how to drive after every vacation. The problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it's always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards."

  "This explains why it's so hard to create exercise habits, for instance, or change what we eat. Once we develop a routine of sitting on the couch, rather than running, or snacking whenever we pass a doughnut box, those patterns always remain inside our heads. By the same rule, though, if we learn to create new neurological routines that overpower those behaviors---if we take control of the habit loop---we can force those bad tendencies into the background, just as Lisa Allen did after her Cairo trip. And once someone creates a new pattern, studies have demonstrated, going for a jog or ignoring the doughnuts becomes as automatic as any other habit."

Along the same vein are [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206-the-willpower-instinct?ac=1&from_search=1][The Willpower Instinct]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95708.The_Now_Habit?ac=1&from_search=1][The Now Habit]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933-willpower?ac=1&from_search=1][Willpower - Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength]]. Very much recommended.
