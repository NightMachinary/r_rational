A couple threads ago I recommended a few Game of Thrones fanfics. I'll post them here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614734/1/In-Good-Company][In Good Company]] is by far the best. It's mainly a character study that focuses on Stannis and his strained relationships with his family in an AU where he stays in King's Landing as Master of Ships instead of spending all his time at Dragonstone. Unfortunately a deadfic, but still worth reading what's there IMO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11605215/1/Hear-Me-Roar-The-Lannisters-in-the-War-of-the-Ring][Hear Me Roar: The Lannisters in the War of the Ring]] is an interesting one. It's a crossover with Lord of the Rings where the Westerlands and the Lannisters suddenly get transported into Middle Earth and get involved in the war. It's not complete, but it updates often.

I think other people here have recommended Oh God, am I the Mannis Now? and I second that. It's a decent SI fic and the main character tries to industrialize the Stormlands a bit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10379763/1/And-The-Giant-Awoke][And, the Giant Awoke]] is a fic where Tyrion escapes to Essos and uses his brains to become rich from various enterprises. It's a decent munchkin fic, though sometimes it seems like things go a bit easily for him.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48797][Westerosi Internet]] is a pretty hilarious set of crackfics with the premise that it follow canon exactly except that the characters have Instant Messaging and the Internet. The character interactions, especially with Tywin, are pretty hilarious.

As far as more general fanfics go (i.e. no munchkinry, crossover, or SI), [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/317779/chapters/511035][No Featherbed for Me]] is decent. It's an AU where Gendry is the first son of Robert and Cersei so no war happens. It follows Arya growing up and dealing with the difficulty of being forced (as a woman) to act like a medieval noble lady. This one is complete.
