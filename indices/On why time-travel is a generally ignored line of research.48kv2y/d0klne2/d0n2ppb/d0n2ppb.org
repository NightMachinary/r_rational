"The signs of successful time traveling civilizations are places where you would expect an advanced civilization to have developed, but it inexplicably never happened." Realistically some form of civilization would arise in place of time escapees?(if you believe that in all place life can arise, life will, than one form life disappearing merely sets the stage for another) Also the premise is odd to me, are you implying that every single time traveling civilization is perfectly rational?
