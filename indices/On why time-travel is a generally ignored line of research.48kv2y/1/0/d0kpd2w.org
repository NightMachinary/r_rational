No, Krona's interference is literally responsible for the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Or evil. Or the Antimatter Universe, where narrativium is reversed and the heroes always lose.

It varies with every telling, really, but "entropy" is the one the fans have latched onto.

I don't think it's ever been an enemy, though. You're probably thinking of the time Krona returned from the dead as a supervillain called Entropy.
