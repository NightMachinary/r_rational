Honestly, aside from their shared dislike and distrust of the Konoha leadership they have basically nothing in common. Orochimaru seems entirely driven by personal curiosity, whereas Naruto, aside from his current major goal of defeating "The Enemy", is always driven by his desire to help people, and to make the world a better place. Naruto would look at Orochimaru experimenting on innocents, and hoarding his knowledge to himself, not bothering to use his knowledge to actually help people, and be disgusted.

Sasuke meanwhile wouldn't be interested in Orochimaru at all, and vise-versa. Orochimaru doesn't seem to have all that much interest in personal power, so researching with Orochimaru wouldn't help Sasuke become much stronger, and Sasuke wouldn't make a great researcher, so Orochimaru has no reason to take him under his wing, as he did in canon.
