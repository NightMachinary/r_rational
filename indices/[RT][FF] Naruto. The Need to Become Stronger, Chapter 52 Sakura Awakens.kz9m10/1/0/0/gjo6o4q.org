Fair points. As I said in my first comment, I do agree that the main differences between Naruto and Orochimaru are their different core goals and Naruto's actual empathy. I'm basing my comparison mostly on how they have the same approach to growing stronger (experimentation, theorizing on how to recreate the secret techniques of clans, curiosity etc... they both have a talent for invention that shocks and surprises at least Sakura) and they way they both see the 'ordinary', 'accepted' parts of the setting clearly (or at least more like the audience). The sentiments Orochimaru expresses in this chapter are exactly the things Naruto has spent the past arc or two struggling with - the violence and amorality inherent in the system. Orochimaru just has none of the ethical or moral limits of Naruto - while Naruto looks at the system and seems to get honestly confused/disgusted at how intelligent, rational beings with magical chakra powers ended up with the Ninja System, Orochimaru instead seems confused as to why Ninja take offence at his immoral actions when they deem so many other evil things acceptable. We've even seen this kind of thing in Naruto (to a much lesser extent) when the other Konoha ninja got mad at him after he beat Lee. Just like Orochimaru, Naruto sometimes can't understand why people take offence at his own less moral/nice actions when the world has so much more evil in it they don't seem to take offence at. In this fic Kurama even admits he helps Naruto because its 'refreshing' to meet a human who hates Ninja as much he does. At this point I think its clear that Naruto is meant to have more in common (philosophically, not ethically) with the villains of the setting.

And I think this is most clear with the Snake - both Naruto and Orochimaru seem to see and approach the setting the same way. They're both scientists, they both see the violence of the system clearly, etc... It's just that Orochimaru doesn't have empathy and Naruto does. They differ in their core goals - they're both 'scientists', but Naruto wants to help people and Orochimaru only cares about personal power/enlightenment. Orochimaru is like a Dark Mirror of Naruto - the villain he would be most like if he was evil. I think Sakura is eventually going to notice some similarities between her relationship with Naruto and her relationship with this seemingly more relaxed, casual, almost 'nice' version of Orochimaru.

As for the Sasuke point - I think its more that Naruto has spent the entire fic proving that real power and understanding can be found by going against the Village. The main group even talks about how the 'study sessions' Naruto organized between all the genin goes against so many Village rules that they found it more appealing to literally collude with enemy Sand genin than be exposed. By the standards of the Village the entire main group could already be considered, to some degree, traitors. Orochimaru's entire argument in canon was that "only under me will you be able to grow strong, not with the Village". A big part of Orochimaru's argument in this chapter is "yes I'm a traitor but being a traitor isn't that bad and the Village isn't exactly squeaky clean either" and Naruto has spent weeks priming his friends to accept both of those ideas (or at least to accept that idea that the rules of the Village do limit/slow their growth).

And Orochimaru really does seem interested in the Sharingan. And he was one now - assuming he knows that the Sharingan takes more chakra to power if you're not an Uchiha, soon he's going to be interested in getting his hands on a live Uchiha specimen to study so that he can figure out exactly why that is. Meanwhile Naruto has spent the entire fic proving to Sasuke that this is a world where knowledge is power; Orochimaru has a lot of knowledge. The Snake has incentive to try and recruit and/or capture Sasuke - Sasuke has incentive to go with him and try to steal his secrets/reverse engineer his techniques. I'm not saying it definitely will happen. I'm just saying it could easily make sense in the context of this fic.
