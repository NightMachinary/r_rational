I actually can't wait for Naruto to meet this version of Orochimaru. They're basically the same character - if Naruto didn't have the overarching goal of defeating The Enemy to define his life (and was a lot more willing to experiment on innocent people) he would basically just be a younger version of the Snake Sannin. All of the work Naruto has done in order to make his friends see the world more like him is, unbeknownst to him, just making it easier for them see the world like Orochimaru.

If Sasuke switches sides in this story I won't even blame him. Naruto essentially spent their entire friendship priming the other boy for indoctrination by the Snake Sannin's cult.
