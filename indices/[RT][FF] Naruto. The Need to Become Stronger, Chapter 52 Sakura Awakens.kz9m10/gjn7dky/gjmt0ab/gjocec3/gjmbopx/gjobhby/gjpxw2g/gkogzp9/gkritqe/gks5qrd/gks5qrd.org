Yeah i gave up right before the Wave mission iirc, I'm usually skeptical of that mission going in a creative fashion. But you did a good job.

You did a good job avoiding the big error of many rationalist fics which is completely inhuman characters who do cringey stuff ("let's be poly in a setting that's radically different than modern times", "let's explicitly talk about therspy in a non-modern setting, etc.). Your characters feel human.

Ehh. The soul thing is a symptom of a bigger thing, which is you explain away the fantastical elements of Naruto canon. Like Summoned Animals being kind of meh (the road that barely talks), the tailed beasts being mindless after enough time, a lot of bloodlines are just secret.

That's not a bad thing. It's a subjective thing. I like mystical elements in fics more than most. I like a touch of religiosity as background flavor. Like, the fact that people have definitively ruled out souls or chakra surviving after death rubs me the wrong way. IMO leaving it ambiguous would be better. But having Sakura say "well acksually chakra disperses after death there's no afterlife" is meh.

But overall, small tonal complaint relative to very great job otherwise
