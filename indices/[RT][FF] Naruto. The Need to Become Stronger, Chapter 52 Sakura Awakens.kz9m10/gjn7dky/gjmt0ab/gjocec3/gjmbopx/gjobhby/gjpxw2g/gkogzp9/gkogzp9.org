Gotta say, this fic has improved dramatically in writing. I didn't enjoy the first 10 or so chapters, but afterwards it gets much better. Characters became much better too.

Your strength is in twists and turns of plots, the emotional drama between Team 7 and the other Genin, and to some degree the worldbuilding on the political side. Kurama, Naruto, and Sasuke are wonderful characters. I hope you don't make Sasuke an antagonist or ultimately kill him off too easily. A waste of a wonderful foil to Naruto's core optimism, and it would be a great redemption arc.

Some critique:

I think you kill characters off a little too casually, tbh, though this is a common fault in Rationalist fics (as in Waves Arisen, which does this to the point of parody). I understand you do this to make it more realistic, but it then runs the risk of removing a sense of "fairness" from plot. Like, if Raza just dies from a surprise attack, which basically never happened in canon to a powerful character, why isn't the Akatskui also just dying to nothing from surprise attacks? Because Plot. A better approach would have been for a surprise attack to weaken him, he fights on, but then he loses. Accomplishes the same goal in a better way, IMO.

I also think you try too hard to remove the more mystical elements of Naruto worldbuilding from your fic. The apparent lack of souls, of any gods (Shinigami in canon, possibly Jashin), even of any religiosity among characters. It's too grimdark in that aspect. Rationalist fics love removing souls from their canons, even if they could still tell a story with them in it!

overall, the fic is really great, and I'm really impressed by how much your writing and characterization improve from the first dozen or so chapters.
