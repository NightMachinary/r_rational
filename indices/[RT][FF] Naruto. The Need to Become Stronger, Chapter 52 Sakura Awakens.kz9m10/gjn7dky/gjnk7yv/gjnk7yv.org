I'll take that as high praise, thank you!

Yep, this version of Orochimaru is basically the living embodiment of the phrase "reason is a slave of the passions", which is of course a big theme of the story. Naruto's key frustration is that people never want to listen to logic (and by extension, they don't want to listen to *him*) because they simply don't feel an emotional impulse to do so. I've tried to highlight this conflict throughout the story:

#+begin_quote
  “Haku had the ability to /teleport/. Instant travel and communication, and he used it to /kill people/. He could have helped to save the world...”

  “But he didn't want to save the world,” Sasuke pointed out. “He wanted to do whatever his master told him to, and Zabuza wanted to take over the Land of Water.”
#+end_quote

(Fun fact: I actually based that Sasuke quote on an, uhm, [[https://i.imgur.com/YKaqaTH.jpg][slightly less serious comic]])

Oro takes this to a whole other level by literally being able to control people's emotions - justified, I think, by the fact that he was introduced in canon by his ability to paralyse people with the fear of death. Plus he could manipulate people through the curse mark. I always thought that was much more interesting than his ability to, well, summon snakes a lot <_<

More realistically, though, I've noticed that the most powerful kind of persuasion relies not on countering someone's arguments but simply avoiding them entirely to construct a narrative that suits you. If you tell someone that they're wrong about X, it encourages them to argue with you. However, if you say "what I love about X is that they're always so honest about how evil they are" and then quickly move on, well... there's a good chance that the other person will have "X is evil" recorded in the back of their mind without even realizing that they've been persuaded of something.
