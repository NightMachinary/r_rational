Ahh, now I want to rewrite the first chapters again. I get that niggling feeling every time someone mentions the difference in quality, but I figure it's probably better to just keep writing new chapters and not get distracted.

I'm glad to see you mention Kurama as one of your favourite characters! I really like the ol' fox too, but for some reason he rarely gets mentioned in reviews. I was worried that I might have made Sasuke too over-the-top (especially early on), but he definitely has a special place in my heart as well. I find ambiguously moral characters much more interesting than designated villains, most of the time. Though I do love Sakura too - her POV is much easier to write and make relatable than someone like Sasuke, I feel.

I get what you're saying about killing characters too easily, I think. I worry that it causes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][darkness induced audience apathy]]. Although, Kakashi did go through multiple steps of losing fights, being beaten down etc. Did his final defeat bother you as well?

I don't think removing souls from Naruto detracts from the story, TBH. Literally none of the main characters ever mention religion in canon - in NTBS, they at least occasionally mention the spirits or the Sage, but in canon it just doesn't play a role. Hidan even calls the Leaf a bunch of filthy atheists, and Kakazu points out that that's not quite true as they do believe in the "will of fire", but that's it. The "soul" thing only comes up when somebody is about to transfer one or rip it out of someone.

Anyway, thanks for the review! I'm impressed you stuck around despite not liking the first ten chapters. I could have sworn I've seen you comment on this fic before though - did you give up on the fix earlier only to give it another try recently or something?
