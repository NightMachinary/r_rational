Wow, this has got to be the most manipulative dialogue I've ever read where the manipulator isn't being dishonest in the slightest. I mean Sakura comes into the conversation terrified of Orochimaru because 1. He's a sociopath who has no compunction about experimenting on innocents, and 2. He's a traitor who not only went against his village (arguable morality) but kidnapped and experimented on his own teammates husband (super evil)

In their conversation Sakura brings up these points, and Orochimaru actually affirms them, and makes it very clear to Sakura exactly what kind of person he is, but while he is doing that he's masterfully misdirecting and topic changing to always make Sakura feel like he's "winning" the argument. Like the issue with Tsunade's husband, what does Orochimaru actually tell Sakura? That he had a totally good reason for kidnapping him, and that he's not actually dead, just horribly experimented on. But the way this is presented skips over the bad parts, and focuses on the reason for kidnapping him, and of course congratulating Sakura for figuring out that reason (with some genjutsu positive reinforcement for good measure)

Feels like this will be one of those times where the readers like a villain a little too much. A fantastic characterization of Orochimaru though, definitely less likely to think of him as "the Enemy" from now on, it doesn't seem like has much to gain from manipulating the whole world.
