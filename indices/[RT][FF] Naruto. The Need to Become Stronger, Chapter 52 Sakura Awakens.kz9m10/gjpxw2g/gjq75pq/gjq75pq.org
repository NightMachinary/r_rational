My original beta reader never watched Naruto and he did not have too much trouble, so honestly you should be able to dive right in. There's a couple japanese words like kunai (throwing dagger) and a few suffixes (-sama= master, -san = sir, -kun and -chan are diminutives) but that's pretty minor stuff and mostly should be clear from context.

Just remember that it's a world in which almost all major characters are ninjas, and that ninjas all have their own magical abilities. For the rest it's not too different from a regular fantasy setting. Translate "chakra" as "mana points" in your head and you won't be too far off. :P

Only thing I can really see being an issue is that there are a lot of different characters and techniques to keep track of. Honestly I should probably rewrite chapter one to remove unnecessary cameos, since most of those characters don't show up again until chapter 20 or so. Same with terms like "sharingan" - a word like that might be dropped now and then, but it'll be explained as soon as it's relevant to the plot, so if you don't know what something means just keep reading and it'll become clear soon enough.

That said, if you do encounter problems while reading, please do let me know so I can take that into account for anyone else who has the same issue. :)
