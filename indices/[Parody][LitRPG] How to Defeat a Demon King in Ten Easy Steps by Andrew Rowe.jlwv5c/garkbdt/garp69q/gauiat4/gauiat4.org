I remember thinking this was interesting when the audiobook was posted before, but I'm more interested in text format and decided to wait for it to come out as a book, then completely forgot about it.

The sample chapters are pretty good. I like the author's writing style, and the MC seems interesting. It's not enough to say for sure that the book itself is good, but it seems promising at least.
