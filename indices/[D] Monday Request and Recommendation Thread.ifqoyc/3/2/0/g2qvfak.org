The pacing issues are a matter of point of view. The most common pacing issues in stories are not enough meaningful things happening, or insufficient variation of highs and lows in varying dimensions. TWI suffers from neither. The total amount of events is simply so large that it takes ages for any developments beyond the arc scale to occur. If a novel is like a movie and a serial like WtC is like a Netflix style intense series, TWI is like a classic series. One where excellent individual episodes are more the point than the overarching plot. Very enjoyable if you let go of the desire to see an end, profoundly frustrating if you don't. YMMV
