Glad to hear it! I've read a pretty gross amount of fiction in the past year and really did try to narrow it down to the things I thought were the best. If you've already read most of the mainstream stuff like MoL, APGTE, WTC, etc, then I'll go ahead and double down on my recs for Katalepsis and The One Who Eats Monsters, since both are very good and very under read.

Gideon the Ninth and Harrow the Ninth are also very good IMO, but have certain stylistic choices that I could see others not enjoying (but I personally enjoyed or at least didn't mind). Book 1 was about a 8/10 for me for the first ~60% of the book but really started to pop off near the last third and became a 9-9.5 overall for me. Be aware that book 2 is written partially in 2nd person (at least 30-50% of the book? I cant remember).
