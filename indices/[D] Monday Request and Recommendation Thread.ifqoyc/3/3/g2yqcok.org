Holy Hell, how has [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7950959/novalounge][One Way Trip / Near Light]] not been picked up here before?

I picked it up Monday and I'm halfway through book two already, it's balancing the OP of the time travel in an OK manner, but the relationship and the actual usage of time travel and Max's abilities beyond just a rewind is fantastic. Few novels will pick up the concept of Deep Time, let alone fanfictions!

A summary of the Games before going into this from a wiki page would be sufficient, it's mostly OC characters with a few things from the games I'm easily picking up from context.
