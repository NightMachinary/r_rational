So, I've been lurking these recommendation threads for about a year now and figured it'd only be polite to contribute something of my own. I don't actually care about a work being explicitly rational, so long as it's believable, but these rec threads have consistently turned up interesting new works for me to read so I continue to lurk them.

I'm gonna cover most of my favorite stuff (or stuff I wanna talk about) that I've read in the past year or so, but keep in mind not all of these works are /rational/ fiction.

Anyways, since this comment is probably gonna turn into a huge TL;DR I'll keep it concise up top and expand on my thoughts further down.

*A Practical Guide to Evil:* One of the most popular pieces of web fiction, for good reason. I'll admit the earlier books aren't nearly as good as the later books, so if you gave up early, maybe try reading further. Definitely my favorite read in the past 12 months.

*What Defines Us (RWBY):* I actually saw this recommended +last week+ two weeks ago which was awesome, because it's truly fantastic. It IS romance fanfiction, though, so if you aren't a fan of that you probably won't be a fan of this. It's 400k words and one of my favorite works of fiction in the past year, though, so definitely try it out if you're at all interested in a romance. Keep in mind it's pretty heavy on the angst (but... justified? It's not teenage “woe is me” angst, its “bad things happened and now I'm depressed” angst).

*The Locked Tomb:* I can see why some people wouldn't like this series, with it's fairly irreverent tone and slow pacing in the first half, but this is something that you can read and find out for yourself if bothers you. Personally, I thought both the first and second books were fantastic.

*Murderbot Diaries:* This had probably one of my favorite protagonists of the year. A grouchy emotionally incompetent (but secretly caring) rogue AI was an absolute pleasure to read about.

*Cradle Series:* This series definitely is ‘popcorn' reading, but it's the best of its kind. I had a blast reading these books.

*Katalepsis:* This web serial is probably fairly unknown in comparison to most of the other works I've talked about so far, but it deserves way more attention. I remember stumbling upon this fairly early on (like arc 3?) and being blown away at how good it was compared to how few people talked about it. It's a pretty interesting story of cosmic horror of the Lovecraftian variety with a cute B plot lesbian romance. Definitely try this one out.

*One Way Trip/Near Light (Life is Strange):* This is almost certainly the most unknown work I'll talk about in this post, and probably something close to none of you have read (I would think?). It has its flaws, dipping into angst too heavily in places and a somewhat strange writing style in certain sections. I had a blast reading this, though. The part that I think would catch the interest of a lot of readers here is that this work attempts to reasonably tackle the idea “How would the various governments (or other organizations) attempt to handle a known time traveler?” In this heavy AU Life is Strange fanfic, superpowers are a thing (that society doesnt know about) and includes stuff like teleporters, psychics, precogs, etc, and the fic tries to handle them in a fairly rational (or at least reasonable) way. It's crazy to me that this work has less than 200 favorites on ff.net, because it's way better than even most of the popular web serials out there.

I'm honestly wondering if this just happened to hit specific tropes and plot points that made this a good match for me, because I really don't get why this isn't way more well known. It hasn't been mentioned even once on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], which dips into some pretty niche and unknown recs, so its unusual to me that nobody has mentioned this even once. If anyone reads through this, let me know if this is just one of those stories that isn't actually that good and just happened to be something that appeals to me, because I think this belongs with a lot of the big name recs I've included in this list.

*Mother of Learning (web serial):* This story is already crazy popular, so I don't have much to say about it. I thought the characters were pretty weak, but I had fun reading it nonetheless. It really lacks any kind of emotional impact, but lives on the merit of being /interesting./

*Wandering Inn (web serial):* I had fun with this, but character bloat really killed it for me. The early parts (books 1-4ish) were a lot of fun for me. Doubt I'll keep reading, dropped it early book 6.

*Worth the Candle (web serial):* This is definitely good, and one of the more cerebral things I've read, but I caught up to it like a year ago and never felt the urge to go back and read the new chapters.

*Pale (web serial):* This is classic Wildbow in that it's honestly just /great/ writing, and actually interesting too (unlike Ward or Twig for me), but continues in Wildbow fashion to be just way too depressing. I've had fun reading up to ~3.5 so far though

The stuff in the *Worth a Read* section are good, and weren't DNFs, but they also weren't anything amazing to me. Read them if you don't have other stuff to read, I guess.

Among the works above that I've read this year is a ridiculous amount of fanfiction, quests, web comics, and other media, but I can't really think of anything that really stuck out besides maybe *Tower of God*, *Always Human* and *Kill Six Billion Demons*, all of which I didn't read more than half of (Only because I'm just not a fan of web comics in general). I also read some interactive fiction like *All Night Laundry*, *Homestuck*, and *My Delirium Alcazar*, but I'm really not a fan of the format and thus all were DNFs.

I've also read a probably unhealthy amount of f/f romance fiction (both print and fanfic) in the past year or so, but I figured this was probably too unrelated to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to actually organize recommendations for. If anyone is actually interested in this niche, send me a dm or comment and I can make a few recs.

Lastly, I've read way too much Worm fanfiction and honestly can say that basically none of it is something I would consider exceptional, which is strange considering the sheer quantity of it. Plenty of it is /fun/ but I can't really say anything could stand along the stuff I've rec'd above.
