Started reading Prince of Slytherin based on the same recommendation and... I can't stand it. It's absolutely full of bashing, James and Jr are absolute dicks, the novel is good at making you sympathize with Harry because the premise of the story (apart from the Peter part) cannot happen without everybody being an inconsiderate asshole.

I must admit I haven't read a lot, having just finished chapter 8 but if the whole novel is going to be "Jim is an idiot and everybody loves Harry, who becomes a perfect Pureblood over Summer" I don't know how it is so liked, it reminds me of the worst fanon of Worm, with the Trio being Jack Slash Jr and woobie Panacea and Undersiders. Does it have any redeemable qualities, does it get better? I mean, I assume it must get somewhat better, but is it worth getting to that point?

.....

Not sure if it will suit your tastes, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23747950/chapters/57035011#main][The Good War]] in AO3 is a delightful Slytherin!Fem!Harry story that goes deep in the consequences of the Dudley's abuse on Harry (here Elizabeth). Here we have an independent and distrustful protagonist that has to relearn how to live when not surrounded by hate.

Sadly, the story doesn't have many chapters, and each new chapter takes a while. There's also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shedding-lionskin-harry-potter-au.862342/#post-68309077][Shedding Lionskin]] from BeaconHill, the author of "Nemesis" (The Bumblebee worm fanfic). Harry is a metamorphmagus and at the end of book 4 (I think) decides to pretend to leave Hogwarts and attend classes as a woman in Slytherin. Makes more sense in context.

I think both of this have been recommended earlier, so they should somewhat fit rational themes even if they are not rational themselves.
