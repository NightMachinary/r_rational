There are a few works I've enjoyed which are similar to your request, but none of them are perfect fits:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606][Sburb Glitch FAQ]], a Homestuck fanfic in the form of a strategy guide for glitched Sburb games. The focus here is on glitch exploitation, but it requires a fair bit of familiarity with canon. A popular foundation for AUs and RPs (I think Replay Value is the name used most often?) but I haven't read through any of the secondary works.

- [[https://www.scribblehub.com/series/3413/isekai-speedrun/][Isekai Speedrun]] is a fun read but the protagonist mainly uses their foreknowledge because the video game aspects are deemphasized.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32291/jank][Jank]] feels fairly true to the culture of MMOs and has some entertaining ideas but the players aren't trapped in the game.

EDIT:

- Log Horizon is a good example of the genre. While the light novels focus on the politics, [[https://imgur.com/a/AkeYt][this Imgur album]] makes a good case for the level of thought put into the tactics of the action scenes in the anime.
