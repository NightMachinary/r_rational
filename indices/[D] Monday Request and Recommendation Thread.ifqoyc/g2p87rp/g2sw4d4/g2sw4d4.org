Seconding this rec, The Man From Earth is one of my favorite movies.

It's just a full length movie of people in a room talking and exploring a concept. It's interesting, thought-provoking, and pretty easy to watch. It has a mystery element that makes it hard to talk about the plot in a rec, but it's not a huge twist you need to brace yourself for or anything.
