You've got to go a few books in to get the branch point for this Fanfic, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4453992/1/Artemis-Fowl-The-Book-of-Ages][The Book Of Ages]] was at least logical in it's handling of the time travel and other aspects from canon. Artemis is rational, but quite willfully allows himself to be influenced by his emotions, which is kind of his character arc.
