Yes, the first arc is clich√© and trope--heavy on purpose. The author's deliberate intention is to fully deconstruct a stereotypical WBWL story, and over the next ~1m words it gradually recontextualizes and overthrows everything that happened before with a massive, complex storyline full of twists and turns (for a fanfiction, anyway). That is not to say that PoS is perfect---it gets bloated after a while, and the overall narrative becomes kinda depressing and hopeless, with some very high-level, esoteric conflicts. It's /very/ ambitious in what it's trying to do, and while that often results in some amazing scenes and ideas, it also sometimes becomes it's own trapping. And the bashing... over time you learn so much about internal motivations of all characters that you genuinely feel more of a pity or sympathy at them, rather than anger. Most of them get really fleshed out, and if not redeemed, then at the very least made clearly understandable in why they are acting the way they do. At the current moment, only a single character could arguably be said to be still bashed, but it's less 'What an asshole! How could such a cruel person exist?' thing and more 'Dude, what a sad, miserable person trapped in an awful situation' thing. If you don't have patience for long build-ups and a lot of subtle foreshadowing and shit, while everyone talks about politicking and generic indy!Harry tropes appear in the foreground, then reading it will be pretty painful, though. I would still say it's worth it for the crazy AU worldbuilding and insane plot twists, but eh. YMMV.

From my perspective, the story seems controversial in a pretty similar way to how HPMOR is controversial, if that tells you anything.
