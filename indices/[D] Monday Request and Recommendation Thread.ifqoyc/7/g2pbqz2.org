Any good Harry in Slytherin fanfics?

Recently binged Prince of Slytherin from last week's recommendations ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/2/]] skip the prologue, it spoils things and author is planning on going back and heavily editing/removing it. I linked to the first actual chapter) and I loved it, easily top 5 HP fanfics for me.
