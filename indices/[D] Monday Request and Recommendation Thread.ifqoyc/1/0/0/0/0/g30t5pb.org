12 Angry Men is one of my all-time favorites! Unfortunately the one-room movie genre isn't the most populous, but there /are/ some other good ones:

Phone Booth (phone booth instead of a room)

Exam

Locke (car instead of a room)

The Circle

The Hateful Eight was recommended to me as a movie along these lines (despite the flashbacks that occur in locations other than the main room), but wasn't as much to my tastes.

Edit: Can't believe I forgot about Clue! One house instead of one room, but same idea. Coherence also, thought they venture out around the house once or twice.
