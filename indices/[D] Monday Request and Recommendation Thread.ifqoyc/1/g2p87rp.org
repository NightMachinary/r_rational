[[https://www.amazon.com/Man-Earth-David-Lee-Smith/dp/B077N4M7PQ][The Man from Earth]]! I rewatched this amazing movie the other day and it's definitely something people here will enjoy:

- 99% of runtime consists of people talking in a single room, and everyone I watched it with still loved it.
- Written by Jerome Bixby, of Star Trek fame (came up with the Mirror Universe among other things)
- Rationalist to the end, from how the story is handled to the specific topics mentioned.
- Released by the director on torrent sites since he wanted people to watch it more than he wanted money (so don't feel bad if you don't have Amazon Prime).

I've intentionally kept the plot vague, it's a story about a group of professors slowly exploring the mysterious past of a long time friend of theirs, so I'd be doing you a disservice if I told you any of it. Just trust me and watch it, it's not a long movie.
