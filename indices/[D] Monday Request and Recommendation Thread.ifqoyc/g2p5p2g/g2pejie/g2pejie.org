Based on the stuff you've said you like, may I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]]? It's a fanfic based on Good Omens, with the POV character being Aubrey Thyme, a therapist who is unknowingly treating Crowley, a Demon, who is attending therapy at the urging of his husband Aziraphale, an angel.

It's beautifully written, with /some/ minimal angst, but mainly it's about the process of grieving and overcoming traumatic memories. Not much fanfic has ever affected me as deeply as this.
