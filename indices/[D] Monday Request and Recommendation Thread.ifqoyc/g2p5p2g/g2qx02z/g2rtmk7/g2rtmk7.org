Making a list of recs for romance fiction is honestly way harder, partly because I've read so much of it and also because I didn't keep especially good track of what I've actually read. Also, romance fiction in general tends to be harder to rate quality wise over other types of fiction because it feels so much more /subjective/ to me. These kinds of stories live and die by emotional connections and that's going to vary wildly depending on what your specific favorite tropes, plot points, and character types are. That said, this list is highly subjective and reflects what I /personally/ enjoyed the most.

**That said, this is still a curated list from at least hundreds of works, so the others are still well worth reading

I'm only gonna leave some comments on my top 5:

*The One Who Eats Monsters:* I actually think published fiction is a much weaker medium for romance stories, at least from personal experience. That said, The One Who Eats Monsters is similar to Katalepsis in that the romance is a heavily featured subplot and the main plot is amazing standalone. I actually forgot about this book while writing my above list but it totally belongs in my “Highly Recommended” section. I have a soft spot for socially challenged protagonists (like Murderbot!), and Ryn (the protagonist) is a non-human entity who is experiencing human society in its entirety for the first time, and is appropriately terrible at social interaction. Read this one if you're looking for plot to accompany your romance.

*What Defines Us:* See parent comment

*white blank page:* My personal preferences tend to run towards angst/drama stories, and this one ladles it on pretty heavily. Since I'm recommending it as one of my top 5, I obviously don't think its poorly done or cringy or anything, but without a doubt it's /heavy/ on the angst. Avoid if that isn't your thing. College setting.

*Increments of Longing:* This one was just super enjoyable to me and I've reread it a few times. It's a political marriage fic between Sylvanas and Jaina and has a bunch of super cute moments. I think this one, along with my next rec, has pretty general appeal where I don't think anyone is going to /dislike/ it, even if it might not make your favorite list.

*The Love of Forgetting:* Like I mentioned above, this fic has pretty general appeal and is also superbly written. It features Lena Luthor handling an amnesiac Supergirl with all the adorableness (and suspense) that entails. Read it! It's well written, interesting, and I doubt anyone would find it /bad/.
