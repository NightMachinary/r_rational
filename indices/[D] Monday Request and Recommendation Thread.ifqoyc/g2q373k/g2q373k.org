I caught up with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] recently, and it's put me in the mood for tinker-y fictions, where characters go through a build stuff -> use your stuff -> build more stuff based on what you learned / new abilities you have loop. Any recommendations?

Off the top of my head, similar stories would be:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12563/artisan][Artisan]] - mostly dead
- Some parts of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15614/daedalus][Daedalus]] - also pretty dead
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32983/vaudevillain][Vaudevillain]] - very alive, but not quite on target for this request
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aces-and-jokers-oc-insert.796551/#post-62075730][Aces and Jokers]] - more conceptual tinkering than physical, but it fits reasonably well I think.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33844/the-runesmith][The Runesmith]] - seems like the author intends for it to get there, but it hasn't so far
