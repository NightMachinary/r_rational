If you're up for xianxia, /Forty Millennia of Cultivation/ at least approaches what you're looking for. It's heavier on fighting than crafting, but still has that build->use->build cycle you're looking for.

Takes a bit before it becomes non-generic. Might be worth skipping to around chapter 50ish once you've read the first couple.
