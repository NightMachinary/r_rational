It's probably the most unknown work I'm a big fan of. Which is wild, since it was written in 2016 so its had plenty of time to gain popularity but just... hasnt? Glad you enjoyed it.

I only knew the game from a very broad sense (the ending, and concept) and like you said I was able to mostly pick things up from context.
