[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9140366/1/Gladiator][Gladiator]] is one of my favorite stories on the web. Its a romance/adventure ATLA fanfiction that has reached an epic length of 2,425,000 words. The main character is Sokka, and it shows his experience with slavery and being a gladiator in a world where the fire nation won.
