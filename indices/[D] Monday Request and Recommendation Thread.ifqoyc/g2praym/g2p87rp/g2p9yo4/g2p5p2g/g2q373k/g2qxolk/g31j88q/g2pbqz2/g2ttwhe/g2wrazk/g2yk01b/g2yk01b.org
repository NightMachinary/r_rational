Just watch /Avatar/. It's beautifully animated, has great wordbuilding and [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/3/33/Southern_Air_Temple_outlook.png/][locations]], creative [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/3/37/Flying_bison_family.png/][wildlife]], a story with a sense of urgency, an original magic system and interesting antagonists. Voice acting, fight choreography and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7wBmk5uUhU][the]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l4rZG8skjo][music]] are all great. It's exceptional.

I would expect it to be better than any fanfiction based on it (although I haven't read this /Gladiator/).

It's certainly a lesser commitment than reading a 2.4M-word story.
