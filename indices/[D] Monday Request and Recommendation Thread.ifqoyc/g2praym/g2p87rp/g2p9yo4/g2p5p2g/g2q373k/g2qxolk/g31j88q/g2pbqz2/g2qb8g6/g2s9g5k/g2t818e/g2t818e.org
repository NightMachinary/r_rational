On your recommendation and of others I jumped ahead to chapter 29 and stopped by the end of book 1 (chapter 34).I admit it explains some things and gets better, but I'm not sure if I can manage to go back to chapter 8 and get to that point. Maybe I'll just skip those chapters. Also, those explanations haven't really been foreshadowed (ok, maybe some), and sometimes look like the author has taken them out of his ass to justify what has happened.

Anyway, to those discorauged by my review, reading ahead things get kinda better. Nothing particularly impressive, at least in my point of view, and definitely nothing that makes the first ten or so chapters worth it.

Thanks to those that have taken the time to reply to my comment, if I continue reading is y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶ thanks to you.
