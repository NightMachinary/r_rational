So I've searched for it before, beyond the HPMOR and The Arithmancer, any other Harry Potter stories where muggle tech is used, or better yet anything where Muggles actually outclass wizards in a conflict without it being a complete curbstomp for either side?

IE Muggles act tactically, and Wizards aren't so bumbling as to ignore the 'firelegs' pointed at them?
