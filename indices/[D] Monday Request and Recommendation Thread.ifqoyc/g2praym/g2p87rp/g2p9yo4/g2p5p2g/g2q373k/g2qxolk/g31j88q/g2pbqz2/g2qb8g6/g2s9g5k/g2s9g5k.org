If you're willing, I'd recommend reading chapters [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/29/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][29]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/30/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][30]], since I think those are where the story really picks up.

With that said, I do agree with a lot of your criticisms. While the bashing lessens/get contextualized (eg. there are legit, if flawed, reasons Harry was left at the Dursleys), it remains to some extent. While the whole "Harry is always right and Jim is always a loser" lessens, there is a sort of undercurrent of competence surrounding Harry, and Jim kind of gets shit on by the narrative.

Ultimately, the political nature (like, actual politics, not just 11-year-old Slytherins) and the worldbuilding kept me reading.
