  This is easily one of the best Slytherin Harry fanfiction out there. The premise is if the sorting hat put sorted Harry into Slytherin. It follows a realistic trajectory from that outcome. His friends change, plot points change, romantic relationships change and we're given a well done and fantastic story because of that.

  This is a series of oneshots of how a Harry Potter who was placed in Slytherin might develop. It's not a serious fanfiction and errs more on the humorous side. It's well written a quick read.

  This fic asks the question, what if Hogwarts was structured more like Battle School from Ender's game. It's a great story that melds the charm of Harry Potter with the seriousness of a Battle School. Oh and one of other changes is that Harry was sorted in Slytherin.
