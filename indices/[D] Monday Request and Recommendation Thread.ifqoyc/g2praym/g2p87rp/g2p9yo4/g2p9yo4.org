Its probably quite redundant to mention Terry Pratchett here. However I recently reread [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_(novel][Nation]]) and was struck by how much this is explicitly a rationalist book for young people.

Emphasis on science+planning, pulling unorthodox strategies to win, some tangential X-risk warnings, all in the usual extremely high quality Pratchett style prose.

*I'm trying to collect a list of rational!-memeplex media for the next generation*. Do you have any in that vein?
