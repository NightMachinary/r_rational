Delve on RoyalRoad is a litRPG that's not quite videogame but has all the videogame traits. The story is a slow slice of life exploration, but the main character's primary advantage is that he looks at the world like a videogame to be min-maxxed while everyone else has just grown up with it as their entire life.

This means that the vast majority of the populace are unoptimized. Each person makes smart build decisions that make sense individually, but aggregate to being awful for minmaxing. Everyone builds 'tanky dps' that doesn't rely on allied buffs. People don't share builds or information. And there's huge societal problems causing a chicken-egg issue with nobody wanting to be a support or crafter because it's unsafe because there are no balanced teams to rely on... because there's no point for teams when nobody goes support or crafter.

In the most recent chapters the MC finally starts their own guild and tries to get people to minmax as a group instead of individuals, so that he can turn around the state of the world.
