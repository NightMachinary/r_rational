[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]] is pretty good and has a lot of this. Lots of battle strategizing, puzzle-solving, examining the game rules and identifying exploits, and just dealing with the emergent behaviors of the system.

I like to call this fanfic, "SAO but good". It also features a lot of different characters with different strengths, rather than having one guy be super over-leveled.
