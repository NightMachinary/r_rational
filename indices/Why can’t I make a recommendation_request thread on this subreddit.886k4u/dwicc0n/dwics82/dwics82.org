Recommendations and requests could be considered discussion of rational fiction.

Especially if those giving recommendations or fulfilling requests explain why they think the story is worth reading.

I think it's ambiguous enough that it would be worth explicitly banning recommendation/request threads if that's what the mods want to do.

edit: Also from a practical point of view, we've already seen that some people interpret the rules this way. So even if the interpretation you gave is 100% correct, there's no harm in making them more explicit, if for no other reason than to make the moderator's work easier.
