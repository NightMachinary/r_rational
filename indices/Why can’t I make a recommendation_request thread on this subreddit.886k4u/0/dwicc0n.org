Quote from the sidebar: "Post links to or discussion of rational fiction only; otherwise use one of the weekly discussion threads."

A recommendation/request thread is clearly neither a discussion of rational fiction nor a link to rational fiction. Of course, the mods should certainly have told you via message and discord why, but the reason seems fairly clear to me.

In addition, request threads are somewhat rude because ideas are a dime a dozen but actually writing a fic is difficult; similarly, recommendation threads really belong as comments on the monthly recommendation post. The recommendation post for March is at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/826k1r/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/]]
