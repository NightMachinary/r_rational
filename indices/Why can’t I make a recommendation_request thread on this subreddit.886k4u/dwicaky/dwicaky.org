Personally I think you have a point. There should be something explicitly in the rules which says "no posting request threads" if that's something the mods want to avoid.

I thought there was a seperate link to additional rules somewhere, but I'm unable to find it. Which means even if there are more detailed rules than what's listed in the side bar, the sub could definitely benefit from making those rules more visible.

Also check out [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] for a long constantly updating SI in the Young Justice/DC universe that seems more or less rational and covers transhumanist themes. (Note: it may seem like it's just retreading cannon at first, but it diverges and explores many subplots after it gets out of the opening stages of the story).
