I'm coming a bit late here, but here are a few thoughts I had about this

1. It is necessary to enslave Pokemon, because if they weren't enslaved they would easily overpower humanity. Many are much smarter than us, and most are more powerful than us. It is only via our institutional power in the form of slavery that we can hope to have any control over our future.

2. Although in a perfect world the character in question believes Pokemon would ideally be free, there are currently more pressing, and likely more important and more easily solvable questions to attempt to tackle in the present, such as biosecurity threats, AI alignment, and global poverty reduction. Nobody is dying on account of the enslavement of Pokemon, and in general they're treated better as slaves than they would be in the wild. This character also believes they would be at an unfair disadvantage when attempting to solve the other problems they care about if they did not partake in Pokemon enslavement. Thus they continue to enslave Pokemon, feeling slightly bad about it but not too much since it's the status-quo.

3. Politics and Moloch. You rule the region you're in by defeating the Pokemon Champion. If this is your ambition, then you either optimize fully for Pokemon training, or be defeated by someone who did. Thus, if you give your Pokemon off-days and a wage you will lose to someone who pushes their Pokemon 24/7, and puts money otherwise spent on wages to training materials.

4. Pokemon actually prefer enslavement, and it is in fact anything but! The average trainer spends [X] poke-dollars on per pokemon, while the average family spends [Y]. While these are nowhere near the market-rate of the average human labourer, these are likely /above/ the wages which would be paid to these Pokemon in a free market because the humans are paying for housing and food, which Pokemon have repeatedly demonstrated these as non-necessary when in the wild. Similarly, a study conducted in [YEAR] showed that when polled by an Alakazam, 87% of Pokemon would prefer being owned by a trainer than to life in the wild. By comparison, [[https://xkcd.com/2305/][76% of people feel positively about Meowth, 89% of people say fair elections are important to democracy, and 86% of people do not trust Kim Jong-Un to do the right thing]]. We also see a distinct lack of humans renting off their Pokemon, indicating a distinct lack of hired-Pokemon labour. (I don't think this argument is very strong, even with these made-up numbers).

5. A weaker version of 4. The current system /may/ not be perfect. But so far it's working out very well for both humans and Pokemon, and the introduction of Pokemon slavery has been pareto-optimal for both groups. We should generally be careful about overturning traditions as per Chesterton's Fence, especially when these traditions have been as beneficial as slavery.

I think the strongest argument here is 2. Not super happy with 4 & 5, as after 10 seconds of thinking about each I wasn't convinced.
