Another option you can consider, though it might not be exactly what you want:

Consider a settings where slavery exists. A moral rationalist realizes that it's evil, and vows not to keep slaves. However, he/she is rich, and sees slaves being treated horribly. So isn't it the moral imperative to save some by buying them and treating them well? But now our moral rationalist owns slaves, and obviously he now has to manage them / deal with infractions, and possibly organize them into some sort of work force so that he can get more money to buy more slaves... and the more efficient / more money you make, you can buy more slaves to 'save'. So you get a truly moral person, with a weak form of condoning slavery, and a whole set of slippery slope / difficult choices.

In Pokemon, maybe this person buys trapped pokemons, but they can't be returned to the wild, and require treatment, and money... same principle.
