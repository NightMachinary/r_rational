Start by thinking of the people you enslave as not only ignorant but stupid and incapable of improving. Like pets or beasts of burden, you are restricting their freedom for their own good; they have safer, more comfortable lives working for you than they would if they were free to make their own mistakes.

Their complaints about the situation are like those of children; they don't, can't, know better. It's noblesse oblige; it's your responsibility, as their betters, to take charge of them.

Moral, rationalist and posessing an accurate theory of mind: if you want a character who is a slaver you can have two of these, but not all three.
