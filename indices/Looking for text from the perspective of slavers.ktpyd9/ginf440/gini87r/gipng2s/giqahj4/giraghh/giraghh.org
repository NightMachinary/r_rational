People managed to convince themselves that /other people/ were not as intelligent (and then it became a self-fulfilling prophecy as they kept them in impoverished conditions in which they couldn't educate themselves). With anything that doesn't even /look/ like us it'd be doubly difficult to convince anyone.

To be blunt, we don't know for sure that dolphins or killer whales aren't as smart as us. They're probably at least as smart as our toddlers. Them not having a technological civilization like ours is hardly proof; they live in water, they have no prehensile appendages, what are they supposed to do? Had you landed on Earth one million years ago, humans and dolphins wouldn't have looked like they had such different lifestyles all in all. But just by virtue of them not being like us, it becomes a lot harder to make any comparisons because our lack of reciprocal understanding allows one to argue that they must be stupider.
