Right now there are specific animals that are more intelligent than certain humans. But most people would be horrified by the idea of the enslavement of slaughter of those humans while seeing nothing wrong with not giving intelligence tests to all pigs, rats, apes, dogs, dolphins, elephants and so on in captivity that, if passed, award them with the basic human rights that even toddlers and mental ward patients have.

Also, look into the achievable communication skills of certain apes, cetaceans and corvids. Amazing stuff, that.
