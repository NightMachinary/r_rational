Sure, but the humans in the pokemon world don't know that.

That could still be assuming that pokemon are slightly smarter animals, not fully sapient.

Then pop in some pokemon viewpoint chapters.

Tho, it is actually hard to enslave pokemon, as they can easily break free/kill humans if they care to. Unless pokeballs are brainwashing devices or something.
