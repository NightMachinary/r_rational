  My issue is I think of anyone with this thought process as "bad".

I mean, someone with this thought process would be certainly /close minded/ - in our world, at least. Today, you have to make a wilful effort to believe it. Centuries ago, I /may/ kinda buy someone would believe it in good faith. Coming from a civilisation that has steel, guns and ships, they find people still living like prehistoric tribes, and don't exactly appreciates the finesses of how and why availability of resources and other environmental factors shape technological discovery, they /might/ be justified at first in thinking that these humans are indeed less smart or capable of innovation. That justification quickly vanishes upon prolonged contact though. And in addition, even if you /did/ consider yourself having a caretaker duty, no one would take their children (whom they have a caretaker duty towards) and put them to hard work in a cotton field, so let's face it, that's just bad faith; a rationalisation used to coat simple convenience. Check out Benjamin Franklin's writings - he went from the default racist views of his time to abolitionism simply by intellectual honesty and observation.

So yeah, not sure how or why you'd want to write this. There's a reason why you think slavery does not compute for someone who is trying to be both rational /and/ moral. It does not. Some ancient philosophers in Greece and Rome already were clear sighted enough to point this out, even living in societies that absolutely depended on slavery (EDIT: actually I have probably misremembered some ambiguous stances here, don't take my word for it on this). The only way I can see for someone to think it rational to keep someone else in slavery is perhaps a situation like house elves in HPMOR - one where the slave group is /actively/ seeking to work and serve, for whatever twisted reason (and that's already got to be pretty contrived and probably by design, seems a bit of a weird quirk to arise naturally). And even then you'd still try to be as graceful and kind as possible, aiming to maximise well-being of the creatures you're taking care of, not your own well-being. Even when it comes to animal farming, we can't really say we're being moral. We do it for egoistic purposes - life is easier for us with animal products. The animals are only treated the way they are because they're weaker. Even in a good farm where they're left with more space and freedom than a factory one, they're still at our mercy. Everything we do supposedly for their sake is actually for our own, to lessen our sense of guilt towards them.
