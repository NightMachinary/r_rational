Yeah, thanks for the contribution. I think the most valuable perspective I got from this thread is: "In a world without massive historical humanitarian abuse due to slavery, the idea of slavery itself would not have the instinctual negative reaction which it does in our society". I think my whole issue, is that I subconsciously think off all the historical abuse of slavery when considering it, and conflate all the negativity with racism, abuse, etc which is associated in many historical examples of slavery.

I think 4, combined with the relationship between Pokémon and trainer to not be what we consider traditional slavery, but more along the relationship of a pet with a few added rights (Such as a Pokémon's right to leave a trainer or return to the wild, etc) due to the intelligence, makes a morally gray-enough relationship which could perpetuate into modern society.
