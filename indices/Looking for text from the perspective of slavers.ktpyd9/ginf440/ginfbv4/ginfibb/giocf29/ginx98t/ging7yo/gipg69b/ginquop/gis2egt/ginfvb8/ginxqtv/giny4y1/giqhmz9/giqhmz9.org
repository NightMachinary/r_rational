The other thing that you should consider is not humans as a dominant force as i kind of implied but humanity using pokemon slavery in your words as the only way to keep a human state in existence with well the forces of nature that pokemon as a whole are. Like it's one thing for you to speak of it like we would be the dominant species, but why would we be the dominant species if every pokemon was as smart and generally more physically capable than us?

Like the other way is the Roman's where someone enslaved could buy their own freedom by learning a trade that they would have had the fees covered for by their owner. In that the slave owner is both gaining the upfront cost back and also some percentage of the money made while the slave is still enslaved. Conversely there's more like the Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire who were well slaves well trained and kept well fed who were used as well soldiers.

Converesly there's the whole problem with more intelligent beings making up the majority of food chain where well intelligence would be much less valued if even your food crops are feeling and thinking beings and that treatment probably would get rid of a lot of general empathy towards non-humans. But even then amongst most people living on subsistence farms there isn't the widespread vegan-esque uhh equivalence of animal life to humanity. Like we shove animals that are pretty intelligent on the whole into zoos or well food markets without much thought the idea that more intelligence would make us more sensitive to relative equivalence in uhh humanity is kind of na√Øve.
