If we want to talk about moral rationalism, how about we talk about how in the USA, slavery is legal and protected by the constitution?

A lot of us are groomed from birth to not know this. It sounds so absurd and invisible to the lived experience of 90%+ of the population, after all. However, it's true. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcCxsLDma2o][Go watch Slavery By Another Name.]] This kind of thing still goes on. I'm sure you've heard of them from time to time in the news - box packers in Texas, firefighters in California, Janitors in Arkansas, etc.

Now that everyone here knows this and is on the same page. Suppose you think yourself a "good and moral" person. What do you do with this information?

A. Try to build awareness so we can get some force behind reform. However this would involve having uncomfortable conversations with people who'll think you're crazy or don't want to think sad thoughts, so it's much easier to

B. Pretend there isn't a problem. Anyone who says there is, is an annoying liar. But there's always the chaotic evil option of

C. THOSE PEOPLE deserve to be slaves. You know. THOSE PEOPLE. Which people? The kind you don't like. Your imagination of who gets tortured is all that matters. It doesn't matter who that is really, as long as wage laborers get paid as little as possible overall. Just say they're learning "important job skills" packing soap, a job that belongs to a machine outside of slavery and does not exist on domestic soil otherwise.

As for cock fighting with slaves in the imaginary world of Pokémon? You have to accept that what they show you is sanitized cock-fighting propaganda. It is a cartoon. In the real world you won't get some bruises and "faint" from a Charizard breathing a fuckin' fusion orb or some shit at your tree rat, the rat will be dead. *DEAD*. Death is acknowledged really only within the in-game pokedex entries, these cock fights can not ever be a fun and healthy game. Being crippled for life is the best outcome a pokemon could ever hope for after a life of fightin'.

So, much like how Bill Gates is not a "good billionaire" (at a minimum, wealth extraction from Africa and the stuff he probably did to children with his friend Jeff), Professor Oak is not a "good poképrofessor". The man is a monster.

So you either have a miserable, realistic grimdark world that needs some kind of pokéterrorist fighting for the health and freedom of animals (and from a perspective of counter propaganda, the ideal hero of this movement should be nonhuman), or you buy into the fantasy world where being horribly bitten and clawed is only a passing moment of pain. Which is also ok, because it is a cartoon, and a fantasy. Having an army of monsters is cool.

Heh, just the concept of Ash, Misty, Brock and Oak having a roundtable debate about their respective moral philosophies is very funny, though. When the whole point of the thing is to sell toys to five year olds.

... these characters don't even know what a jelly donut is, mister.
