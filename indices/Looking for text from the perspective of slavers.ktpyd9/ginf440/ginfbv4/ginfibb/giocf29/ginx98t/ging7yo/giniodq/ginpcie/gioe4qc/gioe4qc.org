We raise animals in little cages their whole lives just so that we can kill them and eat them later, even though nutritionally there's no real need. Even the most ardent meat eater doesn't look at pictures of factory farm conditions and think, "yup, looks perfectly fine!" And yet, we still eat meat anyway.
