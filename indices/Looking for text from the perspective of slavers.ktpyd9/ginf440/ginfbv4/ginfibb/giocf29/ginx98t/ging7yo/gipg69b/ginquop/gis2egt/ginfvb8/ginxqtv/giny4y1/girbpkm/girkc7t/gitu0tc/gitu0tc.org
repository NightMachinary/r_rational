Well, if you're saying that I myself mistakenly concluded the anime slavery was ok, answering the question without knowing, that might be true.

In that case, the missing element OP wants in his story might be pokeballs that reprogram the pokemon to want to be a pet/friend (those who haven't joined the trainer voluntarily).

Then I could /maybe/ sort of see a moral rationalist believing it's ok - after all (Professor Oak could reason), in the anime, wild pokemon that will not follow the trainer without being captured against their will are kind of like hostile animals. Why not turn them into a friend, or at least a cute pet?
