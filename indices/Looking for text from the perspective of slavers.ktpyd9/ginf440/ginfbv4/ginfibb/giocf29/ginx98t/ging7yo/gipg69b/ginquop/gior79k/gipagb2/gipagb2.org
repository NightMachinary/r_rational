I'm not sure what your problem with this is? It's 100% true. "A long time ago" isn't 200 years ago, it's 2000, and this isn't about US chattel slavery (which is not the Only Slavery That Ever Existed, as Americans often seem to think). In Roman times this was absolutely a thing. Also the conditions of the slaves varied. Really, in antiquity "slaves" were effectively just the lowest social class of all. But there was more social mobility, both downwards and upwards, than in US chattel slavery, because your race or nationality didn't brand you as intrinsically deserving of slavery. Some slaves bought their freedom, some free men sold themselves into slavery out of despair. Some slaves had it much better than others, so there actually was some kind of social ranking among slaves themselves. Some freed slaves moved on to be tremendously successful and rich. Petronius makes fun of one such character in the /Satyricon/, and while he's portrayed as a tasteless /nouveau riche/, it's still clear he IS a big shot.
