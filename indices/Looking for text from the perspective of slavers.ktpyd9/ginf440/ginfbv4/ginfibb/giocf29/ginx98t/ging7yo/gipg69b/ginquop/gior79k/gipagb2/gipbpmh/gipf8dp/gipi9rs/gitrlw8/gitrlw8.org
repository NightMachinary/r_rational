  the point is, they were slaves because they /became/ slaves, not because anyone said, "well, this race of people clearly has to be kept in slavery, they're too dumb for their own good"

You're saying that slavery 2,000 years ago wasn't a racial issue. I agree.

  They may be war prisoners, or poor people - the point is, they were slaves because they /became/ slaves, not because anyone said, "well, this race of people clearly has to be kept in slavery, they're too dumb for their own good".

Since we're on the topic of racially motivated slavery, in both cases (slavery 2,000 years ago and racial slavery later), people involuntarily became slaves and their children automatically became slaves as well. That there were /also/ people who sold themselves into slavery fails to fulfill the spirit of the grandparent comment, if not its literal interpretation, and I don't think yours or his comment address OP's question (which was how a moral rationalist could mistakenly conclude that slavery was moral).

(Unless the person I responded to meant to say that since pokemon were miserable in the wild, the trainers would believe it to be moral to enslave them, but that's either a case of rationalization, or a rational reasoning going so wrong that it requires further explanation, else it leaves such a big part unexplained that it doesn't really explain almost anything, IMO.)

(Generally, my impression is that most comments in the thread answer the question "how could an otherwise moral rationalist /rationalize/ pokemon slavery to themselves," not OP's question (paraphrased) "how could a moral rationalist mistakenly conclude pokemon slavery was ok." Having the rationalist fail at rationality is one way of solving the dilemma, but I think the least interesting one. (Unless we each interpret OP's question differently.))

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome][I'm not /sure/ that's all that compatible with Wikipedia]]. Also, the grandparent comment was about slavery as such, not about one specific kind of slavery in one specific society during one specific Era, (and I also don't think it addresses OP's question).

I mean, thank you both for trying to fix the holes in my knowledge, but I think you underestimate how strongly I'm trying to hold on the original topic. :)
