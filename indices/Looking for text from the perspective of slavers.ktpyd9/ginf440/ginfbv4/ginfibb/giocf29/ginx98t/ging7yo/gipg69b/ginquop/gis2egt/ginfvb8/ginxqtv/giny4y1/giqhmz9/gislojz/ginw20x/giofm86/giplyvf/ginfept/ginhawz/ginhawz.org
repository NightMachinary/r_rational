The thing is, I like the setting and want two write with it, and even think that this form of sudo-slavery would be the logical conclusion of the world I am building, along with actually being beneficial for Pok√©mon in general. My issue is due to my background this is very hard for me to get into a mindset where this doesn't just feel "icky". I mentioned Realms of Monsters, because I think that does it well, and did help me with this perspective understanding, but not enough. Hence looking for more works.

To clarify: Yes, I know I feel this way because of my subjective ethics, the problem is I can't imagine someone who I would think of as "A good guy" that does not share this ethic, and I want to change that. And all bar the above, works of fiction I have read which use slavery use it as a way to show how the protag is "good" by not condoning it. Which I want to do as well, but ALSO want to have characters who are good and do condone it.
