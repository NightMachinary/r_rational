He's right though.

Classical Era slavery was almost always something you could work your way out of. Baring specific kingdoms and cultures that took on more xenophobic stances, it had nearly nothing to do with race/sex/etc.

You didn't even need to be desperate to do it. Many had a chance at a much more secure life by becoming the slaves to a rich and powerful person in the area.

It was still wrong and the room for abuse was massive, but the racial undertones are a product of colonial era expansion. In the modern world, you can usually assume someone is talking about the later form of slavery unless they explicitly reference earlier periods.
