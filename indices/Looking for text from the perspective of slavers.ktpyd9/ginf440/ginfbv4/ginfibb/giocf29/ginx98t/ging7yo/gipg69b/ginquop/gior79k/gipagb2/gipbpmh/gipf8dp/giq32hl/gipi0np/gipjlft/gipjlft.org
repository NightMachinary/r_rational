  OP was asking for a rational justification for it

OP was asking for a reasoning of a moral rationalist. A /rational/ justification is easy to come by if your utility function contains something morally wrong (since rationality and morality are orthogonal). Coming up with a moral justification (or, specifically, something that a rationalist attempting to be moral might incorrectly consider to be a moral justification) is much harder, and I believe it's impossible-in-principle.

While I don't mind explaining where your reasoning went wrong, this conversation is unlikely to continue if you want to act +like a 12-year-old+ this way.
