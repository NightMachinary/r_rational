What do you mean by moral? I feel moral relativism can be helpful here: slavery seems impossible to justify to you because your understanding of ethics has freedom and equality (extended in such a way that it should apply to sentient pokémon) built in so deeply.

This does not need to be the case.

Moreover, one can very easily not hold these traits in high esteem, consider themselves moral (that is, make their decisions keeping their ethics in mind), and be totally rational. You've heard of Hume's Guillotine?

However, I will raise that it's entirely possible to just... not construct your version of the pokéworld where this is how it is? There are other ways to flesh things out such that the ethical ramifications are ameliorated. Especially if the story isn't about slavery, and no (good) characters are stepping out against pokémon being treated this way... you're kinda just writing yourself into a corner where you have to interface with this really uncomfortable idea for no reason.
