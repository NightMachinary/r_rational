Okay, sure, I wrote you a story :P

#+begin_quote
  One upon a time there was a happy little girl called clementine. Little Clem lived in a beautiful farm with her father, and although it could be a little lonely sometimes she was as happy as could be. She would play board games with her father (and usually win!), she gave names to all the animals she was friends with, and whenever she got bored she would go play with the boy who lived at the other farm further down the road. Then one day, an alien showed up and shot her father.

  “AAAAAAHHHHHHH!” said Clementine.

  “Are you all right, tiny human?” The green-skinned, bug-eyed alien shot her a concerned look. “The evil slaver did not hurt you, did he?”

  Clem looked at the alien monster in horror. “You shot my father! Why'd you do that?”

  The alien stared at her, perplexed. “Because the human had robbed you of individual agency. He was forcing you to do physical labour against your will, wasn't he?”

  “That's called doing chores!”

  “But our ship's sensors could clearly hear you complaining as you did them,” the alien said, confused.

  “Of course I didn't want to do them,” Clementine said. “I'm just a kid. Daddy knows what's best for me.” She rushed over to her father's side, checking his breathing the way she had been taught to do when their gelding had gotten very sick. “Oh thank Gosh, I think he's still alive.”

  “Of course he is, we only stunned him,” the alien said, frowning. “But why are you showing such concern for your slaver? It appears you might be suffering from what you humans call /Stockholm Syndrome.”/

  Clem glared at him. “I don't have any kind of /syndrome!/ My dad really does know what's best for me. He's stronger and smarter and he knows way more stuff than me.”

  “Well of course he is,” the alien said, nonplussed. “Slavers are always stronger and smarter than their slaves -- otherwise, they would be the slaves and not the other way around. Isn't that how human history always goes? The strong ruling over the weak?”

  “Uhm, I guess so,” said Clem. She was suddenly regretting not paying more attention in history class. “But that's not the point! Slavery isn't bad because having power over people is wrong, it's bad because it comes along with, like, beating people with whips and stuff if they disobey.”

  “Our ship's sensors could clearly see your father-”

  “Spanking is /not/ the same thing,” Clem said, crossing her arms. “You're not listening! It doesn't matter what /words/ you use to describe things. What matters is if people are happy or not. I love my daddy, and sure it'd be nice to have more freedom and stuff, but that doesn't mean I'd be better off without him!” She pointed to her pet chicken. “Take Clucky here, for example. Sure, you could say I /own/ Clucky, but she's way better off with me than out in the wild and that's what-”

  “AHHHH, SLAVERY!” cried the alien, and shot Clementine.

Okay, so that one is from the perspective of a slave and not the slaver. :P

But seriously: I think it would help to understand that historically speaking a lot of people were perfectly fine with being slaves. In ancient Greece, you had slave teachers who instructed the children of the ruling class. In Ancient Rome you had slaves who would willingly fight to the death to protect their masters. There's a podcast (Hardcore History) I remember listening to about the fall of the Roman republic. A general was forced to flee from his enemies, and his trusted slave and comrade told him to run away while he stayed behind to buy him even a few seconds of time.

If you want to understand the perspective of a slaver, imagine growing up alongside your best friend, someone who's willing to fight die for you, only for some weirdo to show up and tell you that you are somehow oppressing this person just because you have more social status than they do. And imagine being told this by a person who themselves are perfectly happy exploiting their own high social status to mistreat others. :-)
