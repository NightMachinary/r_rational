Just as there is a continuity from animal intelligence to human intelligence (as Dr Pepperberg puts it, only quantitative differences instead of qualitative), there is a continuity from chattel slavery all the way up to being a CEO today. Even consent is not a pure on/off thing. That's a problem I have with historicity theories that divide people in classes, too. I always found it more fruitful to look at what equivalent deontological rules a given person is, in practice, applying in their own existence.
