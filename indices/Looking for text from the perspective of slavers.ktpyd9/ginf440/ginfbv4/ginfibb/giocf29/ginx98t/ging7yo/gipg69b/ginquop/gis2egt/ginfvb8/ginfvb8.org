I suggest reflecting on why it's hard for you to think that a moral rationalist necessarily would see an issue with pokemons being different classes.

We can make an imperfect comparison with animals. At one point Yudkowsky has publicly claimed that animals aren't conscious, with an argument along the lines that it takes multi-level modeling of other individuals to achieve awareness of self and thus consciousness, and therefore have no moral value.

Following the same logic most pokemons would not be conscious even if they sometimes acted like it. There isn't long from thinking that 'X isn't conscious' to 'the suffering of X is just mechanical and there is no qualia' to 'slavery of X isn't actually slavery because there is no real suffering'. I think it would be especially easy to make those conclusions if X was the only thing that stood between you and being a snack to the next dragon that flied by.
