I actually teach History, and Stanford reading like a Historian has a great accessible selection. I think you need to make an account, so I'll put a selection from a slave transport captain's diary. It is quite honestly one of the most evil things I have ever read.

/Captain Thomas Phillips, 1732/

  Having bought my complement of 700 slaves, 480 men and 220 women, and finish'd all my business at Whidaw fon the Gold Coast of Africa], I took my leave of the old king and his cappasheirs [attendants], and parted, with many affectionate expressions on both sides, being forced to promise him that I would return again the next year, with several things he desired me to bring from England. . . .

  There happened such sickness and mortality among my poor men and Negroes. Of the first we buried 14, and of the last 320, which was a great detriment to our voyage, the Royal African Company losing ten pounds by every slave that died, and the owners of the ship ten pounds ten shillings....

  [reddit poster note: my best research put this at around three thousand dollars in modern day currency for each slave. Which would mean the company lost about $2m, which seems about right from other numbers I've had.]

  The distemper which my men as well as the blacks mostly died of was the white flux [diarrhea], which was so violent that no medicine would in the least check it....

  [Smallpox attacks the ship.] All the assistance we gave the diseased was only as much water as they desir'd to drink, and some palm-oil to annoint their sores, and they would generally recover without any other helps but what kind nature gave them. . . .

  But what the smallpox spar'd, the flux swept off, to our great regret after *all our pains and care to give them their messes in due order and keeping their lodgings as clean and sweet as possible, and enduring so much misery and stench so long among a parcel of creatures nastier than swine*, and after all our expectations to be defeated by their mortality. . . . *No gold-finders can endure so much noisome slavery as they do who carry Negroes; for those have some respite and satisfaction, but we endure twice the misery; and yet by their mortality our voyages are ruin'd,* and we pine and fret ourselves to death, and take so much pains to so little purpose.

Here's selections from a speech from John Calhoun, a separatist and ardent supporter of slavery. He's really the spearhead for the argument states rights prevent fixing any sort of discrimination. Here's an 1837 speech from him.

  I do not belong, said Mr. C., to the school which holds that aggression is to be met by concession. Mine is the opposite creed, which teaches that encroachments must be met at the beginning, and that those who act on the opposite principle *are prepared to become slaves.* In this case, in particular I hold concession or compromise to be fatal. If we concede an inch, concession would follow concession...

  [redditor note: Slaveholders love talking about how important their liberty is and how much honor they have. There were jokes about that at the time.]

  Unless [Abolitionism] be speedily stopped, it will spread and work upwards till it brings the two great sections of the Union into deadly conflict... I told him that *the doctrine was tantamount to the assumption of unlimited power on the part of the Government*, and that such would be the impression on the public mind in a large portion of the Union.

  . I then predicted that it would commence as it has with this fanatical portion of society, and that *they would begin their operations on the ignorant, the weak, the young, and the thoughtless* ---and gradually extend upwards till they would become strong enough to obtain political control, when he and others holding the highest stations in society, would, however reluctant, be compelled to yield....

  *Already it has taken possession of the pulpit, of the schools*, and, to a considerable extent, of the press; those great instruments by which the mind of the rising generation will be formed. In the course of a few years they will be succeeded by those who will have been taught to hate the people and institutions of nearly one-half of this Union, with a hatred more deadly than one hostile nation ever entertained towards another. It is easy to see the end. By the necessary course of events, if left to themselves, we must become, finally, two people.

  [Redditor's note: He's consciously using Declaration of Independence language here.]

  *We of the South will not, cannot, surrender our institutions.* To maintain the existing relations between the two races, inhabiting that section of the Union, is indispensable to the peace and happiness of both. It cannot be subverted without drenching the country or the other of the races. . . . *But let me not be understood as admitting, even by implication, that the existing relations between the two races in the slaveholding States is an evil:---far otherwise; I hold it to be a good*. I appeal to facts. Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.

  In the meantime, the white or European race, has not degenerated. It has kept pace with its brethren in other sections of the Union where slavery does not exist. It is odious to make comparison; but *I appeal to all sides whether the South is not equal in virtue, intelligence, patriotism, courage, disinterestedness, and all the high qualities which adorn our nature.*

  I may say with truth, that in few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer, and so little exacted from him, or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age. Compare his condition with the tenants of the poor houses in the more civilized portions of Europe---look at the sick, and the old and infirm slave, on one hand, in the midst of his family and friends, under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress, and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poorhouse.

Further things you might look up are Drapetomania, a mental disorder that made slaves run away. Petty's account of Drake's voyage is kickass, and he was both a slave trader and worked with escaped slaves on his attacks.
