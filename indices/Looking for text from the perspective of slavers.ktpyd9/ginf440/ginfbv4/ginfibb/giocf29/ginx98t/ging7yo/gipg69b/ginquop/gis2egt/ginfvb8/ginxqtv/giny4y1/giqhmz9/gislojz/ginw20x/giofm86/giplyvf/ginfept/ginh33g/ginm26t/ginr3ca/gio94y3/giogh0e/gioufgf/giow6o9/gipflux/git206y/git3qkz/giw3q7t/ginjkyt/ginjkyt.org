I'm going to preface this by saying I've previously replied to someone wanting to make rational version of this series by saying they were trying to steel man defection: I don't like recommending it.

That said I think there was a few sympathetic and moral slave-owning characters in Under the Yoke of the Draka series. Waring: the series is alternative history with south Africans beating the Nazis at being the most racist and winning WWII. This book if I remember right is set during the cold War. I can only recommending it because you are looking for sympathetic slavers and you kind of need a setting where slavery is normalized or is being normalized so you get moral actors not necessarily questioning their assumptions, or accepting their societies justifications.
