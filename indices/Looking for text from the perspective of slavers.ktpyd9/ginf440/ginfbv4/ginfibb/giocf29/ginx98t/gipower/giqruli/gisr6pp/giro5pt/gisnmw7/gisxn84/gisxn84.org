I'm not particularly interested in the object level debate, so much as in the assumption implicit in that particular turn of phrase ('moral blindspot') that the choice to eat meat must be an unexamined one. By your own admission, you've thought about the issue and have decided to carry on eating meat; is it so strange to imagine that other people might make the same decision without feeling hypocritical about it?
