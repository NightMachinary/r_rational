I agree. You'd have to write them like you would a rational(ist) meat eater. I.e. they'd have to have some form lf moral blindspot or be some form of preference utilitarians or some such.

But I don't get why that's so hard to writr. Maybe because I am a carnivore, like Yudkowsky and his HJPEV character.
