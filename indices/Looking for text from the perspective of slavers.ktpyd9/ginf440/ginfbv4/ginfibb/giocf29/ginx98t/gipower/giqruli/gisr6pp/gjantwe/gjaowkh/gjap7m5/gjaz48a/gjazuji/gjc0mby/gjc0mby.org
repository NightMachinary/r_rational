I certainly disagree with the last two sentences of the last post, but this discussion is already ranging far. To put it in your terms:

If ethics are a way to convince others to act accordingly, and you are a utilitarian, then you must want others to be utilitarian. Maximizing happiness or good comes with the obvious inverse of minimizing pain.

The pain animals feel is empirically and instinctually real. Furthermore, the separation between humans and other living things is empirically a matter of degrees rather than distinct categories.

Therefore, by creating an arbitrary separation between humans and animals, and ignoring the pain of animals undermines the principle of utilitarianism, which makes it less widespread and less of a total belief, which makes it less useful.
