The implication of 'moral blindspot' is that the choice to eat meat must be an unexamined one; that no rational person who has actually considered the issue could possibly come to the conclusion that killing and eating animals is moral. Pushing back on that isn't being euphemistic, it's insisting that people don't assume the conclusion in the terminology being used.
