The same can be said with certain categories if humans. A blatant racist will pick a human race and consider them irrevocably inferior to the point that civilized living alongside them is considered impossible in their eyes.

But if you instead take humans with certain severe mental handicaps you could even make this argument without ignoring the science.

And of course there would be the option of genetically creating a slave race that is designed to barely not be our peers so that we can use and abuse them without feeling guilty about it.
