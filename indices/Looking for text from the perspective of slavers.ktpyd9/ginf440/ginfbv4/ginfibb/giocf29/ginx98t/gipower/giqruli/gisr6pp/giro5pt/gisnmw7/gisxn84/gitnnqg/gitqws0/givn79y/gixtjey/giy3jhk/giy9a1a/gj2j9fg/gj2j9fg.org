  Please seriously consider the possibility that other people might honestly disagree with this claim. That a person might honestly follow their moral convictions in word and in deed without compromising them for the sake of convenience. That the people who disagree with you on matters of morality really do disagree with you in their heart of hearts rather than secretly agreeing with you while lying about it to save face.

Sure they can. People believe all kinds of things with amazing levels of conviction. I yet to encounter a logically consistent argument that meat eating is good/moral/virtuous though.

  Rawls's veil of ignorance concept is based on formalizing a solution to precisely this sort of concern. Chattel slavery can be universalized as wrong precisely because even the most heartless and selfish slave owner would prefer to ban chattel slavery if they found themselves in a position where they might have to live the life of the slave instead. That's a very core moral intuition - that if you wouldn't want it to happen to you, you shouldn't allow it to happen to others like you - simply stated more formally. Slavery is bad because nobody would want to be a slave.

How does this concept not also apply to, say, pigs then? Even the most avid meat eater would rather the world were vegetarian if he could somehow find himself having to live the life of a pig in a meat factory.
