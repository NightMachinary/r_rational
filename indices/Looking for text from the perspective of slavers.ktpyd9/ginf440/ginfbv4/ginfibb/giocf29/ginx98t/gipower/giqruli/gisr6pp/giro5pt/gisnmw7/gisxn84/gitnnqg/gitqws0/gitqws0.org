One person's modus ponens is another person's modus tollens.

If a particular ethical philosophy (be it preference utilitarianism or otherwise) says that killing and eating animals is morally very bad, but that your own decision making process nevertheless results in you eating meat, there's two possible conclusions:

1. That your decision making process at least occasionally has you do things which are morally very bad, or,

2. That that particular ethical philosophy (whatever it may be) does not reflect morality, at least as it pertains to meat eating.

There's nothing wrong with arriving at first possibility. It fits the evidence available as well as anything else. But it is important to remember that the second possibility is something that equally reasonable people with equally evidence and only slightly different priors from your own might arrive at. Not because they are morally blind, but simply because they are approaching the question from a very different angle.
