  Might I suggest that perhaps other people are more morally self-consistent than you are? That when other people say that they're OK with something, it really IS because they're OK with it and NOT because they (like you) recognize it as bad, but have decided to keep on doing it regardless?

One can be okay with something even if it is objectively bad. It's called being, to some degree, selfish and/or positively biased towards your family/friends/acquaintances/culture/species/planet/whatever.

  I don't mean this as an insult, I just find it deeply weird that you apparently object to meat eating, but can bring yourself to do it regardless! If I thought slaughtering and eating animals was even a tenth as bad as slaughtering and eating a person, I'd prefer to starve.

In our civilization we benefit from the death of others all the time. Like when we buy an electronic device for instance. We might not be literally eating their flesh, but it's not like it makes a difference to the corpse.

  Thirdly, can I recommend taking a look at various social contract theories when you get the chance? It's not all Kant, trust me. In particular, I'd recommend Gauthier's "Morals by Agreement", which rather neatly lays out the case against utilitarianism egoism and suggests instead a system of 'constrained maximization' where people agree to a basic social contract to enforce cooperation toward shared values while allowing individuals the liberty to pursue their own aims, so long as they do not come into conflict with said social contract. Also worth considering is Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" which lays out how one might fairly determine the contents of said social contract through something analogous to pie-cutting algorithms and other game-theoretical formalizations of the concept of fairness. None of them directly touch on animal rights issues, but the obvious objection would be that chickens (for example) are not our peers, offer us no reason to respect their preferences and only merit consideration under the social contract insofar as the general public has strong preferences about them which can be universalized under a Rawlsian veil of ignorance. And even then, it wouldn't be because anything is owed to the chickens (or other animals), but because we have promised it to the people who like chickens.

That sounds like a morality that is purely based on how useful people are to your society and how much everyone requires appeasement in order to remain useful instead of becoming disruptive for their own benefit. That's less morality and more enlightened self-interest projected on a naturally social species. It also allows for the complete trampling upon everything that can be enslaved without risk or the ability to pull at our emotions.

Like, under such a system you can't even a priori say that chattel slavery was necessarily evil. It just turned out to be a bad long term investment and the former slaves and their non-slaver allies managed to pass a new agreement with the rest of society.

I'm sorry, but I don't subscribe to complete moral relativism. But if you have an argument on how meat eating can be considered morally positive or neutral without making away with the whole concept of objective right and wrong, then I'm all ears.
