I think you may have to make compromises when it comes to morality if you truly want to stick with this concept.

The truth is that humans are rarely moral in all aspects of their life, even the ones who we consider to be good in hindsight. As was the case with Slavery in real life, there may even be people who consider the act of slavery to be immoral (or are at least question its morality) while they actively participate in it.

Instead of trying to consider how a good person could rationalize slavery as being good. Maybe you should consider why a person who is mostly moral in other aspects of their lives would make an exception for something that they know or suspect to be evil.

I'm no expert on this, but I think the gist of it is that once you're used to a system of evils that you are profiting from, it's incredibly hard to stop participating in that system when you have no similarly convenient alternatives.

Imagine a world where electricity was created by pinching babies and making them cry. There is no other way to create electricity and as far as modern science knows there never will be another way to create electricity. The only choice someone has is to either condone the pinching of babies or live their lives without any of the modern conveniences they enjoy.

Most people will rationalize this by saying things like "It's not like the pinching does long term damage to the babies." "Lots of babies don't even remember being pinched after they've grown up."

The more pragmatic folks will say "Yes it's a shame that we need to pinch babies for power. But the benefits of electricity outweigh the collective pain that the babies feel".

And the thoughtful and compassionate people will take note that the babies who are being sent to the pinching factory are generally those who belong to the poor and marginalized members of society. The people who receive the most benefit from the pinching are not the people being pinched, or even the people whose children are being pinched. Pinching babies is exploitative at best and evil at worst.

And some of those compassionate people will boycott electricity and try to shed light on its evils.

But most of them will realize that without electricity they can't perform the jobs that put food on the table. They can't have simple pleasures like watching tv, or even turning on a lightbulb to read at night. Even if their goal is to shed light on the evils of baby pinching, they recognize that it would be hard to even organize an anti-baby pinching rally without using social media.

And lets say that they themselves were able to boycott electricity entirely and never use it in their homes or at work. It wouldn't do much good if everything they buy is made with electricity and everyone they know uses it as well. Essentially the only way to fully boycott electricity is to live by yourself in a cabin in the woods. And how many people actually have the means or the necessary skills to do so?

So instead, most of your compassionate people try to work within the system. Instead of getting rid of baby pinching entirely, they try to campaign for cutting down on electrical power usage. They try to get laws passed which limit the amount of time a single baby can be pinched per day/week/month. They work for incremental progress to reduce the horrors of baby pinching, because they don't believe it's practical to abolish the whole system all at once.

And all the while they make use of electricity while recognizing that it is clearly the result of someone else's suffering. Yet they hope for a day when society progresses to a point where it doesn't have to be.

Obviously replace baby pinching here with catching Pok√©mon and I think you get a semi-realistic view of how a mostly moral person could support pokemon slavery.

Edit: I chose electricity to represent the benefits of Pokemon usage because in the TV show Pokemon are much more versatile and prevalent in society than slaves ever were. They provide benefits that cannot be replicated by simply replacing Pokemon with Humans, because pokemon can do things that a human cannot. Unlike real life where the difference between slaves and their owners was arbitrary, and the benefits only came from having free human labor.
