I don't have any particular works but here's a few reasons for why people might be OK with slavery:

1. Pokemons have a better life being slaves compared to being wild because they are more likely to survive/evolve quicker/have more stable food/have more love/exist in civilized cultures.
2. It's just normal. Many people don't question the normal and even inquisitive people are usually only 'really' inquisitive within specific domains.
3. Given that people are more intelligent than pokemons(just look at the culture of their society/technology/whatever) they are apex predators and thus deserve to rule over pokemons.
4. Even if slavery is abhorent the world would eat up humans if they didn't have pokemon to fight for them.
5. Pokemons aren't sentient/conscious, they are only following instincts, and thus they have no moral value.
6. Pokemons actually want to be enslaved and pokemons that look like they don't just don't know what are good for them.
