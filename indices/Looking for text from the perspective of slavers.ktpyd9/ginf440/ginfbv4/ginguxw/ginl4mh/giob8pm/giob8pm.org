Could be a ditto who mimics as a human and becomes the Pokemon champion of the region before revealing its true form, or a ditto which captures a bunch of legendaries or other powerful Pokemon and fights alongside them whilst commanding them and the advantage of having the ditto trainer be able to fight and become the enemies or they own Pokemon would give the ditto a significant advantage, in a regular 1 vs 1 the trainer opponent would be useless and just shouting instructions but the ditto could actually fight at the same time as their Pokemon and one could lure away the Pokemon whilst the other goes for the opponent trainer. Ditto trainer could also breed with any Pokemon and breed itself an army of ultra strong Pokemon. Ditto trainer would also be able to communicate with and understand these Pokemon better since not only is it also a Pokemon but that auto translator would also help. You could have the ditto trainer be a criminal and either have its own criminal organisation or subvert team rocket into a group who wants to free Pokemon and humanity demonises them due to the negative impact it would have on humanity, the ditto trainer could raid Pokemon daycares or centres and free the Pokemon using some sort of invention or meteor ring that interferes with the binding to pokeball process and frees them from any they are bound to. I'd love to read a Pokemon fan fiction like that!
