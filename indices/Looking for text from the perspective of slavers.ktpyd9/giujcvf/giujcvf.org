Your apparent basic impetus that being an intelligent person truly concerned with ethics and being a proponent of slavery are inconsistent is correct. If someone endorses slavery, they are perhaps trying to dress up their opinion as moral, but something has gone wrong along the way. If you read some books by slaves, such as some of Frederick Douglass's accounts of his time as a slave, I think you get both what pro-slavery people were saying and how it actually affected slaves in practice, as far as first-hand accounts go. If you want slavery in your work, you're going to have to grapple with the fact that slavery, using any reasonable definition of the term, has huge ethical issues to put it mildly. I would advise that if you pursue a story, don't justify slavery in the meta-narrative. Just because so-and-so is the protagonist or an ally of the protagonist doesn't mean so-and-so is behaving ethically in all respects. Honestly, I am kind of baffled this question is being asked in this form.
