If you want actual accounts by Slavers you could do worse than checking out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Tom_literature][Anti-Tom literature]]. Especially the stuff that was written before the Civil War as afterwards you start to get retconning. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planter%27s_Northern_Bride][The Planters Northern Bride]] is a story I found especially interesting.
