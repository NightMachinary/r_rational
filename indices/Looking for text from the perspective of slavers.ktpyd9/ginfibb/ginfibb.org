Those poor purple savages. Look at them... They lack the brilliant works of art specific to my culture, they don't know the truth that is my religion, and they don't live in the beautiful architecture style of my people. Clearly, their lives are squalor and misery, regardless of how happy they might appear to the untrained eye. It's probably because they are the immediate ancestors of humans, right on the brink of breaking through to full human intelligence. As an enlightened green person I have a moral obligation to help the purples. They will be far better off living under my rule, being forcibly inducted into my culture, on my property over here on this civilized continent, than they would be living in their own culture among their own people on the land that their families have lived on for thousands of years. Conveniently, I have a lot of land that needs to be farmed. It is entirely reasonable that they pay me for my generous efforts and expenditure of my time uplifting them into true sapience, and given their lack of intelligence the easiest way for them to do that is to farm for me. They are lazy so I will need to provide them motivation and they aren't smart enough to appreciate the advantages that money can buy, so paying them a wage is pointless. I'll have to use negative motivations, i.e. beatings and hangings. And, of course, the easiest way to raise them up into true sapience is to mix my superior genetics with theirs. It's a great sacrifice on my part, but it's my moral duty as an enlightened green person. Fortunately, they are close enough to human that some of their females are quite attractive.

My god has told me that I must rule over the purple people. If I do not then my loving god will flay me over and over for all eternity. He will do the same to them if I can't force them to perform the appropriate sacred dances and tell Him how wonderful and loving he is. I am saving their souls from eternal flaying by ruling over them in the ruthless manner commanded by my god.
