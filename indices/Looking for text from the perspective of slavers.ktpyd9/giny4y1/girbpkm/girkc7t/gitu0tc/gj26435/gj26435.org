In light of the comments here, I think I will be approaching it from a Utilitarian perspective. Also, the most enlightening comment for me so far was:

  It would also help if there were no real historic incidences of massive abuse in slavery in your story. In our world simply knowing your history shows you the dangers of slavery, but in a world where all the history tends to colour it somewhat truthfully as a net-positive, its much easier to arrive at a supportive stance.

Which I think is very true. So I will be going with; Its a complete net benefit, mostly (or the system is intended to be) consensual and there aren't any historical examples for people to use as emotional arguments against it. (which even if rational arguments exist, the most effective ones are often emotional arguments).
