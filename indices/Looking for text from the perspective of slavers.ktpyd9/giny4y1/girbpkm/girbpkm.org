The way I always interpreted the anime, pokemon are psychologically different from humans - they don't mind having trainers (once they're caught - some even come willingly), etc. So what would be a slavery to a person psychologically sufficiently similar to a human, is more of a friend-friend or an owner-pet relationship with a pokemon.
