Alright, so some general points from my years of reading terrible people, like the two above.

- Dehumanization is hugely important, and the first narrative is symptomatic of it. However, dehumanization is very, very, very difficult to maintain through frequent contact. I read a speech from I think Goebbels talking about the mental stress shooting Jews had on SS officers. In the speech he mentioned how everyone had a favorite Jew they wanted to save even if they were in favor of extermination in the abstract (note, even Hitler personally spared his Jewish commanding officer).

- The weirdest thing to think about and truly understand is cognitive dissonance. Many, many, many people are taught / police themselves to not notice or ask questions about conflicting beliefs. I have seen that on /these forums/. The not asking questions part legitimately terrifies me. See 1984 if you want to see it in action.

- The most frequent technique to prevent examination of cognitive dissonance is to change from an absolute for of reasoning to a comparative form. (Look at this, we're much better in comparison to an outgroup.) Thus concerns about right or wrong are minimized.

- Identity politics and transfer is hugely, hugely, hugely important. "If you criticize a practice, you criticize our group, and our group is great so you can't criticize us." Furthermore, supporting and protecting the created group identity is hugely important. Calhoun does his rah, rah, rah, the South is the best in there.

- Appeal to tradition (including imagined tradition) also frequently shows up. Keep in mind that the sacred institutions Calhoun is hell-bent on protecting are /50 years old/ when he makes this speech. Again, this is a way of unifying life into a series of cohesive identities if not a cohesive system for viewing the world.

- The opposite of identity politics, demonization of groups that "threaten" the in-group is part of the maintenance of identity. They're who you transfer all your frustration at cognitive dissonance to. It's not that shit ideas and lies launched a coup d'Ã©tat in the US; hidden members of Antifa fomented the crowd. Because threats help maintain the identity, members of the group are un/consciously looking for new scapegoats.

In some ways the captain's narrative is purer and simpler evil. He wants to make money so he sells slaves. (The same packet has a narrative from someone who also joined a slave ship for money, and the experiences turned him into an Abolitionist.) Calhoun's narrative is however more typical of a participant in a slave society.
