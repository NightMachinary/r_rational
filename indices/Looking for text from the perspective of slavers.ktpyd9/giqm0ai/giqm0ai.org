I think House Elves are the best example of this? The issue is barely touched upon in canon because JKR is a terrible person, but various fanfictions (including The Arithmancer) cover the topic in great detail.

In this case, you have an entire species who were created specifically to be slaves. Their culture is formed entirely around their enslavement. Oddballs who want freedom exist, but mostly as a result of horrific abuse; House Elves with masters who don't horrifically abuse them almost never want to leave. Even then, all of them place high value on working incredibly hard their entire lives, with even free elves negotiating their own pay and benefits /downwards,/ in full knowledge that this is what they are doing, and knowing that their employers won't look down on them for wanting more. Elves freed involuntarily almost always spin into despair and die, even if they find new employment.

Given this, given a species with broadly human values and intelligence except an inverted desire for freedom, is it moral to deny them the position they were created to fill? Obviously whoever created these beings should be hunted down like the animal he is, but the cat's already out of the bag and a species that literally wants to be enslaved exists. You could argue that they just do that because they're all brainwashed, but brainwashing an entire species that uniformly seems unlikely. The human values generally seen as universal (empathy, wanting to minimize pain for at least the ingroup) are probably a result of our physiology, rather than cultural conditioning. Even if that isn't the case for House Elves, just freeing all of them at once would probably be akin to genocide unless preceded by generations of careful reconditioning.

At that point, being a slaver starts to make a whole lot more sense. You actually have good reason to think thay not enslaving these people would increase the suffering in the world (as opposed to all the awful reasons forwarded by real-world slavers). There is a coherent argument for slavery of House Elves in even the most progressive of societies, and moral, rational people could probably agree with its conclusions.

But I'm not sure if that helps you. If the Pokemon you want to write also value their own enslavement the same way humans value freedom, or if you can write the story to include such a factor, go ahead, but I don't think it's possible for a rational and good person to be pro-slavery in any other circumstance.
