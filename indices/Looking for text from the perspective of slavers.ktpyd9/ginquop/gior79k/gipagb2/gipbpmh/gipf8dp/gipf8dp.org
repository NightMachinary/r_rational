It was not THE cause, but it's true that in Roman times slavery was much closer to a social class issue than anything like what we're used to in modern times. Slaves were, simply put, whoever was on the last rung of the social ladder. They may be war prisoners, or poor people - the point is, they were slaves because they /became/ slaves, not because anyone said, "well, this race of people clearly has to be kept in slavery, they're too dumb for their own good". Slaves could be teachers and secretaries (famously, Cicero's secretary was a slave who then bought his freedom, and they remained close associates), they weren't assumed to be automatically beastly and subhuman. It was a different mindset. The racist rationalisations for slavery in the modern era had to be made up /because/ slavery used to be normal, but then Christianity made it bad, and so it became unacceptable to most. When it started to become really fucking convenient to just enslave the locals while colonising the Americas, it wasn't exactly easy to justify it without looking evil - so the idea started to form that "oh, well, but these guys are savages, they couldn't do anything without us! Also they need to learn the truth of Christ! Really, we're doing them a favour!". And then they all died so the colonists looked at Africa and said "oh, more savages! More people who need to learn about Christ! Let's go pick them up! Look how good we are!". But the rationalisations were necessary fundamentally because people already saw slavery, generally, as a bad thing. In Roman times, that wasn't so. Slavery was just the normal state of things. It was like poverty today. Some people will tell you it's bad, but many will say, well, that's how the world works, some people will always have less, and they wouldn't be motivated to work anyway if we just gave them money.
