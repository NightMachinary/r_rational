  Following the same logic most pokemons would not be conscious even if they sometimes acted like it.

By functionalism, if something acts conscious, it is conscious - the question is if they don't act conscious often enough for it to matter to people. But my impression was that OP is looking for a "justification" of slavery in a setting where pokemon are visibly conscious and sapient (edit: apparently not all ("varied degrees of intelligence"), but still), but maybe that's just my feeling.
