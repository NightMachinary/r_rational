Yeah, my issue is that I can't see Yudkowsky making the same (or another) argument if animals showed that some of them could understand humans as well as other humans and execute complex tasks like any other human.

I think that the reason I can't do this is because this is an ingrained core principal of my morality; that no-one "deserves" any more than another person due to anything but said person's actions. My issue is I can't see someone who doesn't hold this belief as "good", although I think rationally it should be possible and maybe seeing their perspective can help me with that.
