Aristoteles was a moral rationalist, and he argued that slavery was permissible under the right circumstances ([[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html]["Politics" Book 1, part 3]]). Mises (which I am aware is a biased source) also gathers ten arguments that have historically been used to defend slavery ([[https://mises.org/library/ten-reasons-not-abolish-slavery][Ten Reasons Not to Abolish Slavery]]). Some moderns libertarians also argue for slavery, as long as people sell themselves into it voluntarily. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Block#%22Voluntary_slave_contract%22][Walter Block]] is the most famous example.

There are currents of modern Islam, [[https://tradetsmakadetorsdag.wordpress.com/2020/10/18/islams-troubling-relationship-to-slavery/][which still includes arguments for slavery]]. The dawa-influencer Daniel Haqiqatjou tries to motivate his position on slavery, partly by referring to secular sources. Insisting that slavery does not substantially differ from arduous and low-status forms of employment - and is better suited to help the vulnerable. He uses the old "you take better care of a car you own than the one you rent, likewise a slave owner is more invested in a slave's health than an employer is in a worker"-argument. In my experience, dawa-influencers tend to assume that Allah is benevolent and rational. If Allah has accepted slavery, then there must be morally rational reasons for this slavery, which one can deduce. Implying a type of "ideal observer" theory of ethics, where Allah is the ideal observer and does not simply decide morality arbitrarily, but at least partially roots morality in some type of utilitarian calculus. Or at least, that is how they present their reasoning to their western audiance.

Relevant to the discussion is also the "[[https://philosophicalvegan.com/wiki/index.php/NameTheTrait][name the trait]]"-challenge from vegans. Almost all of the same arguments used to defend needlessly killing animals who possess advanced minds, social nature, and deep sensory experiences - can be used to defend slavery - with relatively minor tweaking. It's not hard to imagine motivated cognization giving someone that extra push needed to extend those arguments.

Imagine a human society that uses animal X as a source of meat and as a domesticated workforce within the farm (such as letting horses draw plows). They can clearly observe that X can't reason to the same level as humans, can't learn the same things as humans. All X remain on the same intelligence level as pigs. Humans conclude that this trait is immutable. Unbeknownst to them, this species had actually evolved to have higher intelligence than humans. The cognitively weak X they are interacting with, are survivors of a world war fought with bioweapons, one of these weapons was a virus that enforced epigenetic effects that lowered intelligence immensely.

This effect is not permanent. The virus is becoming less efficient for each generation, causing the species to become more intelligent rapidly. At what level of intelligence, would it become morally necessary for humans to free all X? How many generations can humans keep less intelligent beings as forced servants?

This isn't actually all that far from reality. Black and white people are equal in intelligence, in my worldview at least, but this was not always known. Racism within the American south used to be so extreme, that they viewed it as impossible for black people to be taught fully in school. To quote a part of history on that matter: "In 1871, the Georgia legislature created a board of visitors to attend public examinations at Atlanta University. The chairman of the first board of visitors was ex-slaveholder Joseph Brown, who reportedly said that he expected the examinations to confirm the Negro's inferiority. But the recitations of former slaves in Latin, Greek, and geometry forced from him the confession that "we were impressed with the fallacy of the popular idea . . . that the members of the African race are not capable of a high grade of intellectual culture."  And the Atlanta Constitution could hardly "believe what we witnessed. To see colored boys and girls fourteen to eighteen years of age, reading in Greek and Latin, and demonstrating correctly problems in Algebra and Geometry . . . appears almost wonderful" (Sowell, Thomas "Black Rednecks and White Liberals" [[https://books.google.se/books?redir_esc=y&hl=sv&id=JMxpBOnQIH8C&q=ear#v=onepage&q=appears%20almost%20wonderful&f=false][Page 39]] )

I doubt the accuracy of the claim, but it has been estimated that the gorilla Koko had an IQ of between 75 and 95 ([[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44559261]["Koko: Gorilla who mastered sign language dies in California" BBC]]). I am personally skeptical towards the usefulness of IQ, and the accuracy of IQ-tests (there is something close to the truth there, but it doesn't seem to capture the whole scope). I am particularly skeptical towards the whole field of "IQ and race" (it screams bias to me). With that said, the available data, taken at face value, suggest that [[https://www.worlddata.info/iq-by-country.php][there are several countries where the average IQ is lower than 75]]. I've seen people online who combine these two contested facts, too assert that several "races" are less intelligent than gorillas.

My point is that it really isn't that difficult for people to convince themselves that differences in intelligence are greater than it actually is the case, creating the illusion that others are so unintelligent to need the forceful rulership of others as to not cause great harm to themselves or others. Viewing the subjugation of other groups as equally morally trivial as forcing children to partake in studying - sure the child wants to do other things but doesn't know what's best for him/her. You will benefit from the child achieving a proper education, having a family member who can help support you when your old, but that doesn't mean that you are acting selfishly in forcing the little one off to school. So two the slavemaster sees himself as doing what's best for the slave and being naturally rewarded for his efforts without being selfish in his motives.
