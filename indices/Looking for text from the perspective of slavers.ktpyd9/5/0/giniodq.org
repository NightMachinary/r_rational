  Iphones are made in sweatshops, aren't they? But this doesn't stop most of us from buying them because, well, we're not the ones forcing people in that position.

This is the only way I can think of to portray it, but in this case you are literally owning them, and if I am to stick to cannon, morally good people are directly encouraging this behavior such as Prof. Oak, etc.

For the rest, that is what I intend to do, but it still is hard for me to get into the mindset of someone who thinks this is normal: I know that this is a personal failing and I am trying to fix that, probably stories from their perspective can help hence the question.
