If you want to understand behaviour that seems alien to you, start by considering if maybe it's not alien all and you're already doing it without being aware of it. Iphones are made in sweatshops, aren't they? But this doesn't stop most of us from buying them because, well, we're not the ones forcing people in that position. We're just benefiting from a system that already exists - and hey, doesn't that sound familiar?

Or what about servants? We're perfectly comfortable with having people wait on us in restaurants. And some of those people may be treated badly, or paid poorly, but we don't think about it very much because hey, we didn't create the system. There are many poor people who are constantly stressed and terrified of losing their jobs. Women who must put up with sexual harassment from their boss. But that's acceptable, we say, because they have a "choice". Well, slaves also have a choice to kill themselves, but most don't make use of that option.

In fact, actually owning a slave and treating them well might be considerably *more* moral than being a modern day employer who treats his or her workers poorly. It's all a question of how you act based on the circumstances you grow up in, and the beautiful thing about society is that nobody feels complicit in creating the system even though in reality everybody is.
