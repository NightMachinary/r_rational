could you go around the problem by changing the entire mechanics of it? ie. a pokemon is never caught unless it actively acknowledges the trainer, and it works more like a contractual relationship in which the trainer provides for the pokemon and the pokemon chooses to defend the trainer? Or just a straight up friend dynamic. No need for any slavery talk. And if you do, you can keep it to the bad guys of your story, tie pokeball manufacturers who make master balls and other balls that have higher catch rates as being immoral and evil and whatnot.
