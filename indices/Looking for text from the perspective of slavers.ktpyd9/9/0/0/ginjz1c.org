  Yeah, my issue is that I can't see Yudkowsky making the same (or another) argument if animals showed that some of them could understand humans as well as other humans and execute complex tasks like any other human.

(1) The evolutionary reasoning still holds. (2) You don't know that they understand humans as well as other humans. You might see a cat acting as if it understands humans but with the current technology it is impossible to experience it from the cats perspective so all you can do is making deductions and there is a real chance you'd be wrong. (3) Pokemon don't execute complex tasks as well as any other human. Pokemon cultures, insofar as we can call them that, almost never use tools which implies they are less intelligent for some kinds of intellect.

  I think that the reason I can't do this is because this is an ingrained core principal of my morality; that no-one "deserves" any more than another person due to anything but said person's actions. My issue is I can't see someone who doesn't hold this belief as "good", although I think rationally it should be possible and maybe seeing their perspective can help me with that.

(1) What I am seeing from this is that you're actual question is 'how would someone who is good, as defined by my personal moral system, be okay with slavery' and the answer is that they just wouldn't because your personal moral system doesn't allow that. Recognize that your moral system likely have flaws and consider how someone might arrive at a different system based on the points I and others have made.(2) Do you live on the street? If you don't you are holding capital that could be used to feed or house people who do. That implies that either you accept that those people don't deserve your money as much as you do or that there are areas of your moral system which you are willing to compromise on in order to have a pleasant life.
