I mean, if you're going to go rational!pokemon, why do 1-on-1 battles? Why not carry a sack (or bandolier) full of pokeballs, and sic 50 pokemon on your opponent?

Actually, why use pokeballs by hand? Just have a truck with a pokeball array, so you can mass-deploy before a fight. Armored pokemon carrier.
