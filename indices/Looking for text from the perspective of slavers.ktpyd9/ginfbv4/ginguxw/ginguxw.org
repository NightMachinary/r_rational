Even if 1,2,4 is literally true, 3 and 6 is usually true, I still am having trouble seeing how a rational character wouldn't see that there could always be an exception to these points; a Pokemon who could be a better trainer than a Human, so this shouldn't be denied to them, and if it isn't denied to them it should not be expected that they abide by this due to their species.

I can only really see someone being 1. purposefully ignorant, as we do with animals now or 2. have a reason like 5, which I just don't think off as moral.
