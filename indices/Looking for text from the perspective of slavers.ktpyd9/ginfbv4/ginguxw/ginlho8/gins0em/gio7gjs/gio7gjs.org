Is 'you know better' a negative character trait if it's literally true, to the best of our knowledge? Gets into interesting philosophical and legal territory with the mentally unwell, or with assisted suicide. Legally binding documents can be thrown out if the person signing is not able to make the adjudication themselves, but those people tend to have a guardian who can make decisions on their behalf - that's VERY similar to ownership, though maybe not in line with your preferred vein of moral rationalism. Many jurisdictions ban assisted suicides, even though someone may have a sincere and reasoned desire to commit one. These are both legal cases, rather than rational or philosophical ones, but they might give some context to that last statement.
