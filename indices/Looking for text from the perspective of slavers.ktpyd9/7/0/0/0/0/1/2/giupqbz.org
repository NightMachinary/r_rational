Children becoming slaves happened in Roman times but it was very rare for what I know. Certainly, slaves weren't /bred/ the way they were in late US chattel slavery. The original comment mentioned that ancient slavery was due to poverty instead of race, you expressed distaste at the fact that anyone was upvoting it, I wanted to specify that it was accurate.

I also think it does open a road for OP's question; while still questionable, you /could/ somewhat justify “this person owed me, and under terms of a contract they accepted they are now my slave until their debt is extinct”. Cold as fuck, but still way closer to being moral than other justifications, since at least it involves consent at some point.
