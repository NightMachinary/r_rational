Fair points. Your first two comments down this thread seemed more concerned with the poverty/race division.

I addressed the OP elsewhere. Essentially, if you put physical and mental welfare as more morally important than individualism and personal autonomy then its easy to rationally conclude that systems taking away the later in return for the former are a net moral good.

As to why you can't just give them both? Well, the rationalist would need to be unaware of any model of governance that can do that for pokemon or enough understanding of pokemon physiology to understand they possess that capacity within themselves.

The overall point being that some form of unrecognized racial bias is not necessary to rationally arrive at a pro-slavery view. They do need to be missing the full scope of modern understanding, but there are multiple paths toward such an incorrect yet rational view.

In our modern world? You have to rationalize. The information is too widely available.
