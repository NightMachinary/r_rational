  The original comment mentioned that ancient slavery was due to poverty instead of race, you expressed distaste at the fact that anyone was upvoting it, I wanted to specify that it was accurate.

It's inaccurate in two points - he didn't mention /ancient/ slavery, and he mentioned voluntary slavery because of poverty without saying it was just one of many possibilities, but I'm reasonably sure we've exhausted the topic at this point.
