Prior to you actually having created the world, there are no logical conclusions. You can change the setup to produce different conclusions. Maybe pokemon just aren't sentient, maybe they just /do/ like it, maybe the relationship isn't very slave like and all pokemon are choosing to hang out/enjoy battling (this is pretty much the tact the show takes). You're limiting your world to a very narrow interpretation of the universe you're writing in and not liking the results.

If, more generally, you want to experiment with exposing yourself to/writing characters with different moral compasses to yours... perhaps you should start somewhere a little safer than slavery?
