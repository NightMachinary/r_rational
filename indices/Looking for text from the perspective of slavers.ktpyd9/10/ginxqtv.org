Beside already mentioned /Tom Sawyer/ and /Gone with the Wind/ you can read some Russian classics - Pushkin, Turgenev (formally Russian serfs were not slaves, but difference was superficial). Pushkin [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Captain%27s_Daughter][The Captain's Daughter]] take part during [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Rebellion][Pugachev rebellion]] and have protagonists interacting heavily with rebels (who composed in part of slaves) while he himself is part of counterinsurgency force. The gist of it is that while both protagonist and author are sympathetic to rebels and slaves, slavery is a part of established system, and overthrowing that system is disastrous for everyone. That was position of liberal part of Russian elite in the first half of XIX century - slavery is bad but slave rebellion is much worse. Failure of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decembrist_revolt][Decembrist coup]] provided liberally inclined nobility with moral justification for tolerating slavery - some of them tried to abolish it, failed and now it was not their responsibility but that of Tsar.
