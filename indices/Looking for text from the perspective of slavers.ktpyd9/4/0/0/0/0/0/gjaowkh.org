That's an arbitrary distinction. The founders of Utilitarianism would certainly disagree with you:

/The day may come, when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny..../ T/he question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?... The time will come when humanity will extend its mantle over everything which breathes.../ "Jeremy Bentham (1748 - 1832)

/Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer "immoral," let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned./ - John Stuart Mill
