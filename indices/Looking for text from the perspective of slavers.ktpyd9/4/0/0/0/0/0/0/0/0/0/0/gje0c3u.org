Animals are a variety of 'utility monster'. If we (humans) include them in our calculations of utility, we have to take actions hat harm humans to help animals. Meanwhile, animals cannot themselves be utilitarians, so convincing them of the merits of utilitarianism is impossible.

While humans will still value animal welfare due to the fact that we are hardcoded and culturally impelled to, that means the welfare of animals should only be considered important by utilitarians as a means to achieve human welfare.*

In general, utilitarians should only seek to extend the principles of utilitarianism to groups that would themselves reciprocally support the interests of utilitarians, otherwise there's an active disincentive for people to commit themselves to following the principles of utilitarianism.

* speaking in slightly less absolute terms, some animals are indeed smart enough to display intelligent reciprocity in a manner that supports them being given utilitarian weight, but they're the exception, not the rule, and they're still worth /less/ than humans. I've lost the comments, but I shut up and did the math to figure out the value of a dog life vs a human life to find out that an arbitrary dog (rather than a specific family pet) is worth about 1/1,000th to 1/10,000th of a human by either economic or neural measures.

And if you're still going to include all animals into your utility function, at least some animals can still be ethically eaten since a human would gain more utility from eating them than they could feel. Specifically, I used neuron counts + connection density to estimate the utility of a human eating a honebee (very smart for an insect) vs. the disutility that bee would get by being eaten, and it turns out that if you even marginally enjoy it, low-end estimates of the utility you could feel outweigh even high-end estimates for the maximum possible disutility the bee could feel.
