Because pigs are not our peers. There's no way to have a society with pigs and humans as equal partners. A pig is not mentally capable of understanding the concept of reciprocity. Our decisions on whether or not to eat pork have no bearing on a pig's willingness to eat a person, even if we completely ignore the obvious physical and logistical difficulties inherent to a group of pigs running a human-meat factory. If we decided to have a social contract against eating one another, the pigs wouldn't honour it, or even realize that they was any agreement /to/ honour.
