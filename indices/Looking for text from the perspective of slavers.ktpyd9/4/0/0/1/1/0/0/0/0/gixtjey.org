There's a lot to unpack here, and honestly I'm questioning whether it's worth it. But why not:

Firstly, it is important to keep in mind that what seems obviously true to /you/ is neither necessarily obvious to /others/ nor, as it turns out, necessarily /true/ at all. There is nothing privileged about your own perspective which guarantees that you'll never be the one who gets Eulered by a seemingly convincing but ultimately flawed argument. As such, it's extremely uncharitable to assume that anyone who arrives at the opposite conclusion from you must have done so through an embarrassingly basic failure of rationality.

Secondly, though I hesitate to point this out, you seem to be positing that the people who eat meat must realize that they're doing something wrong and rejecting any moral framework which tells them so, because they'd rather have a moral framework which is flattering than one which is correct. Might I suggest that perhaps /other/ people are more morally self-consistent than you are? That when other people say that they're OK with something, it really IS because they're OK with it and NOT because they (like you) recognize it as bad, but have decided to keep on doing it regardless? I don't mean this as an insult, I just find it deeply weird that you apparently object to meat eating, but can bring yourself to do it regardless! If I thought slaughtering and eating animals was even a tenth as bad as slaughtering and eating a person, I'd prefer to starve.

Thirdly, can I recommend taking a look at various social contract theories when you get the chance? It's not all Kant, trust me. In particular, I'd recommend Gauthier's "Morals by Agreement", which rather neatly lays out the case against utilitarianism egoism and suggests instead a system of 'constrained maximization' where people agree to a basic social contract to enforce cooperation toward shared values while allowing individuals the liberty to pursue their own aims, so long as they do not come into conflict with said social contract. Also worth considering is Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" which lays out how one might fairly determine the contents of said social contract through something analogous to pie-cutting algorithms and other game-theoretical formalizations of the concept of fairness. None of them directly touch on animal rights issues, but the obvious objection would be that chickens (for example) are not our peers, offer us no reason to respect their preferences and only merit consideration under the social contract insofar as the general public has strong preferences about them which can be universalized under a Rawlsian veil of ignorance. And even then, it wouldn't be because anything is owed /to the chickens/ (or other animals), but because we have promised it to the /people who like chickens/.
