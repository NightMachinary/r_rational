Your scenario has one interesting quirk: Pokemon are significantly more powerful than humans. The weaker ones might be enslaved by force, but the stronger ones seem to just play along for the sake of a mutual relationship with its human.

Morover, many, if not most of them have human level intelligence, atop X-men level superpowers.

If they did not want to be slaves, they would not be. WE would be.
