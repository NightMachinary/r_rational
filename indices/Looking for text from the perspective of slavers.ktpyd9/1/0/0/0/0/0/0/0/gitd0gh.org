Speaking of the tech in Pokemon, I forgot that they literally digitise and store Pokemon on computers, you could technically alter or make copies of Pokemon due to that right? I'm sure if you can convert a Pokemon into digital code you could theoretically copy it as many times as you want. and as you suggest you could store tonnes of stuff in poke balls like that, it's like a tardis! :)
