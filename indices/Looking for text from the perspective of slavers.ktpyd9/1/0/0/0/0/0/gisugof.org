A mobile Pokemon deployment unit would be cool, I'm not sure what limitations are just things that happen because of the game limitations or if they're legitimate in world limitations, for example, do trainers only fight with a few Pokemon because that's how it is in the game or does being captured make them obligated to not cause harm unless explicitly requested as if they follow the laws of robotics or something and that's why the trainer has to give explicit commands rather than having them act autonomously? Can poke balls be nested? E.g. have a pyramid scheme where the Pokemon at the top has 4 poke balls containing Pokemon, the Pokemon within those balls have 4 poke balls containing Pokemon and so on, the organisation works by capturing Pokemon and those Pokemon beneath you capturing Pokemon and the higher up you are in the pyramid the larger the army you command.
