Sure they would. I mean most people eat meat and that's much more questionable.

It's still inflicting pain on dogs against their will in a situation that they can't decide to escape and within a system that allows for their abuse with little oversight or consequences for the abusers.

And if it actually was about vital training to keep people safe and there were no alternatives then there should be massive oversight and research into the most efficient and least abusive training/rapid evolution methods. Not an ad hoc system where children capture wild creatures with which they fight for sport and bet money on while exploring dangerous areas.
