  I still find it hard to get into the mindset of a Moral Rationalist who does not see an issue with Pok√©mon effectively being a different societal class.

You are presumably okay with keeping animals as pets or using them for labour. For all you know dogs are having detailed conversations with each other. Every time you think of the word dog replace it with the word for pokemon.

Stray pokemon have to be put down because of the danger they pose. Adopt a pokemon today. People who abuse or fuck pokemon are looked down upon. Still pokemon are used to protect people or animals from danger, including from other people.
