Is eating shellfish wrong? Eventually, you get into making trade-offs between the pain of harming x to pleasure y. How much pain can a shellfish endure?

What about exercise? It's painful in the short term, but feels good in the long run (the pleasure/reduced suffering of being fit/not being obese). Is the situation different just because with eating, the sufferer and recipient of pleasure are different entities, whereas for exercise, the sufferer and recipient are one and the same?
