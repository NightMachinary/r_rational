  Like when we buy an electronic device for instance.

Yes. Which is why I'm posting this from a seven year old desktop PC made entirely from recycled parts and why I use a smartphone made by a manufacturer who only uses Japanese labour. Why I wear clothing acquired as gifts, as prizes for donating blood or purchased from the army surplus store, so I know it was made in domestic factories instead of with overseas slave labour. Why I refuse to get a job with a company which sells products I think are unethical, even though my current line of work pays very poorly. Because I could not in good conscience do otherwise. It would be wrong to do it, so I don't.

  One can be okay with something even if it is objectively bad.

Please seriously consider the possibility that other people might honestly disagree with this claim. That a person might honestly follow their moral convictions in word and in deed without compromising them for the sake of convenience. That the people who disagree with you on matters of morality really do disagree with you in their heart of hearts rather than secretly agreeing with you while lying about it to save face.

  Like, under such a system you can't even a priori say that chattel slavery was necessarily evil. It just turned out to be a bad long term investment and the former slaves and their non-slaver allies managed to pass a new agreement with the rest of society.

Rawls's veil of ignorance concept is based on formalizing a solution to precisely this sort of concern. Chattel slavery can be universalized as wrong precisely because even the most heartless and selfish slave owner would prefer to ban chattel slavery if they found themselves in a position where they might have to live the life of the slave instead. That's a very core moral intuition - that if you wouldn't want it to happen to you, you shouldn't allow it to happen to others like you - simply stated more formally. Slavery is bad because nobody would want to be a slave.
