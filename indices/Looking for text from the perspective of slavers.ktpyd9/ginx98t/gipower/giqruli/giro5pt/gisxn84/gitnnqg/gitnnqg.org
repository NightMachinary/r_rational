So I noticed that I used "preference utilitarianism" completely wrong.

Please just ignore I used it until I educate myself more.

What I wanted to say in its place is simply people who care about the well being of certain categories of beings more for subjective reasons.

In other words I simply don't care enough about the suffering of animals. I accept that what I'm doing is bad and then continue doing it, because I don't feel like holding myself to those moral standards. I'm also a specieist and I am biased towards beings of a certain intelligence level and with at least the theoretical the potential to create stuff I'd care about.
