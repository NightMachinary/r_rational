Racists will say racist things, news at eleven. That is a problem for every system of ethics from utilitarianism (see the dishonest crowing about crime rates) to virtue ethics (with the supposed logic that some people cannot be trusted to govern themselves). The correct response here is to affirm that every human being is deserving of equal dignity and that anyone who disputes this quite simple premise ought be ignored when matters of morality are being discussed.

But let's go ahead and steelman that arguement. What would a person have to be like in order for them to be offered no moral consideration under a social contract theory of ethics? In no particular order:

- They would have to be incapable (or unwilling) of respecting the social contract themselves. Not in the sense of being unable to contribute to society or being somehow less productive than other people (neither of those is a disqualification to human rights - we would still want to be cared for even if we were unable to contribute as much as others) or in the sense that they are unable to articulate the abstract principles at work (we can hardly expect that of everyone), but in the more fundamental sense of being, like the pigs in our earlier example, unable or unwilling to moderate their behavior out of consideration for others. Humans can be assumed to possess this ability unless and until they have given ample evidence to the contrary.

- They must /permanently/ disabled in the above fashion. If their state was brought on by injury, there must be no possibility of recovery; if they were born that way, there must be no chance that they might grow out of it. If there is any chance that they might recover their ability to abide by the social contract, it is our duty to offer them the same level of care and respect that we would desire for ourselves if we were in their position, out of respect for the person who they will become once they regain their senses or grow into maturity.

- They must have no established preference for their care in the event of this disability. Even someone who is irrecoverably and obviously dead deserves that respect be given to their wishes during life. Likewise with someone who has become comatose or who has become too mentally ill to care for themselves - we owe it to them to carry out their wishes regarding their own care with all the respect and deference that we would hope to be afforded to our own wishes should it be us who passes.

- There must be nobody who cares enough for their welfare to take custody of them. Let's say there was a rare genetic disorder which prevented a child from ever growing up - they would remain a helpless infant forever. If the parents of such a child decided that they wished to keep their child and care for them all the same out of love for their newborn, we would have a duty to allow that and to afford their child all the protections of any other child - because if it were us with the child who we wanted to extend the protections of law over, we would want them to support us just the same. (Note that this same principle would also govern a pet pig - if you are caring for an animal, noone has the right to simply kill and eat the animal without your permission. A pig keeper has the right to his pig.)

- There must be no /marit ayin/ considerations at stake, wherein an otherwise permissible action is forbidden because it might lead onlookers into believing that a similar seeming forbidden action is acceptable. In this particular case, you're not allowed to hurt a being who /looks/ like a normal human, even if the above requirements are all satisfied, unless you also make it abundantly clear to everyone involved why an exception ought to be made in this case. Similarly, you could not use such a being to put on a macabre performance that would upset or offend onlookers, as this goes against one's duty to those onlookers.
