I don't know any works of fiction that treat of this specific issue. I've read some isekai and vrmmo stories where slavery is widely accepted, even by characters coming from modern-day earth for some reason, but those are definitively not rational fictions.

Indeed, it is hard to imagine a moral rationalist that would condone slavery, but the vast majority of people are not always perfect moral rationalists; your characters can have flaws. You can write a character that treats Pokemon like animals, but who is otherwise mostly a good, rational person.
