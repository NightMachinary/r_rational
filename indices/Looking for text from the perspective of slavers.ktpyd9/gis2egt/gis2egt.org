This one might seem orthogonal, but I hope it helps with perspective. What do big game hunters, the fossil fuel industry, and Kenneth Copeland have in common?

They all imply by their actions a belief in man's superiority and dominion over the world, especially when it supports their "greater good".

For many, this comes from creationist or fundamentalist religions' teachings that a god created the world and everything in it for man to make use of to honor them and to further the mission of their faith, so the profits they make they must use in exercise of this dominion and contribute to the spread of their gospel, monetarily or through evangelism (see: the family behind [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_Lobby#Controversies][Wahhabi Lobby]]). The impacts today do not matter because all is for god, and the more they make, the more they honor god. They also believe the world will end and everyone who is like them will be eternally rewarded in the measure of their contributions, either in the afterlife or by rapture. It is fairly literally a death cult and the antithesis of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori][memento mori]].

This is only one example, but the slaver mindset is systemic, not individual. It's enabled by the human desire to be a part of an institution and to know where in it you fit. It's also pervasive today, so if you don't recognize it around you, you likely suffer from some memetic immunity to its signs.

You could familiarize yourself with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism][Social Darwinism]] and eugenics, which are foundational to modern anti-democratic ideals, inequality, racism, and genocide. I think EY covers this pretty well in HPMoR as the basis of the Death Eaters' "blood purism" belief, but you can also read about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson][Andrew Jackson's]] ([[https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/content/brenda-wineapple]["The Impeachers"]] covers it well) or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas][Bartolome de las Casas']] writings for a good idea of what genocide looks like first hand and draw your own conclusions on how they reached their views.

I once went to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Estate][Biltmore House]] where I saw walls lined with sketches and portraits of statesmen, philosophers, thinkers, royalty, and other prominent historical figures leading back to antiquity. I thought, "this is a little fanboyish", until I realized that they'd interspersed their own family tree through it, tying them inexorably to greatness. They had always been great, masters of the world and leaders of men, because it was /in their blood/. So many wars, subjugation, death, all because the mad believed in blood magic.

The point is, you're probably more aware of a slaver mindset than you realize if you can model the upper class, royalty, or any sort of ruling class or elites. Being able to dehumanize someone or exepr permanent authority over them because you haven't lived their experiences, think of people in terms of how you value what they contribute to society or how much power they have, or otherwise being able to suspend your empathy to gain advantage over others are indicators, even when they don't recognize what they're doing for what it is. Buying an iPhone or Beyonce product when you know it was made in part with slave labor, contributing to those who do the slaving without care are looser examples of how tolerance enables its existence.

See also moral relativism. Eg- you're not a better person for not understanding power dynamics, as it implies apathy and privilege.
