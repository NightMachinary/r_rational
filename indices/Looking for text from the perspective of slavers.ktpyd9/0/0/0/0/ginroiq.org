  I've had acquaintances literally defend the british empire to me as being a net good for the development of the countries it managed.

I mean I don't think it is likely at all that Australia would become as good a country as it is now without the British empire. Does not mean what they did to the Aboriginals is morally good though; and this is I think the exact issue I feel in the setting I am trying to write. In this world, the semi-slavery of Pok√©mon is a net good for them, but it doesn't change that the same good can be achieved *without* the assumed ownership part, and I can't seem to get into the mindset that these two are not separated: In the British empire example: The empire could have done everything positive they did in Australia without all the heinous things they did to the natives, If you want to go to the extreme, they could have respected land rights and ownership even and still brought technology and population to Australia. What I can't seem to do is get into the mindset of someone who thinks this colonization is a net good AND thinks that treating the natives like anything less than humans is also justified.
