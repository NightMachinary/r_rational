  The empire could have done everything positive they did in Australia

It could have. But would it have? The empire is not a charity. The massive profit that comes from plundering a country and exploiting the natives is the thing that drives the rest of its actions. People tell themselves stories in which they can paint themselves as heroes, but the good effects are side effects - the driving force is the profit motive. Without that, only the truly altruistic act, which is a much smaller group, with no significant funding or backing, where it is an organised group at all. Again, none of this is even very far in the past; indeed, it is still happening in parts of the world right now, and some products on your supermarket shelves are made through arguably unfair exploitation.

(This is also a huge problem with stories set in space that are trying to tell some version of the war of independence: if the expectation is for colonies to rebel, colonisation will slow to a crawl or stop entirely. Who would fund it? There will be no return on the investment. Unless you come up with a way to solve that problem you can't - rationally - tell that story.)
