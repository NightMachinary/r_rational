  The empire could have done everything positive they did in Australia without all the heinous things they did to the natives, If you want to go to the extreme, they could have respected land rights and ownership even and still brought technology and population to Australia.

This seems to be premised on the idea that an institution powered purely by goodwill can exert as much influence on the world as an institution fueled by some form of extraction.

The empire is made up of people with varied and conflicting motivations. The promise of treasure can mostly align them toward some action. The aspiration to do good will move fewer. They need to put food on the table somehow.

An organization that aspires to do good (or do anything, really) needs resources to fuel it. These can come from donations by people who believe in its mission, concessions from people who benefit from its actions, or extraction from people or things it has power over. There is giant area of ambiguity between the second source and the third one.
