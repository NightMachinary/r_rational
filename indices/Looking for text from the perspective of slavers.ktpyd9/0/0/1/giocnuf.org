Are you actively morally opposed to how people treat(ed) work animals? Horses, dogs? Slavery is the same thing, except applied to persons. So your answer is clearly that the slavers need to have a reasonably accurate theory of mind of the enslaved, but one that does not grant them personhood in their view. You want the reader to see the enslaved as persons (otherwise they won't see slavery), but not the characters.

As such you need the enslaved to actually be somewhere at the edge of personhood, or their personhood needs to be subtle / not expressed externally much. I think that was a theme in one of the Ender books? (some race that were actually people but humans didn't realize)
