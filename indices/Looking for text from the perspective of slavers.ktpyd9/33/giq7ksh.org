I'm not familiar with pokemon other than a very vague notion that's perculated through popular culture, so forgive me if this is totally off-base: but it seems that you're assuming that pokemon are conscious, thinking beings. What if that's not true -- or at least, what if the people in your world don't believe that it's true?

From a certain perspective, I treat my computer like crap. I've written some code that compiles, but I think it's a bit dodgy? I'll just run it, and if it crashes, I'll investigate further. I'm not going to waste mental effort in double-checking the code ahead of time to prevent a crash! Want to time some code? I'll run it multiple times to benchmark it, with no regard to whether the computer is "tired" or "hungry" or anything like that. Now, nobody thinks there's an ethical problem with treating computers as slaves / tools.

What about animals? That gets murkier. Some people object to killing animals for food or materials, period. Some people object to killing cute & cuddly animals, but are fine if it's cows or chickens. Some people object to killing animals, unless they're treated "humanely" (be that free-range, grass-fed, sung a song before having their head chopped off, whatever). Some people object to killing land creatures, but fish are fair game. Etc.

At any rate, almost everybody believes that it's ok to treat computers and animals in ways that would be totally unacceptable to treat humans.

So, enter pokemon. In your world, are they considered to be tools like computers? Or animals like fish? Or perhaps more like "cuddly" animals like cats and dogs? If they're considered to be tools, then a whole realm of treatment becomes available without apparent moral qualms.
