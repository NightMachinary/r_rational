Then what you call "precommited" means "will in fact do".

That's fine, but then my original point had been that it's hard to even imagine an architecture by which you could, while being in a state "non-commited" (will or will not do depending on the sum total of benefits at the moment of irrevocable decision making), turn yourself into a state of "precommited" (will in fact do and no thought process can change that).

Even if you could reprogram yourself in a way that "doing that thing" becomes a goal unto itself, it must become a lesser goal than some of the goals you already have.

And if later the circumstances turn into your favor, those bigger goals will outweigh this one and you'll still break commitment.

So in your terms, that must mean you can never actually "precommit". So long as doing something is not your ultimate goal in life, you cannot make yourself into "will IN FACT do", only "intend to do". And intentions change.
