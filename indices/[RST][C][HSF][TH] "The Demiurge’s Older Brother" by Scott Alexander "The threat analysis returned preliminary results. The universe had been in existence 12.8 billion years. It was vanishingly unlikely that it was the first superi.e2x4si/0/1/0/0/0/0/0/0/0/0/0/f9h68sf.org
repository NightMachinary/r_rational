  You mean precommitting_1?

No, precommitting_2.

You said that precommitting might be impossible for humans.

I renamed your "precommitting" to "precommitting_2", so your claim that it might be impossible to precommit for humans became a claim that it might be impossible to precommit_2 for humans.

#+begin_quote
  You won't wish to put anything that threatens your existing goals above those goals.
#+end_quote

That risk is either already calculated with at the moment you're precommitting_1, or you retroactively precommit_1 at the moment of encountering the situation.

Do you have a specific situation in mind?
