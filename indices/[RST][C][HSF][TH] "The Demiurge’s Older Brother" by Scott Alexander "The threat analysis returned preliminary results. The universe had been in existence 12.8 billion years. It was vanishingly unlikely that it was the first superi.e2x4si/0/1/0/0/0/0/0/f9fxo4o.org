Sorry, I should've written "only one box" instead of "one empty box", or else it's not transparent Newcomb's problem (but luckily, that doesn't change the point).

#+begin_quote
  however much you precommit
#+end_quote

Precommitment doesn't come in degrees. It's binary.

If you were to one-box in [[https://arbital.com/p/transparent_newcombs_problem/][transparent Newcomb]] upon seeing box B being full, you are precommitted to one-box.

If you were to two-box in transparent Newcomb upon seeing box B being full, you are precommitted to two-box.
