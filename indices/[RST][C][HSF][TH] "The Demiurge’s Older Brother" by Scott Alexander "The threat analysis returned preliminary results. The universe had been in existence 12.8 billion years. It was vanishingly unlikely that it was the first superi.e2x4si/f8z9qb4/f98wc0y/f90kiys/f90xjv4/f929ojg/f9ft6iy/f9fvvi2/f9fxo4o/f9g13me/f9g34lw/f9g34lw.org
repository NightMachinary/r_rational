  Then what you call "precommitted" means "will in fact do".
#+end_quote

That's what it means (and that's also the meaning of it in the original story).

We could redefine precommitment to mean something else (like concentrating really hard on doing something in the future and wishing that our future self does it).

Let's call this new concept precommitment_2.

The problem is that precommitment_2 doesn't give the same benefits in the same decision-theoretic situations - for example, if you precommit_2 to one-box (but are still the sort of person who would two-box upon seeing the full box B), you will always arrive to see an empty box B, and always win only $1000.

But you'd be right that precommitting_2 (edit: in a reliable, 100% certain way) might be impossible for humans.

  Even if you could reprogram yourself in a way that "doing that thing" becomes a goal unto itself, it must become a lesser goal than some of the goals you already have.
#+end_quote

Why?

#+begin_quote
  So in your terms, that must mean you can never actually "precommit".
#+end_quote

In my terms, if I take only box B upon seeing box B being full, then I was precommitted to one-box. Since it's possible for me to one-box upon seeing box B full, it means, in my terms, that I can actually precommit.
