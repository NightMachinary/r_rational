  It's unclear if you can precommit even for yourself.
#+end_quote

Precommitting for yourself means that you execute certain behavior even though later on it will be unprofitable for you. (Like one-boxing by taking +one empty box+ only one box in transparent Newcomb.)

So even if you wish you wouldn't have to do it, you'll do it anyway.

Executing the action you precommitted to is a deliberate choice, it's not an unbreakable restriction on your behavior invented by your past self that your present self could now betray by "finding a way" to "subvert it".
