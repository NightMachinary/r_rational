  So even if you wish you wouldn't have to do it, you'll do it anyway.

But why would you? Newcomb's problem works because the alien has checked what's going to /in fact/ happen, so if the box has money then everything in your head is going to conspire against all odds to convince you to one-box. It's a sort of an anthropic principle.

But if you really took Newcomb's gamble, and if we discount anthropic improbabilities for a second, then however much you precommit, when you look at the two boxes and you know there's nothing the alien can do now, and you aren't going to play such games ever again, there's no reason not to take both.

Perhaps there's value in being known to honor your commitments. If that value is greater than the value of breaking the commitment then the commitment will hold.
