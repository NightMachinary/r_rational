I mean, the other party has no means of verifying whether you have properly precommited or not. Imagine 9-tsiak completes "negotiations" and breaks the agreement. How would the simulated entity predict that in advance?

--------------

This is unrelated but anyway: It's unclear if you can precommit even for yourself.

Anything you can rewrite in your utility function, you can rewrite again. The only to prevent that is if you add a condition, lesser than your existing conditions, that you act as planned and that you won't rewrite this ever again.

It must be lesser than the existing ones, because there must be some ranging in the utility function.

But then, if that condition truly means giving some concessions from your utility function, that could only have been justified by the uncertainty in your success. Your gain for the higher layers of the utility function and your loss from this new layer are balanced.

As the time passes if you grow more certain in your success, the balance is shifted, the higher layers of the utility function may dominate this one in the function as a whole. While you still can't break it, you will look for ways to subvert it. And now it's the genie problem for those who relies on your concessions. They will probably lose.

Maybe the only way to stick to any commitments is to 1. have uneditable utility function (=> you can't precommit to anything else), and/or 2. always be forced by the circumstances.
