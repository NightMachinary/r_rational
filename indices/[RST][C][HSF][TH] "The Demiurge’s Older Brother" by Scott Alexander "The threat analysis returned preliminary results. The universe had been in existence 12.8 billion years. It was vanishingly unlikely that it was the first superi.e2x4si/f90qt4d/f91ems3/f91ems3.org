  How did they arrive at the premise that "most value systems are not diametrically opposite"?

My guess would be "there are kajillions of possible value systems, but out of those kajillions there's only exactly one that is /diametrically/ opposite to any given other one."

I actually rather like the notion of all these superintelligences trying to figure out what a "consensus value system" for the universe as a whole would be and then acausally agreeing to it. Neat idea.

A bigger problem is something I said in jest in response to another comment; what about the /stupid/ "superintelligences" that aren't clever enough to talk themselves into not running rampant? It's possible to construct von Neumann machines that are basically non-sapient and set them loose on the cosmos. Sure, they wouldn't be able to directly defeat an actual superintelligence like the one depicted here. They'd be a trivial threat, really. But they /would/ break the Fermi paradox solution presented here, since they'd be able to build Dyson swarms and Kardashev III "civilizations" and whatnot that are visible at intergalactic scales beyond the capability of a brand new superintelligence to visually quarantine.
