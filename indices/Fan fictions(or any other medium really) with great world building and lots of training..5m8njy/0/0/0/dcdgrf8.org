  or reasons I do not have the data sets to properly explain, a good chunk of rational fiction and fanfiction seems to have a female protagonist.

I will note that HPMOR originally took some heat for perceived unfeminism. Which did not go unnoticed; at the time I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/30ak1f/more_on_precisely_bound_djinnis/cpqrjkh/?context=3][correctly predicted]] that his next lead would be female (possibly my only correct HPMOR-related prediction). As a data point, I notice in myself an impulse to make a protagonist female just to cover my ass.
