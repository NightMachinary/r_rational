There is actually a name for the style of writing that you're interested in - that of (Chinese?) light novels - or more specifically, wuxia/xianxia. The subreddit for these is [[/r/noveltranslations]]

I've started delving into some of the more popular ones, and their format is essentially

- non-traditionally classed underdog protagonist training (called Cultivating) + injustices aimed at protagonist + protagonist surprising everyone with his power when he fights them. Rinse, repeat.

It's basically Dragon Ball Z in novel form.

Few are as well thought out and varied in their powerups as Mother of Learning. Few (none?) are as well written. In fact, as a genre they're trash writing in a lot of ways: poor sentence structure, excessive use of awkward idiomatic phrases, extreme telling rather than showing approach to writing, inconsistencies in the rules of the world, things happening for the sake of plot all over the place, contrivedness contrivedness contrivedness to the point that what you read doesn't matter since whatever the author randomly wants to be the case next week will somehow happen regardless, somehow retaining flat 1-dimensional characters despite character development and personality growth. That might be the complete list. Some of the flaws are due to poor translations, others to the fact that these are 1000+ chapter works written at breakneck paces.

Despite that, what the genre does really, really well is writing level ups. It's sort of like reading an RPG. And some novels actually avoid most of those flaws. Perhaps the most famous author is IET (I Eat Tomatos) whose most famous work is [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon]]. Coiling Dragon is great - it actually has what I consider a really pretty plot, once you get to the end and can see it. It has a levelup system which is consistent and interesting from the start, but in which levels and possibilities are new and exciting for the reader all the way up to the end. It has plot twists that actually contribute to the story's value as a story. The main character has character. The translation is not bad, though it isn't beautiful language either. If it were edited down and rebalanced by a professional author, it could be up there with some of this community's favorite works. The story had an emotional impact on me, which I didn't see coming during the first 600 chapters.

Particular to your interests, Coiling Dragon has excellent world building. Its settings move from feudal kingdom that looks somewhat feudal Chinese and somewhat European medieval, to the world at the scale of empires spanning a continent many times larger than our planet, to higher celestial realms in which you can just feel the red rocks and crumbling dust and endless empty, barren hilly vistas. The distinct and largely non-interacting places are /so/ distinct and developed they all feel like they're from different stories.

I highly highly recommend it to you. It starts incredibly slowly - I actually skipped to Chapter 8 since the first 7 chapters are World Building a small feudal town in a kingdom in a giant empire and introducing a 5-9 yearold child going about life while interested in martial arts, which wasn't what I was there for. But trust me, it picks up and then never stops accelerating.
