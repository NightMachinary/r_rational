I 100% understand your desire for another MoL. If you find one, PLEASE let me know!

However, it does seem you're confusing Wuxia/Xianxia with Light Novels, which can easily cause you to overlook some really excellent stories, so let me elaborate a little bit:

"Light Novels" refers to Japanese works published in a specific format and length, often with a more casual writing style than "traditional" Novels. They span a wide variety of genres and settings:

- Action-Adventure
- Mystery/Psychological Thriller
- Traditional Sword-and-Sorcery Fantasy
- Historical Fantasy
- Transported/Reincarnated (in)to a Different World
- Slice-of-(Highschool-)Life
- Trapped-in-a-Videogame
- Romance
- Sports
- Supernatural
- etc.

On the other hand, wuxia/xianxia are Chinese works (either published or posted as web serials) and are more like a "genre" of their own, rather than being "the Chinese version of Light Novels". In other words, they're much more similar to one another in terms of plot, setting, tropes, themes, values, and story elements (like "Cultivation" and "Martial Arts") than they are to Light Novels of any genre.

That said, the wuxia/xianxia information is secondhand knowledge, as I haven't read any yet myself (though I've been looking for one with an MC who has values I can mostly relate with, though that seems to be a stumbling block of its own), so take it with a grain of salt.

But if you didn't like wuxia/xianxia, there's no reason you wouldn't like certain types of LNs. Similarly, if you tried an LN in a certain genre, there's no reason you wouldn't like LNs of a different genre, wuxia/xianxia, or just a different LN even within the same genre, since they're so varied.

--------------

If you want to give an LN series an honest try, as a fellow Mother of Learning fan, avid LN reader, and someone who LOVES gradual power-ups and watching characters use them creatively to win, I'd recommend:

[[https://myanimelist.net/manga/67617/Tate_no_Yuusha_no_Nariagari][The Rising of the Shield Hero]] -- Very different from MoL, has numerical stat/level values, definitely not "rational fiction"---for example, a lot characters hold the idiot ball, but that usually ends up being a /disadvantage/ for the MC, which is an interesting twist---but the MC himself is pretty rational and, given his disadvantageous circumstances, has to use his brain and whatever he can get his hands on to survive and succeed, especially when there are powerful idiots around him that won't listen to reason. Overall, super entertaining and I recommend it.

[[https://myanimelist.net/manga/56743/Dungeon_ni_Deai_wo_Motomeru_no_wa_Machigatteiru_Darou_ka][DanMachi]] -- If you don't care as much about the "rational" side of things and just want something more on the classical "Heroic Journey" or "Naruto" end of the power-fantasy spectrum (starting from nothing and succeeding because of hard work, determination, risking your life, wanting to be a hero, and love) that has great incremental power growth and elements of romance, then check this one out.

Hope this was helpful.

Cheers!
