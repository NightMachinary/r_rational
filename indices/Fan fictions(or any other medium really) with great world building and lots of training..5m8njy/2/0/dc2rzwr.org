Yea, I also noticed that the writing in almost all light novels is just bad. That is why I could never get into any LN even though admittedly they contain a lot of the themes I am looking for in a story. I guess I am just looking for another mother of learning. Your suggestion sounds interesting but I will stick to English authors for now.
