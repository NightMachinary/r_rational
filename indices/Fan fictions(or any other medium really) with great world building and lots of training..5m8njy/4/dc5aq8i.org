I know this is incredibly useful as I don't actually remember the name of it, but someone posted a link to a fun quest back in late 2015 on this board about a guy attending an incredibly cut throat magic college. It had some romance, male protagonist and had some good training montages. Year One out of Four was finished but the author didn't want to start year two until at least 2017 to focus on other projects.

I honestly can't remember where it was hosted. It was on a forum where I had to register, the male protagonist was an artist and devolved a unique magical ability based on art and illusion I think? I really enjoyed it and maybe you can help me find it again.
