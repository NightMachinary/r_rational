So just to be clear, OP. I wasn't trying to come down on you in any way for desiring a male protagonist. It's your eyes and brain. Value whatever you like. I was simply asking a question because your post reminded me of another one with that same caveat from months if not years back. I guess my use of the word justify probably did sound judgemental because of how people often use it but I wasn't really commenting ON your desire for one at all. Good luck in your fiction search.

Also, if you haven't already, you can probably read Chunin Exam Day (an incomplete Naruto fanfiction that's now been discontinued) if you like the leveling up sort of plot. It's groundhog day style much like MoL and was quite good for quite a while (I personally think it started to decline in its last third or so)
