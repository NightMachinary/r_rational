You might like Arcane Emperor. Its an original fantasy. MC accidentally teleports himself to a world with status screens and leveling. His main advantage over everyone in this world is he has a special method of training in his sleep. There is romance, which I disliked, but you are asking for.

Downside is that I really wouldn't call it rational fiction.
