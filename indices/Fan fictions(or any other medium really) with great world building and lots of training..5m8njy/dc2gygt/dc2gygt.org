I don't know why people are giving you a hard time for wanting a male lead. I used to have that preference a few years ago, although it went away. Nothing wrong with it.

If you like exciting books with powerful male protagonists, I recommend you read The Name of The Wind and The Dresden Files. If you haven't read Ender's Game, give that and all sequels a try, including the side series. It's more of a children's book, but reading The Hatchet and its sequels also gives me that sense of autonomy. Jack London could also work.

These recommendations all go slightly outside your request, but training montages are hard to find, and Mother of Learning is pretty exceptional in the way it balances action and planning.

Oh, and you should read Twig.

Finally, Forging the Sword is maybe the best Harry Potter fanfiction ever, although it's abandoned.
