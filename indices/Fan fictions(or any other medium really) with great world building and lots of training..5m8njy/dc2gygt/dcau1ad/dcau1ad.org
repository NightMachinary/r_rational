Regarding people being peeved about the male protagonist requirement, I will note that, for reasons I do not have the data sets to properly explain, a good chunk of rational fiction and fanfiction seems to have a female protagonist.

Often, with a male writer.

I hesitate to attach any meaning to this or point any ill-informed "aha, and thus!", but it is an interesting factoid.

Personally speaking, I also prefer male leads, if only because I enjoy strong male leads doing strong male things, so perhaps my own views are biased. I will admit to having skipped a few popular things, such as Worm or Dungeon Keeper Ami, simply because the primary PoV doesn't align with my aesthetic preferences for recreational reading.
