As I recall, we briefly had some Redpill-types on here at one point. Either they shut up or left, but I get the impression that the subreddit doesn't approve and that at least some members might be downvoting out of a suspicion that this is another one and a desire to shut it down before it starts.

(I remember at least one Redpiller who similarly made lots of requests for male protags, explaining that having "rational female characters" just wasn't realistic, and wondered if this was more of the same)
