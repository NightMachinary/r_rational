Heh.

Actually I did it because it was SUPPOSED to refer to the villain of the piece -- I had this scene planned for the case where you succeeded in capturing her, where the lot of you could banter back and forth and she could be prideful and arrogant despite being captured. Sadly, I did not get to that scene, so the title makes no sense. I didn't want the thread to think it referred to them so I changed it.
