SPOILERS

So I binged through this all at once and then I read the thread for the final chapter on [[/r/HPMOR]]...

I really like the feel of this fic, the sense of twistedness of Luna's thoughts, the smooth transition from lucidness to dream state. On the other hand, it did make it hard to keep up with what reality Luna was in. For example, up until I read your comments after reading the last chapter, I still thought that Luna's prime/original reality was a HPMOR AU were Harry and Hermione had been erased from history. I kind of thought that would be a major plot point up until the last few chapters. I also thought the the flashbacks with her mother was just another alternate reality and I underestimated their importance up until the last few chapters. The meta-fictional thing was justified in story, but I felt like it was unsatisfying compared to the story that was starting to be told that I hoped would be told more: Luna, on the brink of death, jumping and shifting from reality to reality discovering new knowledge in hopes of finding something to save her life. That said, Luna hijacking the story from beyond the 4th wall felt a lot better than her dying to try to teach an eldritch magical entity the meaning of friendship (that was what she was trying to do, right?).

  This is where you want to beg me to not do that, because it's at odds with the intention of your story. You want denouement, you want to tie up the dangling plot threads, you want what you would call a fitting ending. But I don't care about your story, and I doubt anyone else does.

  This is my life, and if I have to deny you your twisted satisfaction to save it, I will."

You tell'em Luna. That said, I really do want a continuation fic of slider Luna shifting from reality to reality, searching out advanced magical solutions to her problems, (like tame magic eating breed of Devil's Snare) and having fun exploring (Luna gets to be the sane one when she meet druid-doublewitch Rose Potter),.
