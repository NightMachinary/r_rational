I did the same thing with Significant Digits Harry in Chapter 11. It was my intention to just "show off" a lot of different parallel universes to highlight the similarities and differences of Luna's behaviour in them. Of course, some of those parallel universes did get "resolutions" (see e.g. the various deaths in Chapter 3). Most of them don't form complete story arcs, however, and were never intended to.

For further thoughts on the HPMoR continuation in particular, read scruiser's comment (and my reply) above :)
