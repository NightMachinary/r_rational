Some typos I've found, if you're interested in those:

- You're a first-year like me, *around* you?” → You're a first-year like me, *aren't* you?” (I think)
- For *here*, there weren't many intermediate steps between → For *her*, there weren't many intermediate steps between
- she saw that it was *to* small to be → she saw that it was *too* small to be
- so it couldn't compose *it's* own messages → so it couldn't compose *its* own messages
- All objects not in either of those *category* → All objects not in either of those *categories*
