Yeah... The HPMoR AU part is a bit confusing, given that Luna's basically dreaming it, waking up inside the dream to talk to Harry, going to sleep again, and waking up once again inside the dream to decide to accept Harry's mission (and confuse poor Colin Creevey even further). To be honest, that wasn't even entirely clear to me while I was writing it. Maybe I should add another short scene in which Luna wakes up yet another time, barely remembering a convoluted dream.

Another problem with that scene is that I'd really like to read that HPMoR AU, but I'm not really motivated to write it :) Colin's viewpoint in that one would be especially fun. He's an amateur sleuth trying to uncover a conspiracy while the only actual source on it is right next to him, notoriously unreliable and trolling him without his knowledge.

Worldhopping Luna is another interesting concept for a fic. The main problem with that one is that Luna is explicitly stated in Continuity to not be able to make those lives her own, which raises the question of whether she has enough agency to be an interesting main character. If anyone wants to writes a recursive fanfiction of Continuity, be my guest! I think it would be awesome.

Yep, she was in fact trying to teach Friend the meaning of friendship. She didn't intend to die, given that he would be able to save her. Overall, while not every detail worked out as expected, the end did go according to her plan.

On the meta ending being unsatisfying: I agree, it is. In some ways, the story tries to mitigate this by lampshading it. Luna explicitly denies the author, and by extension his readers, the satisfaction of a real denouement. The main question is whether this dissatisfaction is worth the meta-textual angle the story gains from the ending.

There's another meta thing with the horrid fanfiction clich√© of the author self-insert. Luna is absolutely right when she lambasts me for writing it. I wouldn't change it, though. Somehow, it's very central to my concept of the story.

Thanks for reading, [[/u/scruiser][u/scruiser]], and thanks for posting your thoughts!
