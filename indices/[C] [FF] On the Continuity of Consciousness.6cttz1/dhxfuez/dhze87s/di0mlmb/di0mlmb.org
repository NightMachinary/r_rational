Thanks for the kind words.

About Friend dying (and the 4th wall): You can just believe that Luna was delirious by that point and basically imagined everything. I won't judge :)

About writing more stuff: I'm currently trying to write another weird fanfiction. It might be a good idea for you to subscribe on ao3 if you want to be informed automatically whenever I post something.

About Cultist Simulator: I've tried it, but as far as I could tell there's only an early alpha version? It's promising, so far, but there's not a lot of content there yet.
