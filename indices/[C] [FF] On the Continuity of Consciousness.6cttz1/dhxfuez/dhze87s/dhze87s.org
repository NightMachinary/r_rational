Dear dear author. Words fail to express how much I like you at this moment. There is a rare quality to the story when it is coherent and yet utterly incomprehensible. Like a dream, that contains a meaning which your mind can't grasp. I like this feeling very much, but dreams don't stay long once you wake. Reading a story that induces the same state, but that you can remember for a while is such a pleasure. Especially since your story clicks with me, somehow touching all the right connections in the brain. It just feels so right. Good job!

If I had to nitpick, Friend dieing in the end does not feel right. You can trick them, you can survive them or you can join them, but eldritch things from beyond your dreams are not supposed to die. And a cliche does not become better if a character admits it as such. But that's okay, I can kind of wave away the whole 4th wall thing in my head and pretend it did not happen. I am sorry Luna. You can't stop me.

I am going to try Arithmancer since it's the only thing on your list that I did not read. And then I'll reread your story again. Not going to ask questions now, after a binge it would be a disservice. I should have read slower, but it was hard to stop)

Do you plan to write more stuff? I would read it)

Also have you played Cultist Simulator? I think you would like it. But you probably have already.
