Yeah, reiterating solid agreement for the bulk of the normal curve, and strong strong strong strong strong strong disagreement for kids as little as 3 or 4 sigma out. I've been an educator for the past eighteen years, and have interacted with ~500 or so kids in the 9 - 14 age range, and have encountered 3 < n < 10 whose capabilities in terms of modeling long-term consequences and other people well exceed those of the average adult.

Rare, but not as rare as you think, and I posit that lots of adults have strongly motivated reasoning to declare it rare (e.g. it allows them to dismiss the data provided by children and maintain a status quo in which they're on top, or it allows them to distance themselves from painful past mistakes by saying "but I was such a /child/ back then" when if they were to admit that this is meaningfully predictive/reflective of their current state and abilities they would have to acknowledge failure/shame/inadequacy/whatever).
