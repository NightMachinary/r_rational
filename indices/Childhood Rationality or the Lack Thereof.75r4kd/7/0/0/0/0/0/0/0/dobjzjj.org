Here's where I just get /real/ arrogant.

I am unimpressed by the evidence of other educators (even when it's not secondhand). I made /multiple/ large, ambitious bets with veteran educators when it came to the way that I ran my classrooms and the results I predicted I could draw out of my students, and /every/ one of them turned out in my favor, and /every/ one of them was based on me /not/ believing in the hard limits that you're proposing in your post.

I outperformed other teachers /specifically because/ I didn't buy the hard limits you're proposing in your post. I was a significantly-above-average popular teacher /specifically because/ I threw out assumptions and conclusions that emerge from the kind of thinking you propose.

There's a bit in the foreward to Ender's Game where OSC says that he got /dozens/ of letters from educators complaining that gifted kids just aren't /like/ that, kids just don't think and act like that. But he got /thousands/ of letters from /actual kids/ saying "thank you so much for Ender, I finally see myself accurately portrayed in a character."

You're equating "disagrees with Fenris" with "doesn't understand psychology" or "has wrong ideas about training." And that's just flat-out wrong. I'd pit my pedagogy against yours or your wife's, any day of the week. And I know exactly how arrogant that sounds, and I stand by it, openly, in the light. Sometimes, you gotta be willing to stand up and say "Yeah, I know better in this domain," even if people will look at you askance for it, and this is one of those times.
