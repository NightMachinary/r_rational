Two of those "strongs" were emotional (I'm a strongly diachronic 4-5 sigma kid who has lots of carefully preserved and reasonably accurate memories of being unfairly patronized and condescended to); the other four were epistemic. =)

I'd say out of the n of ~500, there were between 10 and 20 who met the capabilities of an average adult in those (and most) domains. My impression of them was largely "this is a sober kid with a bright future," and only one of them was under the age of 10 at the time.

I've interacted much less with early elementary schoolers, and lean toward default agreement with your points there. I think maybe the crux between us is that you're drawing the line at ~age 15, and I'm drawing it at ~age 11?
