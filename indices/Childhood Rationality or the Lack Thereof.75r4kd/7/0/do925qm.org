General agreement with this person when talking about the bulk of the normal(ish) curve. Absolute disagreement with this person's attempt to draw conclusions about the tail end of the graph, at least for people in the 10-14 age group (I think I agree even about the tail ends for kids who are 7 or 8). There are clear existence proofs in the tweens that undermine the strict/strong version of his claim, though, causing me to uncharitably imagine that this is one of those people who's forgotten what it was like to be eleven.

Also: Piaget is fantastic, but is no longer the be-all-and-end-all on developmental psych.

Edit: reread claim; OP states "freaks of nature" not "impossible and don't exist." Maybe I don't disagree with them at all? But I suspect they'll have systematically less positive impact on eleven year olds, and elicit less growth and awesomeness, than someone who takes a different tack.
