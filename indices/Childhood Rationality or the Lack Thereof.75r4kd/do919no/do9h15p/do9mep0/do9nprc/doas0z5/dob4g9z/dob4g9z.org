  I think we have a miscommunication here, I don't know what that's a response to. Whether parents want their kids to be moral doesn't seem relevant to whether they want their kids to be rationality prodigies.

The hypothesis was: knowing children can be prodigies of various sorts, can children also be prodigies of morality itself? I suggested there's certainly sufficient incentives for it, and apparently child prodigies can be taught rather than purely spontaneous. Given morality provides the incentives for rational decision making, and even if it isn't, parents want it anyway because it means less headaches for them. So, does it happen? My conclusion is, not really. Thoughts?

  I'm not sure acting awards are a good measurement for childhood rationality, or acting careers at all, because of networking issues.

Firstly, there's no other measure of "good acting" for individual actors out there. You could look at ratings, but how could you separate the influence of a child's acting on the overall rating, and you could argue ratings are also tied to networking. So there ain't nothing better to measure, so far as I can tell. Secondly, if a child is a prodigy at dealing with and envisioning people in the way an actor does, at least to an adult level, wouldn't the child be equivalently good as an adult at networking anyway?
