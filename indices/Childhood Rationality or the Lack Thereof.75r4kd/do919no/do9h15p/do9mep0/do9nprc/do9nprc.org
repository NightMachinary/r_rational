I'm sure virtually every parent would like their children to be moral people, but that requires conceiving of other beings as people in their own right, a skill that children do not intuitively possess until they start approaching puberty. And yet the child prince has always seemingly be seen very negatively, historically necessitating regencies until at least mid-teen years. Which the theory I'm posting would expect.

Or, heck, now that I think of it, child actors! Parents put their kids into acting all the time, but has any child actor come close to meeting truly adult levels of acting skill? Acting ought to include some ability to model someone you are not, so it should be applicable. The youngest I can find is Tatum O'Neal winning the Oscar at age 10 in 1974, followed by Anna Paquin at age 11 in 1994, but nobody else at a younger age. The Emmys haven't had a child winner for 26 years, and the youngest Emmy winner was 14 year old Roxana Zal in 1984. Since 11 is about the youngest I'd expect to see some ability to model other people, I'm not terribly surprised by this result, but it's still obviously incredibly rare, and those awards were not for leading roles. I'd expect better acting skills even from amateur adults as from reasonably-practiced pre-teen children. You can argue that the lack of awards is cultural, but I'd only ask you why it's cultural in the first place.
