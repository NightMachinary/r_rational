  Consider the fact that the brain of a child is not physically or chemically identical to the brain of an adult. Should it not follow that the thought structures of a child cannot be the same as those of an adult? Should this not include the capacity for full rationality?
#+end_quote

If child brains are different to adult brains, and only one of the two is truly capable of rationality, then why should that one be the adult brain?

If there are different biological brain structures, some capable of rationality and some not, then how can you tell which side of that divide /your/ brain is on? Perhaps rationality is only possible at very specific serotonin levels, or among people with some-or-other brain syndrome (like Asperger's, or aphantasia).
