Did you know that you can determine the weapons gladiators used based on the density and structural integrity of their bones? Those who used shields experienced repeated blows that the bones of the arm were required to withstand, this causes structural changes in the bone itself. The body physically changes to the experiences it has. There are many adaptions which are like this.

Cognitive adaptions occur as well.

Structural and chemical changes occur in the brain when exposed to outside stimulus on a regular basis. Curiosity, fear, pain, hunger, exercise, forced isolation, forced social interaction, etc etc etc. All of these cause /significant/ alteration in the brain, even /after/ 'full' development.

It's actually possible to detect through brain scans if someone has experienced as little as 24 hours of isolation (reduction in grey matter in the brain).

With such noticeable and even extreme modifications of the brains chemistry and structure even in so called 'fully mature' brains under relatively 'light' stimulus, it's of little wonder that the highly adaptable developing brain under, sometimes severe, stimulus can experience a rather shocking range of expression.
