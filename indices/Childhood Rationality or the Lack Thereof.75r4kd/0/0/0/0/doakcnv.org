My argument (or observation, rather) had nothing to do with maturation or brain structure. Children are cognitively less able, on average, then adults. Up until ages 5-7, there are bright-line differences in things like theory of mind, but after that it's a more generalized lack of development. That doesn't stop them from acting with a level of responsibility that is almost unthinkable to Westerners when placed in situations where they have real autonomy and experience real consequences. This isn't an argument about HOW we should treat children, either...just an observation based on a cultural reality that is somewhat alien to us.
