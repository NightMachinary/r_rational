It's possible there's cultural impacts that may influence maturation, but your argument that the biological structure of the brain has no impact on thoughts or capability is nonsense. If you were correct, then microcephaly, down's, and various other syndromes that alter the structure of the brain wouldn't matter or impact the ability of a human being to do stuff, would they?
