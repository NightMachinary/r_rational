I agree with this, and also say that the Western notion of treating children as incapable is cultural and not biological. Check out The World Until Yesterday by Jared Diamond for some cultural counterexamples. Basically, when children are treated like adults, they act like adults, with some exceptions for, for example, their diminished strength. In cultures like the Piraha, it would be strange for an adult to tell a child what to do or what not to do.
