Childrens minds develop as they age and gain experience, certainly, but suggesting they cannot be rational is ignoring omnipresent counter-examples.

Children can play games. they can understand risk/reward, execute strategies based on logical conclusions stemming from observation of their environment and the rules at play.

There are child chess and Go masters. There are child math whizzes, and other prodigies. these all imply they can think and act logically, make long term plans, etc.

There are also children who have adapted to very harsh environments and can be quite adept at navigating real life dangers. Children in warzones, in impoverished and crime ridden areas, or subject to trauma show a larger capacity for social manipulation, and ruthless survival strategies.

On the flip side, children can absolutely show altruism, kindness, and ethical thinking when exposed to models and examples that encourage it. Your suggesting that these only form in later teen years is strange to me.

To say children can't be "rational" puts rationality on some mysterious and ill defined pedestal. You seem to think rationality is some magical state of perfect reasoning. But as you mention in criticisms of Piaget, mental development - and rational behavior - should be seen as a spectrum, in fact a many faceted spectrum. People may be quite rational in some behaviors and not at all in others.

With this model in mind, children can certainly exhibit a range rational behavior across that spectrum.
