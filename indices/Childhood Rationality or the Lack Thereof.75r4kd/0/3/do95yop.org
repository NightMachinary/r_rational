In my mind, rationality is basically the ability to take solutions learned in a specific context and generalize them into useful principles that accelerate one's learning in other contexts. The more you can do this---and the less /evidence/ you need to do this /successfully/---the more rational you are.

Your examples of things that children do are the same things you'd expect any regular neural network of today to do: to get good at recognizing patterns and making predictions on the specific dataset they're trained on.

But /adult/ human beings can, uniquely, do something we can't yet make AI do: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing]["general game-playing"]] --- the ability to use experiences of playing one "game" to get better at entirely unrelated "games." For example, the ability to practice Go, and not just become a better Go player, but a person who then starts off with an advantage (compared to a person who hadn't played Go) the first time they play chess or Dominion or Starcraft. Or, to further generalize, to deduce elements of actual military strategy from playing Go (or vice-versa.)

Children will do this on one level---a 6-year-old who plays a Mario game will probably be better at playing a Sonic game. But that is because those games actually share some base-level mechanics. If the parallel is purely conceptual---for example, going from /Street Fighter/ to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Puzzle_Fighter_II_Turbo][Puzzle Fighter]] to [[http://sirlingames.com/puzzlestrike/][Puzzle Strike]]---then it's unlikely children will have any transfer learning to apply, since they weren't spending their time playing the former working out any general high-level principles that would apply to the latter. Only adults (are proven to) do that.
