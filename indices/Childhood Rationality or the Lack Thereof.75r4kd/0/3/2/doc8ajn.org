  But adult human beings can, uniquely, do something we can't yet make AI do: "general game-playing" --- the ability to use experiences of playing one "game" to get better at entirely unrelated "games." For example, the ability to practice Go, and not just become a better Go player, but a person who then starts off with an advantage (compared to a person who hadn't played Go) the first time they play chess or Dominion or Starcraft. Or, to further generalize, to deduce elements of actual military strategy from playing Go (or vice-versa.)

Go was solved with minmax trees; if you cut through the hyped shit they had that perfect algorithm at the center with the neural nets merely acting as glue.

I would like to see the neural nets win vs a tool assisted human. Using (very very very large number of)humans as glue for the same minmax tree set up

So in anyway no, we kinda have had general game playing ai and have had it for decades, it just doesn't scale
