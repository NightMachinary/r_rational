HPMOR is the classic example and is 100% explained by the plot.

Not that familliar with Pokemon OoS, only read a couple chapters.

Ender's game I think could be a reasonable criticism, he's received plenty of flack around whether ender/bean could be realistic over the years. Bean in particular I think is beyond what even breeding programs and genetic manipulation can do. His backstory growing up in the streets and leading child gangs is way over the top.

I have a response to the OP and several other comments here that takes a different approach that I think I will simply make a new thread from the OP for. more to come shortly.
