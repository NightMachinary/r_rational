  a brain is not infinitely complex
#+end_quote

Some people with missing parts of brain manage to think rationally, yet kids can't? That's quite a big assumption. Also I would expect the part of brain that does rationality to be quite small. If our experiences with AI are anything to go by - image recognition takes much more computational power than logical inference.

  The list of child prodigies you mentioned would be good counter-proof of my assertion, but I don't see any child prodigy politicians or counsellors or programmers before their mid-teen years.

I don't see why it should be impossible to learn programming before mid-teens, I was no prodigy, yet I understood variables, ifs, fors and gotos when I was 8 well enough to make very simple text games on C64 (guess a number kind of thing with "ascii" graphic and beeping). I still remember the frustration because either manual had some error in the sample code to initialize graphic, or my C64 was faulty or in different version than the manual - I never managed to make the code to draw sprites work.
