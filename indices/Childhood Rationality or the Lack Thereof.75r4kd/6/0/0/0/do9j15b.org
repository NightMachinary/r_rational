Huh, there you go. One child prodigy programmer. Though, just because he passed a test for Microsoft certification, doesn't mean he designs programs over a period of weeks, months, or years. The article and others say he wants to program a game, but I can't find any long-term project he's actually completed on his own yet. Doesn't mean there aren't any, but I can't find any. Still, that's a pretty compelling potential counter-example.
