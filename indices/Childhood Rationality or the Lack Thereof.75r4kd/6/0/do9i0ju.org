Though sufficiently complex neural networks can compute the same function, a brain is not infinitely complex, so to suggest a child's brain can compute the same functions as an adult's is to suggest that the necessary complexity is possible within a child's brain's level of complexity. If so, then we would see some children exhibit the qualities of an adult in terms of what I mentioned: long-term consequence planning and modelling other people.

The list of child prodigies you mentioned would be good counter-proof of my assertion, but I don't see any child prodigy politicians or counsellors or programmers before their mid-teen years. And by that time, I'd expect some children to have achieved fully adult-level organizational and leadership skills. But not really before then.
