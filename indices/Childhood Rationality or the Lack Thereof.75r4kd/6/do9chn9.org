  Should it not follow that the thought structures of a child cannot be the same as those of an adult?

No, why? You can have radically different neural networks computing the same function, if they are complex enough.

It might be improbable, but "cannot" is too strong a word, unless you show a proof. Also - if you accept the possibility of general AI, then assumption that kids can't be rational seems very strange. If Turing Machine can do it- so can kids.

  For example, according to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, children from the age of 7 to 11, roughly speaking, will be growing increasingly capable of limited inductive logic and reasoning

  My point is that children are NOT capable of such thinking due to biological limitations of the brain's development, not simple lack of trying or training. For a child below a certain age to use true rationality is for the child to quite literally have the brain of an adult, and thus to be a genetic, biological aberration.

These "laws" are just averages based on observation, they are descriptive not prescriptive, and there are exceptions in real life ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_child_prodigies]] ).
