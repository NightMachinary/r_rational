Actually, I like your word replacement and it brings up a good point. An alien Zorblaxian should NOT think like an adult human, and we should NOT see the Zorblaxian reason about things in the same way a human would, and the decisions a rational Zorblaxian would make should NOT be exactly the same as a rational human. Maybe the Zorblaxian is also poor at modelling other people's thoughts as different from it's own, but maybe the Zorblaxian can intuitively grasp very large numbers in a way a human cannot. Maybe a natural disaster that kills 100,000 Zorblaxians isn't just a statistic, but as intimate as seeing a Zorblaxian's mate die. A real alien should NOT be represented as a human in a rubber mask.

And maybe male and female humans really do think differently. Who knows?!?

But my point is about children, and my post is complaining about presenting "rational children" as "rational adults in a child's body" that seems quite common in so-called rational fiction. A child should NOT be capable of the kinds of long-term planning that an adult can consider and should NOT be capable of intuitively understanding that other people are actually complete persons with their own modes of thought and beliefs. That's what I'm talking about, and that's what you haven't addressed.
