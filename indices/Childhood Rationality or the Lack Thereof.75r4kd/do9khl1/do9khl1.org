Others have written in more detail (and my reading of this thread's contents has not been thorough), but I would like to poke the phrase 'Should this not include the capacity for full rationality(?)'.

...Ah, I thought of a fun way to portray my stance! Word replacement:

"Consider the fact that the brain of a Zorblaxian (alien) is not physically or chemically identical to the brain of a human. Should it not follow that the thought structures of a Zorblaxian cannot be the same as those of a human? Should this not include the capacity for full rationality?"

One could do a similar male/female (/female/male) word replacement.

My thoughts on this:

Let it be assumed that there is a biological requirement for what can be referred to as rationality. As a basis for this, consider a rock without a brain, a jellyfish, an ant, a digger wasp that moves a spider to its previous position time and time again without adaptation.

Given how adult humans have to jump through hoops such as statistical tests, double-blind studies and other means to try to get past issues such as confirmation bias and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies][oh-so-many-fallacies]] that humans are prone to, it's doubtful that we meet the requirements for an imagined 'full rationality', with or without our largely ad-hoc systems for defending ourselves from commiting irrational behaviour.

If there is to be any hope of achieving a state of 'full rationality', it either depends on modifying our brains to behave according to a specific behaviour pattern, or 'full rationality' being defined in such a way that very different brains, with very different quirks and handicaps, can (with biological capabilities over a certain low threshold) self-analyse and reach the same equivalent position termed 'full rationality'.

Or, to summarise this (spoken by an imagined person): "HAH-HAH-HAH! White male human adults, you think there's a 'peak' and a 'non-peak' for rational behaviour, and coincidentally YOU'RE at the top of the entire universe and I'm not?"
