What do you mean by modeling other people? Can you give examples? It seems like children should know that other people don't believe the same things, just because they're likely to be disagreed with rather often. On the other hand, I had this annoying tendency to come up with complicated activities I wanted to do without telling the people I was trying to draft into participating, or explaining anything at all, then throw a fit when it immediately collapsed. It seems like I /could/ model other people, but never actually bothered to do so unless I was beat over the head with why that was a problem in a specific case. (Like, I /vastly/ underestimated how much getting punched hurts... but is trying to avoid punching people /after/ learning that just mind-projection?)

Egocentrism was /so much/ worse, yes. What changed that was a combination of being put in circumstances that pushed me to reflect on how I'd changed from 2-12, and failing enough to finally drill in some humility. This does /not/ mean I was incapable of altruism beforehand. I don't mean performing altruism to receive some kinda reward--unless you use a very broad definition of reward that includes satisfying altruistic impulses--I mean random acts of kindness, or trying to help strangers who seemed in need of help. ... I'm still kiiinda likely to get upset about that one time my parents yelled at me until I backed away from helping the younger child stuck in a hard-to-climb-out-of space on the grounds that she wasn't my sister (no seriously wtf?).

Heck, I once had a 10-year-old try to realtalk me (21) about whether or not I thought about the feelings of someone else who I might have made a disparaging remark or 3 about. No one else was in earshot and I'm not sure I've heard him sound as serious since (now 18).

I question whether ability is what's lacking, rather than intrensic motivation to use/train it. Ability to accurately model other people and make short/medium-term plans (as in, up to a week) seem /extremely/ important to survival prior to modernity. People can get away with being terrible at these much more often, nowadays. So how do we distinguish "short-sighted jerk because sheltered and inexperienced" from "short-sighted jerk because biology"? Has someone studied these particular attributes among hunter-gatherers? Serious question.

I acknowledge that puberty /does/ screw with one's head in ways which affect one's approach to dealing with others. It makes sense that there would be a change when the biological goal changes. You seem to be claiming that both puberty and a cutoff closer to age 15 are hugely important to these specific skills. What about all the people who complete puberty before 14-15? If it's age more than hormones, then are these two separate aspects, and how are they divided?
