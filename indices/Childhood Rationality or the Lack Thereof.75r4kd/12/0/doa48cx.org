An example is the False-Belief Task. I'm sure you know how infants lack object permanence. Hide something from view, and to the infant it ceases to exist. Ask a young child to describe how a structure looks from another person's point of view, and they'll describe it from their own point of view. Ask an older child what another person would like to happen, and they'll answer what they themselves would like to happen. Ask a teenager how someone else could believe something that to them is wrong, and they'll have trouble answering seriously. That's the progression underlying the false-belief task. It's not until adulthood that people can honestly apply the "platinum rule" of "do unto others as they would have done to themselves" instead of the "golden rule" of "do unto others as you'd have done to yourself". How easily does a teenager declare someone with contrary beliefs to be bad or stupid instead of simply having a different belief structure that's totally valid for themselves? /That's/ the difficulty of modelling someone else.

Anyway, behaviors can be learned based on reward/punishment and carried over outside of reward/punishment situations, and certainly a 10-year-old can parrot a model for critical thinking that s/he was taught in a group setting, for example. In fact, I'm all for giving kids all the methods they can handle in order to maximize their capacity for long-term thought and imagining other points of view, but it's got to be realistic and fit the needs and capabilities of the end-user (children at a certain stage of development).

Kids are super-curious about how the world works. They ought to be highly motivated to learn how other people think and to plan events with far-reaching consequences. In fact, given how weak they are physically, children may be extra-incentivized to protect themselves through careful consideration of consequences and other people. Especially kids in abusive or dangerous environments, because we don't wanna be unethical and run actual lab experiments to mess kids up. Do we see better consequence-management in such environments? Do we see better people-modelling?

I don't recall mentioning puberty, actually, but the expected completion of mental maturation at 15-20 or thereabouts (it's not fixed for everybody) seems to have been shown experimentally by Piaget and others. And as you might recognize in your daily life, not all adults really seem to have that mature a framework for decision-making. Current events and politics ought to show that plenty of voting-age adults are not particularly capable of understanding different points of view or considering long-term consequences. So, I'd say 15 or so at the earliest, probably 20 or so for many or most, and maybe never for the remainder.
