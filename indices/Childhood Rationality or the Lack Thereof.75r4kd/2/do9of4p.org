OK, so I'm going to take this in a different direction.

Most of the criticisms in the OP and comments I've seen basically argue that children aren't as smart as adults, but this isn't what rationality is really about, and I'm finding the claims made to be thinly supported.

The portion of rationality that I think children are actually very bad at-- and the thing that actually got the whole rationality culture started on Less Wrong -- has to do with /believing things that are true/ and /susceptibility to bias./

As I argued in my first comment, I think children, especially prodigies, are perfectly capable of making logical decisions when presented with clear risk/reward conditions. They are also equally capable of empathy, altruism, and ruthlessness.

I think where children are much more vulnerable than adults to failing to achieve optimal results is in their ability to discern what is true from what is not.

Children are vulnerable in two ways. First, they are impressionable. Early development is about rapidly absorbing information from your environment, and this includes lots of worldviews and information that is false. Children are far more likely to internalize and believe untrue things than adults, because they lack context against which to judge their merit, and by default are trusting of new information.

The second way children are vulnerable to untruth is from internal bias. Learning to recognize and combat bias is a difficult skill to learn, and comes only with practice. Children are more prone to be driven by emotion and impulse, to trust in baseless intuition, to suffer from unrealistic sense of self and ego. They are very unlikely to have received the training necessary to combat innate human biases, and may even be MORE vulnerable to them if they are smart.

These two vulnerabilities are something that writers of rational fiction should be taking into account. I believe HPMOR actually does this to a degree -- harry fools himself quite a bit, is prone to emotional outbursts, ego, and sentimentality. The merit of the narrative actually lies in the conflict between his rational training and worldview and his childish nature.

Keeping these weaknesses and vulnerabilities in mind will help to build more compelling and interesting child characters, even if they are prodigies in other ways.
