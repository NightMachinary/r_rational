I didn't say children weren't smart, I said that they shouldn't be able to handle deductions, hypotheticals, and interpersonal skills in the way they're portrayed in a number of rationalfics. Elsewhere in the thread, I agreed that child prodigies exist, I only argued that those prodigies are exceedingly rare or nonexistent in areas that require consideration of long-term consequences and/or proficiency in false-belief tasks.

I'm not so sure children are less able than adults at identifying the truth, for certain kinds of truth. When working with real-world things, children ought to be nearly as good as adults. It's where we get into hypotheticals or generalized truths that children can be tripped up. Or, as you noted, children are much more impressionable by peer pressure than adults, particularly tweens and teens, and may very well define truth as group consensus or through appeal to authority rather than objective reality.

Regarding intuition, it's sometimes more valuable than you might think, even in children. Piaget's research into children's conceptualization of geometry, for example, demonstrates that infants have an innate ability to conceive of topology (orientation without respect to shape), despite topology being something not mathematically formalized until the 18th and 19th century. The development of early concepts of space (inside vs. outside vs. on, left vs. right vs. middle) is perhaps one of the underpinnings of all human logic.
