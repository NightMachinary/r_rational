Define "rational".

My understanding is that "rationality" is simply a mode of thought, it is correlated with intelligence and knowledge yes, but you don't really need much of either to be think rationally.

I mean, to give a silly example: consider the game world of tic-tac-toe. There is a rational way to play the game so that you never ever lose, and it doesn't take very long for even average young children to figure it out and then play rationally. And if they can play rationally, then obviously they can also think rationally.

  as if rationality is something everyone is equally capable of regardless of brain development or other biological functions.

I wouldn't say that, since obviously no brain or dead body = no rationality. But you really only need a small amount to think rationally. After that it just becomes a matter of scale. The more you know, the more contexts you can apply your rationality to. The more intelligent you are, the more complex you can make rational plans in your head. The more experienced you are, the more heuristics and shortcuts you can take to make those plans faster.

Now, age is indeed a limiting factor on these, but you can always specialize. For instance, I wouldn't expect any child to be a super lawyer + politician + painter + architect + physicist + chemist + mathematician + pianist + guitarist + ... all at the same time, that's way too much information needed to cram into under a decade. But for just one of them? It seems possible enough if you sacrifice a bunch of other stuff. Read them physics books to bed instead of fairy tales. Give them only a piano for entertainment, no TV. Hell, take away all their other distractions like friends and loved ones and any happiness whatsoever. Drop them out of school to focus solely on one field even if it leaves them completely uneducated in every other area.

You would probably count as a horrible guardian for doing so, but it sounds doable enough.
