  The hypothesis was: knowing children can be prodigies of various sorts, can children also be prodigies of morality itself?
#+end_quote

It was? I thought we were discussing whether they could be prodigies of rationality, not morality?

#+begin_quote
  Given morality provides the incentives for rational decision making
#+end_quote

Erm... not... really? Rationality isn't really dependent on good and evil. You can totally have evil rationalists too.

  parents want it anyway because it means less headaches for them.
#+end_quote

This actually implies that parents would specifically want their kids to be bad rationalists: One of the hallmarks of rationality is to keep questioning everything. If parents don't want headaches, they will teach their kids to be obedient instead of constantly questioning their parental guidance.

  Firstly, there's no other measure of "good acting" for individual actors out there.
#+end_quote

Well yes, hence I'm not sure looking at any kind of acting measure is a good measure for rationality in children.

#+begin_quote
  Secondly, if a child is a prodigy at dealing with and envisioning people in the way an actor does, at least to an adult level, wouldn't the child be equivalently good as an adult at networking anyway?
#+end_quote

To clarify, I'm not saying that they would have inferior networking skills, I'm saying that networking takes time whether you're skilled or not. I mean, if you're a movie maker, you aren't going to suddenly hand your leading roles to some random stranger you met yesterday and risk making the movie a flop. You really want to hire someone you can trust, someone with a *long history* of being trustworthy. See the problem there? *Long history required*. Children, by definition, do not have long histories. Their histories are less than 10 years long no matter how awesome they are.
