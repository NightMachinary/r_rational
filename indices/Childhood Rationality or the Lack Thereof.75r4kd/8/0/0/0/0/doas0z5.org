  I'm sure virtually every parent would like their children to be moral people, but that requires conceiving of other beings as people in their own right, a skill that children do not intuitively possess until they start approaching puberty. And yet the child prince has always seemingly be seen very negatively, historically necessitating regencies until at least mid-teen years. Which the theory I'm posting would expect.

Hmm? I think we have a miscommunication here, I don't know what that's a response to. Whether parents want their kids to be moral doesn't seem relevant to whether they want their kids to be rationality prodigies.

  Or, heck, now that I think of it, child actors! Parents put their kids into acting all the time, but has any child actor come close to meeting truly adult levels of acting skill? Acting ought to include some ability to model someone you are not, so it should be applicable. The youngest I can find is Tatum O'Neal winning the Oscar at age 10 in 1974, followed by Anna Paquin at age 11 in 1994, but nobody else at a younger age.

I'm not sure acting awards are a good measurement for childhood rationality, or acting careers at all, because of networking issues. Unlike chess, where a genius child can just single-handedly trounce all the competitors to reach the top, acting is not a one-man show (well some is, but those don't get Emmys). To be in a movie that can win an Emmy, you typically need to find co-actors, directors, producers, marketers, scriptwriters, cameramen, etc. etc., which means you need lots of people connections. Being a child is a massive disadvantage here, no matter how rational you are, because people connections take time to form, and children by definition have less than 10 years to form that network.
