  I've heard of chess masters who raise their children to be chess "prodigies", to the point of removing all other leisure or extracurricular options, and it works. Same with music, art, science, math, etc. Yes, it's cruel as a parent. But, the thing is, none of these really depend on the ability to conceive of long-term consequences or modelling other people. Are there any child prodigies in leadership, politics, psychology, counselling? None before their mid-teen years, as far as I can tell.

I suspect that this is more a problem of sociology than of biology. Morally defunct parents wanting their kids to be chess/math/science/<insert career here> prodigies are everywhere, since being a career prodigy rakes in fame and money. But parents wanting their kids to be rationality prodigies? That would be a really really tiny amount.

I mean, can you imagine a parent putting a small kid through anti-conformity training? That's basically forcing your kid to endure public humiliation over and over and over. Or a parent teaching their kids about the Stanford prison experiment and all of humanity's darkest depravities? Ethics aside, there's barely any incentive for the parent to do so. Rational kids are slightly more likely to become rich and famous, but their odds would have been better if they were trained for a particular career instead. Not to mention, abusing a child into becoming rational is highly likely to result in said rational child calling child protection services to lock you away. So if you were a rational parent (which is kinda necessary if you want to teach your kid rationality), you would almost certainly rationally choose not to do this.
