In my post, I implicitly defined rationality as including (but not limited to) the ability to create and execute long-term plans by conceiving of long-term consequences, and also the ability to model other people as having their own perspectives, thought patterns, and beliefs that may differ from one's own.

I've heard of chess masters who raise their children to be chess "prodigies", to the point of removing all other leisure or extracurricular options, and it works. Same with music, art, science, math, etc. Yes, it's cruel as a parent. But, the thing is, none of these really depend on the ability to conceive of long-term consequences or modelling other people. Are there any child prodigies in leadership, politics, psychology, counselling? None before their mid-teen years, as far as I can tell.

Because of this, I can't abide the sort of rational child actors we see in lots of rational fiction. A child can be rational in the sense that they seek rewards and avoid harm, duh, but beyond a certain horizon that rationality breaks down.
