Sure, minds develop with experience and age, but I'm saying that part of that development is biological. It's not all nurture. The aspects of rationality I mentioned specifically include: the ability to develop and execute long-term planning, and the ability to conceive of other people as having different beliefs and thoughts.

As for your examples of long-term planning, you mentioned chess, go, and math. None of these examples are long-term. Unless you consider 1 day to be long-term? I was more operating on the idea of long-term planning such as "if I smoke this crackpipe, it will be fun, and I probably won't see major negative side effects within a couple weeks at the earliest, but in a matter of months or years this could be very bad", and this conceptualization of consequences is lacking in the vast majority of children and most adolescents. This lack of future-oriented thinking is why we care so much about keeping even legal addictive substances out of schools or away from minors. Unless you argue that there's no reason to stop children from smoking and drinking?

Showing altruism and kindness is not the same as feeling altruism or kindness. Children are mostly motivated by reward-seeking and punishment-avoidance or peer pressure: if I do this, I'll get a cookie; if I do that, I'll get yelled at; if I do this, they'll like me; if I do that, they'll shun me. Since we reward acting kind and altruistic, naturally children will act kind and altruistic, but only if the consequences happen in the near-term: if they don't get punished until a couple hours later, they won't intuitively connect the dots or correct the behavior. Why do you think children of religious parents almost always go to the same church and subscribe to the same moral code as their parents, until they start thinking for themselves as adolescents?

Adaptation to harsh environments, playing games and understanding risk/reward (for certain types of simple probabilities) are not being questioned by my post. I don't contest that children seek rewards, avoid harm, and are highly adaptable. Furthermore, I admit that children, with the use or help of various models, can push beyond their natural capabilities. For example, though a child has trouble making deductions in their head, working a problem out on paper or with objects gives them a chance. But it's not natural or intuitive for children. So, certainly, children are rational in a sense. But they aren't as rational as adults because they can't look far beyond the present and they can't see the world through another's eyes.
