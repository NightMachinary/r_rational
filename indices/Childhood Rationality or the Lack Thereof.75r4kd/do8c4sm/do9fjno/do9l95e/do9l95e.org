  The aspects of rationality I mentioned specifically include: the ability to develop and execute long-term planning, and the ability to conceive of other people as having different beliefs and thoughts.

I have first hand experience with children doing both of these things.

there are developmental limitations to children, they do get smarter and better at planning over time. but it's not a black and white "they cannot plan or conceive of contrary beliefs."

If there are specific examples of children in literature acting in ways you find problematic, maybe you should cite those instead of making general statements. It would help in addressing specific concerns.
