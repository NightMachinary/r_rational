I don't like the term "problematic" because it's associated with political correctness jargon, but anyway:

- Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Harry's rationality is sort-of explainable)

- Pokemon: the Origin of Species

- maybe Mother of Learning, though the protagonist is 15 and therefore within the bounds

- likewise Worm's teenage protagonist, kinda-sorta-maybe

- maybe Twig, but the children are explained to be freaks of bio-engineering

- The Moon's Apprentice, a MLP rationalfic

- pretty much any Homestuck rationalfic

- Ender's Game

Stuff like that.
