  To say children can't be "rational" puts rationality on some mysterious and ill defined pedestal. You seem to think rationality is some magical state of perfect reasoning.

Well, yeah. "Rationality" is a two-place word. It can mean, "reasoning according to a fixed principle that creates correspondences with reality (or at least the local sensory statistics of reality)" (by which standard ANNs and human brain machinery are "rational"), but it can also mean, "reasoning according to prescribed, normative standards that are believed, if not guaranteed, to lead to hitting the ground truth rather than merely to useful models" (by which standard, the entirety of a great many intellectual fields are spent on being /rational/, since we do not at all do it by default).
