That's an excellent way of putting it.

I'd also just say that acting like an adult is not the same as acting rational, and either is not the same is being well-adapted or intelligent. Individual minds are highly variable. Some children may be easily capable of taking on adult responsibility, which honestly in most cases does not even require incredible intelligence or worldliness. Conversely, many adults can never take on what we would call adult responsibility. On average, adults are more likely (probably much more likely) to be able to take on what we call adult responsibility. But that doesn't really say anything about individual minds and individual circumstances, except probabilistically.

So in short I think that treating children as adults, especially in environments that are more closely connected to our ancestral environment, makes sense in context. ANd I stand by my contention that many of our expectations of children are culturally determined. Note, for example, that in the modern US children are generally not allowed to roam freely until approximately 13, and in fact parents that don't agree with this are frequently brought up on child endangerment charges. Only 20 years ago, the age would have been considerably lower, and in the mid-20th century it would not be uncommon for children no older than infants to roam freely in cities and the countryside. Have children changed? No. But our culture has. And there are cultures that treat children as even more independent agents than the America of the mid-20th century.

In general, individuals conform to cultural expectations and cultural limitations. They can become extremely capable or extremely incapable. In Western society, children are considered exteremly incapable, and so they are. Except in those cases when they have to be.
