How on Earth can a six year old possibly work from the experiential lifetime accumulated dataset of an adult? They simply haven't got the scope for it anymore than a 40 year old has the scope to understand the dataset of an 80 year old.

It's not a negative on the six year old that they are working inside a limited dataset. It's just that a twelve year old has literally twice the life experience and their time frames are larger. And an eighteen years old's time frames are larger still, and on and on.
