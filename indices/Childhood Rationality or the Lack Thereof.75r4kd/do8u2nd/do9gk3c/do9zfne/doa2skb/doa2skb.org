Experience is nice, but insufficient. A 40 year old adult whose acquaintances pressure him to smoke his first crackpipe will respond differently than a 12 year old tween whose acquaintances pressure him to smoke his first crackpipe. Both people are inundated with messages that warn about the danger of crack, and arguably the teenager will have much more recent exposure to modern anti-drug information (or propaganda, doesn't matter), and neither are likely to have personal experiences relating to crack before that moment, but the kid will nonetheless be more likely to accept than the adult. Why? Because the kid has less-developed capacity for consequence conceptualization.
