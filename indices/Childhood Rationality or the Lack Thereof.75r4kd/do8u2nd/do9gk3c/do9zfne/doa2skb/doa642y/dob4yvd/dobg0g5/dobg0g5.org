I'm saying given the defining variable of time spent alive, certain predictable changes to human sense of timescale occur. If you want to introduce all the other variables inherent in life you can, but you cannot leave /out/ the variable of experienced, accumulated time on our decision making process. Nothing but time spent alive causes those particular changes, although you can modify planning and decision making process is using specific training which requires excercising those skills.

Let me put it to you this way: is a sample set of 4 as accurate as a sample set of 40? Or is it more likely to be skewed in some fashion?

Have you got the exact same sense of urgency about everything in your life that you did at age 6? Or do you feel better able to cope with situations you've got a lot of experience with, like tying your shoes?

Children have limited datasets. Nothing but experience at this time expands their dataset. This is one big big reason why adults do not get to have sex with children, or sign legal contracts with children, or any other thing involving long-term consequences. All other factors being equal - children, no matter how bright, are temporally handicapped compared to adults. Even brilliant children in real life are taken advantage of and hurt by stupid adults. Do not underestimate this particular variable.
