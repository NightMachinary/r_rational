Brain chemistry is measurable. Brain structure can be mapped. One's experiences are not knowable just by looking at a brain, at least at present.

We know by just looking at the brains of children vs. adults that they're not the same, and based on neuroscientific study we can associated changed in the brain with certain modes of thought. We don't know without asking what a child or adult has experienced and how that experience feeds their current decision-making.
