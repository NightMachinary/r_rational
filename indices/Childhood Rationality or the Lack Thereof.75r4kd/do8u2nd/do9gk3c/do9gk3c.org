My argument is that the smaller-scale in time and scope is exactly the point, but that it has more to do with brain chemistry and structure rather than data-set of experiences.

Another poster mentioned children who survive a warzone. Sure, fine. I don't know off the top of my head if children survive warzones at the same rate as adults, but suppose they do. Did you know that many modern child soldiers go willingly stay with the same army that kidnapped and press-ganged them, even to the point of re-enlisting after being officially released from service by their superiors? Even knowing the horrors of war? Why would you suppose that is? I'd say that the child soldier isn't really capable of understanding the harm that they're causing /or the harm they're suffering/ and how it impacts their long-term prospects or creates long-term consequences. Even an average civilian adult would have better decision-making than the experienced child-soldier.
