  ... intelligence seems to be a proxy for general health...

I don't know about that. I feel like intelligence has more to do with early childhood enrichment, like how much time your parents were able to devote to teaching you. It's like, correlation =/= causation, a confounding factor, right? Like parents who have the ability to devote the sheer time necessary to raising an intelligent child tend to be more financially stable, which would mean on average the ability to always provide consistent food and healthcare, so the healthier kids aren't smarter because they're healthier, but because the health and the intelligence are both a result of easier access to resources. I know /my/ parents weren't quote unquote "financially stable" but I ended up being intelligent because my mother decided she'd devote the necessary time to make me intelligent come hell or high water. She read to me for /hours/ every night for the first few years of my life, and I feel like that's what made me who I am.
