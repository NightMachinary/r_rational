wow necro.

the problem is it's typically taken by high schoolers with a specific set of knowledge and level of education. so it's a good measure of IQ for that level of education, but not outside it.

if you are talking about children who may not have been exposed to algebra, trig, various vocabulary, etc the test is not a good measure of brute intelligence.
