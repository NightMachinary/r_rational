Is there really an intelligence requirement for using rationality? It's not like it's some kind of magical technique only those with +enough chakra+ high enough intelligence can use. It's a set of rules and guidelines that very smart people might find easier to implement, but that in theory anyone can learn and use. It's also possible to have great cognitive abilities and general intelligence, without overcoming any of those fundamental biases which get in the way of rationality. Unless there's something supporting the idea that rationality is restricted to high-IQ people...?
