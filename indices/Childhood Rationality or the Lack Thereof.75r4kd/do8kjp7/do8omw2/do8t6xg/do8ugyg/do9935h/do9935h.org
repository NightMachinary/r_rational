From what I remember of HP from that fanfic (it's been ages since I read it and I skimmed a good bit), he didn't push the bounds of my disbelief /too/ much for an 11 year old, and could have existed quite plausibly as a decently bright 14-15 year old who's read some pop-sci books and wikipedia articles and (in wanting nerd cred) tries to shoehorn references to them wherever is remotely appropriate. Not too crazy to conceive of an 11 year old with a more accelerated "intellectual" development (and maybe worse socialization).

As for the SATs, I think the scale used for grading changes pretty often so whatever the score-percentile correspondence is now it could well have been different at some other time. Though having known a fair few good test-takers back in highschool (not 11 but more in the ~14-16 year old range; also, scoring maybe 1500-1600), some of them were quite smart for their age but plenty failed to particularly impress, so IDK how useful test scores are at suggesting the sorts of qualities being discussed here.
