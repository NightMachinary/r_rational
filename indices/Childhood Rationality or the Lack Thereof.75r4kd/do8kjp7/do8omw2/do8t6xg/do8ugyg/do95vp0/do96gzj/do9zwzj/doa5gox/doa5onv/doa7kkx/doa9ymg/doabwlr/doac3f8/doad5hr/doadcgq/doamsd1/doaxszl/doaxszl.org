I am not far right. Taboo the word eugenics: I do not support violations of human rights.

And the stuff about rich kids: Yes, that is true, and also trivial. Assume as, you believe, 50% of behavior is heritable. If this is true for properties that make it easier for you to make money, then you would by the power of bayes naturally assume that rich /parents/ have some combination of luck and genetics that made them rich on average. Obviously kids inherit the genes, if not the luck.
