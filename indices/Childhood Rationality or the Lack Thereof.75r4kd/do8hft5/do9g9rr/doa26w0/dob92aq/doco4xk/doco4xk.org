Regarding child monarchs it's going to be nearly impossible to assess how much of their leadership is just them leaning on the adults around them even were they to lack a regent, particularly since nearly any good leader listens to their advisors anyway. As for regents being necessary you seem to be implying that I don't think nearly all children are terrible leaders, when what I actually said is that the /absolute most competent/ children can probably compare at the very least to a mediocre adult leader. I never claimed the bias against children wasn't justified.\\
And it's not as though there weren't some child leaders who didn't successfully not f*** anything up. Which would seem to make them very comparable to mediocre adult leaders. But of course there's the question of exactly how hard it is to successfully maintain the status quo.

As for psychology/sociology I would posit that it should be perfectly plausible for someone to come up with models in those areas that don't rely on their own social abilities. For instance not every psychologist would necessarily make a good therapist. My point being that there is certainly ought to be progress that can be made in psychology from a systematizing type approach so any lack of child prodigies in this area shouldn't really be totally explainable from just a lack of social skills. After all many of the models and findings in psychology are very clearly non-intuitive and something nobody would ever have arrived at through using their social intuition. Sociology is I would argue an even more pronounced example of this since it's consideration of individual people is more abstract than nearly any psychology.\\
Comparing law to psychology here i'm not sure works because i'm not sure where you're finding these examples of 10 year old law prodigies. I can't find any examples who aren't already in their late teens and that's just for passing the bar. For your point here to make any sense would seem like it would require children actually being quite successful in law not just demonstrating an ability to understand it.

When it comes to children potentially influencing politics through anonymous means I would sort of dispute exactly how influential anonymous letters have ever really been. I just somewhat doubt the ability of anonymous individuals to really manage much deliberate effect on politics, and I suspect any anonymous writings influence is likely to be very heavily affected by chance (in that very few such writings ever get the opportunity to really get noticed) which would decrease the chance of the already small population of child prodigies getting much accomplished.

Importantly though it's getting clear that what we actually need to settle this issue is for you to come up with a /specific/ anonymous test. Which most adults could do but which you think /no/ children could do, then we would be much closer to settling this.
