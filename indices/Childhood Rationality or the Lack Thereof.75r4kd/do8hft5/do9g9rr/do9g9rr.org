The measures I mentioned are: the ability to develop and execute long-term plans and the ability to model other people as well as an adult.

Child prodigies are just fine in terms of memorization, working memory, computation, etc., leading to children who can and do excel in sciences, math, engineering, music, art, etc. Of course, a child prodigy in more than one field is unheard-of, and these fields don't include anything that I mentioned.

Show me a child king or queen who could meet or exceed the capabilities of his or her contemporaries (without regents). Show me a child prodigy psychologist or sociologist. Show me a child prodigy organizational theorist. In other words, show me a prodigy younger than age 11 who actually conceives of and executes long-term plans or can model and lead people as well as contemporary adults, or even better, as well as the child characters in rational fics.
