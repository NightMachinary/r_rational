See the easiest counterpoint to this is simply the existence of child prodigies. Pretty much any measure of mental capacity you care to devise is going to have /some/ 10 year olds who can perform better on it than most adults, and assuming the highly rational children in fiction are extraordinary individuals shouldn't exactly be surprising.\\
Plus having multiple children like this in a story isn't exactly statistically impossible either, calling many of these children prodigies would give you the false impression that children at adult levels of mental development in many areas are as rare as one's who can do as well as genius adults at particular tasks.

Overall my point is that at 10 year olds capable of rationality are neither nonexistent nor even vanishingly rare. If you happen to have grown up in the same filter bubbles as me you've probably met a few of them (and my cultural bubble isn't really particularly prestigious or anything, I don't personally know anyone who's gone to an ivy league school).
