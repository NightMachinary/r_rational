  Show me a child king or queen who could meet or exceed the capabilities of his or her contemporaries (without regents). Show me a child prodigy psychologist or sociologist. Show me a child prodigy organizational theorist. In other words, show me a prodigy younger than age 11 who actually conceives of and executes long-term plans or can model and lead people as well as contemporary adults, or even better, as well as the child characters in rational fics.

It seems as though you're deliberately picking areas where you wouldn't expect examples even if 10 year olds were capable of doing as well as an average adult in those areas. For instance children far enough to the right of the bell curve to be good at leadership despite lack of experience ought to be vanishingly rare. So when you consider that those prodigies would need to just happen to be born into a monarchy and thrust into leadership without any regents the sample size isn't really large enough that you should be tremendously surprised to not find any good examples.\\
In terms of fields like psychology or sociology you may be forgetting that those aren't exactly fields where one can make breakthroughs on one's own particularly easily. Simply put the inability to make breakthroughs that can be confirmed easily enough that people can't discount them based on the characteristics of the person who discovered them would seem to be pretty important in terms of which fields have child prodigies.

But again this is sort of irrelevant because whether you expect child prodigies in every single area that are on par with the imminent geniuses in that field isn't actually relevant here. Because as you said this is whether they can be comparable to the average adult.

In regards to long term planning it's sort of trivially easy to come up with examples of children even younger than 10 who save their allowances for years to get something they wanted (the fact /I/ did that despite not really being particularly impressive in any way leads me to believe that's probably not even that uncommon). As for for leadership ability I think you're forgetting that leadership is pretty massively about people's perspective of you.

To put it another way I would wager that few if any people could, if their mind was placed in a child's body (and everyone had every reason to think they /were/ a child) lead people very effectively. So yes that's a point in your favor against rational fics, because adults aren't generally going to let themselves be led by a child.
