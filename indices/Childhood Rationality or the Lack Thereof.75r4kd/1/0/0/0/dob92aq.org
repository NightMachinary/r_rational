Let me unpack my assertion above.

Given our thousands of years of history that focuses on royalty and nobility with high death rates for most of it, I'd expect that gives a pretty good sample size of potential child rulers. In Europe alone, there were several thousands of various rulers throughout history. Probably more if we include various nobility beneath their kings. Looking out at the rest of the world, there should be tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of various rulers throughout history. If even 1% of them (I'd guess a very low estimate) inherited the throne as children, that would mean hundreds of potential child-kings. If children are as capable of dealing with other human beings as an adult, and if they are as capable as adults at envisioning long-term consequences for their actions, then these child-kings would not have required regencies. But even if regencies were part of some unnecessary bias against kids without a cause, then the top 1% of these kings should still be sufficiently prodigal that they might be able to seize rulership without burning their country to the ground. If my assumedly conservative ratios hold true, then there should still at least be a handful of preteen examples in history that did just that, at least as well as the average king. Who, admittedly, might be "challenged" himself by inbreeding.

Instead of that happening, we end up with child-rulers portrayed as in Game of Thrones. Who, admittedly, is also "challenged" by inbreeding.

You say its hard to break out in psychology or sociology on your own. And yet, child-prodigy law students do it. Law ought to be heavily politicized and high-status, no? The difference is that those prodigies approach law on a logical-mathematical basis, which kids can be good at, but psychology demands getting to know another person, which I posit kids cannot be good at.

Firstly, I'd say cultural biases tend not to arise out of a vacuum. There ought to be some reason that "adults aren't generally going to let themselves be led by a child", and it ought not be tautological. But anyway, something from Ender's Game was their use of what was effectively the internet to write text posts because text hid their physical bodies and let their ideas stand on their own merit. Also, they were teenagers. Anyway, if the idea is solid, then we should see child letter-writers who have some influence on leadership and politics. A child prodigy of political thinking and philosophy, if not a leader. Of course, if it's done well, we wouldn't be able to identify the writer as children, but if the writer was writing a hundred or more years ago and since grew up into a reasonably influential politician, I'm sure they'd reveal and be proud of their childhood writing campaigns. Child scientists did this. So, did even this happen? From my admittedly brief Wikipedia search, I don't see it. You could broaden the search to ethical thinkers and social philosophers, or really any philosophers if you want to demonstrate children have the capacity to think deeply about alternative belief systems and how people, but I still don't see it.
