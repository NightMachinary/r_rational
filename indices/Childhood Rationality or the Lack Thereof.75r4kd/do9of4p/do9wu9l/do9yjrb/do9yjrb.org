by intuition I meant belief in conclusions produced by magical thinking -- things that SOUND right, but have no evidential basis.

I think susceptibility to this and other biases are their main vulnerability and what separates them from adults. The "hardening" of worldview that happens in late teens/early twenties is actually a sort of inoculation against gullibility, but comes with the obvious drawback of being harder to adapt to new information. Anyone who interacts with young children can tell you they are hilarious to toy with because they will believe just about anything, with their resistance to deception improving directly proportionally with age and mental development.

This vulnerability (along with internal bias) can make even very intelligent minds essentially useless when trying to solve real world problems, and I would argue is the primary way that children are hampered by "irrationality."
