My wife is an educator of special needs kids. A big part of her education is to see the difference between accommodating needs and patronizing students. Note: special needs includes both gifted kids and various sorts of challenged kids. So, when I say kids have a limitation in thinking, it's not to justify treating kids like crap, but rather to explain their limits as something beyond the child's control and something that has to be worked with.

It's like, OK, you've got a pet, and the pet pukes on your carpet, and you discover it an hour later. Do you, in anger, break out your belt and beat the animal? Do you try to drag the pet to the puke and shout at it to terrify the animal? Do you reconsider either strategy after recognizing there's no way for the animal's mind to connect the punishment to the problem? Do you wonder if the pet is sick or the food was bad? Do you think forward to some sort of training regime? I'd posit that if you realized the animal's psychology means it very likely won't connect something that happened an hour ago with whatever you do to it now, then you'll realize the futility of punishing it except insofar as it might make you feel better, so you're far more likely to look for an underlying reason or consider options for the future.
