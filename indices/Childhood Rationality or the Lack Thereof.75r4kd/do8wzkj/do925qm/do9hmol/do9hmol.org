My post posited that by age 15, + or - some small number of years, should be the earliest at which we see fully adult capabilities in terms of long-term consequences and modelling other people. 14 or even 13 may be within that range. Much younger than that and I'll need some justification by the author as to WTF. HPMOR eventually gives such a justification, for example.

I've got kids. My wife teaches kids. I see how they think, and it's at least a little bit alien to an adult's thinking. I don't consider their thinking to be invalid, nor for them to be people, nor for them to be "at fault" or "lazy" for their lackings, but rather victims of design and biology. Kids do the best they can, but that's not the same as an adults doing the best they can. Kids think differently.
