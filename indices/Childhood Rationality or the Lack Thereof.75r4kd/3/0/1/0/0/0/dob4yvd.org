Ok, let me ask something else, then. Given that two 10 year old children have both lived 10 years and have experienced 10 years of life on an equal timescale, should we see any differences in how those two 10 year olds make decisions? If you're saying timescale alone is what's important, then they should be equally good or bad at any given consideration of long-term consequences, right?
