  My argument is that the smaller-scale in time and scope is exactly the point, but that it has more to do with brain chemistry and structure rather than data-set of experiences.

How do you separate "experiences" and "brain chemistry"? Doesn't our brain chemistry change in response to our experiences? Then don't we change our experiences (through changing our actions) based on our brain chemistry? Which factor is "more fundamental" than the other? To my point of view, it seems that there's a lot of back-and-forth feedback between "brain chemistry" and experiences and so it becomes a chicken and egg problem.
