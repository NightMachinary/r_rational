Kids are perfectly rational. The data set for decision-making they're working from is just realllllllly limited. So their decisions are rational on a much smaller scale in both scope and time.

Rational child thinking: I want candy (mental timeframe, unspoken: within the next 10 minutes). Mom, can I have candy? Mom said not unless I can buy it myself. I have no money. I still want candy but I also want to not get into trouble. If Mom does not see me eating the candy I know is in the drawer, I can have candy (candy in a kid's mind usually being seen as randomly generated loot, and not an object of real value to which actual ownership rights apply) and she won't know.

Rational teen/adult thinking: I want a car. Dad said not unless I can pay for it. I can use my limited savings and get a part time job, and in a few months I can have a car to fix up while complying with all the rules and maintaining good relationships and trust.
