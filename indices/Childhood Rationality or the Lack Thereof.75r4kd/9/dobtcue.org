I think that your big mistake is over-emphasizing the mean for kids.

Kids are shorter than adults. Yet, by age 12, 5% of girls are taller than the average adult woman. Some of them will stop there, and were just early bloomers. Some of them will end up being freakishly tall. And that's 5% - as you get further to the ends of the bell curve, individuals will vary from the mean even more. People who are different enough from the mean to be substantially different are not rare enough to be freaks on a social scale.

Go to a decent-sized middle school. There will be enough boys that are about as tall as an adult male for them to field several of them in their basketball team. Similarly, there will be a few of them who started shaving at a young age, or who had their voice reach a tone suitable for an adult (whether or not it will be THEIR adult tone). If you're doing a story about middle-school basketball players, several of your characters are not going to resemble the average child in their cohort in a number of physical metrics.

Mental properties are not so uniquely privileged. Even the chart you linked to yourself shows that by age 10, a few percent of the kids have begun the formal stage, and more than double that number have reached a mature level of it by age 13. These are still middle school kids, and we're not even looking at fractions of the top percent. If you're going to be writing a story about smart kids, you aren't going to write about the average kids any more than you're going to use the average kids as the protagonists of your competitive basketball story. The main question then becomes "is the population these kids come from big enough to field this many kids this far from the mean?" If you have a group of 500 6-year-olds and somehow every character is a tiny adult, yeah, that's quite a reach, but if you have a small city of a quarter million and you hand pick the cleverest 13 year olds? They might not be able to perform at a respectable professional level /consistently,/ but it's not unbelievable that they'll be able to analyze and plan and delay gratification better than the average adult.

Mind you, that is not a particularly difficult bar to clear, even. The average adult never got a college degree, has basically no savings, and works jobs that pay $12 an hour or less with no real plans for career advancement. If your baseline is career information workers, your expectations for the level of planning and self-control in adult behavior are skewed.
