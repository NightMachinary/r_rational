Vhazhar touched the Sword of Good, so he's currently good. I don't think everyone is corruptible by power - I think it's possible to rule over the universe with absolute power safely, as long as one takes it step by step.

About accidentally killing everyone - when he has absolute power, he can just choose for them to stay alive, and they will. Absolute power presumably means imposing your wishes on reality directly, rather than having to figure out how to apply that absolute power, otherwise, the Dark Lord would still be defeatable afterwards, even though they all seem to act like the spell was final.
