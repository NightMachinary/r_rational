  Hirou wielded the sword but didn't think he was good.

Well... maybe good people are allowed to have moral flaws of certain kind (as long as they're correctible by the right kind of interaction by their environment).

So maybe Hirou got an upgrade from "good but flawed, and wielding the Sword to a fraction of its capacity" to "fixing flaws in some of his key beliefs (in a way that allowed him to be a catalyst to a significant good) and wielding the Sword fully."

"The most evil person who ever existed" wouldn't pass the Sword's test.
