You might be right but that's also exactly what the most evil person who ever existed can very well say to get you to let them torture everyone.

The risk is nowhere near worth it when there's any other possible way to achieve anything that is at least nearly effective and it seemed like there was. There was nothing in the story about the balance somehow actively fighting and overwhelmingly suppressing democracy.

Further, even if there is magic in that universe that explicitly precludes power corrupting people, that still doesn't mean that a guy who is good at magic rituals is good at governing. He could just kill everyone via sheer ineptitude even if he legitimately tries to be good.
