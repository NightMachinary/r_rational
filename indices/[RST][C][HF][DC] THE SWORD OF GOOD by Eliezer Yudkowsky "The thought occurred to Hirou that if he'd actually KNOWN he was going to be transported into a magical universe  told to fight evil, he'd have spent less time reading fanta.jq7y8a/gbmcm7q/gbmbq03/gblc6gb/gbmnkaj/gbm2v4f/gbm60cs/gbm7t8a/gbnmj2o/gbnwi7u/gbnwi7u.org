  About accidentally killing everyone - when he has absolute power, he can just choose for them to stay alive, and they will. Absolute power presumably means imposing your wishes on reality directly, rather than having to figure out how to apply that absolute power, otherwise, the Dark Lord would still be defeatable afterwards, even though they all seem to act like the spell was final.
