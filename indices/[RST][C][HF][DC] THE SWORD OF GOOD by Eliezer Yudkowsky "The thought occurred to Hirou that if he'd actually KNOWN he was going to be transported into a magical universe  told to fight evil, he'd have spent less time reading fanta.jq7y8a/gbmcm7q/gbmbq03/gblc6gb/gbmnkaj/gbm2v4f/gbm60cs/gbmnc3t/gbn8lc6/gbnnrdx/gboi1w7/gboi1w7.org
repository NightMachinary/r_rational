I guess the point is to not blindly rely on the conspiracy theories of a reclusive group who pass their knowledge only by word of mouth? Perhaps if Hirou killed Vhazhar then Dolf would take over the spell and end it somehow, maybe use it to achieve that "balance" that he so clearly desires. It's not very clear how things were meant to turn out.

The mechanics of the spellwork didn't seem so important in light of the character's revelation of how he was easily letting himself be a tool used to trample over others. At least the Lord of Dark was forthright about his intentions for Evilland and the Bad Races. Hirou's observation that people that world don't tend to lie so much as omit information lets us have some measure of confidence in Vhazhar's words.
