Citation needed. We can see in our world people with absolute power, and they are indeed corrupted.

However, the causal relationship is not established. It is true, you can in a lab reduce empathy in test subjects by giving them money. You can observe people in the world with money exibit a lack of empathy. So a trend is noted.

However, the factors causing that have not been established. In our world anyone who can achive great wealth will have to be absolutely corrupted. The system selects for it.

However we can see plenty of examples of people who gain power and use it justly. They are just usually killed by the bad actors who want to maintain their position so the dataset is small.

I think the kind of person who has a fully developed ethical and moral intelgence would be able to handle it well. Further, even if they make a mistake, failing short of the mark would for sure make a better system than the one that grew by historical accident and primitive struggle.
