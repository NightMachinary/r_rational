Not quite so. I own a gun. That is. I inherited my gandfathers old gun that I dont own any bullets for and just sits as a decoration. Dunno if it even works to be honest. However because ai need bulleta we are back to the issue where the difference bwtween you and me is social power and you bought bullets.

Similar with kung fu. If I go thr gym and train for years to become a ultimate fighters that is because people took the time to teach me. In that case gaining power often increases moral education as you have to learn to trust and rely on people and treat them well.

I think fundamentally changing the time scale doesn't fundamentally change the nature of it.

You ever see the old conan movie? They talk about the riddle of steel. That a sword is only as good as the swordsman can let it be.

If we are dealing with a universe where power is real. And wisdom does let you unlock the secrets of the universe it is a different situation.
