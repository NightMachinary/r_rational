That's true of /social/ power. It's potentially expansive, but vulnerable to outright denial like that. However, there are other types of power. For example, if someone purchases a firearm, then he gains the power to leave bullet-shaped holes in things; and even if society agrees to refuse to take his bullets, he can still leave bullet-shaped holes in people's feet.

Alternatively, if you were to learn some form of martial arts, then you could probably beat me up, regardless of my opinions on the matter; because that is another form of power that does not rely upon others to be effective.
