Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

IMO Hirou AND the Lord of Dark (and Dolf and anyone else, if willing) should've teamed up to fight for democracy. Hirou should not have killed or condoned the kills he has made but the kills he has made and other injustices in that world don't condone the creation of another despot (whether it's Hirou himself, Dolf or the lord of Dark), even if said despot at this point in time doesn't seem too bad. Refusing to stop the ritual would in no way make up for the deaths that happened, it would just be another evil on that pile.

Or at the very minimum, Hirou should've halted the ritual until he was a good enough mage to understand what exactly it was doing. If this was the only time the ritual could've been done then IMO it's VERY not worth the risk of making a god to continue it and should've been stopped anyways.
