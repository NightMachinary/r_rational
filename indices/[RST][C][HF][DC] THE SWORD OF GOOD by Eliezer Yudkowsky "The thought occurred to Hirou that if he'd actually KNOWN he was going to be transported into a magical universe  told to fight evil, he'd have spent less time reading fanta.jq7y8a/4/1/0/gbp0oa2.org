I prefer this quote, from Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon B Johnson:

#+begin_quote
  But although the cliche says that power always corrupts, what is seldom said ... is that power always reveals. When a man is climbing, trying to persuade others to give him power, concealment is necessary. ... But as a man obtains more power, camouflage becomes less necessary.
#+end_quote

It's likely a mix of both, but it's certainly less absolute to give both statements.
