Gun power does depend on bullet power, yes, and social power does make it easier to obtain the bullets. But it's still possible to obtain bullets in other ways, including theft.

And yes, social power does help to obtain other sorts of power (like kung fu). But again - it's not the only way to get there. You can probably find a book on the subject online, and learn from that - it won't be /as/ good as a personal tutor, but it'll be better than someone who does not know it at all.
