anything could be. However power is like time. We aren't talking about a cultivation manwha. In the real world power isn't real. it is like time. It a concept we use to understand the relationship of sates.

I could just pick up and eat an apple so I am more powerful than an apple. Elon Musk could buy the company I work for and fire me. He also has enough money that he could probably murder me and get away with it. He is more powerful. Both our powers are socially provisioned though. If society just agreed not to take elon's money. then it would be all useless and he would be less powerful. In either case, power isn't real. It is our way of describing the social distance between us, there is no intrinsic quality to which it relates. So there is no referent to which a third factor could correlate.
