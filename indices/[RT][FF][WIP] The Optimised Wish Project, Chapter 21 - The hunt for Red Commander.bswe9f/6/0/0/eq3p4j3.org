I'm with you about bardok, I'm glad you are taking the old interpretation. It actually already surfaces in how you treat goku's character, as the only reason he is not evil is that he hit his head.

Still, I think the Broly movie does great things, and it would be a shame to abandon it and the good things it introduces. But considering we are talking about super stuff, I wonder if it would ever become relevant in your story

One last thing. While I consider the ssj form worth dropping as it is (well, GT as a whole) the concept of controlling the oozaru transformation, and combining it with other powers, still has potential that I hope toriyama uses one day. But your story your rules, of course
