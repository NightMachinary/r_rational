I can already tell you that SSJ4 is /not/ a thing in this universe, all of DBGT is not canon, so just don't hold your breath for it. As for the Broly thing... I haven't thought much about it, I outlined a lot of this story before the movie came out. My main reference point was the fact that we see Vegeta controlling his Oozaru in his fight with Goku, and the glimpses we get of the same thing in the Bardock: Father of Goku special.

I'll also add that while I liked the new Broly movie a lot, included the opening scenes, I still don't like much the "Dragon Ball Minus" take on Bardock, where he's kinda good and saves Kakarot on purpose. I liked the tragic antihero Father of Goku version much better, and in fact I'm doing a slight rewrite of it as background for this story. There are differences, but you may consider that the final version will basically be more or less the same as the old TV special, which I consider the finest piece of writing to come out of this franchise altogether. I really really /really/ like it. So, basically, I'm not inclined to making the Broly movie canon, if only for that reason.
