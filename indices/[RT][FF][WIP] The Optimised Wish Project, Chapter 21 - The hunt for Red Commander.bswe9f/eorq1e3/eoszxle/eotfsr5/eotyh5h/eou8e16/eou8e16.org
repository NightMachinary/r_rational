How did I even do that? Ugh.

#+begin_quote
  point!, - Comma is redundant
#+end_quote

Mmmh, arguable, IMHO. There are different conventions as to what to do with dialogue in this situation, and some I've read about use commas this way. I'll leave it for now, but if someone else wants to chime in, feel free, I might be wrong.

Anyway, thanks! I fixed them all, in this chapter I was a bit sloppy I suppose.
