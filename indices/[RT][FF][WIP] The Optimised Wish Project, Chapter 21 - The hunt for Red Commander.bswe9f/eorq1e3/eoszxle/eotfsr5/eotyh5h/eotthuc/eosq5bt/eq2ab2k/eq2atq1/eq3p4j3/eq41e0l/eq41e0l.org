The Broly movie is really great, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it a lot and I liked a lot what it does with Cold and Frieza. I will probably borrow something there, but more in terms of mood/inspiration than actual events.

As for the rest... I won't comment for now. I'm sure we'll have a chance to discuss it again down the line :D.
