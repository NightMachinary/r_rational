  I assume you aren't just go the more power rout of chi refinment? Stuff like engraving one's own integrated circuits with eyesight, a tiny ki beam and will?

I take ki to be programmable to an extent, but not that much. Mostly because otherwise it'd feel like the Nen from HunterXHunter, and I don't want to end up literally copying that.

  Is there going to be an explanation for why seemingly every intelligent species has much the same bodyplan? Also octopi, what would happen if an octopus was left in a scanner with a view of it's body for a few weeks?

Without going into specifics, this is a universe in which there are /Gods/ that look like that. Gods who (in the Kaioshin's case) are specifically tasked with directing creation. So the universe itself reflects some sort of underlying will.
