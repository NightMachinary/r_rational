Another great chapter. Gohan throwing Goku to the other island is hilarious, but also totally possible in dragonball which makes it great. Red's assasination couldn't happen to a worse man; My money is on black making a play for control against piccolo's forces, with a mini plot there of “who gets control of the world spanning terrorist/mercanary organization.”
