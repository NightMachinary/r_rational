I didn't write this yet, might include it later, but my personal canon is that he inherited the position. The Red Ribbon is a private organisation, and Red's father was actually competent, but then he died and the thing changed hands and simply kept running smoothly thanks to competent aides like Black.

In the original, Red gets killed by Black once Goku causes a big enough crisis. I don't think normally someone would risk doing something like that without a very big reason. Remember, the Red Ribbon isn't outright /illegal/ in my version, though they may occasionally do illegal things under the table. But it must be noticed that here the Instruments have been brewing discontent for quite a while, and the Ribbon's decline only made it worse for them, and pushed people to their cause. I'll probably address this in a few chapters from now, as the Red Ribbon will be a very important part of the next arc.

Also, about morons getting in positions of power... /gestures in the vague direction of the current real life Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful army/
