If the staff actually obeys orders and Commander Red isn't aware of his own superfluity then his idiocy is likely to wreak havoc each time he becomes aware of a major decision.

Seeing how this is a PMC, that means that in any major battle against an actual challenge he may feel like doing his title justice, costing the PMC men and equipment it wouldn't have lost otherwise.

If the command staff is able to completely obfuscate him then I guess we are back at Red Ribbon having a shadow council doing the actual leading, making Red a figurehead that only needs to be appeased because he owns everything and him dying or going to the courts would completely remove the fig leaf of legality, transforming the PMC into a terrorist organization if it doesn't dissolve.

Which, given how he is dead now, I hope one of the following is true:

- Someone forged a credible will.
- Someone managed to cajole Red into making an actual will.
- Someone controls Red's legal heir in an equivalent fashion as Red was controlled.

When I say hope I mean after putting myself in the shoes of a Red Ribbon member of course. As a reader I am cool with anything that both makes sense and makes for a good story.
