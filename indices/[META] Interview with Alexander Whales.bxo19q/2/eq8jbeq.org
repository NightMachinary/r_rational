Hey, this is the mostly unedited audio from a project on rational fiction I did for AP Language and Composition a few months back. Thought people would be interested in hearing some of the thoughts of a prominent rational fiction author. The reason I went with the raw recording is due to not wanting to accidentally misconstrue anything as well as remove bloat added due to it being a school assignment.
