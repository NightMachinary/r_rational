No formulas are necessary---if they're in the Northern Hemisphere, all they need to do is point the sucker at Polaris and read off the latitude. Just looking and estimating the angle would be useful too. In the Southern Hemisphere, they're gonna be a bit less accurate, since Sigma Octantis is one degree off. Of course, we don't know what year this is set in, so we might be looking at a slightly shifted night sky, but as long as we're within a few thousand years of the present, it works.
