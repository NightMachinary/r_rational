I have a bookmark for that story located at the top of my browser and check it once every other day with all of my other bookmarks.

Pro Tip: If you want to be up to date on some online event, get a bookmark for it and put in a convenient spot on your browser bar. You will end up checking it when your e-mail's loading or when your computer is slightly slow to load a web page. This trick has helped me be the first one to submit to contests and scholarships for school.
