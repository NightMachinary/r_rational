A fantasy-ish world with an interesting approach to magic. All magic has a (fairly terrible) cost: white mages can heal, but they gather the sickness into themselves, not destory it; gold mages can pause time, or even go back in time, but each second paused costs them much more of their lifespan (don't remember off top of my head; think hours or days), and going back in time means having to kill yourself; red mages know someone most intimately with a single touch - but that knowledge replaces their personality and memories, not adds to them. Etc.

As of chapter 4 I find it a very interesting setting, and the MC seems likeable.
