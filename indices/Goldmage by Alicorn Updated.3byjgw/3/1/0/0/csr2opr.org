You forgot blue and green mages. There have been hints of other color magics, but they're all mythical or rumors. Green mages can affect the mind to make it so that you will like something when you didn't before and vice versa. But their price is that they lose their instincts such as pain reaction and how to breathe. Blue mages can learn about things through divination like where someone is or where the gold is in mining. But in return they forget /how/ to do things. It's not like losing memories or instincts like with red and green mages, but rather they only retain factual information and have trouble learning about new things.

It's really interesting to see how there are three different ways to lose mental abilities as a reflection on how complex the mind is and gives a very good reason implicitly why no animals are shown with the magical abilities.
