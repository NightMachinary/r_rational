It's not only that. They have pretty much unlimited divination in the past and present, limited only by light levels.

Personally, both blue and green mages are fucking terrifying. A bluemage can root through your past selectively, digging up skeletons, or just sensitive info like passwords. A greenmage can inflict you with crippling agoraphobia and claustrophobia at the same time, or force you to feel disgusted at the thought of loved ones.
