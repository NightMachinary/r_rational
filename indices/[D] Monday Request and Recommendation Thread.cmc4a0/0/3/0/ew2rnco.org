I think I fundamentally disagree. I think whats awesome about fanfics is that you /can/ throw out huge parts of characters on a whim. Because while Wildbow might have had a reason for writing the story that way, this isn't Wildbow's story. This is someone else's story, using Wildbow's story as a jumping off point. If you want to write a story where Taylor becomes a kpop star, you can. If you want to write a story where Taylor is a psychopath serial killer, you can. If you want to write Taylor as an asexual trans man, you can.

Now we can talk about specifics and determine if we feel it is lazy pandering or not. I don't know if the author of Nemesis made Taylor a lesbian for some story reason or because they wanted to see more lesbian representation or they just think lesbians are hot. But I don't believe the original work is some sacred text worthy of such respect that we are afraid to change things about the characters because it might be disrespectful.

I guess for me I don't see changing a character's sexuality as any different as changing anything else about them. And for me the fun of fanfics is changing things. If I wanted everything to be the same, I would just read the original work.
