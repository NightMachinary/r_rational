The Worm fanfic [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/path-to-munchies-worm-au.5435/][Path to Munchies]] (+note that the version on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-to-munchies-worm-au-complete.449493/reader][SpaceBattles]] is not as complete+) is surprisingly rational for a light-hearted fic. Rational-adjacent elements include:

- figuring out how to work around superpower limitations
- realizing that making short-term improvements can have deleterious long-term effects
- the value of getting a second opinion

It's also complete. At one point the author toyed with a couple of ideas for a sequel, but ultimately decided that they wouldn't work out.
