I really admire and enjoy authors who can write intelligent people talking past each other. Basically where you can tell what each character is thinking, and what they think the other character is thinking, but both (or more) are wrong. Importantly they should be smart and have understandable reasons for this belief. Obviously its much better if this is conveyed through the dialogue and context instead of just telling you what the characters are thinking. It can be used for humor or dramatic effect or just characterization. Does anyone have recommendations which have this type of dialogue / situations?

An example that comes to mind is JacobK's A Young Woman's Political Record which is all about the main character being quite smart and simultaneously really bad at reading people and conveying her intentions. This definitely goes beyond the realm of plausible, but is mainly humorous and character building.

As an aside I find writing this way difficult, my dialogue tends to be too samesy or to the point, perhaps partly because I can't stand poorly done meandering dialogue.
