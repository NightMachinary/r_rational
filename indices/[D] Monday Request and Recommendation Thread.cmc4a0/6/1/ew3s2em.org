For the first one, I would seriously recommend Alicorn's [[http://nyssa.elcenia.com/][Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility]]. It is basically a rational!Phantom Tollbooth, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it's technically for children, I found it very interesting as an adult, and felt the writing style was definitely mature enough that children might have a hard time understanding some concepts. There are certainly enough references to rational concepts that I had a great time with this. This girl can /write/.
