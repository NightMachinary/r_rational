Having read through it, the first chapter was poorly chosen. The author drops you into an angst-fest that while probably justified by the timeline in the story as a whole, needed a build-up for the reader to be on board with it. In Media Res was a poor decision here, and I suspect it will have driven off quite a few prospective readers.

That said, if you can get past it it's not like that all the time, and it's generally better-handled/justified when the angst does come up.
