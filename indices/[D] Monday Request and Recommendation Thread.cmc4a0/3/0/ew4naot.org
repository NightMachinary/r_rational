I got a perfect story for you. Like 100% what you are looking for. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-crooked-man-marvel-si.759274/][A Crooked Man]] is a Marvel self insert fanfiction where the SI is inserted into the universe with extreme reality warping powers. The fanfic scratches all the itches and questions of what will someone do if they can play god. It is pretty tame so far compared to the wish fulfilment full blast harem scale where normal OP fix-it self inserts are commonplace.
