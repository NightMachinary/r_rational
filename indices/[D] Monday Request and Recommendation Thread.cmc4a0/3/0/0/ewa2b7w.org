eh, I'm going to contradict this recommendation - sure, it's certainly among the better examples of the genre, but at its core it's still OP Mary Sue powerwankery, and blatantly glosses over the implications of the existence of a being with godlike power

so far the only statement it seems to be making is "i'm stronger than you, so i can do what i want", which is still as true as it was on melos, despite that being used as a defence when the protagonist is objectively in the wrong
