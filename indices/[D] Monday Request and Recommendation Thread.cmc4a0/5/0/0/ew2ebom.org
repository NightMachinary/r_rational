An apocalypse story presents us with a world in disequilibrium - it's one of the chances to show something clever and doable without it being asked why it wasn't done before. We do still need to ask why others cannot imitate. Broadly, I think it's fine for a Munchkin story to start from an unusual power, but it should require much cleverness to make good use of the power, it must not be an obvious path to godhood.
