Huh, I've never heard of that subcategorisation for litrpg, “Apocalyptic LitRPG”. So please excuse me if I'm wrong, but if I recall correctly, then /Threadbare/ by Andrew Seiple would fit that description. I think it was discussed during that trilogy how the levelling system was just something that suddenly popped into existence in the not too distant past (within living memory, I think).

I wouldn't describe the story itself as rational, but perhaps rational-adjacent, with the protagonist being the titular teddy bear who was given sentience, and him and important people around him being the respective PoV characters.

The employment of the RPG system to the benefit of the characters is rather shown than explained, though the latter also happens. I particularly remember how a character in a protracted fight for their life kept filling their intentionally left empty job slots with jobs whose requirements they had met in previous years, but declined to learn at that time (like [Herbalist], [Carpenter], and what not in contrast to Classes like [Mage] or [Ranger]), simply to replenish the main attributes connected to that job with that initial level 0 to level 1 level up. That character seriously hobbled their prospective levelling in the future for the short term benefit of fighting that much longer. It was an unusual tactic /and/ an unusual use of what are ostensibly very minor benefits for 'regular players'. It evidenced a lot of thought being put into exploring the ramifications of this new system being put into place.

And for what it's worth, I thought the audiobook narration did improve a bit on the quality of the text, though that may also be attributed to editing between reading the web version and the publication on Amazon.
