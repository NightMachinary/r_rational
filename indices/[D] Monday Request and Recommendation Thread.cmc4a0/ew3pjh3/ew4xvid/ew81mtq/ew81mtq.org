Oh yeah, if this was intended for this sub, she totally would have used her skill-trading skills to set up a skill market and simultaneously make all the money and learn all the skills. Or the company that made all those too-human NPCs would have already been taking over the world in other ways.

But I think the characters are well written and realistic - after all, she's playing a videogame to have fun playing the game, not because she wants all the skills.
