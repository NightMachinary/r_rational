So I would like to make three different recommendation requests today.

First are books that play with being in a surreal reality like Alice in Wonderland, Phantom Tollbooth, and Harold and the Purple Crayon. The issue is that the only such books I can find tend to be for children. Are there any such books for adults?

Another request is for any stories about escaping a simulated world like the Matrix. It seems like such stories would be a great fit for this subreddit, but I have barely heard of at.

Last but not least, is a request for anything with a scene where someone realizes that they are not the hero but the villain instead. I'm trying to write about a similar emotional scene, but it's not easy going and I was hoping for inspiration from something similar.
