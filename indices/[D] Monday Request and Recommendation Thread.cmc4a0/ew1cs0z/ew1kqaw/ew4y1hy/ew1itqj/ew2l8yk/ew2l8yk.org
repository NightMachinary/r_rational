Just an aside, but I don't really like it when fanfic authors change canon characters' sexuality, as happens in Nemesis. For Worm in particular, Wildbow decided to make Taylor straight specifically because the bullied lesbian high schooler trope is so overused. He didn't need or want that to be part of Taylor's struggles. I feel like trying to drum up sympathy for a character by changing something so fundamental about them, something which actually changing in the real world would be more like a form of soft death for most people, is both somewhat lazy writing and a little disrespectful, both to the author for throwing out a huge part of their character on a whim, and maybe even a little to members of those communities, though I would never try to speak for them.

I can get it in worlds with no apparent gay characters, or with side characters whose sexualities didn't come up in canon. The Wormverse, however, does minority representation well enough that neither of those are reasonable excuses.

Anyway, this is just a personal preference, and I don't think less of anyone for disagreeing. I just find it strange that people do that with characters.
