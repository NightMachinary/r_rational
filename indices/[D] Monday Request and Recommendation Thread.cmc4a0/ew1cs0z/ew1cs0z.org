A lot of rational stories tend to be very serious and a bit depressing. What I'm looking for are stories that have semi rational goal oriented protagonists while also being a bit more fun and light hearted.

The best examples of stories that fit this that I've found are:

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/reader][Nemesis]]* - Worm AU where Taylor becomes a comedy cape, not for the LOLs but because its a smart choice in her situation.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/reader][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]]* - Harry Potter SI where the protagonist uses her book knowledge to try to help but doesn't immediately overturn the whole world.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/reader][Dragonspawn]]* - My Hero Academia SI where the protagonist doesn't know anything about the world and has the power to turn into a dragon.
