[[https://mangadex.org/title/22637/otome-game-no-hametsu-flag-shika-nai-akuyaku-reijou-ni-tensei-shite-shimatta][Destruction Flag Otome]] is the funniest manga I've read. I don't usually enjoy oblivious protagonists even as humor, but this really makes it work somehow - maybe by making clear which alternate theory the protagonist has fixed in her mind; and by having everyone else be sane in unison, rather than everybody in the story being insane.
