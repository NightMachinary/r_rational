I've been getting into Apocalyptic Litrpgs lately and I am saddened by the fact that there is rarely any munchkinry. In Apocalyptic Litrpgs the physics of earth gets replaced by an RPG leveling system where people have to get stronger by leveling up in order to survive the spawning monster onslaught. This is a prime environment for munchkinry where people can min/max and abuse the system in place. However, the main reason the MC gets ahead of the curve powerwise is either by extreme luck or a benevolent omnipotent being graces a cheat skill to them at the start.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/1729/change-new-world][Change:New World's]] MC dabbles with munchkinry by abusing a goblin spawn point. It is probably the only Apocalyptic Litrpg that munchkins at the start.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35596177-life-in-the-north][Life in the north]] MC makes a good point to his min/maxing mage friend that he can kill him in one punch because he did not put any points in constitution and he should not treat the system as a videogame. (This book is sadly an example where the MC gets extremely lucky kill and is riding off that high throughout the book.)
