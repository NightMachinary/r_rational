I think that is because if the system has such easily exploitable things then why isn't everyone doing it? and if everyone is doing it or if the system is "fair" then whoever was lucky to have best starting position/better traits/chose correctly on almost zero info at the start comes out massively ahead.

Its been a long time since i've read it but IIRC in Change the MC was just lucky to be at the goblin spawning point when the change happened so had the chance to do that; the mc acknowledges that tons of people were almost instantly killed cuz high level monsters spawned where they were. Also spawning in a place that allows for quick early leveling is a common trope in lit rpgs; for instance legend of randidly ghosthound, azarnith healer, the new world, everybody loves large chests all have that as well as Change: New World
