I just read this on your recommendation, and it was surprisingly enjoyable. I suspect it's nearing its end though, as I'm not sure where else the author can go after this arc and a wrap-up arc. Maybe an outside observer looking in and thinking that the protagonist must be secretly an incredible schemer putting up a convincing facade, to have got herself so entrenched in high society as she has?
