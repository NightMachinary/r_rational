I'm interested in more civilization building fiction. Something where man vs nature is a big part of things, but the man is a society instead of a lone survivor. A good example that was recently on the frontpage is [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/439981/luna-is-a-harsh-mistress][Luna Is a Harsh Mistress]]

On that note, I'd also be interested if anyone wants to reccomend some generally good rational pony fic. I've enjoyed what there is of the above, and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]] has also really sucked me in, but I bet there's a ton more that I'd never find on my own.
