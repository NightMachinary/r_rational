Ah, I think I understand what you're getting at now: missing the forest for the trees? Or, more accurately, missing the argument for the analogy?

In a way, it's almost a self-inflicted Red Herring, or perhaps a subconscious form of Strawman? As I think about it, I am more convinced that Strawman most accurately describes this scenario, as someone intentionally (or subconsciously) misunderstands you and focuses on your individual statements, rather than your overall arguement.
