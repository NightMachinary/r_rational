I honestly believe that in most cases the people are genuinely trying to be helpful. And sometimes examples can be confusing but I have noticed that it doesn't even seem to matter if you point it out directly ahead of time, people still seem to fall into this trap. (See, unintentionally, above)

Also, you seem to understand what I am getting at now. All of the things you suggest seem to circle just outside of exactly describing this thing. I feel like "Forest for the Trees" is closest.
