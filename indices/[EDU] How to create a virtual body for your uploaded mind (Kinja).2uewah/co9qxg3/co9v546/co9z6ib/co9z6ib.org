Honestly, I expect that nothing here would be a problem for an upload, for one simple reason: We can dream. Our brains are fully capable of just inventing their own virtual bodies that can do everything here. In fact, we can't not dream. In total sensory deprivation, we start hallucinating in /minutes/. Along with confusion, paranoia, introspection, loneliness, depression, jetlag, sleep disorders of all kinds, degradation of attention, memory, and reasoning skills... Sensory deprivation is scary.

A bodiless upload will probably have a pretty bad case of phantom limb pain. More than half of amputees do, and the upload just had their everything cut off. So you've got the laundry list of issues above, plus your body is twisted like a glitched out ragdoll in a video game, and it's exactly as painful as it looks. You're going to have a lot worse concerns than occasional slight emotional numbness. But you'll surely go on thinking, body or no.
