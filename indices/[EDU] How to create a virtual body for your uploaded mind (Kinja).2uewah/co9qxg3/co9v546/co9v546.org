Thanks for your feedback! I'm writing a short story about a girl who gets her brain uploaded, and I'd actually never considered the possibility of how the brain really /needs/ a body (virtual or otherwise) in order to be healthy. So I thought it was interesting, and wanted to post it as a resource for anyone else pursuing that same thought path.
