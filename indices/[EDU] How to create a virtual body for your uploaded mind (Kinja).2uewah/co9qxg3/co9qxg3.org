This article kind of annoys me, really. It seems to oscillate between saying things that are blatantly obvious (Hormones affect how you think!) and saying things that are very stupid (Without an environment, there can be no subjective awareness!).

Every example they cite is sensible, and things like facial feedback and microbiota effects might be interesting if you hadn't heard of them before. But the overall theme is that you can't have a mind upload without virtual reality. Not just that the mind won't be healthy, but that it just can't be done. Dumb.

Also, while I'm pretty okay with posting everything that might he tangentially interesting to people, officially this subreddit is for rational fiction specifically. That may be why you're not getting much response here.
