What? Exactly when did that ever happen? And mirror clones don't even count as people, or else Twilight /in canon/ is a mass murderer.

Again, /when?/ Twilight barely said anything in reaction, and all she did was try to come up with logistic problems that Dash already had addressed. Twilight didn't give any advice in the first place, besides "Hey Dash don't do this thing," which was a normative prescription that Twilight didn't even justify.

/"Right, well according to our spies inside the empire, it's because they're working on a secret weapon estimated to be greater than or equal to our magic. If they achieve something like that, then it could be a toss up as to whether or not the Princesses could keep them in check with their magic alone."/

/"I spent hours trying to think of the best way to achieve a lasting peace with them"/

No such thing. First of all, the Griffon Empire being called an Empire doesn't really mean anything; the show's sense of scale seems to view empires as having populations the size of Ponyville if you look at the Crystal Empire and Griffonstone. Secondly, one nation is not the entirety of the world, and, as I have repeatedly pointed out, it was a preemptive strike to prevent greater loss on both sides when the Griffons attempt their own invasion.

I'm still not sure how you can possibly think Rainbow's a supervillain here. It's kind of ridiculous for you to claim so; at the very worst she's misguided. There is no evidence in the text that Dash is being nefarious, underhanded, or immoral. She is solving problems on behalf of Equestria.
