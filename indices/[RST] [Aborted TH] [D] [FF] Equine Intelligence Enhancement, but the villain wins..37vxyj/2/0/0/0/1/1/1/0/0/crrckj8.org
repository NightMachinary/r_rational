Certainly. Let me explain my argument in more detail:

- Rainbow Dash declared pre-emptive war on a rival nation.
- All else being equal, fictional supervillains are more likely than non-supervillains to declare pre-emptive war. (I only gave one example. I can find more if you want.)
- Therefore, this is evidence that Rainbow is being painted as the supervillain.

--------------

Okay, this argument is getting too long, so I'll weaken my position in the hope of finding a compromise. Can we at least agree that the plot is putting Rainbow in the role of the villain? We can think about the "should superintelligences be assumed good or evil" problem some other time.

The plot of this story is simple and classic, straight out of /Frankenstein/ or /Jekyll and Hyde/ or /Honey, I Shrunk the Kids/. A scholar makes a fantastic discovery, applies it foolishly, and then has to deal with the consequences before everything they care about is destroyed. Twilight Sparkle is in the "hubristic creator" role as the protagonist, and Rainbow Dash is in the "abomination of science" role as the antagonist.

It can be fun to re-read a story from the villain's perspective and see how they had good intentions (as all deep characters should) and had a good chance of success (as all effective villains should). But the author didn't write Dash as the good guy, and it's his story.
