  Does [[/r/rational]][1] have a blind spot in recognising supervillains or something?

  Between this and HPMoR's Quirrell practically wearing an "I am Voldemort" T-shirt, I'm starting to wonder.

And Lex Luthor. There's a rational /Superman/ fanfic where we're more-or-less rooting for Lex fucking Luthor.

Maybe I should just start tagging people as Apologist for Obvious Villain when they do this stuff. Actually, no, that'll never work. It'll just start "Villain X DID NOTHING WRONG" threads.

  What more does she have to do to convince you she's the villain of the story?

Take even more personal initiative and become a more interesting character. I mean, that is the problem: we kinda want to root for the villain because they're the ones with plans and ideas. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][Due to an unfortunate bias of literary structure, heroes are usually basically reactive]] -- [[http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=953][and therefore basically reactionary]].

(If anyone still wonders why the fuck I'm so fanboyish over /Gurren Lagann/: it is one of the very few stories to reverse the trend. The heroes are taking initiative and trying to build something, the villains are motivated precisely by their belief that doing so is ultimately destructive and futile, that no initiatives and no progressive efforts must be undertaken ever again.)
