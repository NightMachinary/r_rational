It has nothing to do with a preference towards ponies. Dash's resolution to conquer the Griffon Empire is in reaction to the extant threat of war, and her actions are ones that will minimize death and suffering. The enhanced mice are similarly endangering the lives and well-beings of others, simply for revenge on Twilight. Her actions make total moral sense in a consequentialist view.
