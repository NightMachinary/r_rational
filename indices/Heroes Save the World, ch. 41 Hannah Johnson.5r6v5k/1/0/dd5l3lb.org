The ending is intended to be unclear because we're in Hannah's head right now and a lot happened, very quickly, so she's as confused as you are.

However, I apparently still messed up, because if the text isn't clear enough on the fact that it's /supposed/ to be unclear, and why, then I didn't write it well enough. Sorry about that. >:P
