Hello, author of Paragon here. Thank you for your thoughts. This story is based loosely on litRPG mechanics, but I'm hoping it doesn't come off too level-up focused. The story isn't defined by the mechanics, but they will play a large role.

Also, big fan of your work. I look forward to when you release updates.
