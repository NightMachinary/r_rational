I'd encourage you to post as the month goes on. It's good to get more stories.

Structurally, you've given me a few hooks, any of which could start the story:

- How does a software consultancy literally explode?
- How did his personal life explode
- Dragon?
- Religious debate?
- What's up with the politics?
- Move?

One sticking point is that I'm not sure if the political stuff is an unreliable narrator, if it's authorial hints about the tone of the book, or if it's signaling that we're in an alternate US.

Take the insurance. Standard home owners insurance covers losses from fire and mundane criminal acts. It might not cover damage from exceptional things like war, terrorism, or Godzilla. So, if the insurance company says that the bombing was just a crazy guy, then the damages should be covered immediately.

And transition teams haven't been able to fire career civil servants since the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Civil_Service_Reform][Pendleton act]] passed in 1883.
