I'm conflicted on the political stuff.

As written, it's a strong turn-off for me, and the details are a bit jarring. But I suspect I'm not in the target audience. So, if you're going to be writing a book with strong political themes, it's probably good to set the tone at the start.

If you're going to focus on the impact of the bombing, and it's long-term fallout, I might /also/ have the main character be injured from getting jumped. Since he's a software developer, losing an (insured) office just isn't that big of deal.

Otherwise, I'd focus on the dragon.
