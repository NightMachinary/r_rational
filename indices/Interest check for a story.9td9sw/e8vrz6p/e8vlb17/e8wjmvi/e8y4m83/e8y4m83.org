As far as I'm aware, majority of the time political stories are about how the author's chosen faction is right about everything and the outgroup is wrong and stupid and evil. It's possible to write a fairer more even minded portrayal of political issues, ,but it's probably much easier to do if you are either autistic or from another country than the one you are writing about/for. You're going to need to make it really really good epistemic quality if you want rational fiction readers to move past the understandable aversion to politics and actually read it.

I've actually been working on a rational fic that involves real life politics as a significant part of the plot, which I hope does a decent job of taking a nuanced approach to political issues. It doesn't seem that way at the beginning of the story though, but there's a big reveal towards the end of part 1 which subverts that initial impression and it's foreshadowed a bunch of times before that. It's still a work in progress and parts of it need more fleshing out, but if you want an example of a rational fic that deals with contemporary political issues it might give you some ideas of how that might be accomplished.
