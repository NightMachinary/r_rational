Which of these hooks interests you more vs less?

I must not be being clear about the insurance! You're 100% right, which is the point; the narrator cannot argue that it was terrorism lest the damages have been invalid (because the damage wasn't covered). Having to pay it back no matter how long it's been is narrative license, no insurance contract would be structured that way in real life, but I thought it was funny.

Narrator's mom is in State and serves at the pleasure of the President, though she's been there since Reagan (e.g., stayed through two two-term Democratic Presidents). "You're fired as soon as we're in office, but you're not allowed to say anything about it" kind of dealio. She's based off of a couple of real people.
