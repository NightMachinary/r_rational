Also, IIRC, arcane is the only school of magic that is self powered. People store mana, essentially, into their auras and use that to cast spells. The stored up mana can run out. For the other three schools, the power is directly borrowed from its source directly, and the only limit is the user's tolerance. Divine channels energy from the Gods, but the user can risk burning themselves out if they draw too much power. Infernal energy is basically free and extremely easy to access, but it will corrupt any user if they're not careful in its usage. And Fae is entirely at the whims of one's contracted familiars and allied spirits, and you need gifts, relationships, and favors in order to do stuff.
