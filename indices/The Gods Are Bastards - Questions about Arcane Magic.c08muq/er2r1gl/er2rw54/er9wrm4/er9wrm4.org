Arcane magic is what puts the world into a 40's era level of technology. It's orderly, follows consistent rules, and lends itself to making repeatable +circuits+ runes. Runes are also used for the more magical magic effects like forcefield shields, temperature regulation, silence, and so on.

It also tends to fail catastrophically near fae magic, depowered near "holy" magic, and overcharged near infernal magic.
