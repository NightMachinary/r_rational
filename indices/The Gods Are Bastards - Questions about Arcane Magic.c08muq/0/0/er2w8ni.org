  why haven't you read further,
#+end_quote

The things I enjoyed in the story did not make up for what I did not like, and I'm not masochist enough to suffer reading something for a paid off that I do not think will come.

#+begin_quote
  and for what purpose are you asking?
#+end_quote

I recently found a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/arachnophobia-worm-the-gods-are-bastards-crossover.746014/][crossover between TGAB and Worm]] (which is being written in a style I like much more than the D. D. Wedd's), and I want to get an idea of what Arcane magic is capable of, to have an idea of what to expect from the next chapters.\\
Thank you for your help!
