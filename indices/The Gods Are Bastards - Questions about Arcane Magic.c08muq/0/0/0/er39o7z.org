Could you elaborate? I have my own particular criticisms of TGAB, but I'm always curious what turned other people off. Most of the criticisms I've read about the writing style are smoothed out over the first few volumes - and those about implied authorial bias are strongly reversed and countered as the series goes on - but I do admit to having a soft touch when it comes to the series since I've been invested for years.

Oh, spiffy! I'd probably need to reread Worm to get into this... but I'm not up for doing so. Tonally, TGAB is pretty much the opposite of Worm. I've specifically recommended it as a palate cleanser for those who burned out by the grimdark (or grimdark-lite) nature of Worm. In TGAB, plot armor is literally part of the overall narrative for the main characters.

  I want to get an idea of what Arcane magic is capable of, to have an idea of what to expect from the next chapters.

Early on, I think Arcane is mostly shields, charms, and powering tools (enchantment). Besides high-level users like high elves, blue dragons, and Archane Tellwyrn herself... they are masters of the craft and rain down destruction as they please, unlike low-level users like Gabe. Unlike all the other schools of magic, Arcane isn't tied to a specific deity. It seems to make it a bit more nebulous than the rest; its limits are less defined, its usage is more widespread, and it doesn't require outside assistance or piety to work. For example, Divine requires the patronage of a god; Fae requires relationships or pacts with spirits; and Infernal will likely result in the swift death of the practitioner unless they work with a specific god or are taught by red dragons. Arcane is a lot more analytical - if you know the words and the patterns and the intent, you can invoke it - no gods or pacts or risk required. It's like operating the machinery of the world to some extent (though all magic is, really).
