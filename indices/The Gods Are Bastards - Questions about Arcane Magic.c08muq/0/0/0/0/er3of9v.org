  Oh, spiffy! I'd probably need to reread Worm to get into this... but I'm not up for doing so.

You really don't have to for the linked story, as it's a TGAB fanfic first and foremost. The Worm elements introduced so far are strictly flavouring: (Worm spoilers) Taylor has one arm; Taylor killed Scion; Taylor /used to/ have an insect-themed power. That's the full extent. Honestly, if you treated it as a TGAB fanfic with a "mysterious OC protagonist" you'd lose nothing at all.
