  As I have not read beyond the first chapters (I can not read the author's style), I come here to borrow the knowledge of those who have.

Just curious, why haven't you read further, and for what purpose are you asking?

#+begin_quote
  What sorts of feats/spells is possible with low/medium-level Arcane magic?
#+end_quote

I haven't read the early volumes for a long time, but I seem to recall that Arcane magic allows for things like:

- Silencing wards (preventing any sound from extending more than a few feet away)
- Enchantments that boost certain parameters (luck, protection, constitution)
- Tracking (like a homing beacon)
- Shielding, especially against energy sources (like wands)
- Working like electricity to power weapons/arrays/vehicles/etc.
- Teleportation (higher level, I think)
- (Slightly) disruptive of Divine magic, opposed to Fae magic, and disrupted by Infernal magic (see Circles of Interaction, volume 3, chapter 3)
- Strong direct magic attacks, like fireballs and magic missiles. Tellwyrn is an Arcane archmage, so what she does is usually (but not always) through Arcane magic.
