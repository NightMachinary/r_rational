Much like how divine magic is opposite of infernal, arcane magic is the opposite of fae in many ways. This means that it's very much based on maths, careful application of theory, and stuff like that. Given the time-period of the world in the story, the most impressive thing a low level wizard can do is some slight enchantments that take a lot of preparation, and maybe some more versatility with wands.

The time period of the story is basically late-western inspired. Wands are essentially guns, and unless you're very powerful/skilled/have access to specific knowledge you're probably just better off using a wand or a staff (heavy rifle equivalent). The age of heroes is over, a low/medium-level arcane mage is working in a factory to make enchantments.

The two arcane mages in the story are Gabriel who just uses wands, and Fross who is a Fae creature who converted her considerable power into arcane magic. Other than that the only relevant ones are medium/high-level ones who operate as battlemages in elite forces, portal operators, and professors...and the incredible archmages of course.
