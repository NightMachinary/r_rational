Who's Kerria? o_O Never heard of her... is that like an alternate name for Yellow from the manga?

Edit: Aah, it's a type of yellow flower in Japan, that makes sense :)

I've been thinking of adding a "Yellow" character to the story for awhile, but if I do I would first want to actually read the manga some so I could get a sense of their character (Leaf is essentially an OC, but I have nothing in particular in mind for Yellow) and what their role in the story would be.
