Green (English translation) in the manga was initially a shady character. She's first introduced as a con-artist who dupes Red, and from there on has a supporting/anti-heroine role until things get really epic (outrageous) in Saffron City. She originally stole her Squirtle and Pokedex from Prof. Oak, and the conclusion to her character arc in the Red Saga is being forgiven after explaining why she turned to theft and scams.

I remembered that, but I get how my post might have been misleading. I was thinking more along the lines of how the ESP aspects could be used for diagnosis, calming Pokémon during/prior/post treatment, and understanding the effects of treatments from the perspective of the patient Pokémon.
