Ahh neat. As you kind of mention she does seem really similar to my version of Leaf, with her battle style and higher empathy, but I don't really know how Leaf in the manga is so maybe the distinction is a lot bigger.

Healing powers would be a massive break of how my world works (human psychics are not powerful enough to heal pokemon) but it could be worked in with just a lot of experience raising and taking care of them, which is very similar to Aiko.

I guess we'll see. I might actually just change her name to Kerria at this point XD
