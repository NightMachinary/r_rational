If it helps kick-start any seed-ideas (and at the risk of being mildly spoilery), here are a few facts about manga!Yellow:

Her attitude towards Pokémon is very benevolent and empathetic. This likely stems from her special ability to heal and understand Pokémon via touch, which she was born with. This goes so far that Pokémon healing is considered her 'specialty', same as how Pokémon battling is manga!Red's, Pokémon training is manga!Blue's, and catching Pokémon is manga!Crystal's.

As a result of her attitude, her battling style focuses heavily on subduing enemy Pokémon without actually injuring them. It was her skill in controlling a battle in this manner that convinced manga!Prof. Oak to let her be the main character of the Yellow Saga. (Even though we later find out she's also super-naïve, and somehow doesn't even know about metamorphosis... wut? -_-)

Her home is Viridian City, and her first Pokémon was a Rattata. She also wears a cool straw hat, which at some point gets the rainbow and silver feathers in it (which are the keys to TIME TRAVEL - seriously).

So, with the above, maybe one idea could be that OoS!Yellow is a psychic like Red, but focused on applying her powers to further veterinary research and care. That could make her a foil to Red, i.e. pure versus applied science, and her battling style could make her another foil to Blue. She would likely have a similar stance as Leaf on Pokémon treatment, but because of her psychic/empathic abilities has a more extreme position? If her primary interest is in veterinary medicine, she could have an understanding of Pokémon biology that exceeds even what Red has studied in that field (specialist vs generalist).

Considering all of the above, she could maybe have a role to play whenever Pokémon biology/medicine/biomedical ethics/humane treatment/time travel (jk!) gets the limelight?
