On the one hand, having more trainers join the party would be a pretty big diversion from the original games. On the other hand, I can see the appeal of having more main characters to focus on. Maybe there should be more teams of major side characters whose perspectives we get to see. I mean we already are starting to do get something like this but it's mostly just individual side characters, rather than recurring teams of them. It would be interesting to do something like what Sonic Heroes did. The main team is Red Blue, Leaf and Aiko. Then you could add others.

BTW why didn't you name her Kerria instead of Aiko? Then you could have had all four of the Gen 1 colors represented among the protagonists. Seriously this was a huge missed opportunity.
