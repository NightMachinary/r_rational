Hey, just picked up the story on Sunday and ended up binging it until I caught up. I just wanted you to know that I really enjoy your take on the world of pokemon. It's fascinating to have a game I grew up playing as a kid re-contextualized as a truly dangerous and fleshed out world. It reminds of when people talk about doing the Nuzlocke challenge in the games. I hadn't really thought about the more emotional implications behind it until you're serial made me look at it from a more realistic point of view. I'm looking forward to the next chapter!
