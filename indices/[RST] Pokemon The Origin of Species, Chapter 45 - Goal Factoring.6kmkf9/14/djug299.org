Hey, I'm a bit late to the party but I realized that I haven't been commenting much lately and since I feel guilty about it I wanted to leave my own small contribution! This story is always the highlight of the start of a new month for me and it really has grown into something special. This chapter allowed the main characters to look into their character arcs, in a way, in order to decide which direction -they- wanna go. It's as if you, the author, were giving them the freedom to choose their own path as opposed to letting the demands of the plot to dictate it. It might be an illusion, but it's (super) effective!

Red's conflict with his mother seems a bit petty at first, but then you realize it holds a sense of familiarity. It's actually a fairly realistic teen-parent conflict moment in its scope and execution. Concerning Red's future, I am really exited about his finding some big mystery or problem to work on: right now his research has been for the sake of the research itself, but when he finds something he's truly passionate about (for whatever reason) this focus will move on to the object itself. The psychic interludes are always a joy to read.

As for Blue, his character establishing moments with his grandpa were truly heartwarming and showed a softer side of him. He's still my favorite character to read about because I'm a sucker for this kind of ambition-driven rise to greatness journey, so I'm ready to enjoy the Blue ride!

Finally, Leaf is where the story has unexpectedly grown on me the most: I went from being pretty uninterested in her character and story arc in general to genuinely enjoying it. I think it has some great potential, conspiracies aside, to highlight some of the ethical grey zones of the pokemon universe, while making her question her own firm and somewhat black-and-white beliefs at the same time. That would truly be awesome.

I think that's all for now..oh yeah, the new character! I kinda like her, but I feel like I am supposed to like her and sympathize with her, which makes me want to not like her despite it. Yet I also have the feeling she might have some hidden depths after all. By the way, is her father supposed to represent the pokemon daycare from the games?
