When Red was explaining what it was like to be psychic to his mother by comparing it to be deaf person being able to hear:

  Red smiles ruefully. "It's pretty amazing. Like... I don't know, getting a hearing implant must be, for someone born deaf. But it's a lot of hard work too, and I still can't do a lot of things I thought I'd be able to. I can't even lift a stupid rock."

I would advise against that metaphor. Cochlear implants are a subject of controversy in the Deaf culture since they often view it as 'forcing' people to fit in when for those who are born deaf and receive the implants late in life (not hearing aids though since they don't require surgeries). It takes years of practice and hearing therapy to be able to hear as well as a hearing person (if ever). For many Deaf, they are skeptical of the 'benefits' that cochlear implants bring. While they don't have issue with teens or adults choosing to get them of their own volition, there are issues with hearing parents deciding that their deaf child should get the implants to be "cured". For example in the media about cochlear implants, we almost always see the parents gushing about the implants, but the children are rarely shown being asked for their opinions before or after.

If you did want to use a metaphor with controversial implications just like how there is controversy associated with psychics in your story, then it's a very good choice. But if you simply wanted to use an analogy of using a sense for the first time, then I would recommend the blind seeing color for the first time instead.

Whoops, I went off in a tangent. I'm fine with the metaphor itself, but I thought you might want to know about any potential issues with it and I'm willing to answer any qeustions you may have.
