I think there is some pattern - "Ero" means Poison Powder for one Pokemon, and Sand Attack for another. I think "Ero" means "disabling/controlling attack", while "Ero 2" might mean "evasive attack" or something. Like how people try and keep all their hotkeys similar between different MMO characters, even if the spells themselves are different.
