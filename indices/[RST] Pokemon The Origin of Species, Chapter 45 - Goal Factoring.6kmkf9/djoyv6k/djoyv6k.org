I really enjoy your writing, my only complaint is that I hate waiting for the next to be released! I know some have said they think adding Aiko to the story would make for too many perspectives and possibly drag out the story. I agree, but I also like her! I thought that maybe she would work well as a constant side character the way she has been so far. You may have already considered this, but I wanted to mention it. Whatever happens, the story is still awesome and I can't wait for the next chapter!
