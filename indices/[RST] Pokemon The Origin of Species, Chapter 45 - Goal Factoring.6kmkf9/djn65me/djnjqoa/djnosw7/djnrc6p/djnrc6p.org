  Or would she rather just let it go?
#+end_quote

The story piece is clearer now but the "she" here is still ambiguous since the sentence is about two women. Also, without the "she rather /I/ just let it go," or something to that effect, the sentence looks like Leaf is doing the letting go. Something like "Or would Leaf appreciate it if I dropped the subject entirely?" or "Or would Leaf rather I forget about the whole thing?" or "Should I just let go of the topic?" or "Or would Leaf prefer not to talk about it?" or similar would work better, IMO; that way, the reader won't have to pull out of the story to try to figure out who is doing what.
