So this is actually something I'm aware of but did not in this case use intentionally to parallel the controversy about psychics, which makes me feel like I should change it for that reason, while at the same time I'm still navigating how I feel about it and whether including it with such muddled intentions does it justice.

For now I think I'm going to keep it in because I know how /Red/ would react to the idea that medically curing a disability isn't an obvious and uncomplicated good. (Which may be in part influenced by the much more advanced medical technologies available in the Pokemon world, but may not be too).

I do thank you for bringing it up so I could think about it more, though!
