Hey everyone, welcome back to, say it with me now, the New Longest Chapter Yet! Lots of notes this time around, so bear with me:

First, I had an amazing time this month at the Center for Applied Rationality workshop in Seattle. It was tons of fun, I met all sorts of interesting and unique people, and I learned quite a lot about myself and various tools available to upgrade my thinking and perspectives. If you're curious to learn more you should totally [[http://www.rationality.org/][check out their site]]! The title of this chapter is based on one of their techniques, and I'm going to try and draw Red's out and upload it to my site soon so you can get a better picture of what it looks like.

Second, in case it's not quite clear in the story: abra can't be used to teleport others. They can only teleport their trainer, since it requires a full-mind-meld to bring them along.

Third, some amazing readers have made some amazing fan creations! Check out my site for links to some [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon-fan-art/][awesome fan art]] and an [[https://soundcloud.com/user-598992923/pokemon-the-origin-of-species-ch-1-unreliable-predictions][audio play of the first chapter]], which was just delightful and a fantastic surprise for me.

Finally, I wanted to repeat once again that, while I enjoy and appreciate and value guest reviews, remember that fanfiction literally does not allow me to respond to them, so please keep that in mind if you leave reviews that have questions in them but are not signed in :) Additionally, fanfiction will block anything that looks like a website or email address, so if you try to leave those in your reviews, Guest or otherwise, I cannot follow up on them as they will just look like empty spaces in the reviews.

Enjoy, and all feedback welcome, as usual!
