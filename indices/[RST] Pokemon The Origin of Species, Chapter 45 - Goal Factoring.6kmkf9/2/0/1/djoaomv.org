I thought about that, but from Blue's POV it seemed like there's more to it than just "all commands are Ero N in random order for all Pokemon". It makes sense, because this way you can't learn code names (like "Bai"), which code name corresponds to which attack depends on which Pokemon is out. But then what "Ero" means? If it's just a nonsense word, it seems "unfair" narratively. And if that's the code, why not drop "Ero" and just use "1", "2", etc. "Ero one", "Ero two", etc seem a bit too long to say to be optimal. If "Ero" is her analogue of "Ok, Google" to avoid accidental activation, replace numbers with something which serves the same purpose, but is not common words, like numbers in a foreign language or "alpha", "bravo", etc.
