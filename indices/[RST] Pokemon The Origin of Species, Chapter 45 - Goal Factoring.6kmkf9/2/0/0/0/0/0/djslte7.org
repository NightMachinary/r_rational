My thinking was that Aiko doesn't seem as clever as the other characters. Or perhaps she's just more 'child-like' or naive.

Following that logic, Aiko's tactic probably isn't as clever, or strategic as some of the other tactics we've seen. At least in this way.

That may also be why it's harder for Blue to figure out; he's trying to figure it out as though it /doesn't/ have an obvious fault.
