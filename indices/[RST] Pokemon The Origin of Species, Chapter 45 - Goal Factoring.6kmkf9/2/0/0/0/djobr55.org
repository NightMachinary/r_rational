In a similar vein to "disabling/controlling attacks", I was thinking Ero is just short for erode. "Fast" was obviously quick attack. So my guess would be that they're descriptive, but my model wouldn't explain Ero 2. Perhaps Ero stage 2, as in, wait for current status effects and erode the opponent's stamina.

I think determining Ero vs Ero 2 seems like it could cause undue hesitation in fast paced battling evironment.
