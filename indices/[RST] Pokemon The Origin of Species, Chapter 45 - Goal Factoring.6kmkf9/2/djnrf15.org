So nobody's talking about the "ero" mystery. Did everyone figure it out immediately and I'm the only one not getting it?

My best guess is it has something to do with the old pokedex, something like "New Folder" or "Document1", only the pokedex somehow glitched and it's actually "*ERRO*R", "*ERRO*R1", etc. (English is not my first language, but I think you're not supposed to distinguish double letters, so "ero" and "erro" would sound the same).
