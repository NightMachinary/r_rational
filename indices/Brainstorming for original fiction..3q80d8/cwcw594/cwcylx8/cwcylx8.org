I disagree with the "there are multiple presidents". Instead, there're a sudden rush of random people being placed in the position of company president. there are now four or five presidents of the USA. (most people say i wish i were president, not president of the USA. The difference is pretty big.)

This wrecks even more chaos on the stock market, ofc.
