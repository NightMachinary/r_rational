People who say "I wish I was president" generally know which type of "president" they're talking about, and wishing for the title is more explicit than wishing for the power of being president, given that most people who wished for the power of the president would also likely get drastically less than they think they would as well, since the POTUS has nowhere near as much control over things as people think they do.
