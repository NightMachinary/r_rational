I wonder what kind of limits you would impose on this kind of thing?

What if someone wished "I wish I was the only person who could speak" so that they were the only ones to be able to speak. If someone were plausible, and thought it out, then they could rationally conclude that speaking the i wish.

This means that in the background, you'd need to place some kinds of limits on the wish, because some could be extremely dramatic and universe-level altering.
