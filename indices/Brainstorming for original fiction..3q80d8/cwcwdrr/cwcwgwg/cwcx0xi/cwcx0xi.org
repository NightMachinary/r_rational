I estimate I say that phrase at least once a week. That's 126 hours awake, so I had a 1 in 126 chance. That's over five million English speakers, assuming that it has to be that phrase in English.

Of course, there must have been some kind of time delay, or the people who realized would have wished a million things.

Frankly, there would probably have been many people who had wished themselves omnipotence, so game over.
