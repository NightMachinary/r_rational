Well, the bigger issue is that once someone has their wish come true, they'll immediately try a second wish. Other people who see this wish come true will try wishes of their own. So you're not really restricting it down to just "people who said 'I wish ...' within that hour", it rapidly expands to lots and lots of other people. This is true even if you're in the pre-internet era.
