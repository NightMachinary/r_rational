If RR escaped through the primordial prison door, then he essentially just walked out. The people in the loop aren't simulations, they're all real, just destroyed and recreated every month. The gate is built to keep things separate, and the only way it has to get people out is to shuffle souls. But if you can make an actual doorway through to the real world, then walking out means that you appear on the other side of that door. There are then two copies of you as well.
