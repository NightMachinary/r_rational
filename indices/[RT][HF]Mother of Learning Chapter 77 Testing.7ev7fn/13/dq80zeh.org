The staple of magicpunk, airship, here we come!

The primordial theory is beautiful. I guess Z&Z will find themselves studying summoning magic soon, in order to device a spell that can planeshift them out of this dimension using one of the primordial cages as a reference or something. Why summoning? Because it's one field of magic mentioned rather regularily, but not yet seen being practiced by anyone. Well, it's blocked by the SG, but still, my Chekhov Gun senses are tingling.
