Interesting info about familiars being able to shape shift. Possible RR is Zach's familiar gone rogue. RR was described as freakishly strong I think, which this could explain. Soul bond between them might help with marker transmission/alteration. Would need to be a smart creature, but surely lots of those about. Perhaps a dragon?

Also not clear how SG would deal with soul bonded controller; its not possible to preserve controller's soul but reset that of bonded soul.
