  My theory that Zorian makes a giant floating castle to explore the world with at the end of the story has been confirmed! Airships for the win!

He's been able to have a giant floating castle for a while now. Just attach a floating spell to the orb, and he's set.

Well, he can't actually access said castle when it's floating, and when he can access it it's invisible, but it still fits the criteria.
