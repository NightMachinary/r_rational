We were told that they are multidimensional beings. The idea doesn't seem that weird to me. I think you're assuming the Primordial is like inside some space inside his prison, but I don't know that we need to assume that. If it isn't. If it's more like it's sealed just outside the universe, there's no reason the plug shouldn't extend "inside" of it.
