I think it's just the opposite - they could be trapped in any primordial /but/ the one beneath Cyoria. Having an exit to the prison inside himself wouldn't make any physical sense - though I suppose it would explain why the universe resets when he's summoned.

More likely, in my opinion, is that a bridge to every primordial but the one that holds them is created. The link to that primordial is possibly the Sovereign Gate, acting as a sort of entrance built into the primordial's mutilated body.

As for Silverlake, I suspect she would have to do something that mimics a primordial's prison, such that the loop mistakes her dimension for one as well and skips over destroying it. The problem is that won't be part of the original blueprint - so she'll either need to bridge the gap back herself, or more likely get Zach and Zorian to do it.
