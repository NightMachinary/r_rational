Time to talk about my pet theory. I think red robes may have help optimize the assault on the primordial prisons because he needed them to succeed in breaking the primordial out so he could escape the loop.

It seems that red robes put a lot of resources for a ton of loops into making the invasion go down perfectly. Maybe he just really wanted to help them out or thought it was funny or something, but especially with what we learn this chapter and the reaction when they mentioned breaking one out. I think it's much more likely that he needed to.
