To be fair, RR was specifically trying /not/ to kill Zorian, since he needed to interrogate him. As a necromancer, that's probably one of the most difficult situations to show your abilities in.\\
Also, the only real weakness we saw is that his mental defenses are shoddy. Admittedly, that would be enough for Zorian to blast him - but it doesn't mean he's not a powerful mage.
