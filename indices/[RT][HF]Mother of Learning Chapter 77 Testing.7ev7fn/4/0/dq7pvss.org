The beneficial thing about that, if Z&Z can confirm it, is that RR will be immediately outside the prison door. The whole of the time loop only takes a short amount of time in the real world. Seconds, likely. So RR wouldn't have time to go anywhere, and he won't be expecting Z&Z. So when they exit the time loop, presuming Zorian is combat ready upon leaving, they can teleport to the Hole and take out RR. Or Zach could do it alone, because he's probably the best combat mage alive, and RR can't compensate.
