It seems to me that tricking a clearly not terribly savvy Guardian program into thinking your marker is the controller one before the controller has left would be easier than breaking out of the Gate, like through a will-kill-you-in-150-million-ways-primordial prison, by boring through the dimensional border, or some other way, considering that Gate is supposed to keep the world with all it's mages and their crazy experiments locked up for a month without them noticing. Only reason Silverlake, who is a professional in the field, noticed was by going to a very specific location and casting very specific spells, implying that simulation is pretty damn sturdy.
