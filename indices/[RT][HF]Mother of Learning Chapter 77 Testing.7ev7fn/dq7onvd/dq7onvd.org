My theory that Zorian makes a giant floating castle to explore the world with at the end of the story has been confirmed! Airships for the win!

Also: the primordial thing sounds scary but honestly it doesn't really affect anything except they might be able to escape through the changing primordial's prison. The SG has been used before and been in use for centuries at a time, there's no reason to worry if they don't actively try to talk to it..... oh fuck that's how they're going to get out, isn't it?
