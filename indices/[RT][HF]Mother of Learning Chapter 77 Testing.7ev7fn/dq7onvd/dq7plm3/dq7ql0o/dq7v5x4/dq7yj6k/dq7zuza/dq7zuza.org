As you can see above, mind-shattering is paraphrasing the way the author described the primordial. It can induce madness and insanity upon individuals therefore it can shatter minds ergo mind-shattering. I never implied that the geometries the entity existed in were the cause of the madness or insanity.

Also, if you want to be pedantic, I never said it broke geometry. I just said it used non-conventional geometries. Nothing about it being non-conventional equates to it breaking geometry. Even within conventional geometries there are objects and surfaces that fold in on themselves (e.g. Klein bottles).

Secondly, you act as if using associations to other similar entities is a bad thing. It is both natural and normal for authors to use allusions to other constructs in literature to convey feeling and tone. This is an obvious allusion to Cthulhu and other cosmic entities. While not all of the cosmic entities are non-conventional, most of them do follow non-conventional geometries.

Also if you note what I wrote, I used the word expect, which implies using context and clues to extrapolate a data point which you might not know. In this case, I asked if you expected it to follow conventional geometries. So, using meta-knowledge of the author's allusion and information from the text ("[...] Golden-Feathered Worm was very dimensionally[sic] complex [...]"), it is normal to assume that it will not follow conventional geometries.
