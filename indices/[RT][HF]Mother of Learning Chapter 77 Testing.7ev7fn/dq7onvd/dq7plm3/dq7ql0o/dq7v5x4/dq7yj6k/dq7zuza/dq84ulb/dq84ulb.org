It's not a bad thing, it's just not a good thing. It's an entirely neutral thing. I'm not saying it's necessarily wrong, just that I'm approaching the problem from a different point.

Also, we're referring to the primordial beneath Cyoria, not the Golden-Feathered Worm. If we're talking about allusions from the text, specifying dimensional complexity and the Golden-Feathered Worm makes it sound like a unique trait. Actually, it sounds rather like a prime candidate for the Sovereign Gate.

Though of course, it's possible and perhaps even likely that all primordials are dimensionally complex.
