Huh. So if a primordial is enough to contain all that, makes you wonder what the source of the primordial (one of the dragons) could contain.

Probably enough room in one of those bad boys for a universe, with some extra space to fit in a spiritual plane and maybe even a few fancy pocket dimension/prisons. After all, just using of the dragons to make a planet seems kind of small potatoes now.
