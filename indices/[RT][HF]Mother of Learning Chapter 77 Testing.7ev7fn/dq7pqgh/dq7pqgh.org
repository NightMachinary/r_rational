Second bonus theory. They aren't in just any primordial. They're inside the one trapped at Cyoria. Think about it. We know there aren't huge number of them so it was already decently likely. Add to that that Silverlake is quite right that the easiest and simplest thing would be just not to copy any of the prisons. So why did they? Maybe it's not so much another angle on the prison as the other side of it.

There are a decent number of flaws with this. The biggest being why can the primordial be broken out then, but I still think it's a worthwhile theory
