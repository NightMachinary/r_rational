It's not too crazy to assume the primordial has a connection to outside from inside its body, a "mouth" if you will, the current "outside" being inside the prison. It enters the paradox territory when you consider that this way the "mouth" location on the inside the primordial matches the location of the prison entrance two dimensions out.
