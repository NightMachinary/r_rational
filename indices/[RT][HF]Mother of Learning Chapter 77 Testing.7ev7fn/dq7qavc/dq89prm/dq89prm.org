I think they said, in a chapter, that trade would be beneficial since it would be easier for the other person to give and teach him their secrets voluntarily instead of forcing the secret out of their minds. Besides all tradeable items also reset.

Reminds me of a scene where a super-powerful villain buys his groceries with real money since it would be easier and less time-consuming than stealing anything he wanted and having to deal with the pathetic attempts of the police to stop him.
