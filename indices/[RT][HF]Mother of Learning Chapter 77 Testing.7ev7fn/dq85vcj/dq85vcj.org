*Soap Bubbles*

I'm beginning to think that the "primordial prisons" aren't really pocket dimensions containing primordials, but rather the primordials themselves. The primordials that previously roamed the world were just physical projections of pocket dimensions--say, a soap bubble within a soap bubble. Banishing the primordials was the equivalent of pushing the interior soap bubble to the exterior--which is possible because the bubbles share a common film (i.e., the primordials are the spawn of the world dragon). This is what made the primordials impossible to defeat. Popping a sub-bubble risks popping the larger one; destroying a primordial could compromise the world dragon. Very interesting.

*Sovereign Gate Theory*

I would like to conjecture a little on the nature of the Sovereign Gate--namely, why it was inactive for all those years. I don't think that the SG is a single primordial, but rather a tool that taps into them. If the SG is near a primordial during the planetary alignment, it taps into that primordial to simulate the world for the controller. The SG functioned normally when it was located in the Xlotic--the former seat of the Ikosian empire--because it was kept near the Golden-Feathered Worm. It's been inactive for the past few cycles because the Ikosians /left/ the Xlotic, and the imperial family / Novedas were unaware that this would affect the SG's function. Luckily, before the current cycle, Zach's guardian donated the SG to the time magic research facility--which just so happens to be located next to Panaxeth's prison, triggering the time loop. To explain it in metaphor: rather than a full computer running the simulation, the SG is more like an OS for the simulation that runs from a USB drive. It was pulled out of one computer (the Xlotic primordial) when the Ikosians migrated. Zach's guardian accidentally plugged it into a new one (Panaxeth).
