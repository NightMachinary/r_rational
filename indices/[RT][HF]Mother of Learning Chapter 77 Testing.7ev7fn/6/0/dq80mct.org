I see several problems:

- If QI is setting up an invasion regardless, why assume that he's aware that the loop has actually begun? What differences would we observe? Actually, I would argue that his observed behavior suggests he /doesn't/ know about the loop, or he would have dealt with Zach differently (eg capturing and studying instead of simply assaulting his soul).
- If they were inside the primordial's prison, it would kill them all. And Zorian has seen the primordial breaking out of its prison into the loop world.
