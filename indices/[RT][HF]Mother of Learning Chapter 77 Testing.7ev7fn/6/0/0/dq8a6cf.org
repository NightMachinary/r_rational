I was thinking that he would be setting up an invasion in anticipation of the gate being used because he had prior knowledge of the gate; only going through with the plan after confirming being in the loop.

After sleeping on it I have to admit this doesn't seem very likely, although i do think it's awfully convenient that the invasion coincides with the loop. Either the loop was started because of the invasion or the invasion is started because they are in the loop, which is plausible if QI can detect whether they are in a loop or not and if he can either mobilise the invasion within a month or if he was already preparing the invasion and just needs to say the word go.

Wild theory #3: QI is aware of the sovereign gate and assumes the loop will start a month later as it was supposed to. To this end he endeavours to release a primordial in order to end the loop on day one, sabotaging the loop and preventing people from gaining ridiculous amounts of power. If i remember correctly QI is the oldest named entity im the story barring gods and primordials, if anyone would have prior knowledge of the gate surely it'd be him
