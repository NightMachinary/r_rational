It's not that much of a coincidence, the releasing of the primordial needs to be done during the planar alignment (just like the start of the soverign gate). Don't forget the whole reason the invasion is occurring now and at cyoria is to unleash a primordial on their enemies.

We also don't know how long is been since the soverign gate was last used. For all we know it could be tens of thousands of years ago, long before the gods fell silent. Qual may have heard of the myth but just because he's a 1000 years old doesn't mean he knows what's true and what's false and how everything works
