Wild theory #4: the Gate is an anti-Primordial defence mechanism. We already know it can do insane time acceleration, so it isn't a stretch at all to think that it can keep a separate simulation of the world without a Controller in it. If a Primordial is ever released in that world, the Gate waits until a month before it would happen in the real world and then activates, pulling in a member of the Noveda house so they can gain the foreknowledge and expertise necessary to stop the prison break.
