Theory: QI, being as old as he is, is aware of the Sovereign Gate and upon approaching the period when the gate can be opened sets up the groundwork for an invasion. Upon discovering that he is in the loop (through similar techniques to Silverlake) he starts the invasion in order to use the primordial as a bridge and get to the real universe. Assuming this is true, it's plausible that, what with RR helping the invasion and ZZ being absent in various restarts, that QI has succeeded in this many times and that on the other side of the prison there is an army of QI/RR clones waiting.

Bonus theory: the primordial they are inside is the one imprisoned beneath the city. The prison door looks the same but from another perspective, perhaps this is because they're inside the prison looking at the other side of the door. Silverlake remarks that there are no guards, because the Sovereign Gate can't create them, or because the guards are on the other side of the door?
