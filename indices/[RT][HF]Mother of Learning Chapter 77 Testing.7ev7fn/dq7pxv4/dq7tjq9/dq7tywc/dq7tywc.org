No, when Zack and Zorian don't interfere the primordial is freed. Even when Zorian triggered the summoning two weeks early the primordial was freed, instigating an early termination of the loop. The primordial summoning definitely succeeds at least to the degree that reality is broken without intervention from either Zack or Zorian. Red Robes just makes the invasion much more effective in terms of strategy and destructive power.
