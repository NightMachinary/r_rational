I presume you are speaking of the ninth paragraph from the end at chapter 52?

  "Something huge and dark brown like a hand studded with mouths and eyes, shot out of the rip in space, but Zorian didn't have time to study it much. Without any prompting from him, the marker on his soul suddenly activated and everything went black."

So yeah I admit a hand broke out of the prison, but that didn't mean the whole body would be able to. Even if the you're right and a full summoning could be completed without waiting for the planar alignment, there are several things that wouldn't make sense and explanations that could shed light on the cult's actions.

Why wait for the day of the planar alignment if it wasn't important? There were literally centuries of other days a primordial could be summoned.

It is possible that the energy required to summon the primordial was lessened due to the fact that the time loop is taking place inside the primordial itself, therefore reducing the energy requirement below the estimated threshold.

It is also possible that the Cult of the Dragon Below has the best shot at controlling the primordial with their own magics at the height of the planar alignment when magic is at it's strongest.
