The orb has the power to store memories in the time loop. It doesn't have that power outside of the time loop. Zack and Zorian learned how to use it from the guardian. While it's possible that RR deciphered how to expel people from the time loop using an imperial artifacts ability without contacting the guardian at all, it is unlikely he did so when such a resource was already at his disposal, since he must have known about it. I've re-read all of his scenes ten or twelve times and meticulous research doesn't seem to be a likely personality trait from him. Besides that, we don't actually know how much longer he was in the loop before Zorian. Based on his combat ability it likely wasn't the full thirty years. He got wounded by academy students after all.
