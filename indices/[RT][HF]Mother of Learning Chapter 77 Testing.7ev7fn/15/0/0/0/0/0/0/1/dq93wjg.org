  If anything, Red Robes would want to delay the summoning as long as possible while in the time loop.

Unless RR wants to hijack the summoning to make a bridge back to the real world.

Zorian noticed that RR's involvement seemed to be "turn up and provide a bunch of info to the invaders at the start, then mostly disappear". That could easily be him just setting up his exit every time in case he needs it, not unlike how ZZ set up a bunch of things every month.
