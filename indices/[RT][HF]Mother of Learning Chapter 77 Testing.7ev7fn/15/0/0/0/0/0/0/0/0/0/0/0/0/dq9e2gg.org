The guardian could very easily destroy him permanently, or at least disable whatever mechanism he was using to stay in the loop. Caution would be paramount, and he'd likely needed to milk the guardian for information like Zack and Zorian did. All of that would take multiple attempts. RR probably visited the guardian hundreds of times planning and preparing. At least five to figure out how to use the powers of each of the Emperors artifacts.
