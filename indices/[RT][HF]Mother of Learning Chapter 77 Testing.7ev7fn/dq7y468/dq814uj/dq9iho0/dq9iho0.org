Silverlake is consistently shrewd, suspicious, greedy, and unfriendly. Only time she's been somewhat nice is when she says that she'd teach Kana. Even in the last chapter she attacked them, when she KNEW that they are powerful enough to have brought down a grey hunter. She seems to be in the mindset of attack now, ask questions later. Even after getting smacked down last chapter, she's still willing to spy on them overtly and get her contacts to spy on them when her own efforts failed.

They'll have to fight Silverlake eventually, if only to beat her down. She's too greedy to make a good capitalist. You know you gotta at least promise trickle down.
