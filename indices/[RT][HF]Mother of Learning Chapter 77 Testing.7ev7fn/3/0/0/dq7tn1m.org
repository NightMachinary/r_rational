I doubt this is it. I think Zorian would have no problem with stealing knowledge if it were contained in a private book someone owned. I think it's more that he doesn't want to attack Innocents and sift through their minds. As he feels like doing that would be crossing a boundary. If I remember correctly it's discussed in/following the chapter that Xvim originally proposes the idea.
