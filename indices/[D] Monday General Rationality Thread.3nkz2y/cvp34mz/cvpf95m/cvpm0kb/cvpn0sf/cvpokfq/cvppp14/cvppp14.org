  imagine you're a programmer who wants to ... but doesn't want it to only work in this one program

As a programmer, unless I have a strongly compelling reason to want to support more than one proprietary application for this very specific use case (besides for fun and/or just to show I can) then wanting to generalize is effectively wasting your time. I've done this before myself, so I understand the instinct greatly. But efficient use of your time will very often lead you to adding more specialized tools onto an already specialized one, rather than making generic tools that will work with any program, since the latter, if even possible, is highly likely to be several orders of magnitude more complex to create.
