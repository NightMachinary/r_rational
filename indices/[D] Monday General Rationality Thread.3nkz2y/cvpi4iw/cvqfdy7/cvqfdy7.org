General memory improvement has already been discussed [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/lat/memory_improvement_mnemonics_tools_or_books_on/][here]].

For your particular case, no good object-level memory hacks occur to me (maybe write things down? Have your phone always recording audio so you can go back and reference it? Method of loci) I will comment, however, that the more I've learned about human memory, the more forgiving I am about the errors it makes, both in other and myself.
