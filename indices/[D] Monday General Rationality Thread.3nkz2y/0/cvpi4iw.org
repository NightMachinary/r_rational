*How can I improve the availability of my recall?*

I am often frustrated with my memory ability.

Some scenarios: I had a job interview on Friday, and my roommate asked me the next day how it went. I was able to give a general impression, but I had trouble repeating very many specific questions my interviewers had asked. Or: My sister's wedding is coming up, and I would like to include some funny stories from our childhood in my toast. But after ruminating, no specific such stories spring to mind, only the vague sense that there have been lots.

But on further reflection, it's not exactly a memory problem.

If my roommate were to ask, “Well, did they ask you about ---------?”, I immediately would know the answer, and indeed if he had prepared me a whole quiz in the form of a list of sentences, some of which were spoken during the interview and some of which weren't, I'd have no trouble identifying which were which. And when I asked my godmother for help on the wedding speech, she suggested, “What about the time when ---------?” and I immediately recalled the full details of the incident in question, and could pick up the story from the half-sentence she'd spoken so far.

So the information I want is in my head, somewhere. It's just not available (in the “availability heuristic” sense of the word “available”) if I specify too general of a query.

There are lots of stories involving my sister and me that I could tell you if you asked the question in such a way as to remind me of them, but just the generic search “funny stories involving my sister” turns up none of them. When my godmother asked me about that particular day, my internal sensation was not, “Oh, I'd forgotten about that until you mentioned it just now”; it was, “Duh, of course! Why didn't I think of that until you mentioned it?!"

Are there strategies to improve my recall to general queries? If not, are there strategies for me to self-generate more specific queries when needed?
