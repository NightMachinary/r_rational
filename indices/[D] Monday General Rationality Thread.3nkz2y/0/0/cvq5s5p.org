Well there's Bacopa Monneiri, check examine.com for details on that.

I've found it helps with recall but at the cost/benefit of making me more prone to daydreaming and reduces anxiety (which is not so good when you don't have enough to start with like me.)

My daydreams are more vivid when I'm on it, and my sleep is a little disrupted, but my recall is definitely better.

In terms of cognitive strategy, try:

1. Keeping a diary of interesting stuff that happens to you, occasionally reviewing it. If you're a big fan of story telling like me this comes naturally, since I love telling stories and this helps me recall their details better.

2. Using space repetition software like Anki to remember random facts you often forget. I have friend's birthdays, cool ideas I've had, etc. in my "personal wisdom" deck.
