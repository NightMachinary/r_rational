I sometimes feel like I have the same problem, and so I've been trying a couple things: first, like you mention if someone asks me specific questions I can then usually remember, so I try to create my own trigger words for any events worth remembering, and then the first thing I do is just recall the trigger word to get me started. More generally, whenever I'm finishing the work day, I try to recap it and the same for real life when I go to bed.

Seems to work okay, but of course it could just be because of the additional effort in putting into it.
