Is it really strongly types if it's at the framework level? I presume you're building more complicated types out of some (strongly typed) basic types, but really whether they remain strongly typed depends on the clients language, no?

You'll have to excuse my, I dropped out of highschool so my actual computer science might be a bit weak.

Not entirely sure what you mean by a "strongly typed function". A function written in a strongly typed language?

  to use and graphical terminals could add nice interaction widgets depending on types (calendars for dates, etc...)

Xonsh is nice to play with. It's python frankensteined onto bash, so you get bash with python types. Is lots of fun, doesn't have widgets like you describe but it could.
