There's no particular reason you couldn't run this, and this-enabled apps along side traditional stuff. Just like a bunch of apps have their own sqlite database for storing stuff.

It doesn't have to run at the kernel level, so it can be just another database service.

Don't target windows users, target people who like cool technology.

So that's the hacker/programmer contingent. Rethinkdb is doing a bunch of similar stuff with their change feeds, this is like that to the extreme.

One of the big advantages to this approach would be that it would make creating collaborative software much easier. Coupled with a /good/ scene graph, it would be an excellent platform for emerging vr/ar stuff.

Other then that, it could be a great platform for creating collaborative web apps like google docs.

In short, it's just another service, like dbus or postgres.
