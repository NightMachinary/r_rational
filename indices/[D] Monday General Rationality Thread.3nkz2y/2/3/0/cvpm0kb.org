  to handle merge issues
#+end_quote

The idea is that by keeping data-structures up to date, you minimize merge conflicts. Where there are merge conflicts, they should mostly be due to simultaneous user edits, which is up to the user to resolve.

It's important to note that it's /not/ a flat file, where you have to merge things. It's a data structure. Instead of merge issues, you get collisions or race conditions when two clients/users edit something at the same time.
