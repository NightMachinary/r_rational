That's more an issue of how the culture and design principles though. Look at cli tools, which work on data structures instead of being plugins for programs.

Program interoperability like that is just second nature in the world of shell scripts and pipes. Why not try for that elsewhere? If that datatypes are consistent it shouldn't even be hard, just write code that deals with data instead of dealing with a plugin api.
