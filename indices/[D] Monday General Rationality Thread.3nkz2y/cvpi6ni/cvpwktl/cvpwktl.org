I've bounced between a diagnosis of sociopathy and high functioning autistic depending on psychologist and likely time period I was visiting with them. (Sociopathy around 6th grade, autism in college were the answers given).

I'd lean towards Autism myself as my "morality" centers on functionality rather than anything else, but I can see how a sociopath with only minimal external desires could be living the same life I currently am. Having no moral issues with employing any tactic to get what you want is hardly relevant when nothing you want has a morally objectionable method of obtaining.

Well. Asides from occasionally torrenting, but I'd imagine that's hardly applicable.
