Yes, I have.

He was charming and smooth and very likeable. He lied fluidly and without effort. Examples:

"Tell $important_person that I can't make the meeting because I'm sick." He had forgotten about the meeting.

"If my girlfriend calls, you and I were riding bikes today." I assume he was cheating on her again. He was amazed when I said I wouldn't lie for him -- it was as though this were an unimaginable concept, that lying would be something to avoid.

He didn't show up for work one day. When I finally called him to see if he was okay, it turned out that he'd gone on a junket to a nearby vacation spot...oh, but it was business-related, really! It was a gathering of ad execs and he was going to be doing a 5-minute presentation to them! And spending two days there, but hey.

He lied about things that were easily verified, which I thought was weird.

On the phone, I asked him to hold off on doing $X until tomorrow and he agreed. We hung up, I walked across the room to my desk, and he had already done $X.

He cheated on his girlfriend at least twice that I'm aware of. He was living with her at the time, so when she threw him out it was a problem, so you'd think that enlightened self-interest would have been enough to keep him from cheating even if integrity wasn't. Nope; I don't think it occurred to him that he might get caught. Somehow, he managed to talk his way back into her house and her bed each time she threw him out.

He stalled off things he didn't want to do for literally weeks or months by "forgetting", and would get angry when called on it.

He would get his way through relentless pushing -- it wasn't possible to come to a compromise or make an agreement about something that wasn't the way he wanted. He'd make the agreement, then just raise the issue again the next day and keep after it until he got exactly what he wanted.

He freely mixed intimidation with smooth charm to get his way.

The list goes on and on. Co-founding with him was a miserable experience.
