It sounds textbook to me.

The defining trait of sociopaths is a lack of empathy / concern for others. Lacking empathy makes it much easier to kill people, so if you have serial killer tendencies then it's more likely you'll act on them. On the other hand, lack of empathy doesn't immediately link to a desire to kill people simply for the pleasure of killing.
