Sociopathy doesn't cause people to become serial killers; it allows people to act on serial-killing-tendencies that the non-sociopathic state would lead them to suppress.

Regular old non-serial-killer sociopaths are frankly a lot scarier to me; I'm pretty sure they form a majority of the elite class, because they constantly see ways to get ahead in life that normal people would reject. Sociopathy is just morality being bred out of humanity.
