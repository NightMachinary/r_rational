Remember that this is a conversation on the Internet, so who's going to tell anyone that he knows in real life that [[/u/ToaKraka]] is a sociopath?

In addition, I'd trust a sociopath from this community to act out of enlightened self-interest since sociopathy only impairs empathy and understanding of emotions, not rational thinking. I mean, they will have different goals from what we're reaching for, but they'll be just as capable of using the same tools and mental thinking as we use to reach their goals. Which all means that I'd expect [[/u/ToaKraka]] to at least behave politely for continued mutual interesting discussions.

Also sociopaths only care about looking good in front of other people if they can gain some sort of benefit from looking good as a means to an end, not as a terminal goal. Otherwise if he's online and he can't benefit from appearing as a saint, then I would expect a sociopath to mention it for the slightest gain such as a joke, having an interesting conversation, or to even just see how other people would reaction to the admission.

Oh looks like [[/u/ToaKraka]] just mentioned his reason is for interesting conversation.
