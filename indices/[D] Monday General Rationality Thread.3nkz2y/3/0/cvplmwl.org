Yes.

It's an insanely aggravating story and while I'm grateful to have the skill to handle any sociopaths I may meet in the future, I wish I never met the guy and I am thankful that he's gone without causing too much trouble.

Let me just say the guy was a brilliant actor who put up like four different facades to four (I think) different women at the same time over a span of years. It finally came crashing down when one of them found out about the other women and started accusing them of stealing him away from her and her daughter.

The other women started realizing he was a rather toxic relationship and tossed him out of their lives and one even had a police escort to watch over him moving his stuff out. At least one women went to therapy for a while and is much more positive now.

He was concluded to be a narcissist due to how often he only showed up and did activities with the women when it directly centered on himself. The sociopathy was deduced based on how he would act apologetic for hurting someone's feelings and quickly move on without a shred of regretfulness. It was almost bipolar how quickly his emotions would change. He was often described as having multiple personalities and a lot of clutter left behind was found such as having several different dishes and other supplies for multiple households. He even left presents from his daughter behind.

One women even said, "Who the hell was this guy? I don't know anything about him!"

The defining hallmarks is the ability to show a lot of different faces to different people. So you won't necessarily notice anything unusual until you get the chance to meet the sociopath in a dramatically different place/occasion from when they normally meet you. They will also be very controlling about everything. For example, this guy had a job in construction and engineering, so he could control when he wanted to drop by and whenever someone wanted to reach him, they only could get to him through his cell and he'd never respond until /he/ choose to text back. He wanted control over how people perceived who he was. In addition, he never spent more than a few days in company with anyone. I think he would reach a point where he couldn't maintain the facade any longer and needed to be alone.

I noticed that he had a very strong 'moral' code, but I think it was mostly rules he followed to ensure that he stayed out of jail and fit into society. For example, he never hit a woman for the public image of being chivalrous, and he never told a lie (or never was definitively caught in one) to seem trustworthy.

If you want to get a sociopath out of your life, get help from other people for the support. Give very clear demands on what you want them to leave with and if at all possible, get police help. Don't give into even the most simple change to your demands. When dealing with sociopaths, the saying "Give an inch, and they'll take a mile." is very true.

If you are in severe trouble and don't know how to deal with a sociopath, I recommend talking to a therapist/psychologist. One of the women got very good advice from her therapist on how to get rid of the sociopathic boyfriend and it worked to get him to leave without causing trouble.

If I sounded very angry or disgusted about sociopaths, it's because I have very good reasons to feel angry at people who would have ruined other lives without a second thought for even the slightest benefit for themselves.
