Sociopathy. Mostly characterized as a distinct lack of empathy or moral founding Portrayed in popular media mostly through serial killers, the crazier the better. Here's my question/discussion point. Have you ever met a real sociopath? Someone who exhibited what seemed to be sociopathic traits? I know the media would have us think all sociopaths are psycho serial killers, but that isn't so.

So please, if you will, regale me of your findings on sociopathy, whether you've researched it, watched tons of fiction, or, preferably, are (or have met) real life socio/psychopaths. :)
