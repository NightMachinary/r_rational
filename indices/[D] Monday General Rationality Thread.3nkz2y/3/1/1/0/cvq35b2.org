(shrugs) I don't see it as a reputational hit at all. What could be better than favorable comparisons to some of my most-admired fictional characters (Sasori, Orochimaru, Yagami Light, etc.)?

In any event, I've discontinued the program of "friendship" described in that linked image (I only intermittently found it particularly fulfilling), so nearly all my social interactions occur on this site--and, as I've said elsewhere, I'm thoroughly unoriginal (note how few text submissions I've made), so this is as good a topic of discussion as any.
