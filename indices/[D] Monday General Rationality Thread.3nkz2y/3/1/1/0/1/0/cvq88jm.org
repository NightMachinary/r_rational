I recognize that these people had flaws--but I still admire them. Sure, Light was overdramatic and impatient--but he was also extremely charismatic and an expert manipulator, and his sincere conviction in his righteousness puts tears in my eyes. Sure, Orochimaru was petty and impatient--but he at least had the /idea/ of pursuing infinite knowledge and lifespan, and the ability to carry out his plans. Sure... actually, I can't think of any personality flaws for Sasori, other than whatever drew him to join and remain with Akatsuki, rather than striking out on his own.

If you insist on having some non-villainous targets of admiration, try Hermione Granger, Dagny Taggart, and (though I haven't seen /Code Geass R2/) Lelouch vi Britannia. <melodrama>The drive--the determination--the conviction--!</melodrama>
