I'm annoyed by his actions, not out of affection for my mother, but because I find the results of his actions disgustingly /wasteful./

The recurring example is that he buys too many fruits (despite my mother's admonishments), so that everyone else is forced to eat them quickly before they spoil. This is annoying not only because I personally am pestered to eat lots of bananas (which I don't particularly like), but also because I hate to see all those bananas thrown into the trash.

More simply: If communicating hardly takes any effort, and it drastically decreases tension in the home, why doesn't he bother to do it? It annoys me.
