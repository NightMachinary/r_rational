If you're referring to "I haven't yet met anyone for whom I've felt much real affection", I can't say I really /like/ any of them. The closest I can come is that I definitely appreciate my father's sense of humor--but, on the other hand, I can't say I like him /overall,/ since (for example) he seems to be extremely remiss in communicating with my mother.

(Remember, gratefulness for services rendered and affection for personality traits are separate emotions.)
