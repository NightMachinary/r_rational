  However, "I constantly fantasize about having people under my (totally undeserved) control" sounds extremely sociopathic. But when you look at the link, it seems like the fantasy is actually to get your own specialized fanfiction, which I gather is your obsession.

I referred only to fanfiction because the question of that [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]] thread specifically asked for scenarios that /didn't/ "involve sex or getting rich". Without those limitations, those items would have been added to my response--I would've talked about "absolute control over dozens of /people",/ rather than just "writers". See also [[https://www.literotica.com/s/dont-you-want-me][this short story]] (not mine).

I won't dispute the other points, though.
