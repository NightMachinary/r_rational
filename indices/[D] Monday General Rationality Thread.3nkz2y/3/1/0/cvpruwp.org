  It's been suggested that I myself am sociopathic,  but I'm not all that inclined to believe those anons--not least because I'm absolutely terrible at lying, due to an utter lack of originality.

If you're only terrible at lying because you can't think of an alternative scenario that explains what the other person already knows, then that has no bearing on you being a sociopath.

I'm a bad liar, not because I can't think of an alternative explanation (for most scenarios, I can; seeking alternative explanations is basically how I organize my thoughts), but instead, it's because my body, against my will, reacts to my guilt (Ironically, the same reactions also happen if someone /thinks/ I'm lying, which I guess technically makes me a great liar, as long as people know that about me).

That being said, you're probably a high-functioning autistic. A sociopath would have picked up on the (honestly, pretty obvious) implications of the other posters. For example: a sociopath would never have assumed that non-verbal meant emoticons.

You also don't seem to be very arrogant, and under-react when your character is being attacked, the opposite of a sociopath. You're ambivalent towards things that matter to most people (like family and friends), but care about things that most people don't even bother to think about (like a singular "they"). It practically screams autism.

However, "I constantly fantasize about having people under my (totally undeserved) control" sounds extremely sociopathic. But when you look at the link, it seems like the fantasy is actually to get your own specialized fanfiction, which I gather is your obsession. I'd guess that if you could control, say, a general AI to get that same fanfiction, you would.
