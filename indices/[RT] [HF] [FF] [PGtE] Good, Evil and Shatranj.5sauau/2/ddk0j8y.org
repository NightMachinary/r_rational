Alright. New top-level comment for general feedback. This is pretty stream-of-consciousness stuff.

Contractions in the narrative. Some people will tell you that's a never-do, that it belongs only in dialogue. Tense shifts. Everything after:

#+begin_quote
  Not that he needed it. is present tense. Purposeful? It's interesting, anyway. Passive voice. All over the place. Rocky constructions such as: Pawns were taken by Rooks and the first sentence of the entire piece, Good was sitting.
#+end_quote

Directly addressing the reader -

#+begin_quote
  You see, when Good wrote the rulebook
#+end_quote

Your dialogue is clunky in general. Jumping all over the place time-wise and not identifying whose talking where. People talking inbetween paragraphs of their own actions. Structurally, you have a few missing periods and basic proof errors. There are long periods of back and forth with no identifying the speaker, rapid-fire... again, it's a stylistic choice. It's a purposeful thing, or at least it should be. It's very tough to make a new scene start with dialogue that flits back and forth like that. Give the reader an anchor.

Like an anchor, the reader needs a hook. Your opening's gotta grab 'em. This is not easy. But neither should it be abandoned whole sale. Bizarre and interesting is better than boring.

#+begin_quote
  Good was sitting at a table.
#+end_quote

This isn't boring. It's just not interesting, either.

The passive voice and describing with -ing words are sometimes touted as hallmarks of inexperienced writing. Some people will tell you to cut as much of it out as possible. They're not a cardinal sin. Nothing in English is. Later, you start a sentence with and...

#+begin_quote
  And then there is no reason to adjust it after that first push.
#+end_quote

Which some will also tell you never to do.

You have a couple sentence fragments.

#+begin_quote
  It didn't. Well, not quite.
#+end_quote

Again, you can write in fragments if you want. They can be excellent, emphatic punctuation on a scene. But these sentences can also jar when they come together too often.

The thing about writing is, you can do anything you want. You can be e.e. cummings and never write with a capital letter. Cormac McCarthy, and say fuck you to apostrophes, quotation marks, and proper structure in general. /Blood Meridian/ is my favourite novel and it's a fucking chore to read some of McCarthy's paragraphs. Others are transcendent.

It's a general rule of thumb that before you go breaking the rules - or rather, conventions - you learn them. If you know /why/ you're breaking a "rule" then go for it.

If you want to be a good writer there are only two things you need to do. Read a lot and write a lot. And not just derivative fiction. There's so many fantastic authors out there, even just in English.

In general I think, more and more these days, that fanfiction is a waste of time. Reading it is empty calories and easy dopamine. Like porn, or junk food, or Jerry Springer or daytime TV. Not terrible. Not a vice, per se, but it can fill your time without really giving anything back for it. Writing it, on the other hand, ingrains bad habits and lets one put the shutters over their own imagination in order to use someone else's sandbox as a shortcut.

Feel free to disregard everything I've written here. I'm not your typical [[/r/rational]] commenter, I think. I come from a different perspective than the norm in this sub. I care more for the edifice of a story, the narrative, the emotions a piece evokes in a reader and less about whether characters are acting "rationally" or the balance of a conflict, or if the twist is realllly interesting and clever. Few things bother me more than soapbox fiction, and I find a lot of things here have a story that comes secondary, written only to suit a message. That can be done well. Most things can. Often it's done clumsily, however. The Venn diagram of good web fiction and rational web fiction has a great deal of overlap, however, which is why I'm subscribed here.

Just keep practicing. Finish things. Edit them, but don't bog yourself down. The twenty-fifth edit might ruin something amazing you had in the tenth... but the first draft is never the best one, to shameless steal something someone more smart than I once said. Think about why you're writing what you're writing. It's a skill like any other: it just takes practice. Practice with intent, with a focus on improvement, with an eye towards your own flaws. And putting in the hours. Always putting in the hours.
