Thanks for your feedback.

#+begin_quote
  Your dialogue is clunky in general.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's an issue. No idea how to solve it aside from just writing a whole lot, though.

#+begin_quote
  Jumping all over the place time-wise and not identifying whose talking where.
#+end_quote

I tried to identify speakers through their mannerisms, with Evil using lots of "mmm"-s, as well as through various connections based on what each side would be saying. For example,

#+begin_quote
  "Huh, my crusade got turned away."
#+end_quote

Implies the speaker was the one with the crusade, which are a Good thing, which implies the speaker is Good. Likewise, I tried to connect two paragraphs by saying "Good moved his Prince forwards" in one of them, setting up the side on which Prince is, and then using Prince to identify the speaker in the next paragraph, and other similar things.

#+begin_quote
  This isn't boring. It's just not interesting, either.
#+end_quote

Aw. I thought first two paragraphs were the funniest part-contrasting something mundane like sitting at a table, reading books with something not-mundane, like not being human. I guess that didn't translate well.

#+begin_quote
  Just keep practicing.
#+end_quote

Well, I know that much, hence me asking for feedback.
