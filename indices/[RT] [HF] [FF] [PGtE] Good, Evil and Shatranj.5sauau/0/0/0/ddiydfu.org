*On the story:*\\
1) Good sounds a lot like someone whose moves revolve solely around being more powerful and having the advantage, whereas Evil is shown to be smarter (wiser?) of the two. I realize that the canon has this aspect as well, on the whole, and also that it is more probable that someone who has a lot of power at their disposal is likelier to be sloppier in their gameplay. But if Good can spawn The Wandering Bard, I imagine it can be a lot smarter? (yes, that's an open-ended question for you; I'm not sure myself)

2) I imagine that Good is the doofy friend who made up a game with unfair advantages for himself, so that he may finally win one against his smart-ass friend, Evil. Am I right?

*On the writing:*\\
I wish I could help you out more here but I'm not a writer. As a reader though, here's what I thought:\\
1) I liked the story and the writing did not cause any hiccups which would throw me off. For a new writer, I'd say that's a good start.

2) I'd have liked it if the story pulled me in more. I don't know how to achieve that... Maybe try reading the wiki at [[/r/writing]] or [[/r/writingprompts]] or get their input?

3) I don't know how /rational/ the writing is but I liked the last section for how well it explained Evil's mode of thinking.

I hope this helped. Glad to have you here.
