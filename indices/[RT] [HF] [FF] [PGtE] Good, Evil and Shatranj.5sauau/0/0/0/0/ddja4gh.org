  Good sounds a lot like someone whose moves revolve solely around being more powerful and having the advantage, whereas Evil is shown to be smarter (wiser?) of the two.

That was exactly what I was trying to convey, yes. Well, not quite, but close. Good can see subtler moves, but not nearly as good (badum-tss) as Evil, which lead to their original argument (Good thinking it can design a foolproof set of rules by just restricting everything objectionable, Evil disagreeing on the basis of Godel's incompleteness theorem)

  I imagine that Good is the doofy friend who made up a game with unfair advantages for himself, so that he may finally win one against his smart-ass friend, Evil.

No, they both agreed on Good having all the advantages. Good is kinda playing as the GM, while Evil is playing as a munchkin who tries to break the game.
