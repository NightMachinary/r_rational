Doesn't it? On Fanfiction.net, I mean. Two things: it's Dragon Ball, not Dragon Ball Z, and it's M-rated, so it's excluded by default searches. I may want to lower the rating since anyway I think the content is pretty tame. Unless you mean another archive, in which case it's probably because I don't know about it. I only cross-post on FF.net and AO3.
