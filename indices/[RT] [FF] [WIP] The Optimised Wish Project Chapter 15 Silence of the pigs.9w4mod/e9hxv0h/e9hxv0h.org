I was so paranoid during this chapter. Puar could be anything and anyone, and he's in control of the computer in a fully computer-controlled complex. First I thought he was impersonating Bulmas father or mother, but probably not - he's still having trouble with details, and Bills would notice inconsistencies in their behaviour. I did call him being the fake Bulma-voice and messing with the clock, but I would probably have called fake on anything.

And now we have a rampaging giant ape Goku in the middle of a populated city. Except for characters we don't know are present suddenly swooping in and saving the day, the only way to stop him is cutting off the tail. Problem is, how would they know to do that? Maybe spooky squad figures it out somehow, but Puar will of course still be working against everyone. Difficult situation.
