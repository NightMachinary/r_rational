Not in the original story, of course. But I've retconned a few characters already, I'm not being super literal. For example, Mai isn't a double agent for the Red Ribbon, and the Instruments aren't even a thing in the original DB. Spike & the others are real supernatural creatures, not men with fucked up histories and a serious case of chuunibyou. I'm following a bit the example of EY in HPMoR here - keeping a lot of details similar or close enough, but occasionally changing something around in order to make things more interesting and fresh.
