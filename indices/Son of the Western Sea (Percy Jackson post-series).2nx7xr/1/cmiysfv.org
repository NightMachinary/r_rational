Personally I like it. It's interesting to see the politics between pantheons and the portrayal of Percy as a lovable bum with extraordinary power is fun.

I was a bit surprised by your choice to make Percy bi-sexual though. Considering it's common both in fanfics and ancient Greece it makes sense but there weren't any hints in the books so there definitely needs to be a part of the fanfic where he...eh, rediscovers ancient tradition.
