This was an interesting read, but I'm not sure I'd call it rational. There are no real transhumanist themes in it, or puzzles to be solved. There doesn't even seem to be any overarching storyline beyond 'percy sails around.' There's no attempts to munchkin powers or optimize the world. Also, no one really paid attention to the whole "gods will spy on you having sex and then use that in political power plays later."

Let's be honest, the gods' constant awareness of stuff in their domain is Big Brother in a scary way. People go so far as to avoid saying Zeus's name because it would draw attention. Hell, Zeus would straight up kill a man because he decided to fly on a plane if he was born to the wrong parents jesus fucking christ that's not ok, it's illegal

Now I'm imagining a re-write of the series with a rational!percy who gets freaked out by the gods and sets off to overthrow them. I mean, the gods literally are responsible for the holocaust in cannon if I recall correctly. It was a civil war, but seriously, there /must/ have been better ways to go about it. And what happens when the muggl--- I mean normal people find out? The American government would so not sanction divine acts of war in one of their cities.

I wonder how hard it would be for the camp to begin mass production of bronze tipped bullets, or to create a monster reserve so they only have to capture a beast once. And can we talk about how horrible it is that they're letting /teenagers/ go on life-threatening quests because /glory/? They're too young to vote, let alone kill in self defense.
