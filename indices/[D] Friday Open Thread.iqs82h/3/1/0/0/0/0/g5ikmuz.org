I agree that the history channel is more egregious because it's a factual error rather than a cultural error. Especially if since you have modern readers they might not clock on or not consider the differences in how sexual misconduct was treated only 30 years ago.

I would say that I think you're still underestimating. "Stalking" was basically considered okay, and even idolized. I wouldn't say the Wizarding World with its love potions, imperius curse, polyjuice potions, and more is really more likely to be in line with modern thinking. Dumbledore too, if he's ok with Snape torturing children during his tenure I don't think he's suddenly going to become some moral bastion over a dead woman. And sadly I imagine most wizarding parents simply wouldn't care just as few cared about the pedophilia rampant in the church and British boarding schools.

On stalking it was not really criminal until 1997 in England though there were some telecommunication laws prior to that. The 90s were really when a modern recognition of rape culture really got started.

The past sucked
