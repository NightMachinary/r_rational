  since Lily was a muggleborn I imagine the reaction of the community will have very little concern for Lily. Perhaps some argument to be made that Snape's like of her would taint him too, but then plenty of slaveowners raped their slaves and were rarely ostracised for it.

I think you're pushing this a bit too far, as if everyone was a Malfoy or a Black. First, Lily Potter by this point is a national heroine, muggleborn or not. And second, even if she wasn't, we know that most of the management at Hogwarts - notably, Dumbledore and McGonagall - held her in a high opinion. What else is needed? The Wizengamot wouldn't get involved with a matter as trivial as the firing of a random professor - one with no particular social standing, even, Snape is a half-blood himself.
