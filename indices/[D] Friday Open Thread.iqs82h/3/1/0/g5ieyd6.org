The Mail is definitely older, but you're 100% right that I forgot about the historical context.

About the stalking, yeah, it was a bit of a joke on my part I guess, but well, Dumbledore /is/ the Headmaster here, I think he'd be a bit more progressive than the average. Plus there's the curse, any excuse would have been enough to kick Snape out. But you're right, it's not extremely realistic. I guess I could have gone with a more serious idea - that they simply discovered Snape had gone and revealed the prophecy to Voldemort, or that the fact got out and he ended on trial.
