History Channel?

Isn't this set in 1990 in the UK? The Ancient Aliens meme is from 2010s

I know the Daily Mail became the most popular paper in 1980s but I'm not sure about the feeling. I guess tabloids have been mostly the same.

Edit: In addition Snape getting into trouble for stalking Lily seems like you're whitewashing both the actual 1990s and the late Victorian era boarding schools on which Hogwarts and its society is based on. Every time you read the words "women consent" you can be sure you're portraying a better past than actually existed. (Marital rape wasn't illegal until 1991 in the UK)
