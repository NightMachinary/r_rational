  Dumbledore too, if he's ok with Snape torturing children during his tenure I don't think he's suddenly going to become some moral bastion over a dead woman.

In canon, Dumbledore needs Snape tied to him as a double agent. Here he doesn't. The situation's a bit different.

  On stalking it was not really criminal until 1997 in England though there were some telecommunication laws prior to that. The 90s were really when a modern recognition of rape culture really got started. The past sucked

I mean, things don't become criminalised unless a substantial fraction of the population already thinks they're bad. Culture usually changes before law. I don't think until 1996 you could go around parading your photos of an half-naked underage girl you took from hiding and not be considered a creep by many. But yeah, these sort of cultural considerations are way beyond the level of research I thought of putting in that one line of the story. I literally just conceived it on the spot as I needed to make up one reason why Snape wouldn't be DADA teacher any more in absence of... everything that happened in canon at the end of HBP.
