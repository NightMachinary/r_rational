For me the thing that enraged me the most is how they go through that whole (stupid) EVA ordeal, the captain finally earns the trust of the Russian guy... and then the /Indian/ dude who until then had been supportive turns all "you stupid fuck, you could have gotten killed" - even giving some creepy possessive vibes towards her. ...why? They made it really clear that if they didn't deploy the third solar panel they were toast (redundancy? What's that?). It was do or die. And now he resents her taking a risk, to the point of stirring up MORE drama, more controversy, more disunion? How are these guys not going to end up with someone being jettisoned out of the airlock before they even reach Mars?
