I find that youtube is a lot worse when dealing with really popular music (usually anything up from 100 million views). And it has a helluva recency bias, recommending content from creators that I only checked out once to see what the <outgroup> has been up to. And now I have to suffer through with them being in my recommended feed for a week.

The trick is to use an incognito window when watching "undesirable" content. That way google wont get confused of what i really like.
