I'm generally really, really dubious about AI-driven anything, but Spotify's recommendations engine pretty consistently turns up at least one band every week I hadn't heard of but that I turn out to really dig. And it's not just in one genre! The last month has seen Hanggai, David Garrett, Antti Martikainen, Clamavi De Profundis, Roger Pontare, Dark Moor, and Blackmore's Night added to my various playlists.

I wonder what makes Spotify so different from Youtube, Netflix, or Kindle, whose recommendations are pure, unadulterated trash. Is it just that my taste in music is more in line with popular opinion? It shouldn't be a matter of just the business model, because while that would make sense for Youtube, it wouldn't for Netflix.

Anyway, just rambling. There's so much music that I like at my fingertips! It's great!
