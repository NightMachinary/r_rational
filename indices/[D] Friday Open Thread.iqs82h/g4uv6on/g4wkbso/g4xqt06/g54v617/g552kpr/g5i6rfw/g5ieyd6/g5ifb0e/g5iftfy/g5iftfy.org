The part that bugs me is more that for this fanfic I was going for a pretty serious tone. Had it been a parody/crackfic, who cares, anachronisms are funny. But being this rather somber story (towards the end, at least), yeah, on second thought, these sort of silly mistakes ruin its credibility. Though I'd argue the History Channel one is the only really out of place - the Lily affair could be handwaved, after all sure, the general culture was different but that doesn't mean stalking was literally considered ok. It's just that in most cases it would end up covered up, or the culprit would only get a slap on the wrist.
