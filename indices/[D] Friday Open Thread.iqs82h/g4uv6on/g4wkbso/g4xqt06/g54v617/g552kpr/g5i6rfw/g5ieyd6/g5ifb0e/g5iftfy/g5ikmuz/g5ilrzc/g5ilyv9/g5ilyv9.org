  In canon, Dumbledore needs Snape tied to him as a double agent. Here he doesn't. The situation's a bit different.

So why is Snape still teaching in 1st year?

  I mean, things don't become criminalised unless a substantial fraction of the population already thinks they're bad.

Sometimes true but often not. Law can precede societal changes in many cases. Death penalty is the obvious example, but there are lots of laws that aren't popular or didn't become so until after.

I mean sure if Snape goes crazy with it probably then it could be a reason but since Lily was a muggleborn I imagine the reaction of the community will have very little concern for Lily. Perhaps some argument to be made that Snape's like of her would taint him too, but then plenty of slaveowners raped their slaves and were rarely ostracised for it. Snape's a known cog in the political wheel, he favours the Slytherin house which is all the purebloods want from him. If Voldemort's gone for good then yeah Dumbledore can oust him for someone of his faction but I don't really think any reason needs to be given for that.
