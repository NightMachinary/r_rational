Has anyone watched the Netflix show "Away" about a Mars mission yet? I feel like in some respects recently there's been this swath of space movies and shows (Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian and more) that have some degree of realism thrown in, and try to look like very hard sci-fi, but sometimes still mix it with very questionable choices. Two episodes in, I'm flabbergasted at how insubordinate and psychologically unstable this whole crew designated for a 3 YEARS MARS MISSION is - they've already broken into pieces before launching from the Moon - and by some frankly ridiculous design choices seen in an EVA scene (no backup solar panels? Moving around with just one tether that they keep hooking and unhooking? Wut?). Not sure if I'll continue, apparently it gets even more soap opera later.
