I'm thinking of abandoning music streaming services^{*} in favor of putting all my music up on a personal cloud (probably Amazon S3 since I already use it). There seem to be a number of options out there, but I didn't see anything as straightforwardly trustworthy as an open source one. I also couldn't find any option that works on both Android and web/desktop.

So before I do the work of evaluating things one at a time, has anyone here done this? Any recommendations, anti-recommendations, tips, pitfalls?

^{*} It's been coming for a while, but the Google Play Music to Youtube Music transition is the kick in the butt I needed to go do it.
